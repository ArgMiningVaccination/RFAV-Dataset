PROGRAM REVIEW DETERMINATION ......................................................................................................................... H-1Program Review Guide 2017vii IntroductioniMAs provided by Section 498 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), the Secretary of Education (Secretary) determines whether institutions seeking to participate, or participating, in the programs authorized pursuant to Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, HEA programs), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1070 et seq., meet, or continue to meet, the institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability requirements for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Title IV HEA programs include the Federal Pell Grant (Pell Grant), Teacher Educa - tion Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work Study (FWS), Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan), and William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) programs. One method for providing this required oversight is through program reviews. AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT PROGRAM REVIEWS The Secretary is mandated by law under Section 498A of the HEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1099c, to conduct program re - views at institutions of higher education participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. The law provides for program reviews using very specific language. It states: In order to strengthen the administrative capability and financial responsibility provisions of this title, the Secre - tary (1) shall provide for the conduct of program reviews on a systematic basis designed to include all institutions of higher education participating in programs authorized by this title; (2) shall give priority for program review to institutions of higher education that are (A) institutions with a cohort default rate for loans under part B of this title in excess of 25 percent or which places such institutions in the highest 25 percent of such institutions; (B) institutions with a default rate in dollar volume for loans under part B of this title which places the insti - tutions in the highest 25 percent of such institutions; (C) institutions with a significant fluctuation in Federal Stafford Loan volume, Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan volume, or Federal Pell Grant award volume, or any combination thereof, in the year for which the determination is made, compared to the year prior to such year, that are not accounted for by changes in the Federal Stafford Loan program, the Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan program, or the Pell Grant program, or any combination thereof; (D) institutions reported to have deficiencies or financial aid problems by the State licensing or authorizing agency, or by the appropriate accrediting agency or association; (E) institutions with high annual dropout rates; and (F) such other institutions that the Secretary determines may pose a significant risk of failure to comply with the administrative capability or financial responsibility provisions of this title.Program Review Guide for Institutionsviii Program Review Guide 2017The Secretary has delegated to Program Compliance's School Eligibility Channel (a component of Federal Stu - dent Aid) the responsibility for performing program reviews at postsecondary institutions that participate in the Title IV HEA programs. This authority extends to the resolution of any program review findings and the initiation of administrative action(s) when appropriate. Members1 of the School Eligibility Service Group Participation Divi - sions (SPDs) conduct program reviews. See Appendix A for SPD contact information. See Appendix B for a list of Acronyms and Common Terms used by the Department. INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS Institutions participating in the Title IV HEA programs must meet basic eligibility criteria. Among other things, an institution must be authorized by the State in which it is located to provide an educational program that is beyond secondary education, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary to accredit schools that wish to partici - pate in the Title IV HEA programs, provide at least one eligible program, and admit as regular students only persons who have a high school diploma or equivalent, or are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance in the State where the school is located. Eligible institutions must demonstrate that they are financially responsible. The Department determines whether an institution is financially responsible based on, among other things, the institution's ability to provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer the Title IV programs in which the school participates, and meet all of its financial obligations. Institutions must also meet certain minimum administrative capability standards. These standards require that an institution have, among other things a capable individual responsible for administering all of the Title IV, HEA programs; a system of internal checks and balances for administering federal student financial aid; a division of functions for determining student awards and disbursing funds that result from those award decisions; frequent, periodic reconciliation of fiscal office and financial aid office award data; a system to identify and resolve discrepancies in information the institution receives from various sources about a student's application for financial aid; a satisfactory academic progress policy for recipients of federal student financial aid; procedures to ensure that requests for federal cash do not exceed the amount of funds the institution needs immediately to make aid disbursements to students; a policy for refunding tuition when a student withdraws from classes; a process to ensure that the institution submits its required annual financial statements on time; a process to ensure that the institution submits its required annual compliance audit on time; and 1 The term \"member\" refers to \"reviewers\" or \"review team\" and encompasses any SPD member who might be involved in conducting a program review. The terms \"reviewers, \" and \"review team\" are used interchangeably throughout this Guide.Introduction Program Review Guide 2017ix a process to notify the Department within 10 days of any changes in the institution's status or operations as required by regulation. The Department makes available online resources that may be of assistance to institutions in the daily manage - ment of the Title IV programs as well as in preparing for a program review. These are found at https://ifap.ed.gov. PURPOSE OF PROGRAM REVIEWS The overall purpose of a program review is to evaluate compliance with the Title IV, HEA statute and regula - tions, identify liabilities owed to the Department for errors in compliance, and improve future institutional capabili - ties. During this process the reviewers typically: analyze the institution's data and records and identify any weaknesses in the institution's procedures for ad - ministering Title IV, HEA program funds; frame required actions and recommendations that will strengthen the institution's future compliance with Title IV, HEA rules and regulations; quantify any harm resulting from the institution's impaired performance and identify liabilities where non - compliance results in loss, misuse, or unnecessary expenditure of federal funds; determine the extent to which any weaknesses in the institution's administration of Title IV, HEA program funds may subject stu - dents and taxpayers to potential or actual fraud, waste, and abuse; and refer institutions for administrative action to protect the interests of students and taxpayers, when necessary. As part of a program review, reviewers examine financial aid, academic, and fiscal records, interview institution staff and students, and review relevant consumer information (e.g., the school's website, student catalogs, pamphlets, etc.), among other things. This is usually done at the institution (on-site review) to allow the reviewers to have di - rect contact with students, institution officials, and employees and to give the reviewers first-hand knowledge of the institution's administration of the Title IV HEA programs. In some circumstances institutions are asked to submit copies of selected records to the SPD for review at its office, or the SPD may review only relevant data stored in De - partment databases (off-site review). See Appendix C for a list of Most Frequently Cited Program Review Findings.Program Review Guide 20171-11MChapter Department Preparation for Program Review After a decision is made to conduct a program review and a review team is assigned, the team must familiarize themselves with the institution in order to develop an appropriate plan for conducting the program review. The review team begins by gathering information and reviewing data and documents on file with the Department. The team may enlist the assistance of other members of the School Participation Division (SPD) staff such as the Eligibil - ity Analyst, Audit Resolution Specialist, and Financial Analyst when reviewing the institution's eligibility applica - tion, audits, or financial statements. INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE RESEARCH The reviewers will gather information about the organizational and physical structure of the institution. This information is gathered primarily from documents and data submitted to the Department through the eligibility ap - plication, compliance audits, and financial statements. By researching the organizational structure of the institution, the reviewers will learn the details of its ownership, leadership, and financial structure. This helps the reviewers determine what information should be considered dur - ing the program review. For example, if the owner(s) of the institution own other institutions, the review team will typically consider any relevant information about those other institution(s). If the institution's corporate ownership is publicly held, the reviewers may check the Security and Exchange Commission website for recent filings submit - ted by the owner in order to obtain information about the corporation's activities that may be relevant to the pro - gram review. Understanding how the institution is structured physically will help the reviewers determine where documents might be located and may reveal potential internal institutional communication issues. If the institution has multiple locations, the reviewers must determine how information is communicated and how records are shared between locations. The reviewers must ascertain where the records to be reviewed are lo - cated and determine where the review of institutional records will take place. Institutions are obligated to make their records available at an institutional location as designated by the Department. (See 34 CFR \u00a7 668.24(d)(2).) Institu - tions with multiple locations may be asked to send the records to a central location. Records held by servicers and/ or consultants must be made available to the reviewers at the designated location. Small institutions must have a structure that supports separation of duties while providing for proper record - keeping and internal checks and balances. Large institutions must have a structure that supports adequate commu - nication and sharing of information among the offices, whether they are down the hall or across the campus.Program Review Guide for Institutions1-2 Program Review Guide 2017SYSTEMS RESEARCH The Department has many electronic sources from which reviewers can gather information on institutions participating in the Title IV HEA programs. By researching data from multiple sources, reviewers gain additional insights about the institution. Postsecondary Education Participants System The Postsecondary Education Participants System (PEPS) is Federal Student Aid's management informa - tion system of all organizations that have a role in administering student financial aid and other HEA programs. PEPS maintains eligibility, certification, demographic, financial, program review, audit, and default rate data about schools, lenders, and guarantors participating in the Title IV programs. One of the primary sources for institutional information in PEPS is the E-App completed by institutions to report updates and apply for recertification. The reviewers use the information in PEPS to gain an understanding of the institution and its Title IV history. This information may also be compared with other documents to confirm the institution is accurately reporting lo - cation, academic program, and other information to the Department. eZ-Audit eZ-Audit is a web application that provides schools with a paperless, single point of submission for financial statements and compliance audits. It also serves as the Department's system for storage of financial statements, compliance audits, and related documents. The reviewers may review documents in eZ-Audit related to the institution's administrative and financial capa - bility. National Student Loan Data System The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) is the main source for student-level data for the Federal Pell Grant, TEACH Grant, Perkins Loan, and Direct Loan Programs. (FSEOG and FWS funding data are not entered in NSLDS so they cannot be matched to student-level data.) Student information entered into NSLDS is provided by institutions, lenders, guaranty agencies, Direct Loan servicing, the Department's Borrower Services, Central Process - ing System (CPS), and Common Origination and Disbursement System. Certain student-level data may be obtained from NSLDS for comparison with information in the institution's files and other records. G5 G5 is an electronic system for grants management and payment tracking. G5 e-payments function is used by schools to draw down Pell Grant, Campus-Based, and Direct Loan funds. G5 provides the reviewers with current grant and payment information such as authorization amounts, cumulative drawdowns, current award balances, and payment histories. This information is used to develop an overall picture of the institution. It is also used when reviewing the institution's Title IV funds management. FISAP and eCB Website The Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP) contains award and expenditure informa - tion reported annually by institutions participating in the Campus-Based (CB) Programs as of the close of the award year (June 30th). The CB Programs include Perkins Loan, FSEOG, and FWS. Chapter 1\u2014Department Preparation for Program Review Program Review Guide 20171-3 Institutions also use the FISAP to report the number of undergraduate and graduate students for the year, tuition and fees for the year, total Pell Grant expenditures for the year, Federal Student Aid applicant (family) income information, cumulative fund activity for the Perkins Loan Program, and withdrawal from the Perkins Loan Program, if applicable. The eCB Statement of Account notifies an institution of its final federal authorization for each of the CB Pro - grams for the award year. The reviewers compare the information reported by the institution on the FISAP, and the authorization figures from the eCB Statement of Account, with the institution's financial records to verify that all Title IV funds were properly accounted for. If the institution being reviewed participates in the CB Programs, the reviewers determine, for every award year under review, if the institution has a letter granting a waiver of the non-federal matching requirement for the FWS and FSEOG Programs. The Secretary may waive the requirement to match FWS and FSEOG funds with non-federal funds for institutions meeting certain conditions. The reviewers also determine if an institution has requested, and been approved, for a waiver of the community service and/or reading tutor requirement for FWS under 34 CFR \u00a7 675.18(g)(2). Common Origination and Disbursement System The Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) System is a Department system used to collect and store student-specific demographic and award information. COD integrates data from institutions, GAPS/G5, PEPS, and CPS. Institutions use COD to report originations, disbursements, adjustments, and returns of Pell Grant and Direct Loan funds. COD currently does not collect information regarding CB awards. The student-level data in COD is reviewed for anomalies and compared to data in other systems and at the insti - tution. In addition, the reviewers check COD to find out if the institution was approved for extended processing for the award years included in the scope of the program review. Campus Security Website The reviewers may access the Office of Postsecondary Education's Campus Security website and compare the crime statistics for the institution on the website to the statistics in the institution's annual report. The comparison may help determine if the institution is disclosing to the Department the same statistics as it is disclosing to its em - ployees and students. OTHER RESEARCH The reviewers may check other documents from Department files and other recordkeeping systems. These documents may include prior program review reports and the institution's responses, complaints, and reports of re - views conducted by other organizations.Program Review Guide for Institutions1-4 Program Review Guide 2017EXTERNAL AGENCY CONTACTS External agencies may be contacted regarding a planned program review. Such agencies may include guaranty agencies, accrediting agencies, state authorizing/licensing agencies, and/or state agencies responsible for corporation registration. The reviewers may coordinate activities and share information with the compliance section of the institution's primary accrediting agency. When research suggests that there may be issues in programs accredited by a secondary accreditor, the reviewers may also contact that accreditor as well. The reviewers may also coordinate activities and share information with the compliance section of the institu - tion's state authorizing/licensing agency(s). For proprietary and private non-profit institutions that indicate corporate ownership or partnership, the re - viewers may verify the existence of the ownership entity with the appropriate state agency responsible for corporate registration (usually the Secretary of State). This will help to ensure that notice of the program review is sent to the proper entity. Information obtained from the state agency may also be used to confirm that the corporation is in good standing, and to identify other information on file with the state such as officers, directors, corporate status (such as active or inactive), and agent for service of process. PROGRAM REVIEW PLAN In planning for a program review, the school participation division (SPD) identifies the purpose, scope, and ex - ecution information for the program review. This includes consideration of: program review type, program review scope, location where records will be reviewed (on-site or off-site), timing of notification of the program review, timing for conducting the program review, staffing considerations, and duration of the program review. The review characteristics may change at any time during the program review, including after discussing the review with the institution, after reviewing the information the institution submits in response to the announcement letter, or while conducting the review. This may include changing the program review type, changing the scope of the review or the number of award years reviewed, expanding the review sample, including additional award years, or altering the focus of the review. The reviewers may also determine that completion of the program review will require additional time either on-site or off, or may make any other necessary changes to the purpose, scope, or ex - ecution of the program review. Program Review Type The SPD will determine what type of program review to conduct\u2014either a standard Program Review or a Cam - pus Security or Closed School Review. The type of review is decided based on the issues that resulted in the decision to conduct the review.Chapter 1\u2014Department Preparation for Program Review Program Review Guide 20171-5 Program Review Scope The SPD will determine the appropriate scope for the program review and will determine award years to be in - cluded, if necessary, for General Assessment Focused Incentive Compensation Joint Program Review A general assessment program review is the most common option for the scope of a program review. A gener - al assessment review is conducted when the SPD seeks a general evaluation of the institution's performance in meet - ing its administrative and financial obligations relative to the Title IV, HEA programs. A general assessment review can be changed to a focused review at any stage of the review. A focused review is a program review that addresses one or more specific issues. A focused review is conducted when the SPD seeks to determine if the institution has problems with a specific area(s) of Title IV, HEA program compliance. The incentive compensation review includes testing of the Higher Education Act (HEA) regulations that spe - cifically prohibit an eligible institution from providing any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admissions activities or making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance. The joint program review is conducted in instances where adverse action and significant liabilities are consid - ered likely outcomes. The scope of a program review typically consists of the current award year and the most recently closed award year. If the program review is being conducted early in the award year and the reviewers determine that the insti - tution's records for the current year are insufficient to review, the reviewers might look only at the most recently closed award year. Location Where Records Will Be Reviewed\u2014On-site or Off-site The SPD will determine whether records will be reviewed on-site at the institution or off-site at the Department. With some exceptions, general assessment and joint program reviews are typically conducted on-site. A focused review can be on-site or off-site. Off-site program review procedures parallel on-site procedures, including the same steps in the process. Timing of Notification of the Program Review The SPD will decide how far in advance of the visit, or start of an off-site review, to announce the program re - view to the institution. Most standard SPD program reviews are announced two to four weeks in advance. However, the review team may provide shorter notice of the program review, including providing notification when they ar - rive at the institution to conduct the review. Factors that may result in the SPD providing short notice of the program review may include, but are not lim - ited to complaints from law enforcement agencies (e.g., Department of Justice, FBI), serious credible complaints from students and/or parents,Program Review Guide for Institutions1-6 Program Review Guide 2017 complaints to the Office of Inspector General (OIG), negative reports from state agencies or accrediting agencies, adverse articles in the media, information from former or current employees of the institution, or possible fraud or abuse at the institution. Timing for Conducting the Program Review The SPD will determine whether specific timing is appropriate for a program review. The SPD may be aware of a planned review by another agency or other internal Department office (e.g., Financial Partners, Default Manage - ment) and therefore may decide to conduct its program review in conjunction with the other agency or office. The program review may be scheduled to coincide with pending actions such as an upcoming recertification date, a let - ter of credit release, an audit receipt, etc. Staffing Considerations The staffing of the review team will be based upon the scope and other factors such as the size of the institution (the volume of records to be reviewed) and the location of the records. The need for specific staff expertise (foreign language interpreters, etc.) will also be considered. The review team typically includes at least two reviewers; how - ever it may range from one reviewer to several. Duration of the On-site Review The duration of an on-site review is typically one week. However, when establishing the anticipated duration for an on-site review, the reviewers will consider the program review scope and characteristics, the number of Title IV, HEA programs in which the institution participates, the anticipated level of testing, logistical issues, and any other factors that may affect the amount of time on-site. Joint program reviews are typically longer than general assess - ment and focused reviews.Program Review Guide 20172-12MChapter Institution Preparation for Program Review Institutions should be prepared at all times for the possibility of a program review. Attending training and staying current with changes to the law and regulations are the best ways for an institution to prepare. Institutions may also wish to take advantage of the FSA Assessments modules (available at https://ifap.ed.gov ) to conduct a self- assessment of their management of the Title IV programs. When a decision is made to conduct a program review, the institution will be notified of the review and the steps it must take in preparation for the review. RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM REVIEW The institution will be formally notified in writing of the SPD's decision to conduct a program review and whether the review will be conducted on-site at the institution or off-site. The lead reviewer will coordinate all cor - respondence and communication with the institution. See Appendix D, Announcement Letter, for an example of the template used by the Department for the on-site announcement letter. Advance Notice Review The institution will typically receive advance notification of the program review by telephone and letter. This no - tification will include 1. a telephone call to the President/CEO/Owner; 2. a telephone call to the Financial Aid Administrator; and 3. a follow-up letter to the President/CEO/Owner of the institution, with a copy to the Financial Aid Adminis - trator. The lead reviewer will attempt to make the initial contact with the President/CEO/Owner by telephone. If the reviewer is able to reach the President/CEO/Owner, the conversation will cover the following: Notification that a program review will be conducted Purpose of the program review (to determine the institution's compliance with the Title IV, HEA program regulations) Identification of a contact person (the FAA or someone else) with whom the reviewer should discuss the de - tails of the program review Notice that a formal written notification of the program review will be sent to the President/CEO/Owner and other identified contactsProgram Review Guide for Institutions2-2 Program Review Guide 2017If the reviewer is unable to speak with the President/CEO/Owner of the institution, the reviewer will leave a message that the purpose of the call is to announce a program review by the U.S. Department of Education, that a letter announcing the review and containing the details regarding the review is being sent to the President/CEO/ Owner, with a copy to the Financial Aid Administrator (FAA), and that he/she will also be contacting the FAA via telephone. Following initial contact with the President/CEO/Owner, the lead reviewer will attempt to contact the FAA or designee. If the reviewer is able to speak to the FAA, the conversation may cover the following: Notification that an on-site or off-site review will be conducted Purpose of the program review (to determine the institution's compliance with the Title IV, HEA program regulations) Notification of the scheduled start date of the program review. If the start date will create a significant con - flict with critical activities at the institution, the reviewer may be able to negotiate an alternative date for the review.

This may include, but is not limited to, copies (except for catalogs, brochures, pamphlets, handbooks, etc.) of the Catalog/brochure of institution Policy and procedures concerning Admission to the institution and to academic programs Satisfactory academic progress Attendance Recruiter compensation/incentive programs Withdrawals, official and unofficial Return of Title IV funds Verification Awarding of Title IV, HEA program aid Most recent campus security information published and distributed to students and staff, including web - sites used, if any Institutional and financial aid student consumer publications URL listing for all financial aid consumer information Examples of institutional forms, applications and worksheets that are used in administering the Title IV, HEA programs Documents identifying current total enrollment and percentage of students receiving Title IV, HEA pro - gram aid The availability and format of recipient data, what data is to be provided and the due date for receipt of the data The institution's ability to generate reports The format to be used to present the data: Excel and/or Access The expectation that, for each award year under review, the institution provide a numbered, undupli - cated list of Title IV, HEA recipients with the data elements identified on the Recipient Data Spreadsheet (The institution may choose to complete the provided workbook or generate its own electronic file in the same format as the workbook provided.) Indication that a formal written notification of the program review will be sent to the President/CEO/Owner and other identified contacts. This letter will also provide the format for submitting the information request - ed. After making initial contact, the SPD will send the letter formally announcing the program review to the Presi - dent/CEO/Owner, with a copy sent to other identified contacts. This letter typically confirms the review location and start date; identifies the reviewers and primary Department contact; identifies the award years to be reviewed; provides a list of information the institution must submit prior to an on-site review; transmits the Recipient Data Spreadsheet, if applicable; for on-site reviews, provides an enclosure listing records the institution must have available on-site at the start of the program review; and provides an enclosure regarding safeguarding Personally Identifiable Information.Program Review Guide for Institutions2-4 Program Review Guide 2017Short Notice Review For a short notice program review, the institution will typically receive notification of the program review when the announcement letter is either presented to the institution at the time of the visit, received via FedEx Overnight delivery the morning the program review is to begin (prior to arrival of the review team), or received via fax or e-mail shortly before the review team is to arrive. The institution is not expected to provide Title IV administration information in advance for this type of pro - gram review. THIRD-PARTY SERVICER NOTIFICATION It is the responsibility of the institution to notify its third-party servicer(s) of the program review. The institution must ensure any documentation that must be provided prior to the program review is provided to the Department and that the records that must be available at the institution during the program review are available. However, if necessary to facilitate the delivery of the required documentation and institutional records, the lead reviewer may participate in a joint call with the institution and the third-party servicer to provide clarification. RESPONDING TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT LETTER Preparing the Response The institution must gather the required information and prepare the requested reports. These items must be sent to the reviewers as directed, and by the due date identified, in the announcement letter. Most documents may be submitted electronically or in hard copy. When submitting hard copies of documents, the institution should be careful not to submit original documents (except for catalogs, brochures, pamphlets, hand - books, etc.). Protecting Sensitive Data Institutions are responsible for protecting sensitive information including personally identifiable information (PII). PII is any information about an individual including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, criminal or employment history and information which can be used to distinguish or trace an in - dividual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, biometric records, etc., including any other personal information which is linked or linkable to an individual. PII that, if im - properly disclosed, could be used to steal an individual's identity, violates the individual's right to privacy, or other - wise harms the individual, must be protected. When sending sensitive program review documents and media by first class or overnight mail, all data files must be saved in a password-protected WINZIP or WINZIP-compatible file prior to shipping. shipments must include a manifest inside the package (a copy should be retained by the institution in the event a package is lost or damaged). Chapter 2\u2014Institution Preparation for Program Review Program Review Guide 20172-5 all sensitive documents and media must be double packaged in packaging that is approved by the shipping agent (DHL, FedEx, UPS, USPS, etc.). both the \"To\" and \"From\" addresses must be included on both the inner and outer packages. shipping agents used must have the capability of tracking the shipment's status. shipments must require signatures upon receipt. packages must not identify the sensitivity of the contents. Sensitive information may be transmitted via email. When an e-mail containing sensitive information is sent to the Department, the information must be provided in an attached, password-protected, WINZIP file. Passwords must be provided to the recipient in a separate email or via telephone. Materials Not Submitted by Due Date If the requested materials are not received from the institution by the due date, the lead reviewer may contact the institution to ascertain the reason. The reviewer may grant the institution an extension, and/or change the pro - gram review start date, if the circumstances warrant it (e.g., if there is a death or natural disaster). If all requested materials are still not received, the reviewers will typically proceed with the program review without the requested materials. Except as noted, failure to provide the requested documents will neither prevent nor delay the program review.Program Review Guide 20173-13MChapter Entrance Conference The primary purpose of the entrance conference is for the review team to gain an understanding of the institu - tion's processes for managing the Title IV, HEA program funds placed in its trust, and to determine who at the institution is responsible for managing those processes. The entrance conference will also serve to provide institu - tion officials with an overview, and an opportunity to ask questions about, the program review process. NOTE: Any institution that participates in the Title IV, HEA programs is required to cooperate with the Depart - ment in the event of a program review (see 34 CFR \u00a7 668.24(f)). Failure to do so may lead to an adverse administrative action. Each entrance conference will be customized to reflect the scope of the program review. However, the entrance conference for on-site and off-site reviews will generally follow the formats presented in this section. ENTRANCE CONFERENCE\u2014ON-SITE An agenda for the entrance conference may be provided. While each entrance conference is unique to the insti - tution under review, the following items are typically covered: Introduction of Program Review Team Members Introduction of Institution Representatives Reason for the Program Review and Scope Overview of the Program Review Process How Title IV Aid Is Processed at the Institution and Staff Responsibilities Required Documents and Time Frame to Provide Them Scheduling the Exit Conference Getting Started Short Notice Reviews An entrance conference conducted at the start of a short notice program review closely resembles an entrance conference conducted for a program review that was announced in advance. The three main differences are in scheduling the entrance conference, the amount of information provided to institution officials and the request for documents. Immediately upon arrival at the institution, the reviewers will notify the President/CEO/Owner of the intent to conduct a program review and provide him/her with a copy of the announcement letter. At that point, the reviewers may request that a brief entrance conference be scheduled as soon as possible so that all appropriate institution of - ficials can be notified of the program review. Program Review Guide for Institutions3-2 Program Review Guide 2017In addition, because the announcement letter was not provided in advance, the reviewers may explain the letter to the President/CEO/Owner and request the documents required for the program review. Introduction of Department and Institution Representatives The program review team members typically introduce themselves by giving their name and role on the review team. The President/CEO/Owner, or that person's representative, should initiate introductions of the institution's per - sonnel present and ask each of them to give a brief description of their role, if any, in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. All institution personnel may be asked to sign in on an Entrance Conference Attendance Form. If there are officials who are directly involved in the processing of Title IV, HEA program funds who are not able to attend the entrance conference, the institution should provide the person's name, title, phone number, and office location. Reason for the Program Review and Review Scope The review team may or may not identify the reason(s) the institution was selected for the program review. However, even if the reason(s) presented establish the initial scope of the program review, the scope may be expand - ed. In addition, for a general assessment review, the reviewers will perform an overall assessment of the institution's compli - ance with the Title IV, HEA regulations. for a focused review, the reviewers will perform an assessment of the institution's compliance with specific regulations. for either review, a formal written Program Review Report will indicate problems identified, if any. The review team will also identify the award years for which the team will be reviewing program data, financial data, and student files. While some information will be requested initially, the team may ask the institution for additional information as needed throughout the program review (e.g., files or reports for certain categories of recipients, such as recipients selected for verification, or recipients who withdrew for whom a return of Title IV, HEA funds was calculated). Overview of the Program Review Process During the entrance conference, the review team may provide an overview of the program review process. The process typically includes a Department review of the institution's data and records. If the program review includes an evaluation of student files, a sample of students will have been drawn from the institution's population of Title IV recipi - ents. The reviewers will need to know how or where to obtain the student files to be reviewed. interviews with institution staff and/or students. a Department analysis of the information obtained to determine, first if the institution is in compliance with the applicable Title IV, HEA rules and, second, if errors are identified, to determine the source of those er - rors so that the institution can take corrective action. a Department preparation of a written Program Review Report and Expedited Determination Letter (EDL) that is sent to the institution. The Program Review Report contains a discussion of any instances of noncom - pliance identified and indicates what action(s), if any, the institution is required to take in order to identify the extent of the noncompliance, correct the noncompliance, identify the actions needed to make the Title Chapter 3\u2014Entrance Conference Program Review Guide 20173-3 IV, HEA programs or the recipients whole for any funds that were improperly managed, and/or to prevent the same problems from recurring. The EDL serves as both the preliminary report and final determination letter to the institution regarding findings discovered during the review. The institution is not required to submit a written response. an institution preparation of a written response that is sent to the Department. The response provides any information requested by the Program Review Report and any other information the institution would like the Department to consider. a Department review of the institution's response to the findings in the Program Review Report. a Department preparation of a Final Program Review Determination (FPRD) letter that is sent to the institu - tion. The FPRD provides final determinations for each finding including any liabilities owed to the Depart - ment, lenders, and/or students, and payment instructions. How Title IV Aid Is Processed at the Institution/Responsibilities During the entrance conference, the review team may provide the institution with the opportunity to explain how it processes Title IV, HEA funds and who is responsible for various aspects of the administration of those funds. For a focused campus security review, the Title IV process will not typically be discussed. Required Documents and Time Frame to Provide If the announcement letter was not sent in advance, the review team may explain the documents requested in the announcement letter. They will identify what documents need to be provided, which documents are needed as soon as possible, and what the deadline will be for providing all documents. If the announcement letter was sent in advance, the review team may explain only those items listed on the at - tachment to the letter that were not provided in advance. Schedule Exit Conference or Status Meeting The exit conference or status meeting will be scheduled, if possible, during the entrance conference. Doing so assists both the reviewers and the institution's personnel in planning their work and managing their time. It is also helpful to establish early in the process who will represent the institution at the meeting. However, if during the pro - gram review the timing and/or requirement for the exit conference changes, the reviewers should advise the institu - tion. Getting Started To begin the on-site review, the review team may: establish procedures for interviewing staff. Interviews may be conducted with individual staff. If the school has a \"non-disclosure clause\" in an employment contract, the reviewers will request that the school provide the reviewers with a written waiver of that clause to ensure that they are able to speak freely to all current employees of the school about their knowledge of the school's administration of the Title IV, HEA pro - grams. The reviewers will provide copies of that waiver to any school employee who the reviewers interview. identify a contact person in each key area. That person should be intimately involved with the daily opera - tions of that office. Depending on the size and structure of the institution, there may be a single point of contact or points of contact in various areas (e.g., Admissions, Registrar, Financial Aid, Business Office, Campus Security). The reviewers will need to know the phone numbers and office locations of the contacts. Program Review Guide for Institutions3-4 Program Review Guide 2017 request a location where there is privacy to hold conferences with staff. establish a process for communicating with the institution's officials during the course of the program re - view, including a protocol for communication (written requests) and a time frame for response. establish procedures for interviewing recipients. Students may be interviewed, if necessary. request a secure work area (because of student privacy issues) and reasonable access to a photocopy ma - chine. There will need to be a way for the reviewers to secure records that are in their possession in their absence. explain the possibility of resolving issues or deficiencies while the review team is at the institution. In some cases the institution may be given a reasonable time frame to resolve deficiencies and possibly collect miss - ing documentation prior to the end of the on-site visit. ascertain when they will be provided with the records requested in the announcement letter. determine if the institution is aware of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) requirement to document disclosure of students' PII to the Department as part of the program review. If the institution is aware of its responsibilities, no further action is required. If the institution is not aware of the requirements, the reviewers may instruct the institution to review the FERPA information on IFAP, and may provide the institution with sample language for a statement to place in the student files reviewed. ENTRANCE CONFERENCE\u2014OFF-SITE An off-site entrance conference serves the same purpose as the on-site entrance conference. The primary differ - ence is in the scheduling and in the amount of information that is provided. The reviewer will conduct the entrance conference via telephone. Because an off-site review is typically focused on one or two specific areas of the institu - tion's Title IV, HEA administration, the details of the program review and the amount of information needed may be limited. An agenda for the entrance conference may be provided. While each entrance conference is unique to the insti - tution under review, the following items are typically covered: Introduction of Program Review Team Members Introduction of Institution Representatives Reason for the Program Review and Scope Overview of the Program Review Process How Title IV Aid Is Processed at the Institution and Staff Responsibilities Scheduling the Exit Conference Getting Started Introduction of Department and Institution Representatives Because of the limited scope of most off-site reviews, there typically will be only one reviewer. The reviewer will introduce himself/herself. The President/CEO/Owner, or that person's representative should initiate introductions of the institution's per - sonnel present and ask each of them to give a brief description of their role, if any, in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. If there are officials who are directly involved in the processing of Title IV, HEA program funds who are not able to attend the entrance conference, the institution should provide the person's name, title, and phone number.Chapter 3\u2014Entrance Conference Program Review Guide 20173-5 Reason for the Program Review and Scope The reviewer may or may not identify the reason(s) the institution was selected for the program review. How - ever, even if the reason(s) presented establish the initial scope of the program review, the scope may be expanded. Because an off-site review is typically focused on one or two specific areas of the institution's Title IV, HEA administration, the reviewer will perform an assessment of the institution's compliance with specific regulations re - lated to the focus area(s). The reviewer will also identify the award years for which program data, financial data, and student files will be reviewed. While some information will be requested initially, the reviewer may ask the institution for additional informa - tion as needed throughout the program review (e.g., files or reports for certain categories of recipients, such as recip - ients selected for verification, or recipients who withdrew for whom a return of Title IV, HEA funds was calculated). Overview of the Program Review Process During the entrance conference, the reviewer may provide an overview of the program review process. The pro - cess typically includes Department preparation of a letter requesting that the institution send certain documents immediately after the conference. During the conference the reviewer will confirm the email address to use for sending the let - ter and discuss the time frame and delivery method for submission of the required documents. The reviewer will also advise the institution that additional documents may be required before the program review is completed. institution submission of the requested documents. Department review of the institution's data and records. If the program review includes an evaluation of stu - dent files, a sample of students will have been drawn from the institution's population of Title IV recipients. The reviewers will need to know from whom to request the student files to be reviewed. interviews with institution staff and/or students. Department analysis of the information obtained to determine, first if the institution is in compliance with the applicable Title IV, HEA rules and, second, if errors are identified, to determine the source of those er - rors so that the institution can take corrective action. Department preparation of a written Program Review Report and Expedited Determination Letter (EDL) that is sent to the institution. The Program Review Report contains a discussion of any instances of noncom - pliance identified and indicates what action(s), if any, the institution is required to take in order to identify the extent of the noncompliance, correct the noncompliance, identify the actions needed to make the Title IV, HEA programs or the recipients whole for any funds that were improperly managed, and/or to prevent the same problems from recurring. The EDL serves as both the preliminary report and final determination letter to the institution regarding findings discovered during the review. The institution is not required to submit a written response. institution preparation of a written response that is sent to the Department. The response provides any in - formation requested by the Program Review Report and any other information the institution would like the Department to consider. Department review of the institution's response to the findings in the Program Review Report. Department preparation of an FPRD that is sent to the institution. The FPRD provides final determinations for each finding including any liabilities owed to the Department and/or students, and payment instructions.Program Review Guide for Institutions3-6 Program Review Guide 2017How Title IV Aid Is Processed at the Institution/Responsibilities During the entrance conference, the reviewer may provide the institution with the opportunity to explain how it processes Title IV, HEA funds and who is responsible for various aspects of the administration of those funds with specific attention given to the areas of focus for the program review. For a focused campus security review, the Title IV process will not typically be discussed. Schedule Exit Conference or Status Meeting The exit conference or status meeting will be scheduled, if possible, during the entrance conference. Doing so assists both the reviewer and the institution's personnel in planning their work and managing their time. It is also helpful to establish early in the process who will represent the institution at the meeting. However, if during the course of the program review the timing and/or requirement for the exit conference changes, the reviewer should advise the institution. Getting Started To begin the off-site review, the reviewer may request that the institution identify a primary point of contact and inquire about the availability of staff and the process for communicating with institution officials during the course of the program review. The re - viewer will need to know whether the institution's primary point of contact would rather be contacted via phone or email, and whether the reviewer should contact him/her at certain times during the day or anytime a question arises. The primary point of contact may be asked to coordinate contact with other institution of - ficials as needed (e.g., Admissions, Registrar, Financial Aid, Business Office, Campus Security). explain the possibility of resolving issues or deficiencies while the reviewer is gathering data. In some cases the institution may be given a reasonable time frame to resolve deficiencies and possibly collect missing documentation. email a list of required documents to the institution. The email will be sent either immediately following the entrance conference or at a later time established with the institution. determine if the institution is aware of the FERPA requirement to document disclosure of students' PII to the Department as part of the program review. If the institution is aware of its responsibilities, no further action is required. If the institution is not aware of the requirements, the reviewer may instruct the institution to review the FERPA information on IFAP, and may provide the institution with sample language for a statement to place in the student files reviewed. See Appendix E, FERPA Disclosure, for information regarding the institution's requirements regarding FERPA.Program Review Guide 20174-14MChapter ED Review of Institution Processes and Data The reviewers will examine information and may conduct interviews in order to develop an understanding of the institution's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. The institution is required to cooperate with the Department during the program review and provide unrestrict - ed access to any and all information requested to conduct the program review. The regulations (34 CFR \u00a7 668.24(f)) specifically require the institution to provide timely access, for examination and copying, to requested records, including but not limited to computerized records and records reflecting transac - tions with any financial institution with which the institution deposits or has deposited any Title IV, HEA program funds, and to any pertinent books, documents, papers, or computer programs; and provide reasonable access to per - sonnel associated with the institution's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs for the purpose of obtaining relevant information. Failure to provide this access to the program review team may lead to an adverse administra - tive action. REVIEW OF CRITICAL ELEMENTS\u2014INSTITUTIONAL The Department has identified critical elements for review that generally address those areas of noncompliance cited most frequently in program reviews. The reviewers test the critical elements to determine if the institution is compliant with the applicable statute and/or regulations. If noncompliance is found, they may continue testing to determine if the error found is system - ic. The review of the critical elements does not prevent the reviewers from reviewing other items if appropriate.

In addition, information required under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act will be reviewed if applicable; drug and alcohol abuse prevention information will be reviewed at institutions participating in the CB programs. A summary of the disclosure requirements is included in the Federal Student Aid Handbook. URLs for all financial aid consumer information. The information available on the institution's website or other electronic sources of information, if any exist, will be reviewed in conjunction with the printed materi - als received from the institution. Examples of institutional forms, applications and worksheets that are used in administering the Title IV, HEA programs. Documents used by the institution will be reviewed to gain familiarity with the institution's processes and facilitate the review of student files.

See 34 CFR \u00a7 668.24. Reviewers gather information from institution staff through a variety of interactions. This is typically the routine interaction of asking questions, or clarifying institutional procedures or data found in student files. However, some - times it is necessary to schedule a formal interview to discuss specific details, topics or issues more fully. Chapter 4\u2014 ED Review of Institution Processes and Data Program Review Guide 20174-7 When conducting interviews, the reviewers will select staff members to interview and do not need permission from institution officials to do so; the institution may not dictate who should be present during interviews (e.g., management, attorneys, etc.), or what information institution staff may supply to the reviewers; and the institution is not permitted to tape record staff interviews. NOTE: If employees' contracts include a \"non-disclosure\" clause, the institution must provide a written waiver to ensure the reviewers are able to speak freely to all current employees about their knowledge of the school's administra - tion of the Title IV, HEA programs. If the institution does not cooperate with these rules, it is not providing reasonable access to personnel, and 34 CFR \u00a7 668.24 requires institutions to provide reasonable access to personnel. Staff Interview Questions During staff interviews, the reviewers may ask whatever questions they believe are necessary. However, the ques - tions will typically reflect the position held by the staff member being interviewed. Academic or Education Personnel/Registrar The Academic or Education Personnel/Register may be asked to show attendance documents and explain codes and how records are kept. Policies and procedures manual and other documents will be requested, as needed. Generally, questions will be asked regarding the following: The employee's job duties and staff functions The institution's academic programs Title IV eligibility of the academic programs Clock-to-credit conversion Academic calendar Externships Enrollment process Registration process Record maintenance Consortium and contractual agreements Attendance policies Integrated systems Institutional communication Admissions Personnel Admissions Personnel may be asked to present the forms associated with the admissions process using an actual student file.

Generally, questions will be asked regarding the following: The employee's job duties and staff functions Placement assistance offered Placement procedures Placement rates Externships Record maintenance Integrated systems Institutional communication Campus Security Personnel Campus Security Personnel may be asked to present campus security documents and explain how statistics are gathered for the annual report. Generally, questions will be asked regarding the following: The employee's job duties and staff functions Collection of crime data Campus crime reporting process Dissemination of campus crime reports Record maintenance Institutional communication INTERVIEWS WITH OUTSIDE SOURCES/THIRD PARTIES It may be necessary to interview others who are involved in the institution's administration of the Title IV, HEA Programs (e.g., Perkins Loan servicer). RESOLUTION OF INSTITUTIONAL FINDINGS WHILE ON-SITE During the course of the program review, the review team may discuss findings noted with the institution. If the institution wishes to try to resolve a finding while the review team is reviewing institutional records, it may do so. When the Program Review Report is prepared, any findings that were resolved prior to the issuance of the report will be included in the Program Review Report along with an explanation of their resolution.Program Review Guide 20175-15MChapter ED Review of Student-level Information Reviewing student level information is critical to determining if an institution is following the law, the regula - tions, and its own policies. The reviewers may review student files and student level data from the Department's recordkeeping systems, and possibly conduct interviews, as part of their evaluation of the institution's administra - tion of the Title IV, HEA programs. The institution is required to cooperate with the Department during the program review and provide unre - stricted access to any and all information requested to conduct the review. The regulations (34 CFR \u00a7 668.24(f)) spe - cifically require the institution to provide timely access, for examination and copying, to requested records, includ - ing but not limited to computerized records and records reflecting transactions with any financial institution with which the institution deposits or has deposited any Title IV, HEA program funds, and to any pertinent books, docu - ments, papers, or computer programs; and provide reasonable access to personnel associated with the institution's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs for the purpose of obtaining relevant information. Failure to provide this access to the program review team may lead to an adverse administrative action. REVIEW OF STUDENT FILES The reviewers will request the specific files to be reviewed. However, as all institutions have unique filing sys - tems, it is the responsibility of the institution to provide all relevant information pertaining to the students and is - sues identified. Student Sample If the program review includes an evaluation of student files, a sample of students whose files will be reviewed will be drawn from the institution's population of Title IV recipients. After identifying a separate valid statistical sample for each award year under review, a small subset of records from the sample will be selected. This \"review sample\" is generally randomly selected using the first 15 records in the statistical sample and adding up to 14 more records as necessary to ensure the review sample includes a representative subset. A review sample may not be randomly selected if a focused review of a specific issue (or issues) is being con - ducted. The selection of a random sample does not prohibit reviewers from examining the files of other recipients to follow-up on certain issues. These additional recipients may or may not be in the statistical sample. All errors found in any student files, whether part of the review sample or not, will be included in the program review report.Program Review Guide for Institutions5-2 Program Review Guide 2017Review of Critical Elements\u2014Students The Department has identified critical elements for review that generally address those areas of noncompliance cited most frequently in program reviews. The reviewers test the critical elements to determine if the institution is compliant with the applicable statute and/or regulation(s). If noncompliance is found, they may continue testing to determine if the error found is sys - temic. The review of the critical elements does not prevent the reviewers from reviewing other items if appropriate. Program Review Critical Student Elements Elements Statute/Regulation Student Eligibility 34 CFR Part 668, Subpart C\u2014Student Eligibility (\u00a7\u00a7 668.31-668.40) (ATB) Part 668, Subpart J-Approval of Independently Administered Tests; Specification of Passing Score; Ap - proval of Section 472 Credit Balances 34 CFR \u00a7 668.164(e) Dependency Override HEA Sec. 34 CFR \u00a7 student, three-quarter \u00a7 479A Return of Title IV Funds (R2T4) HEA, Section 484B 34 CFR \u00a7 668.22 Satisfactory (SAP) Verification 34 CFR Part 668, Aid Application Information 668.51-668.61) Calculations/Disbursements\u2014Pell Grant 34 CFR Part 690, Subpart Federal Pell Grant Awards (\u00a7\u00a7 690.61-690.67) 34 690, Subpart (\u00a7\u00a7 690.71-690.83)Chapter 5\u2014ED Review of Student-level Information Program Review Guide 20175-3 Program Review Critical Student Elements (continued) Elements Statute/Regulation Calculations/Disbursements\u2014TEACH Grant 34 CFR and 674.16 File Review The reviewers will typically need the following records for the recipients in the review sample: Admission records: records pertaining to the student's admission to the institution/program, including the enrollment contract, admission application, high school transcript, ability-to-benefit results, etc. Academic records: records of courses, credits, or hours attempted/completed and grades earned (academic transcript) as well as records pertaining to the student's attendance, academic standing and progress Student financial aid records: records supporting student eligibility for Title IV, HEA funds, including SAR/ ISIR, verification documents, R2T4 calculations, etc. Student account ledger: records of student charges and credits, including Title IV, HEA disbursement re - cords During the course of the program review, additional student files may be requested. The reviewers may also re - quest a list of recipients with a certain characteristic in order to identify the additional files to be reviewed. Reviewers will take appropriate precautions to prevent unauthorized access to the records in their possession (e.g., locking their work space, notifying their institutional contact when leaving, securing the documents in a locked file cabinet, etc.). If records must be removed from the institution's premises to be copied, or for other extenuating circumstances, the reviewers will identify those records being taken and take precautions to ensure the security of the documents. For an off-site review, the review team makes its request for records via mail, email, or facsimile. The review team will request that the records for the review sample be mailed with a postmark date no later than two business days from the receipt of the request.Program Review Guide for Institutions5-4 Program Review Guide 2017Admissions Records The reviewers will examine admissions documents to determine the basis for admission (high school diploma, GED, ATB, etc.). if information on the admissions document is consistent with information in other institutional records. If not (e.g., the ISIR indicates that the student is a high school graduate, but the admissions application indi - cates the student is not), the reviewers will review documentation collected by the institution to resolve the conflicting information. the requirements of the enrollment agreement (length of program, tuition and fees, start date). if the student is a regular student who has met the conditions for acceptance in a particular program and is enrolled in an eligible program. Academic Records The reviewers will analyze the academic transcript as part of determining if the student is an eligible student, if the student is making satisfactory academic progress, the student's enrollment status, and if the student failed to earn any credits in an academic period (received all F's or all W's, or a combination thereof). Other documents will be reviewed as they pertain to attendance and satisfactory academic progress. Student Financial Aid Records Financial aid records will be reviewed to verify that the student's eligibility for Title IV, HEA funds, was properly determined. The reviewers will examine documentation to support the institution's determination of the student's need and Title IV award, including, but not limited to, documentation related to verification, the use of professional judgment, dependency override, and return of Title IV. Student Account Ledger The reviewers will analyze the student's account ledger to verify that the institution is following the regulatory requirements to include charges consistent with allowable charges and student enrollment status; credit Title IV, HEA funds to the student's account, including identifying the Title IV, HEA program, the date the funds were posted, and the amount of aid received; pay credit balance to student; disburse Title IV, HEA funds within the required time frame; and return Title IV, HEA funds based on R2T4 calculation. Student Data Collection When reviewing the student specific critical elements, reviewers will typically note the information in the tables on the following pages.Chapter 5\u2014ED Review of Student-level Information Program Review Guide 20175-5 Student Data Institutional/Review Identifiers Student Number The student number from the review sample Institution The name of the institution the student attends General, Focused, Join Program ReviewThe program review type OPE ID The OPE ID number of the institution being reviewed Student-specific Information Award Year The award year for which the student in the sample was selected Last Name, First Name The last name and first name of the student Program of Study The program of study in which the student is enrolled Eligible Program Whether the program the student is enrolled in is eligible or ineligible Eligible Location Whether the location at which the program is offered is eligible or ineligible SSN The last four digits of the student's Social Security number DOB The date of birth of the student EFC The expected family contribution of the student (from the ISIR the student was paid from) Program Length The length of the program of study in which the student is enrolled Academic Y ear and MidpointThe academic year of the program of study.

ment's recordkeeping systems, and compare the data for consistency. Review NSLDS Data for Students in the Review Sample Prior to the program review, the reviewers will retrieve information on a student-by-student basis from NSLDS for each student in the review sample. The review team will use this information to confirm student name and social security number (SSN). verify the name of the institution that awarded and disbursed aid. verify student enrollment status was properly reported. identify the amount and type of funds received by each student in the sample. detect any trends with funds received by students. compare the amount reported for payments of Pell, Perkins Loans, or Direct Loan (subsidized, unsubsidized and PLUS) to the amount disbursed to the student or the student's account. check the accuracy of loan periods. verify if any overpayments were reported. identify any defaulted loans and whether aid was disbursed prior to resolution of the default. review subsidized and unsubsidized loans and compare those loan amounts to the borrower's academic loan limits. check loan amounts guaranteed and disbursed (by loan period). check aggregate loan balance(s). Chapter 5\u2014ED Review of Student-level Information Program Review Guide 20175-9 determine if a return of funds has been made for a withdrawn student. (Most funds returned by the institu - tion to the lender as a result of student withdrawals and Return of Title IV Funds (R2T4) calculations are coded as cancellations and indistinguishable from other cancellations in NSLDS. If unable to verify that a return was made, the reviewers may request documentation from the institution.) Review COD Data for Students in the Review Sample Institutions use the COD system to report originations, disbursements, adjustments, and returns of Pell Grant, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan funds. Prior to the program review, reviewers will retrieve information on a stu - dent-by-student basis from COD for each student in the review sample. The review team will use this information to compare the amounts and dates of Pell and Direct Loan disbursements in COD with the institution's fiscal records as well as the student's account ledger. compare, for the TEACH Grant program, the total award and total disbursement. verify that downward adjustments of Pell, and TEACH Grant disbursements as a result of corrections, re - funds (R2T4), or other reasons match the institution's fiscal records as well as the student's account ledger. verify that the amount of any Direct Loan adjustments match the institution's fiscal records as well as the student's account ledger. monitor whether or not the institution met the 30-day reporting requirement. verify that the cost of attendance and transaction number reported to COD are accurate. Review CPS Data for Students in the Review Sample The reviewers will obtain Institutional Student Information Report (ISIR) data for the most recently closed award year and the current open year for the students in the sample. The reviewers will review the ISIR on which the student was paid. If the student has multiple ISIRs, the review - ers will analyze the differences to determine if changes made affected the EFC and if the institution paid on an ISIR with the correct data. Items that the reviewers will pay particular attention to include the following: Multiple transactions Dependency override Verification ISIR Corrections Ability to Benefit FAFSA Signature Missing FAFSA information If the ISIR/SAR is based upon a FAFSA Renewal Application ISIR C Codes STUDENT INTERVIEWS Student interviews may be conducted to authenticate data in the file, follow up on student complaints, and/or discuss institutional practices.Program Review Guide for Institutions5-10 Program Review Guide 2017When conducting interviews, the reviewers will select current and/or former students to interview and will not need permission from in - stitution officials to do so. the institution may not dictate who should be present during interviews (e.g., management, attorneys, etc.), or what information students may supply to the reviewers. the institution is not permitted to tape record student interviews. The questions used during a student interview will vary depending upon the type of institution the student is at - tending and the scope of the program review. Generally, questions will be asked to verify the student's Biographical information Basis for admission Prior education Admission experience Financial aid experience Prior financial aid received Program of study Educational experience Access to campus security information RESOLUTION OF STUDENT FINDINGS WHILE ON-SITE During the course of the program review, the review team may discuss findings noted with the institution. If the institution wishes to try to resolve a finding while the review team is reviewing student files, it may do so. When the program review report is written, any findings that were resolved during the review or prior to the issuance of the report will be included in the program review report along with an explanation of their resolution.Program Review Guide 20176-16MChapter Exit Conference/Status Meeting Generally, at the end of the on-site and off-site reviews, the review team will meet with institution officials to conduct an exit conference or a status meeting. The primary purpose of the exit conference or status meeting is for the review team to share with the institution the next steps in the program review process. EXIT CONFERENCE In situations where the fieldwork is substantially complete, an exit conference will usually be conducted. The reviewers will provide information that is determined by the time the exit conference is conducted, which includes a summary of the following: Required actions (if applicable) Outstanding items and submission time frames (if applicable) Preliminary findings (if applicable) Next steps in the program review process Required Actions (if Applicable) The reviewers may provide verbal instructions to the institution on required actions the institution must take to rectify current practices. If the institution is engaging in a particular action that will result in increased liabilities or other harm if not cor - rected immediately, such as failure to include campus-based funds in the Return of Title IV funds calculations, the institution will typically be directed to rectify the problem right away and not wait for the Program Review Report to be issued. If preliminary analysis indicates systemic errors or error rates in excess of Department standards, the institu - tion will typically be notified that instructions for conducting a file review to identify and correct the errors will be included in the Program Review Report. The institution may want to begin preliminary preparations for conducting the file review for findings noted during the exit conference, but it must still adhere to the instructions in the Pro - gram Review Report for conducting the review. Information regarding liabilities, and instructions regarding payment of liabilities, will be included in the Final Program Review Determination (FPRD) letter. However, if the institution would like to begin repaying liabilities immediately, it may do so, especially as the liabilities relate to refunds of unearned tuition to either students or the Department. If the institution resolves any findings by paying liabilities prior to issuance of the Program Review Report, the findings will still be included in the report, and the institution should provide proof of payment of those liabilities in response to the report. However, if the institution pays liabilities prior to issuance of the Final Program Review Determination, those findings cannot be appealed.Program Review Guide for Institutions6-2 Program Review Guide 2017Outstanding Items and Submission Time Frames (if Applicable) The reviewers will typically confirm with the institution what documents, if any, were requested but not pro - vided by the institution. If the documentation could not be provided because it was not yet available and outside the control of the insti - tution (e.g., cancelled checks), the institution should provide the documentation as soon as it is available. If the documentation could not be provided because the reviewers did not request the items until late in the review or for other reasons, the institution should provide the documentation within one calendar week of the exit interview. If documentation has not been provided when the review team is ready to issue the Program Review Report, the issues for which required documentation was not provided will be included in the report as findings. The institution may provide the required documentation in response to the report. Preliminary Findings (if Applicable) The reviewers will typically provide a brief oral summary of the findings identified to date. The findings dis - cussed are preliminary and additional analysis of the information collected may result in additional findings. The re - viewers will typically notify the institution of any substantial findings not discussed during the exit conference prior to the issuance of the Program Review Report. The exit conference is not the time for an in-depth discussion or debate of all the issues. The reviewers will not detail findings on a student-by-student basis. The Program Review Report will describe each finding in detail and the institution will be provided an opportunity to respond to every finding. Next Steps in the Program Review Process The review team will explain what the institution can expect to happen after the reviewers leave the institution. Upon returning from the program review, the review team will further analyze the data collected. If additional documentation has been requested from the institution, the data will be analyzed once it is received. It is anticipated that a Program Review Report will be issued generally within 75 days. The report will contain the findings identified, even those that the institution was allowed to resolve prior to the issuance of the report. The institution will be responsible for addressing all findings in the report, including those that were not known or dis - cussed at the time of the exit conference. The institution will have the opportunity to respond to the Program Review Report in writing within 30-90 days, depending upon the complexity of the findings and/or if any file reviews are required. Reasonable dialogue regarding the findings and questions of regulatory interpretation will be considered, but a timely resolution of the issues identified will be expected. After the institution has been provided the opportunity to respond to the Program Review Report, the reviewers will issue an FPRD letter that will serve to identify any liabilities, provide repayment instructions, close the program review (if applicable), and provide instructions for appeal. Chapter 6\u2014Exit Conference/Status Meeting Program Review Guide 20176-3 If there are no findings, or all findings with no liabilities have been resolved prior to issuance of the report, the SPD may issue an EDL in lieu of issuing a separate Program Review Report and FPRD. STATUS MEETING In situations where the fieldwork has not been completed and/or the data has not been analyzed, a status meet - ing will usually be conducted to provide the status of the fieldwork. The reviewers will typically identify required actions (if applicable), outstanding items and submission time frames (if applicable), and next steps in the program review process. Required Actions (if Applicable) The reviewers may provide verbal instructions to the institution on required actions the institution must take to rectify current practices. If the institution is engaging in a particular action that will result in increased liabilities or other harm if not cor - rected immediately, such as failure to include campus-based funds in the Return of Title IV funds calculations, the institution typically will be directed to rectify the problem right away and not wait for the Program Review Report to be issued. Outstanding Items and Submission Time Frames (if Applicable) The reviewers will typically confirm with the institution what documents, if any, were requested but not pro - vided by the institution. If the documentation could not be provided because it was not yet available and outside the control of the insti - tution (e.g., cancelled checks), the institution should provide the documentation as soon as it is available. If the documentation could not be provided before the end of the review because the reviewers did not request the items until late in the review or for other reasons, the institution should provide the documentation within one calendar week of the exit interview. If documentation has not been provided when the review team is ready to issue the Program Review Report, the issues for which required documentation was not provided will be included in the report as findings. The institution may provide the required documentation in response to the report. Next Steps in the Program Review Process The review team will explain what the institution can expect to happen after the reviewers leave the institution. If a return visit may be necessary to complete the fieldwork, the reviewers may discuss the return dates at this time. If the fieldwork has been completed but data has not been analyzed, the reviewers may indicate that they will con - tact the institution and schedule an exit interview (by conference call or in person, as appropriate) after analysis is complete.Program Review Guide 20177-17MChapter Referrals During the course of the program review, it may be necessary for the review team to notify other offices within the Department, or external agencies, regarding problems found at the institution. It is not necessary for the program review process to be concluded prior to the issuance of an adverse administrative action. In fact, such an action will be initiated as soon as practicable during the program review process to protect the integrity of the Title IV programs. THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS AND APPEALS SERVICE GROUP If serious noncompliance is identified during the program review, the SPD may refer the institution to the Ad - ministrative Actions and Appeals Service Group (AAASG) for further action. AAASG administers the Secretary's authority to fine an institution that participates in the Title IV, HEA programs, or limit, suspend, or terminate Title IV, HEA program eligibility, as well as impose emergency actions. These actions are collectively referred to as ad - ministrative actions. An institution has the right to appeal administrative actions before an impartial hearing official, as outlined in 34 CFR Part 668, Subpart G\u2014Fine, Limitation, Suspension and Termination Proceedings. Under the Subpart G regulations, an institution and/or FSA may appeal the hearing official's initial decision regarding fines, or limitations, suspensions or terminations of Title IV eligibility to the Secretary. INSTITUTIONAL IMPROVEMENT SERVICES The purpose of Institutional Improvement Services (IIS) is to help institutions improve their current and future administration of the Title IV, HEA programs by helping them identify the cause of their non-compliance. Whether it is a lack of information or a lack of understanding of how to implement and apply the rules and regulations, IIS is intended to help institutions through training and/or implementation of an improvement plan. GUARANTY, STATE LICENSING, AND ACCREDITING AGENCIES The reviewers may notify other entities regarding problems found at the institution. Other agencies to be noti - fied may be the guaranty agency, the state licensing agency, and/or the accrediting agency. These agencies share the responsibility for oversight of institutions participating in the Title IV programs.Program Review Guide for Institutions7-2 Program Review Guide 2017OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL If a reviewer suspects any fraud, waste, or abuse of Title IV, HEA program funds a referral will be made to the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General (OIG). The review team will report any credible informa - tion indicating that any employee, third-party servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs, or the receipt of funds under those programs, may have engaged in fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or breach of fiduciary responsibility, or other illegal conduct in - volving the Title IV, HEA programs. Program Review Guide 20178-18MChapter Post Review Communication and Report Upon returning from the program review, or completing the off-site review of institutional records, the review team will analyze the data gathered. The reviewers will either contact the institution to request additional in - formation, or issue an Expedited Determination Letter or a Program Review Report. The institution will be given an opportunity to respond to the Program Review Report before a Final Program Review Determination Letter is issued. DEPARTMENT REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION In some cases, the reviewers may find that they need additional information from the institution in order to fin - ish analyzing the institution's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. If additional information is needed, the reviewers will either contact the institution and request that the institution send the documentation/ informa - tion, or visit the institution to review the additional documents. The reviewers may contact the institution by telephone, email, or letter to request additional information. Tele - phone or email contact will typically be used only for minor requests where the explanation of additional informa - tion is not extensive. However, if, for example, it is necessary to expand the sample and request additional informa - tion for students in the expanded sample, then the reviewers will request the information by letter. Regardless of what method the reviewers use to request additional information, the request will include a time frame in which the institution must provide the additional information. The institution will generally be allowed 30 days to provide the requested information. If the information provided contains personally identifiable information (PII), the institu - tion must take care to protect that information, either through encryption or proper packaging for shipment. If the institution fails to provide the requested documentation in the specified time frame, there are three pos - sible outcomes: The reviewers may contact the institution and schedule a visit to review the documentation on-site. The Program Review Report may include findings that are not actually problems, but rather reflect the fail - ure of the institution to provide requested information. The institution's failure to provide information may be included as a finding in the Program Review Report, which could become grounds for an administrative action. PROGRAM REVIEW REPORT OR EXPEDITED DETERMINATION LETTER After the review team has completed its review and analysis of the institutional and student files, a report will be issued to the institution. There are two types of reports that may be issued:Program Review Guide for Institutions8-2 Program Review Guide 2017 Expedited Determination Letter Program Review Report (most commonly used) The Expedited Determination Letter (EDL) The EDL serves as both the preliminary report and final determination letter to the institution regarding find - ings discovered during the program review. The institution is not required to submit a written response, and the EDL will include an indication that the program review is being closed. The EDL is typically used when either no findings or only minor (isolated, non-systemic) findings were identified during the program re - view, any findings identified were corrected prior to issuance of the EDL, and any liabilities identified were paid/collected prior to issuance of the EDL. The EDL will be sent via certified or overnight mail to the president of the institution with a copy to the financial aid administrator. The president and/or financial aid administrator will be responsible for providing copies of the letter to other institution officials requiring copies. A copy of the EDL will also be sent, if applicable, to officials of the state authorizing, accrediting, guaranty, and other federal agencies. The EDL includes the following standard sections: Scope of Review and Disclaimer Findings (if applicable) Recommendations See Appendix F, Expedited Determination Letter, for an example of the template used by the Department. Scope of Review and Disclaimer The scope section identifies when the program review was conducted, the focus of the review, how the student sample was selected, the number and type of records examined, and the award years reviewed. It also includes a dis - claimer indicating that the review is not all-inclusive. Findings All findings are included in the EDL as a matter of record. Documentation of all compliance problems is impor - tant to providing independent public accountants, accrediting agencies, and other entities with a clear picture of any Title IV, HEA program administration weaknesses identified. Findings in the EDL explain how the institution violated regulatory requirements, the effect of the violation, and the actions taken to correct the violation. Findings are numbered and titled to reflect the violation noted. Each finding will include the statutory/regula - tory citation and either a direct quote or brief description of the requirement. In addition, related resources, such as a Dear Colleague Letter, Blue Book, Federal Student Aid Handbook, Application and Verification Guide, etc., may be cited. A Noncompliance section for the finding will provide a description of the problem identified, including identification of all specific occurrences. The Institutional Action Taken to Resolve section will include an explana - tion of the actions the institution has taken to correct the problem and to ensure that the problem does not recur.Chapter 8\u2014Post Review Communication and Report Program Review Guide 20178-3 Recommendations The reviewers may include recommendations in the EDL regarding actions they feel the institution should take that are not specific to resolving a particular finding. These recommendations would address matters that can po - tentially affect the administration of the Title IV, HEA program(s) at the institution. For example, if the institution does not utilize Federal Student Aid online technical assistance or avail itself of Departmental training, these could be recommended. The Program Review Report A Program Review Report is the preliminary report to the institution of the findings discovered during the re - view of the institutions records. The report includes the applicable statutes and regulations, and specifies required actions and a timeframe for the institution to respond. The Program Review Report will be sent via certified or overnight mail to the president of the institution with a copy to the financial aid administrator. The president and/or financial aid administrator will be responsible for pro - viding copies of the report to other institution officials requiring copies. The institution's response to the Program Review Report will be due by the due date specified in the cover letter. The Program Review Report typically includes the following standard sections: Report Cover Page Table of Contents Institutional Information Scope of Review and Disclaimer Findings Recommendations Appendices and Enclosures See Appendix G, Program Review Report, for an example of the cover letter and report template used by the Department. Report Cover Page Each Program Review Report will have a Report Cover Page. The Report Cover Page will identify the institution and the team that is conducting the program review. Table of Contents Each Program Review Report will contain a Table of Contents. The Table of Contents provides the page num - bers of sections and individual findings within the Program Review Report. Institutional Information The institutional information section of the Program Review Report is provided to give the reader a snapshot view of the institution. It includes the institution's name, address, type (public, private nonprofit, proprietary), high - est level of offering, accrediting agency, current student enrollment, percent of students receiving Title IV, HEA pro - gram funds, the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds disbursed by program, and the three most recent cohort default rates for the applicable loan programs.Program Review Guide for Institutions8-4 Program Review Guide 2017Scope of Review and Disclaimer The scope section identifies the dates when the institution's records were reviewed, the focus of the review, how the student sample was selected, the number and type of records examined, and the award years reviewed. It also includes a disclaimer indicating that the review is not all-inclusive. Findings Whether or not a deficiency seems minor, or has been resolved or repaid while the reviewers were on-site, it will be included as a finding in the report as a matter of record. Documentation of all compliance problems is important to providing independent public accountants, accrediting agencies, and other entities with a clear picture of any Title IV, HEA program administration weaknesses identified. Findings in the Program Review Report explain how the institution violated regulatory requirements, the effect of the violation, and what actions the institution must take in order to be in compliance. Findings are numbered and titled to reflect the violation noted. Each finding will include the statutory/regula - tory citation and either a direct quote or brief description of the requirement, In addition, related resources, such as a Dear Colleague Letter, Blue Book, Federal Student Aid Handbook, Application and Verification Guide, etc., may be cited. A Noncompliance section for the finding will provide a detailed description of the problem identified, including identification of all specific occurrences. The Required Action section will include a detailed explanation of the actions the institution is required to take to identify the extent of the problem and to ensure that the problem does not recur. There are two general types of findings; student specific and institutional. The type of finding together with the error rate and whether or not the error will result in a liability, will determine the required action. 1. Student-specific Finding If there is no potential or actual liability associated with the error, regardless of the number of errors identified in the student files in the sample, the institution will be required to correct its policy/procedure and practice for the future and demonstrate that this correction has been made. In addition, the institution will be required to correct the errors for the students in the sample. If there is potential or actual liability associated with the error, the institution will be required to correct its policy/procedure and practice for the future and demonstrate that this correction has been made. If the error rate is small, the institution will be required to correct the errors for the students in the sample. If the error rate is high, the institution will be required to correct the errors for the students in the sample and perform a file review for either the remainder of the students in the statistical sample or the entire student population with the specific characteris - tic in order to identify and correct any other errors. 2. Institutional Finding If the reviewers find that the institution has an incomplete or unacceptable institutional policy/procedure, the reviewers will determine if the error in the policy is also reflected in errors in student files. If not, the institution will be instructed to correct its policy/procedure and practice for the future and certify that it implemented the policy/ procedure. If so, the institution will be instructed to take the appropriate action as identified for a Student-specific Finding above, which includes correcting the policy/procedure. If the reviewers find a problem related to institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, financial reporting, or other institutional actions, the reviewers will determine if there is a liability or potential liability associated with the error. If there is no potential or actual liability associated with the error, the institution will be instructed to correct Chapter 8\u2014Post Review Communication and Report Program Review Guide 20178-5 its practice for the future and demonstrate that this correction has been made. If there is potential or actual liability associated with the error, the institution will be instructed to provide sufficient information so that the liability can be quantified. In addition, the institution will be instructed to correct its practice for the future and demonstrate that this correction has been made. Recommendations The reviewers may include recommendations in the Program Review Report regarding actions the institution should take that are not specific to resolving a particular finding. These recommendations will address issues that can potentially affect the administration of the Title IV, HEA program(s) at the institution. For example, if the insti - tution does not utilize Federal Student Aid online technical assistance or avail itself of Departmental training, these could be recommended. Appendices and Enclosures The list of any student files reviewed will be included as an appendix. An enclosure concerning the protection of PII and the requirements the institution must follow when submit - ting this type of information will be included when such information is requested. The Program Review Report will include additional appendices and enclosures as necessary. These may include instructions for any required file reviews, analysis supporting one or more findings, checklists to assist the institu - tion in correcting its deficiencies, etc. INSTITUTION RESPONSE TO PROGRAM REVIEW REPORT The institution is required to respond in writing to the findings presented in the Program Review Report. In ad - dition, the institution may submit any additional information and/or documentation it wishes to provide to support its actions if it disagrees with any of the report's conclusions. The Program Review Report will include an enclosure concerning the protection of PII and the requirements the institution must follow when submitting this type of information. The institution's response must be submitted accordingly. The required information must be submitted so that it is received by the due date identified in the Program Re - view Report Cover Letter. The Required Action section for each finding will describe in detail the actions the institution must take, and documentation that must be provided regarding the finding. The description of the required action will also include instructions for submitting the institution's response. The institution's written response to each finding must include all of the information and/or documents specified in the required action. Generally, the institution will be required to (1) correct its policy/procedure and/or practice for the future and either demonstrate or certify that this correction has been made/implemented, (2) correct the errors for the students in the sample, (3) perform a file review for either the remainder of the students in the statistical sample or the entire student population with the specific characteristic to identify and correct any other errors, and/or (4) provide suf - ficient information so that the liability can be quantified.Program Review Guide for Institutions8-6 Program Review Guide 20171. Correction to Policy/Procedure and/or Practice Required If the institution is directed to correct a policy/procedure, a copy of the revised policy/procedure must be pro - vided in response to the Program Review Report. The institution should not take any action to implement or make corrections based on the revised policy/procedure until the reviewers confirm that the revised policy/procedure is acceptable. If the institution is asked to demonstrate that the revised policy/procedure has been implemented and corrected in practice, the institution must submit documents as requested. For example, if the institution has updated its R2T4 policy and/or practice, it must submit copies of R2T4 calculations which were completed based on the revised policy. If the policy/procedure change cannot be easily demonstrated, the institution may be asked to certify that the re - vised policy/procedure has been implemented. The certification must indicate the effective date and must be signed by the appropriate institution official. 2. Correction of Student-specific Errors Required If the institution is directed to correct errors identified for the individual students in the sample, the institution must submit copies of all documents necessary to demonstrate that those errors have been corrected. In addition, the institution should indicate the effect of the corrections on the student's need and Title IV award. 3. File Review Required If the institution is directed to complete a file review, the institution must identify the student files to be re - viewed based on the population identified in the Program Review Report, and conduct its own review of those files to determine if similar errors exist. If so, the institution must correct the errors. The required action for the finding will provide detailed instructions regarding the file review including identification of the population of files to be reviewed and for what award years. Generally, a file review will cover the year or years in which the problem was identified. However, a file review may be required for prior periods if the institution was using an erroneous policy and there is evidence that the erroneous policy was also be - ing used during the prior award year. the institution's policy is correct, but the institution was executing the policy incorrectly in practice, and there is evidence that the institution was also executing the policy incorrectly in practice for the prior award year. a file review summary spreadsheet. A sample file review summary spreadsheet may be provided to demon - strate how the results of the file review must be reported, either within the required action or as an appendix. identification of supporting documentation to be submitted (if any) and how it is to be provided. Sup - porting documentation will typically be requested in one of three ways: Submission of all documents to verify the accuracy of the file review Submission of all documents to verify the accuracy of the file review together with an Agreed Upon Pro - cedures Attestation from an independent public accountant Submission of the results only of the file review together with an Agreed Upon Procedures Attestation from an independent public accountant instructions for review of a sample if liability projection can be used. Normally, for file reviews requiring reconstruction of more than 100 files, the institution may be allowed to limit its review to the statistical sam - ple of students. Based on that review, any liability identified would be projected for the entire population. However, liability projection cannot be offered for all findings. Examples of situations when liability projec - tion cannot be used include, but are not limited toChapter 8\u2014Post Review Communication and Report Program Review Guide 20178-7 returns of Title IV funds are unmade or incorrect, credit balances are owed to recipients, or the statistical sample included students for whom loan discharges have been paid by the institution (e.g., closed school, false certification, or refund discharges). 4. Provide Sufficient Information So That the Liability Can Be Quantified Each finding will provide specific instructions regarding the documentation/information that the institution should provide with its response. Submission of incomplete documentation/information may result in the identifi - cation of liabilities that perhaps could have been avoided. DEPARTMENT FOLLOWUP TO INCOMPLETE/INACCURATE RESPONSE An institution's response is complete when the institution has provided the required information/ documenta - tion or has indicated that the required information/documentation cannot be provided. If the information/documentation provided does not fully resolve the findings, the reviewers may contact the institution to obtain missing information or clarification. If there are problems with the documents received for several files, the reviewers will notify the institution that the response for that finding is rejected, and will typically allow the institution 30 calendar days to correct and re - submit the response. If the corrected response is not received within the 30 calendar days allowed, the institution may, for good cause shown, be granted an extension of time to provide the revised response. If an extension is not granted, the FPRD will be issued and any liabilities will be assessed based on the data available to the Department. In addition, if there are significant problems with a majority of the documents reviewed, the institution may be placed on a restricted method of payment. INSTITUTION REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO RESPOND TO PROGRAM REVIEW REPORT Institutions may find that additional time is needed to prepare a complete response to the Program Review Re - port. If that is the case, the institution may request an extension of time (beyond the due date specified in the Pro - gram Review Report Cover Letter) to respond to the Program Review Report. When the institution wishes to request an extension, the institution must submit its request in writing via fac - simile, letter, or email. The institution should include the following in the extension request: A status report detailing the percentage of work completed for each finding An assessment of the time and effort required to complete the response Samples of work completed, if judged necessary by the reviewers If an auditor attestation is required, a copy of the auditor engagement letter An explanation of the reason the file review if applicable, could not be completed by the due date, including any extenuating circumstances, such as,Program Review Guide for Institutions8-8 Program Review Guide 2017 delayed access to records due to a natural disaster, sudden loss of financial aid or other staff responsible for the response, or a change in administration, multiple file reviews to be conducted for a large population of students, or extensive research required before responding. The institution will receive a written response to its request, either granting it or denying it. INSTITUTION STATUS REPORTS WHEN ADDITIONAL TIME FOR RESPONSE GRANTED If an extension is granted for over 60 days, the institution will be required to submit status reports of its progress toward completing the actions required in the report. The institution may also be asked to submit documents or information to allow the reviewers to confirm that the institution is performing the required actions appropriately (e.g., sample return calculations, sample corrections to verification, revised SAP policy). The information that must be included in the status report will be identified in the letter granting the extension. DEPARTMENT FOLLOWUP IF RESPONSE NOT RECEIVED BY DUE DATE If the institution's response is not received by the due date (original or extended), the reviewers will typically call the institution to determine the status of the response. If the institution has completed the response and the response is in transit, no further action is required. If the institution has not completed the response and requires more than one week to complete the re - sponse, the institution will be asked to submit a Request for Extension to Respond. If the institution will be able to provide the response within one week, the institution must provide written confirmation of the date the response will be received by the Department.Program Review Guide 20179-19MChapter Final Program Review Determination and Followup The Final Program Review Determination (FPRD) letter serves to inform the institution of the Department's fi - nal determination for each of the findings in the Program Review Report. The FPRD also identifies liabilities, if any, calculated based on the findings of the program review; provides instructions for the payment of liabilities, as appropriate; notifies the institution of its right to appeal the existence and amount of any liabilities identified, as ap - propriate; and closes the program review, if appropriate. The FPRD may or may not require additional action by the institution. FINAL PROGRAM REVIEW DETERMINATION LETTER The FPRD will be addressed to the President/CEO/Owner. The FAA will be sent a copy of the letter. The Presi - dent/CEO/Owner and/or FAA will be responsible for providing copies of the letter to other institution officials re - quiring copies. In addition to the financial aid administrator, the appropriate parties at the state authorizing agency, accrediting agency and guaranty agency will also receive copies of the letter. See Appendix H, Final Program Review Determination Letter, for an example of the cover letter and report template used by the Department. Timeline for FPRD Preparation and Issuance Typically the FPRD is issued to the institution within 30 to 90 days after the Department's receipt of a complete and final response to the Program Review Report. However, more time may be needed to prepare the FPRD if a file review is extensive and includes supporting documentation and/or an auditor's attestation, there are multiple file reviews, liabilities must be projected, the reviewers need to seek concurrence or information from other offices, and/or Department priorities require the reviewers to give their attention to other cases. FPRD if No Further Action Is Required An FPRD requiring no further action will be issued if, in response to the Program Review Report, the institution provided information and/or documentation that resolved all findings and demonstrated that any liabilities were eliminated or paid. The FPRD will include a letter indicating that all required actions have been taken by the institution and the program review is being closed. A copy of the Program Review Report will be enclosed with the letter.Program Review Guide for Institutions9-2 Program Review Guide 2017Instructions for retention of records related to the program review will be included in the FPRD. FPRD if Further Action Is Required An FPRD requiring further action will be issued when the institution must take some action to resolve one or more of the findings. This action may include making student level adjustments in COD and/or G5, and/or paying liabilities. The FPRD will either indicate that the program review is closed (if the only required action is payment of liabilities to the Department), or that the program review will be closed upon receipt of documentation that the re - quired action has been completed. The cover letter used to transmit the FPRD to the institution includes important information. It indicates that the purpose of the FPRD is to: (1) identify liabilities resulting from the findings of the Program Review Report, (2) provide instructions for payment of liabilities to the Department and others, if appropriate, and (3) notify the insti - tution of its right to appeal. Language to close the program review is included if any liabilities owed to parties other than the Department have been paid and any student level adjustments have been made in COD and/or G5. If the institution owes liabilities to parties other than the Department (i.e., lenders, students, parents, etc.) or if student lev - el adjustments must be made in COD and/or G5 as part of the required actions, the program review will be closed when the reviewers have verified that the required payments and/or adjustments have been made. Instructions for filing an appeal of any monetary liabilities will be included in the cover letter. In addition, language regarding a pos - sible referral to the Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group (AAASG) will be included if appropriate, and instructions for retention of records related to the program review will be provided. The FPRD Report typically will be structured as follows: Cover Page Table of Contents Institutional Information Scope of Review Findings and Final Determinations Resolved Findings Resolved Findings with Comments (Optional) Findings with Final Determinations Summary of Liabilities Payment Instructions Appendices and Enclosures Report Cover Page Each FPRD will have a Report Cover Page. The Report Cover Page will identify the institution and the team that conducted the program review. Table of Contents Each FPRD will contain a Table of Contents. The Table of Contents provides the page numbers of sections and individual findings within the FPRD. Institutional Information The institutional information section of the FPRD is provided to give the reader a snapshot view of the institu - tion. It includes the institution's name, address, type (public, private nonprofit, proprietary), highest level of offer - ing, accrediting agency, current student enrollment, percent of students receiving Title IV aid, Title IV aid disbursed by program, and the three most recent cohort default rates for the applicable loan programs.Chapter 9\u2014Final Program Review Determination and Followup Program Review Guide 20179-3 Scope of Review The scope section gives the focus of the program review, how the liabilities were determined, and a disclaimer that the program review is not all-inclusive. Findings and Final Determinations For each finding from the Program Review Report, the reviewers will analyze the institution's response to deter - mine if the finding has been corrected and if liabilities exist. The Findings and Final Determinations section of the FPRD presents the findings sorted into the following categories based on their final status: Resolved Findings Resolved Findings with Comments Findings with Final Determinations Resolved Findings are findings that the institution has taken the corrective actions to resolve and no further ac - tion is required. The findings are identified by number only and do not contain the details described in the Program Review Report. These findings are considered closed and are not mentioned further in the FPRD. Resolved Findings with Comments are findings that, while the institution has taken the corrective actions nec - essary to resolve them and no further action is required, are presented with related recommendations or additional information. These findings will include the following elements: 1) the original finding from the Program Review Report (including Title, Citation, Noncompliance and Required Action (in italics)), 2) a summary of the institu - tion's response to the finding and the Department's comments, and 3) the Department's final determination for the finding. Each finding, response, and final determination is listed separately. The institution should read and consider any comments made by the Department. Findings with Final Determinations are findings that contain liabilities or require action by the institution. These findings will include the following elements: (1) the original finding from the Program Review Report (in - cluding Title, Citation, Noncompliance and Required Action (in italics)), (2) a summary of the institution's re - sponse to the finding, and (3) the Department's Final Determination for the finding. Each finding, response, and final determination is listed separately. If a Program Review Report was not issued for any reason, the structure of the findings is simply: Title, Citation, Noncompliance, and Final Determination. If the final determination contains student specific liabilities , whether or not they resulted from a full file re - view, the liability for each individual student is identified either in the text of the finding or in an attached appendix. If a student is listed in the final determination for multiple findings, the final determination for each finding will reference the other finding, and will explain how the liability is being calculated. Any duplicate liabilities will also be identified in the Summary of Liabilities section of the FPRD and removed from the total liabilities due from the institution. When the finding rests on examination of a statistical sample , the reviewers may use the liabilities from the sample in order to project the liabilities for the population from which the sample was drawn unless the institu - tion opts to perform a full file review. Details of how the projected liabilities were calculated will be provided in the FPRD.Program Review Guide for Institutions9-4 Program Review Guide 2017Summary of Liabilities The purpose of this section of the FPRD is to summarize the liabilities owed to the Department, students, and/or the institution's accounts. It is possible that the same funds paid to a student may be identified as a liability in more than one finding. If such duplicate liabilities exist the summary of liabilities table in the FPRD will include two charts for presenting the liabilities; Actual Liabilities by Finding-Including Duplicate Liabilities, and Established Liabilities-Duplicate Liabili - ties Removed. In this case, an explanation of how duplicate liabilities are treated and how the repayment amounts are determined will be included. If there are no duplicated liabilities, only the Established Liabilities\u2014Duplicate Liabilities Removed chart will be presented. The summary of liabilities table will include a section showing adjustments made for any additional liabilities established for interest and special allowance, excess cash, and administrative cost allowance. The summary of liabilities table will provide a total of how much is to be returned to each entity and a total of the adjustments required to current year Pell Grant student records in COD, if applicable. If the institution has repaid all liabilities or made the required COD adjustments prior to the issuance of the FPRD and provided the ap - propriate documentation, the FPRD will acknowledge that fact. The Summary of Liabilities section will also include an explanation of any liabilities calculated using the estimat - ed actual loss formula, any projected liabilities, and any liabilities established for all funds disbursed. Payment Instructions A Repayment Instructions section is included in the FPRD, if it establishes that there are liabilities to be paid, and if the institution has not filed for bankruptcy protection. The purpose of this section is to provide payment in - structions and the terms related to the payments (e.g., when the payment is due, how the institution can request a payment plan, etc.). Payment instructions for payments to the Department will vary depending on the particular Title IV, HEA program(s) to which funds must be repaid, and the liability amount. If the FPRD requires the institution to make upward adjustments in COD due to underawards, Pell Grant Op - erations will open the account for changes and then close the account after the institution has made the required changes. If the institution is required to repay liabilities to parties other than the Department (for example, Pell Grant li - abilities that must be repaid to the Pell Grant account of the institution via student-level adjustments in COD, or funds that must be returned to the holder of a student loan or directly to the student and/or parent borrower) the institution will be required to provide proof that such payments were made. If the return of funds to the institution's federal accounts causes excess cash in those accounts, the excess cash must be returned to G5 as well. The institution is responsible for returning those funds, regardless of the amount. If the SPD is aware that the institution has filed for bankruptcy, the FPRD will acknowledge the bankruptcy and identify the liabilities. However, the payment instructions will be omitted.Chapter 9\u2014Final Program Review Determination and Followup Program Review Guide 20179-5 Appendices and Enclosures An FPRD may contain appendices and enclosures to provide additional information to the institution. Appen - dices may be used to provide the following: student sample details for loan discharge liabilities calculation spreadsheets FEDWIRE form and instructions other documentation If student-level testing was conducted, the student sample list from the original program review report will be included with the FPRD as a reference for the institution. If a file review or other documentation provided by the in - stitution results in the requirement that funds be repaid for students not listed in the original student sample, those students will be identified in a separate appendix. If the institution has been assessed a liability for loan discharges, details for the loan discharge liabilities will be included. FPRDs, where applicable, will contain as appendices the calculation spreadsheets for interest and special allow - ance (cost of funds) liabilities, estimated actual loss liabilities, and liability projections. If the liability to be repaid to the Department is more than $100,000, the FEDWIRE form and instructions will be included. Any other documentation referenced in the FPRD as additional information will also be attached as an appen - dix. DEPARTMENT FOLLOWUP IF FPRD IS RETURNED UNDELIVERABLE If the FPRD is returned to the SPD office marked undeliverable, the SPD will attempt to identify a different ad - dress to which to send the FPRD. Note that the address of record is the address the institution provides to the De - partment in its E-App and that the institution is required to submit a change in address to the Department no later than 10 days after the change occurs (see 34 C.F.R \u00a7 600.21). If the FPRD is successfully re-delivered, the institution has 45 days from the date the FPRD is received to file an appeal. INSTITUTION RESPONSE TO FPRD, IF REQUIRED In some cases, institutions are required to provide proof of payment of liabilities or other follow-up documenta - tion in response to the FPRD. If the institution is liable for funds owed to the Department, they must be sent according to the instructions pro - vided in the FPRD. Failure to pay as required, or file a timely appeal, may result in the Department using an admin - istrative offset to collect the funds owed.Program Review Guide for Institutions9-6 Program Review Guide 2017If the institution is liable for an amount that must be paid to the holder of an FFEL, the institution must provide proof that the liabilities have been paid and that the student has been notified of the return of funds. Instructions regarding the acceptable documentation to be submitted (i.e., the front and back of the cancelled checks or proof of the Electronic Funds Transfer transaction) will be included in the FPRD. If the institution owes student specific liabilities for Pell Grant or Direct Loan funds, the institution may be re - quired to adjust each applicable student's disbursement record in COD. If the adjustments result in a negative bal - ance (i.e., the funds drawn from G5 exceed the institution's authorization for the award year), the institution must return the amount of the negative balance electronically to their account in G5. The institution must provide proof that all applicable disbursement records have been adjusted (e.g., a copy of the adjustment from COD) and proof of payment to G5 as instructed in the FPRD. FINAL PROGRAM REVIEW DETERMINATION CLOSEOUT LETTER A Final Program Review Determination Closeout Letter will be issued generally within 20 calendar days of re - ceipt of the institution's response to the FPRD, if the response contains all of the required documentation. If the institution does not provide the required information within the time frame specified in the FPRD, the re - viewers will typically followup with the institution. The letter will be addressed to the President/CEO/Owner and will serve to close the program review. If the institution does not provide the required information because it is filing an appeal for any of the findings, a Closeout Letter will not be issued. APPEAL OF MONETARY LIABILITIES Under 34 CFR Part 668, Subpart H, an institution may file a written appeal if it disagrees with the monetary li - abilities established in an FPRD. To preserve its appeal rights, the institution must file the appeal within 45 days of its receipt of the FPRD. The FPRD contains detailed instructions to the institution for filing an appeal. The institution appeals by submitting a written request for review to the Director of AAASG. The request must state the basis for the appeal and include any documents that the institution may wish to present in support of its case. The Department will defer collection action on the appealed portion of the liability during the appeal process. However, the institution is expected to pay any non-appealed liabilities. If an institution submits a timely appeal, AAASG will review the documentation provided. If the documentation satisfactorily resolves the noncompliance that created the contested liabilities, AAASG will notify the institution in writing of the outcome. However, if contested liabilities still exist, AAASG will forward the appeal to the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). The hearing process will continue until a settlement between the institution and the Department is reached, the case is withdrawn, or the hearing official issues an initial decision. There are no man - dated time frames for this portion of the appeal process. Chapter 9\u2014Final Program Review Determination and Followup Program Review Guide 20179-7 Either party can appeal the hearing official's initial decision to the Secretary within 30 days of receipt of the deci - sion. There are no mandated time frames for the Secretary to make a decision. (In addition, there are other appeal avenues that extend beyond the appeal to the Secretary.) In most cases, OHA notifies the institution of the outcome; otherwise, AAASG will do so. A closeout letter will not be issued by the SPD. If the outcome is in favor of the Department, the Department will resume billing on the liabilities.Program Review Guide 2017A-1AMAppendix School Participation Division Contacts School Participation Division\u2014Northeast New Y ork/Boston Team Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey, New Y ork, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands New York, NY 646-428-3750 Boston, MA 617-289-0133 Philadelphia Team DC, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia Philadelphia, PA 215-656-6442 School Participation Division\u2014South-Central Atlanta Team Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina Atlanta, GA 404-974-9303 Kansas City Team Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, and Tennessee Kansas City, MO 816-268-0410 Dallas Team Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas Dallas, TX 214-661-9490 School Participation Division\u2014Northwest Chicago Team Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin Chicago, IL 312-730-1511 Denver Team Colorado, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming Denver, CO 303-844-3677 San Francisco/Seattle Team Alaska, American Samoa, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Ne - vada, Palau, Marshall Islands, N.

FDIRECT DISTANCE EDUCATIONProgram Review Guide 2017E-1EMAppendix FERPA Disclosure The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) sets limits on the disclosure of personally identifiable information from institution records, and defines the rights of the student to review and request a change to the records. Institutions are required to maintain a record in a student's file listing to whom personally identifiable informa - tion was disclosed and the legitimate interests the parties had in obtaining the information. Generally, institutions must have written permission from the parent (if dependent) or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows institutions to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR \u00a7 99.31): Institution officials with legitimate educational interest Other institutions to which a student is transferring Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the institution Accrediting organizations To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law Disclosures may be made to authorized representatives of the Department for audit, evaluation, and enforce - ment purposes. \"Authorized representatives\" includes employees of the Department, such as employees of the Office of Federal Student Aid, the Office of Postsecondary Education, the Office for Civil Rights, and the National Center for Education Statistics, as well as firms that are under contract to the Department to perform certain ad - ministrative functions or studies. Except as noted below, the institution must keep a record of each request for access and each disclosure of per - sonally identifiable student information. The record must identify the parties who requested the information and their legitimate interest in the information. This record must be maintained in the student's file as long as the educa - tional records themselves are kept. For instance, if student files are requested by Department reviewers in the course of a program review, the institution must document in each student's file that the student's records were disclosed to representatives of the Department. The easiest way for the institution to do this is to photocopy a statement to this effect and include it in each student's file. The following example may be used by the institution: These financial aid records were disclosed to representatives of the U.S. Department of Education's School Eligibil - ity Service Group, on (Month/Day/Year) to determine compliance with financial aid requirements, under 34 CFR \u00a7 99.31(a)(4).Program Review Guide for InstitutionsE-2 Program Review Guide 2017The institution should ask the reviewers if any re-disclosure is anticipated. When re-disclosure is anticipated, the additional parties to whom the information will be disclosed must be included in the record of the original disclo - sure. For instance, to continue the example for a program review, the following statement might be added: The School Eligibility Service Group may make further disclosures of this information to the Department's Office of Inspector General, and to the U.S. Department of Justice, under 34 CFR \u00a7 99.33(b). There are some exceptions to the requirement of the institution to keep a record of each request for access and each disclosure of personally identifiable student information. An institution does not have to record instances where the request is made by the parent or eligible student, an institution official who has a legitimate educational interest, a party with written consent from the parent or eligible student, a party seeking directory information, or certain court orders or subpoenas.Program Review Guide 2017F-1 Expedited Final Program Review Determination LetterFMAppendix SAMPLE Date Name of President/CEO/Owner Title Certified Mail Name of Institution Return Receipt Requested Address of Institution City, State ZIP+4 RE: Expedited Final Program Review Determination Letter OPE ID: PRCN: Dear Name of President/CEO/Owner: From Month Day, Y ear, through Month Day, Y ear, Jane Doe conducted a review of Institution Name's admin - istration of the programs authorized pursuant to Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1070 et seq.

Scope of Review The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) conducted a program review at Institution Name from Month Day, Y ear to Month Day, Y ear. The review was conducted by Jane Doe. The focus of the review was to determine Institution Name's compliance with the statutes and federal regulations as they pertain to the insti - tution's administration of Title IV programs. The review consisted of, but was not limited to, an examination of Institution Name's policies and procedures regarding institutional and student eligibility, individual student financial aid and academic files, attendance records, student account ledgers, and fiscal records. A sample of 30 files was identified for review from the YYYY and YYYY (year to date) award years.

Furthermore, it does not relieve Institution Name of its obligation to comply with all of the statutory or regulatory provisions governing the Title IV , HEA programs. This report reflects initial findings. These findings are not final. The Department will issue its final findings in a subsequent Final Program Review Determination letter. C. Findings During the review, several areas of noncompliance were noted. Findings of noncompliance are referenced to the applicable statutes and regulations and specify the actions to be taken by Institution Name to bring operations of the financial aid programs into compliance with the statutes and regulations. Finding: Return Calculations Incorrect/Unmade Citation: When a recipient of Title IV assistance withdraws from an institution during a payment period or pe - riod of enrollment in which the recipient began attendance, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV assistance the student earned as of the date the student withdraws. The institution must determine how much aid a student earned by determining how much of the payment period he/she completed and then multiplying that percentage by the amount of Title IV funds the student received or could have received. 34 CFR \u00a7 668.22Appendix G\u2014Program Review Report Program Review Guide 2017G-7 SAMPLEName of Institution OPE ID PRCN Page The Secretary considers that an institution has sufficient cash reserves if the institution returns, in a timely man - ner, unearned Title IV program funds that it is responsible for returning. If an institution fails to return funds in a timely manner for 5% or more of the students identified in an audit or program review sample, the institution must satisfy the reserve standard by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit (LOC) of 25% of the total amount of unearned Title IV program funds that the institution was required to return during the most recently com - pleted fiscal year. 34 CFR \u00a7 668.173 Noncompliance: Institution Name temporarily lost eligibility on MM/DD/YYYY because problems related to moving to a new location caused it to suspend providing instruction. Institution Name was instructed to com - plete R2T4 calculations on all students enrolled as of the date the school lost eligibility. The calculations were performed and the funds were returned. However, these calculations were incorrect. Full-time students at Institution Name usually contract for anywhere from 40 to 45 hours per week. However, institutional officials explained that they used 45 scheduled hours per week in the return calculation worksheets because the institution is open and available to students for 43 hours per week. Students #25, 26, 27, and 30 were enrolled when the school lost eligibility. The scheduled hours used in the re - turn calculation for each of these students are incorrect. Required Action: The institution must recalculate the returns for the aforementioned students to determine if the errors result in additional funds to be returned to the Title IV programs. Due to the high percentage of errors noted during the YYYY-YYYY award year, Institution Name is required to review every return calculation com - pleted during that award year to determine the extent of the errors. D. Recommendations The following is a recommendation based upon observations made by the review team during the program review. Institution Name is not required to provide a response to, nor is Institution Name required to act upon, these recommendations. However, the review team believes that adoption of this recommendation will assist the institution in its administration of Title IV , HEA program funds.Program Review Guide for InstitutionsG-8 Program Review Guide 2017 SAMPLEAppendix A: Student Sample (Award Y ear 1) Student's Name Student's SSN (last four digits only) 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15.

Findings and Final Determinations Findings with Final Determinations The program review report finding(s) requiring further action are summarized below. At the conclusion of each finding is a summary of (Institution Name)'s response to the finding, and the Department's final determination for that finding. Finding 1. Return Calculations Incorrect/Unmade Citation Summary: When a recipient of Title IV assistance withdraws from an institution during a payment period or period of enrollment in which the recipient began attendance, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV assistance the student earned as of the date the student withdraws. The institution must determine how much aid a student earned by determining how much of the payment period he/she completed and then multiplying that percentage by the amount of Title IV funds the student received or could have received. 34 CFR \u00a7 668.22 The Secretary considers that an institution has sufficient cash reserves if the institution returns, in a timely manner, unearned Title IV program funds that it is responsible for returning. If an institution fails to return funds in a timely manner for 5% or more of the students identified in an audit or program review sample, the institution must satisfy the reserve standard by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit (LOC) of 25% of the total amount of unearned Title IV program funds that the institution was required to return during the most recently completed fiscal year. 34 CFR \u00a7 668.173 Noncompliance Summary: (Institution Name) temporarily lost eligibility on Month Day, Year because problems related to moving to a new location caused it to suspend providing instruction. (Institution Name) was instructed to complete R2T4 calculations on all students enrolled as of the date the school lost eligibility. The calculations were performed and the funds were returned. However, these calculations were incorrect. Full-time students at (Institution Name) usually contract for anywhere from 40 to 45 hours per week. However, institutional officials explained that they used 45 scheduled hours per week in the return calculation worksheets because the institution is open and available to students for 43 hours per week.

Required Action Summary: The institution must recalculate the returns for the aforementioned students to deter - mine if the errors result in additional funds to be returned to the Title IV programs. Due to the high percentage of errors noted during the YYYY-YYYY award year, (Institution Name) is required to review every return calculation completed during that award year to determine the extent of the errors.Appendix H\u2014Final Program Review Determination Program Review Guide 2017H-9 SAMPLE(Institution Name)'s Response: (Institution Name) included the required spreadsheet detailing returns previ - ously paid, as well as the amounts of unpaid or improperly paid returns. In addition, (Institution Name) submit - ted the required R2T4 calculations and all supporting documents requested. Final Determination: Each return calculation submitted as part of the file review was examined. The examina - tion resulted in the determination that the institution failed to accurately complete return calculations for several students. The institution is liable for the amount of unpaid returns for each of the following students: Student Number Federal Pell Grant Liability Amount $15.00 *A calculation has been computed to determine the amount of the interest, known as the Cost of Funds, due on the Federal Pell Grant Funds that should have been returned. The total amount of interest is $15.00. Therefore, the total liability to be remitted for this finding is $1450.00. Due to the number of unpaid and late refunds, the institution is required to have on file with the Department an irrevocable Letter of Credit equal to 25% of the total refunds the institution made or should have made during the most recently closed fiscal year (34 CFR \u00a7 668.173(d)).
