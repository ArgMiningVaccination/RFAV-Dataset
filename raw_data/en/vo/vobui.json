Based on Ethylene Glycol blended with patented DeToxTM additive and ASTM D1384 proven corrosion, scale and biological inhibitors. DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze has been especially formulated for use in Refrigeration and HVAC systems to expolit the advantages Ethylene Glycol has over Propylene Glycol, whilst delivering a non toxic solution. Specifically; more efficient heat transfer, easier to pump (especially at low temperatures), less volume for the same freeze protection and cheaper per litre. DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze is miscible with water in all proportions and can protect RAC systems down to -50 \u00b0C depending on concentration. DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze is based on Ethylene Glycol. It has been tested and classified as Non Toxic by an EPA certified laboratory. Previously Propylene Glycol was the only non toxic Glycol available, however with the introduction of the patented DeToxTM additive that is no longer the case. DeToxTM prevents Ethylene Glycol from being metabolised (during digestion) into toxic by-products, which cause kidney failure, blindness and death. Tests carried out on DTX confirmed the toxicity was \"so low that it was impossible to determine and LD50 value\". The DeToxTM additive has very little effect on heat transfer or antifreeze performance. In fact similar volumes of DTX or Ethylene Glycol are required to achieve a specific freeze protection. DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze has improved heat transfer characteristics including lower dynamic viscosity and higher thermal conductivity. For a detailed comparison please refer to the Fluid Performance Chart which is available upon request. DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze contains synergistic corrosion inhibitors to protect metals commonly found in such systems. It has been tested in accordance with BS5117 and found to meet BS6580 and ASTM D1384 corrosion standards. DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze also contains scale and biological inhibitors to help prevent fouling - thus promoting long operational life and high thermal efficiency. DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze mixtures are readily biodegradable (90% over 10 days) and will not remain in the environment or bio-accumulate. All BDIC Glycol products are manufactured in accordance with certified ISO 9001-2008 procedures. DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze is a clear, slightly viscous liquid and mildly sweet to the taste. It is nonpungent however it does have a characteristic aroma. |Density:||1.04 - 1.15 g/cm3 depending on inhibitors| |pH:||7.5 - BSRIA guide BG 29/2012 all pipework systems should be clean and free from biological contamination and debris prior to commissioning. To minimse corrosion, air ingress should be minimised. A pressurised system is best. Determine the total system volume and add DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze to the system according to the minimum operating temperature required (see table below). The minimum dose of DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze should not be less than 22% of the system volume and the maximum does not normally exceed 60%. We recommend the use of deionised, distilled or UltraPure water for this dilution. Avoid water containing high levels of calcium salts or chlorides [CI-]. When measuring the percentage concentration of DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze in solution we recommend the use of a recently calibrated refractometer. Please refer to the associated product Safety Data Sheet which is available on request. 3 years when stored in sealed containers out of direct sunlight. 25, 205 & 1000 Litre IBC's and bulk tankers. DTX: High Efficiency Non Toxic Glycol Antifreeze can also be supplied as a ready-to-use solution. ensure end users and distributors receive the full benefit of working with a specialist supplier that offers: BIJUR DELIMON INTERNATIONAL LONDON EN3 7XU T: "}
