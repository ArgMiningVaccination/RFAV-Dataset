Basic teachings within TCM demonstrate the profound interconnectedness of our existence, offering an in-depth, holistic perspective of the individual in relationship to the laws and patterns of nature. TCM emphasizes the use of specific treatments and practices to harmonize our physical, mental and emotional states, and align with nature's rhythms, to bring about optimal health and wellness. Over the last two millennia, TCM has refined some of the most sophisticated, safe and effective therapeutic practices that offer profound benefits for body, mind and spirit. The core treatment modalities in TCM include acupuncture, moxabustion (the burning of mugwort herb around acupuncture points), nutrition and lifestyle practices, specific exercises, pressure point and massage techniques, and herbal therapy. TCM is well known for its extensive pharmacopoeia of herbal medicines which continue to earn recognition in published peer-reviewed literature. "}
