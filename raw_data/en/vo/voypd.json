In India, every family has their own special beauty recipe that has been passed down through generations of women. So, if you are looking to make a switch from harsh skincare products to healing, traditional beauty routines that are being practised in the country since aeons, here's help. Aishwarya Sawarna Nir, founder of Global Beauty Secrets, a brand that combines ancient skincare wisdom with scientific research to create products that nourish the skin, says, 'People have begun to take pride in their heritage while at the same time they are also increasingly open to explore newer cultures. As a country, we have always been bursting with cultural plurality and are accommodative of many layers of identity, the reason why we have spun a strong social fabric that is extremely inclusive of many traditions, languages, cultures etc. So, even though as a generation we have access to an easier lifestyle, we are actually looking to our grandmothers and other ancient traditions for answers to our lifestyle,' she says. So, here is her pick of 7 Indian beauty ingredients that work like a charm! ROSE WATER: \"Last but not the least , fabled to be invented by the Indian Mughal Queen Mehrunissa or Nur Jahan, the rose water has beautiful toning properties for the skin and works with all skin types including the sensitive skin.\" SHARE TURMERIC: \"Any compilation on Indian beauty ingredients would be incomplete without referring to turmeric - an ingredient to which an entire ceremony called haldi is dedicated during Indian marriages.

It is very potent when it comes to removing scars and a few strands mixed with milk work wonders as a healing moisturizer (and a delicious drink too!)\" SHARE COPPER AND BRONZE BEAUTY TOOLS: \"Heavy metals such as copper (tamba) are associated with sun in Ayurveda and Kansa is one of the most nourishing alloy of copper and zinc for the skin. Using a facial tool made of these heavy metals is great for lymphatic drainage from the face and improves skin health. While this isn't part of the traditional cleansing, toning and moisturising routine, it can be a great addition to it.\" SHARE BESAN: \"Every Indian woman is familiar with besan. This natural clay is very alkalizing and can be used directly on damp skin as a cleanser. It is more portent when used with a few pinches of turmeric, yoghurt and honey.\" SHARE GHEE : \"I am a huge believer in the power of fats, not just to be used topically but also consumed orally. And, ghee is an excellent moisturizer for your skin inside out! During my Ayurveda course I learnt to make the Shatdhautaghritam or '100 times washed ghee with copper utensils'. I often use this salve for very dry patches on my skin or as a healing ointment for skin related injuries. I also consume 1-2 tablespoon of warm ghee on an empty stomach in the morning to nourish "}
