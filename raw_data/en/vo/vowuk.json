This study was a conceptual replication inFinland of a study by Pivetti et al. (2021). Some 529 Finnish participants responded to a self-report questionnaire during the partial lockdown in Finland in spring 2020. The hypothesized relationships between variables of interest were integrated in a serial multiple mediation model via structural equation modelling. Results showed that endorsing generalconspiracy beliefs directly predicted (1) general attitudes toward vaccines and (2) COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and indirectly predicted (3) attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines via the serial mediation of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and general attitudes toward vaccines. As for the antecedents of beliefs in conspiracy theories, political orientation andmoral purity predicted beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Trust in science was inversely related to general conspiracy beliefs. As for the consequences of conspiracy beliefs, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs directly predicted support for governmental restrictions (negatively) and the perception of informational contamination (positively). Keywords conspiracy beliefs, vaccines, COVID-19 vaccinations, public health, trust in science, Finland Received 19 March 2021; accepted 27 July 2021 Introduction \"Vaccines are a medical marvel. They are credited with saving more lives than any other human innovationafter clean water. ...And yet many Europeans are shunning the shots\" (Cendrowic, 2021, para. 1). Many are concerned that having a vaccine does not automatically imply it will be used (e.g., Detoc et al.,2020; Neumann-B \u20acohme et al., 2020; Robertson et 2021; Robinson et al., 2021; Sallam et al., 2021).Nevertheless, to bring the novel coronavirus under con-trol, the widespread use of preventive measures such as vaccination is required. Since the success of the COVID-19 vaccination program will have majorhealth and economic consequences, it is important tounderstand the factors predicting people's attitudestoward COVID-19 vaccinations. Among these factors, conspiracy beliefs are related to reduced compliance with health protective behaviors such as frequenthand-washing and social distancing (e.g., Allingtonet al., 2020; Bierwiaczonek et al., 2020; Imhoff & Lamberty, 2020; Swami & Barron, 2020), and to COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy (e.g., Bertin et al.,2020; Earnshaw et al., 2020; Romer & Jamieson, 2020; Ruiz & Bell, 2021). However, empirical evidence on the antecedents and consequences of conspiracybeliefs is scattered throughout the literature. During the first Italian lockdown in April-May 2020, Pivetti and colleagues (2021) explored, via struc-tural equation modelling (SEM), both the antecedents of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, such as the role of 1Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Bergamo, Italy 2Department of Social Sciences, Social Psychology, University of Eastern Finland, Finland Corresponding author: Monica Pivetti, University of Bergamo, Bergamo 24129, Italy.

Results showed that the atti-tudes toward the vaccines mediated the relationshipbetween COVID conspiracy beliefs and attitudestoward the COVID-19 vaccine. In the current study, we aimed to conceptually replicate the study by Pivetti et al. (2021) to confirm prior hypotheses, usingestablished measures and analytical models al., 2010; Stroebe & Strack, 2014; Troyer et al.,2019), drawing together existing findings on the ante-cedents and consequences of conspiracy beliefs in acomprehensive model. Furthermore, extending Pivettiet al.'s work (2021), the relationships between variablesof interest were examined in a new setting, that is Finland. The hypothesized relationships between vari- ables were integrated in a serial multiple mediationmodel, explored via SEM. In Finland, the different factors behind vaccine hes- itancy sparked public concern. Even though Finns gen-erally have strong confidence in the safety of vaccines,the vaccination attitudes of the Finnish public have been studied little in the past (e.g., V \u20acaliverronen et al., 2019). Recently, Hammer et al. (2021) notedhow vaccine acceptance in Finland declined slightlyjust before the COVID-19 vaccinations began.Hammer et al. (2021), as well as Karlsson et al.(2021), emphasized the role of perceived vaccinesafety as a predictor of Finnish vaccination intentions.Soveri et al. (2021) emphasized the association betweentrust in information sources and the response to official guidelines during the pandemic by the Finnish public. This present study extended these results by analyzingattitudes and conspiracy beliefs in Finland in the earlystages of the pandemic. Data collection in Italy and inFinland was run in approximately the same period inspring 2020, during the first lockdown, when theEuropean public had no information about when andwhether a safe COVID-19 vaccine would be available. Impact of conspiracy beliefs on attitudes and behaviors In recent years, the proliferation of beliefs in conspir- acy theories has grown, as well as the number of studieson this topic in the field of psychology (e.g., Douglaset al., 2019; Goreis & Voracek, 2019). Beliefs in con- spiracy theories can be defined as beliefs in the presence of a \"vast, insidious, preternaturally effective interna-tional conspiratorial network a most fiendish character\" (Hofstadter, 1966,p. 14). These beliefs can be also defined as an attemptto explain events that are threatening or inconsistentwith personal expectations for producing someshort-term benefits such as uncertainty reduction (Miller, 2020). Indeed, conspiracy beliefs tend to bemore prevalent in social crisis situations dominated by collective uncertainty and fear (van Prooijen & Douglas, 2017), as in the case of the COVID-19 pan-demic. Furthermore, some conspiracy belief typologies are strongly associated with the endorsement of other conspiracy beliefs, even when they seem unrelated (e.g.,Goertzel, 1994; Swami et al., 2011). Evidence suggests that belief in general conspiracy theories unrelated to the health domain (e.g., Moonlandings never happened and any evidence has been fabricated by NASA and the US government) weakens engagement in pro-health behaviors and support forpublic health policies (e.g., Oliver & Wood, 2014).Conspiracy beliefs have been associated with the rejec- tion of scientific consensus around topics of health (Douglas et al., 2019) and with both vaccination hesi-tancy and negative attitudes toward vaccinations (Dunn et al., 2017; Hornsey et al., 2020; Jolley & Douglas, 2014; Tomljenovic et al., 2020). As for COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, Grimes (2021) argued that COVID-19 conspiracy theories, arising from existing conspiracy theories, have propagatedheavily across social media. A non-exhaustive list ofcommon themes has included the following: (1) COVID-19 is a hoax or, alternatively, deliberately engi- neered (e.g., Sutton & Douglas, 2020a); (2) COVID-19is a pretext for a mass vaccination program as a means to microchip people with vaccines (e.g., Miller, 2020); and (3) COVID-19 is caused by 5G electromagneticradiation (e.g., Bruns et al., 2020). According to a recent poll, three in ten American people believe that COVID-19 was created in a lab (Pew Research Center,2020). Relatedly, many also believe that Bill Gates cre-ated the virus to either use the vaccines to implant tracking devices in people or to capitalize on the vac- cination (Lovelace, 2020); some have also asserted thatthe pandemic is part of Gates's depopulation plans (Kelion, 2020). In the United States, Romer and Jamieson (2020) argued that beliefs prevalent early inthe pandemic concerned suspicions that the pandemic was the result of malign actions by either the Chinese government or the pharmaceutical industry, or thatsome in the US government were exaggerating thedanger of COVID-19 to undermine the President of the United States. Furthermore, beliefs in conspiracy theories have been associated with distrust toward authorities (Freed et al., 2011; Darwin et al., 2011; Swami et al., 2011). COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs have also beenassociated with a lower rate of compliance with public health guidance (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2020; Stecula & Pickup, 2021) and health protective behaviors(Bierwiaczonek et al., 2020; Swami & Barron, 2020).2 Journal of Pacific Rim PsychologyIndeed, conspiracy beliefs were associated with mistak- en fears about the nature and effects of COVID-19 vac-cinations and an unwillingness to vaccinate (e.g.,Earnshaw et al.,2020; Hornsey et al., 2020; Romer In a national probability survey of USadults, Romer and Jamieson (2020) found that belief inCOVID-19-related conspiracy beliefs was inverselyrelated to both preventive behaviors (e.g., mask wear-ing) and future vaccination intentions regarding thevirus. As a matter of fact, conspiracy beliefs concerningCOVID-19 also weakened trust in governmentresponses to the COVID-19 crisis (Georgiou et al.,2020). Moreover, holding more conspiracy beliefs wasrelated to less adherence to containment-related behav-ior, both directly and indirectly, via decreased politicaltrust (Kari /C19c&M e d-edovi /C19c, 2021). These results suggest how COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs can have seriousconsequences on both attitudes and health-relatedbehaviors (e.g., attitudes toward vaccines and govern-ment information, intention to vaccinate, and compli-ance with government restrictions; e.g., Douglas, 2021;Pagliaro et al., 2021). Many recent studies have shownthat conspiracy beliefs are related to reducing the inten-tion to vaccinate against COVID-19 (e.g., Bertin et al.,2020; Earnshaw et al., 2020; Romer & Jamieson, 2020).In Indonesia, controlling for demographics and impactsof the pandemic, strong conspiracy beliefs, and trust inconventional media were the only independent determi-nants of vaccine acceptance (Wirawan et al., 2021). In anationwide survey in the USA, the rejection of vaccineconspiracies was a significant predictor of vaccination intent (Ruiz & Bell, 2021), while in Jordan, vaccine con- spiracy beliefs were associated with a significantlyhigher level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (Sallamet al., 2021). However, contrasting results were alsofound. For instance, the hypothesis that people whohave stronger COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were lesswilling to take a vaccine against COVID-19 was not supported in a sample of the Finnish public (Soveri et al., 2021). In other research, conspiracy beliefs were strongly related to distrust in information provided by the gov- ernment (Soveri et al., 2021; Wirawan et al., 2021). For instance, conspiracy beliefs were indirectly related tocompliance with official COVID-19 guidelines viatrust in government officials delivering information on preventive measures (Banai et al., 2021). Specifically, informational contamination was definedas the perception that information circulating in the media is biased and untrustworthy (Conway & Repke, 2019; Conway et al., 2020). We predicted thatgeneral and COVID-related conspiracy beliefs would be positively related to the perception of informational contamination, that is, the perception that informationcirculating in the media is not trustworthy. On the basis of the aforementioned literature, we specifically pre- dicted the following (see Figure 1): H1. Conspiracy beliefs would negatively predict both attitudes toward vaccines in general ( H1a) and toward COVID-19 vaccines in particular ( H1b); moreover, they would be negatively related to support for govern- mental restrictions ( H1c) and positively related to informational contamination ( H1d). Finally, as some conspiracy belief typologies were found to be strongly associated with the endorsement of other seeminglyunrelated conspiracy beliefs, we predicted that general conspiracy beliefs would positively predict COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs ( H1e). H2. COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs would follow the same pattern as general conspiracy beliefs; theywould negatively predict both attitudes toward vac-cines in general ( H2a) and toward COVID-19 vaccines Figure 1. Hypothesized model.Pivetti et al. 3in particular ( H2b); moreover, they would be negative- ly related to support for governmental restrictions(H2c) and positively related to informational contam- ination ( H2d). As attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine could be related to the attitude/hesitancy toward vaccines in general, the following hypothesis was put forward: H3.Attitudes toward vaccines in general would be pos- itively related to attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Factors associated with conspiracy beliefs and vaccine hesitancy Research has also demonstrated that political factors are associated with conspiracy beliefs (Douglas et al., 2019). For instance, some studies have revealed that extreme political (left or right) orientations were asso-ciated with the endorsement of conspiracy beliefs (Krouwel et al., 2017; van Prooijen et al., 2015). Thus, conspiracy beliefs are present on both sides ofthe political spectrum and are prevalent at the extremes of a bipolar continuum (Sutton & Douglas, 2020b). In the USA, Jamieson and Albarrac /C19n (2020) found that conspiracy beliefs were associated with the use of socialmedia (e.g., Facebook) and conservative media (e.g., Fox News). Furthermore, research suggests that political conser- vativism is related to the endorsement of climate change denial in a US sample (McCright & Dunlap, 2011). Compared to liberals and moderates, faith inscience declined amongst conservatives over a 35-year period, resulting in the group having the lowest level of trust in science in 2010 (Gauchat, 2012). In some stud-ies, conservative orientations were also negatively relat- ed to vaccine acceptance (Baumgaertner et al., 2018; Rutjens et al., 2018; Sarathchandra et al., 2018).However, other studies found that political orientationwas not related to vaccine acceptance (Kahan, 2015; Romer & Jamieson, 2020). For instance, Romer and Jamieson (2020) found that even though the adoptionof preventive behaviors was predicted by political ori- entation, the intention to vaccinate was less related to this factor. However, conservatives were generallymore sensitive to the threat of disease (Altemeyer, 1996; Duckitt & Sibley, 2010) than liberals, and this could mean that conservatives were motivated todownplay the severity of threat, leading to vaccinationrefusal (Conway et al., 2021). In the USA, Republicans have shown a negative trend in attitudes and intentions toward the COVID-19 vaccine, whereas the attitudesand intentions of Democrats have remained largelystable (Fridman et al., 2021). Therefore, the following prediction was made: H4.Political conservatism would be negatively associ- ated with faith in science ( H4a) and positively associ- ated with general conspiracy beliefs H4b) and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs ( H4c); moreover, politi- cal conservatism would be negatively associated withboth attitudes toward vaccines in general ( H4d) and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines in particular (H4e). Research has found that moral ideology negatively predicts trust in science (e.g., McCright et al., 2013;Rutjens et al., 2018). Moral reasoning can also play asignificant role in conspiracy beliefs, with binding moral foundations positively related to conspiracy beliefs (Leone et al., 2019). Furthermore, previousresearch has suggested that moral purity was an impor- tant psychological predictor of vaccine hesitancy (Amin et al., 2017; Betsch et al., 2018; Callaghanet al., 2019; Rutjens et al., 2018). According to the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT\u2014Graham et al., 2009), moral purity describes individuals' concern forand interest in the control of impulses and desires (i.e.,purity/sanctity moral foundations), which is connected to many conservative and religious moralities with an emphasis on group-binding loyalty (Di Battista et al.,2018, 2020; Graham & Haidt, 2012). In other research, endorsement of moral principles of fairness and care (vs. loyalty and authority) was related to trust inscience, which, in turn, predicted prescribed anddiscretionary COVID-related behavioral intentions (Pagliaro et al., 2021). Research on moral foundations suggests that people with high levels of moral purityavoid individuals, objects, and experiences that violate a sense of sanctity or self-control, or that induce disgust (Clifford & Wendell, 2016; Koleva et al., 2012).Furthermore, people with high levels of moral purity fear biological contamination and perceive the injec- tion of disease antigens as a negative corruption ofthe body's integrity (Clay, 2017; Clifford & Wendell,2016; Hornsey et 2018; Koleva et al., 2012). Therefore, we predicted: H5.Moral purity would negatively predict faith in sci- ence ( H5a) and positively predict both general conspir- acy beliefs ( H5b) and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (H5c); moreover, moral purity would be negatively related to attitudes toward vaccines in general ( H5d) and toward COVID-19 vaccines in particular ( H5e). Another factor associated with conspiracy beliefs and vaccine hesitancy could be individuals' faith ortrust in science. Some studies found that conspiracy4 Journal of Pacific Rim Psychologybeliefs tended to be inversely related to faith in science (e.g., Lewandowsky et al., 2013). For instance,Lamberty and Imhoff (2018) found that conspiracybeliefs were associated with a preference foralternative medicines over evidence-based, biomedicaltreatments. Trust in science and trust in authorities were studied together as they make reference to public trust in dif-ferent sources of information, that is, scientific researchand authorities (e.g., Pagliaro et al., 2021). Public trustin the government's ability to manage the pandemicwas crucial as trust underpinned public attitudes andbehaviors at a precarious time for public health (e.g.,Fancourt et al., 2020). For instance, using mobilitydata at the regional level in Europe, Bargain andAminjonov (2020) found that higher political trustwas associated with a larger reduction in non-essential mobility, as requested by the implementationof containment policies. Research suggests that distrust in authorities (such as health professionals, pharmaceutical companies andlawmakers), as well as general distrust in science, wasalso associated with vaccine hesitancy (Bedford, 2014;Camargo & Grant, 2015; Jolley & Douglas, 2014).Testing a model of COVID-19 risk perception andtrust in science, Plohl and Musil (2020) showed thatboth factors independently predicted compliance withCOVID-19 prevention guidelines. As well as this, Plohand Musil found that political conservatism, religiousorthodoxy and conspiracy ideation did not directlyaffect compliance with COVID-19 prevention guide-lines but did so indirectly through trust in science. In their work, Jennings and colleagues (2021) revealed that participants who mistrusted the government werealso more hesitant toward the COVID-19 vaccine.Pagliaro and colleagues (2021) found that trust in thegovernment and trust in science predicted adherence toprescribed (e.g., handwashing) and discretionarybehaviors (e.g., donating to charity) during the pan-demic, in a 23-country study. In addition, informational contamination has been found to predict the likelihood of opposing govern-mental and civilian action on climate change, rainforest protection and recycling (Conway et al., 2020; Conway & Repke, 2019). In this research, we predicted that theresearch participants' degree of faith in science couldaffect support for vaccines in general and COVID-19vaccines in particular and could be inversely related toconspiracy beliefs. Moreover, we predicted that faith inscience could be positively related to support for gov-ernmental restrictions during the pandemic. Even if nostudy has explored this relationship to date, we pre-dicted that faith in science would be negatively relatedto the perception of informational contamination.Considering the aforementioned literature, we made the following predictions: H6.Faith in science would positively predict attitudes toward vaccines in general ( H6a), and COVID-19 vac- cines in particular ( H6b), and would negatively predict conspiracy beliefs ( H6c) and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs ( H6d); moreover, it would be positively related to support for governmental restrictions ( H6e) and negatively related to the perception of informational contamination ( H6f). Finally, we predicted that support for governmental restrictions would be related to COVID-19 vaccine hes-itancy, with those who were more supportive of restric-tions also being more in favor of the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, the perception of informational contamination would be related to attitudes towardthe COVID-19 vaccine. In Finland, Soveri and col- leagues (2021) found that distrust in information pro- vided by the government was the strongest predictor ofCOVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, we predicted: H7.Support for governmental restrictions would pos- itively predict positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines ( H7). H8. The perception of informational contamination would negatively predict attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines ( H8). All these hypotheses were integrated in the serial multiple mediation model presented in Figure 1. The study by Pivetti and colleagues (2021) tested this model and related hypotheses with a sample of 590 Italian participants during the first Italian lockdown in April 2020, when no vaccine was available. The finalmodel is shown in Figure 2. As for the antecedents of general conspiracy beliefs, results showed that right- wing political orientation negatively predicted faith inscience and positively predicted both general conspiracybeliefs and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. In addition, endorsing moral purity values predicted less faith in sci- ence and stronger negative attitudes toward COVID-19vaccines, but was unrelated to attitudes toward vaccines in general, general conspiracy beliefs, or COVID-19 con- spiracy beliefs. While faith in science negatively pre-dicted general and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, itpositively predicted support for governmental restric- tions and negatively predicted the perception of infor- mational contamination. Faith in science also stronglypredicted a positive general attitude toward vaccines. General conspiracy beliefs positively predicted COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs as well as support forgovernmental restrictions, and negatively predictedPivetti et al. 5attitudes toward vaccines. There was no prediction made for informational contamination. COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs negatively predicted support for gov-ernmental restrictions and positively predicted the per-ception of informational contamination with reference to conspiracy beliefs. While COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs negatively predicted attitudes toward vaccines,they did not directly predict attitudes toward COVID- vaccines. The findings from Pivetti et al.'s study showed that support for governmental restrictions was negatively related to the perception of informational contamina-tion and positively related to attitudes toward vaccines. However, support for government restrictions and per- ception of informational contamination during thepandemic were unrelated to attitudes toward COVIDvaccines. As expected, general attitudes toward vac- cines were positively related to attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, the attitudestoward the vaccines mediated the relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. In an effort to expand current knowledge on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across countries and cul-tures, the current study conceptually replicates thestudy by Pivetti et al. (2021) in a novel context, that is, Finland. In a conceptual replication, a researcher may confirm the findings of a first study using acompletely different population, methodology, and/or analytical method (Morrison et al., 2010). This way, we aimed to validate previous findings and extend the pro-posed model in terms of external validity. In the pre- sent study, the target population, that is, the Finns, will, by definition, differ from the study populationwith respect to geographical and social conditions. Furthermore, psychological scientists have recently started to reconsider the importance of replications in building a cumulative knowledge base (Brandt et al.,2014; Dekkers et al., 2010). For the purposes of the present study, the measure- ment instrument, hypotheses, and evaluation methodwere borrowed from the study by Pivetti and colleagues (2021). As a basis for hypotheses, in this research we posed the question of whether political orientation and moral purity are antecedents of faith in science and general conspiracy beliefs, which in turn could affectattitudes toward vaccines, and the COVID-19 vaccine specifically. We made the hypothesis that the funda- mental structure of the model used by Pivetti et al.would hold true in a Finnish sample as well, even if the paths from political orientation and moral purity would be affected by the specific Finnish context. Even though Finns have a relatively high degree of trust in science, vaccine acceptance by the public has beenshown to have declined during the COVID-19 pandem- ic (Hammer et al., 2021). However, more information is required on the role of conspiracy beliefs for this behavior (Soveri et al., 2021). Methods Design, procedure, and participants A sample group of 529 Finnish participants aged from 16 to 69 ( M\u00bc29.79; SD\u00bc10.1; n\u00bc426 questionnaire imple- mented using the Google Forms platform. The sample group consisted of individuals who were Figure 2\u2014Final model by Pivetti et al. (2021). Note: All variables were correlated. Unstandardized coefficients were shown in Figure 2.

According to their main occupation, 62.8% of them were students ( n\u00bc332), 30.7% were employed on a full- or part-time basis ( n\u00bc162), 3.6% of the partici- pants stated that they were unemployed ( n\u00bc19), while 1.3% were on maternity leave ( n\u00bc7) and 1.7% retired (n\u00bc9). The procedures, measures and sampling strategy were the same as for the original study. The question- naire was open for three weeks during the partial lock-down in Finland, from late April until mid-May 2020,and the participants were recruited using a conveniencesampling strategy (Etikan et al., 2016). The link to thequestionnaire was sent via email to researchers' con-tacts and shared on social media to reach a wide range of participants. On average, the questionnaire took approximately 20 minutes to complete.Informed consent was obtained from all subjectsinvolved in the study before they started to completethe form. The research method was compliant with theDeclaration of Helsinki. Approval was obtained fromthe Ethical Review Board for Research in Psychology, University of Bologna, in April 2020 (protocol code #312669). Material and measures The questionnaire for this research consisted of ques-tions based on the following: Socio-demographic questions : In this section, partic- ipants reported their gender, age, level of educationand main occupation. Attitudes toward vaccines : For this study, ten items from the Short Version of Vaccine AcceptanceInstrument (Sarathchandra et al., 2018) were translated into Finnish (e.g., \" Vaccines are safe \"); the response scale ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (stronglyagree), where higher values indicated more positiveattitudes toward vaccines. Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines : Four items measured attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., \"If a coronavirus vaccine were available, I would get a shot immediately \"). The response format was a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to7 (strongly agree). For this study, the items were creat-ed ad hoc, based on previous studies (e.g.,Lewandowsky et al., 2013). In this section, highervalues indicated more positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Political orientation : The participants' political ori- entation was assessed on a 7-point scale ranging from 1(Left) to 7 (Right).Moral purity : Three assessments of the moral judg- ment subscale of the Moral Foundation Questionnaire(MFQ) compiled the extent to which participants agreed with moral foundation concepts (see Graham et al., 2009; the Finnish translation was based on thetranslation available on the moralfoundations.org spreadsheet\u2014e.g., \" People should not do things that are disgusting, even if no one is harmed \"). Here, partic- ipants rated moral judgment items using a 7-point scale (from 1 \u00bcnot at all; to 7 \u00bcvery much), where higher values indicated a stronger endorsement of moralpurity concerns. Faith in science : Seven items assessed beliefs in sci- ence (adapted from Farias et al., 2013\u2014e.g., \" Science provides us with a better understanding of the universethan religion \"). The response format was a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree), where higher values indicatedmore positive attitudes toward science. Conspiracy beliefs : Five items measured conspiracy theory beliefs (ITANES, 2016; Mancosu et al., 2017\u2014e.g., \" Moon landings never happened, and the proof has been fabricated by NASA and the US government \"). The response scale ranged from 0 (not plausible at all) to 10(completely plausible), where higher values indicatedhigher levels of conspiracy beliefs. COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs : Four items measured COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (translated and adaptedby Pivetti et al., 2021\u2014e.g., \" The coronavirus has been created artificially in a laboratory \"). The response scale ranged from 0 (not plausible at all) to 10 (completelyplausible), where higher values indicated higher levels of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Support for governmental restrictions : The Governmental Response to Coronavirus Questionnaire\u2014Restriction scale (Conway et al., 2020) was used to measure how the respondents feltabout their government's response to the COVID-19crisis and specifically the support for governmental restrictions (e.g., \" We need strong government officials right now to take action to stop the spread of the dis-ease\"). This was composed of two items. The response format was a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (definitely disagree) to 7 (definitely agree), where highervalues indicated stronger support for governmental restrictions. Informational contamination : The Informational Contamination subscale of the GovernmentalResponse to Coronavirus Questionnaire (Conway et al., 2020; Conway & Repke, 2019) measured the extent to which participants felt that they could nottrust their governments to provide accurate informa- tion during the crisis via two items (e.g., \" I distrust the information I receive about the Coronavirus(COVID-19) from my government \"). The responsePivetti et al. 7format was a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (definitely disagree) to 7 (definitely agree), where higher values indicated a higher level of distrust in informa- tion provided by the government. Data analyses. In order to run descriptive, reliability, correlational, and confirmatory factor analyses, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS and AMOS 25.0) was used. To test the mediational model, a SEM was used with composite scores as measured constructs (EQS6.4; Bentler, 2008). An inspection of Mardia's (1970) coef- ficients suggested significant deviations from multivar- iate to reduce the impact of non-normality, Satorra and Bentler's (2001) scaled estimates were relied on to rescale the standard errors and the Chi- square statistics into the Satorra-Bentler scaled Chi- square (S-B v2) statistic. Fit indexes such as the com- parative fit index (CFI; Bentler, 1990), the root-mean- square error of approximation 2008), and the Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1987) were also adjusted for non-normality by incorporating the S-B v2 into their calculations. In this article, these were referred to as robust estimates (i.e., R-CFI, R-RMSEA, R-AIC). First, the hypothesized mediational model was esti- mated and progressively improved by examining Wald and Lagrange statistics. The Wald test assessed wheth- er sets of parameters specified as free in the model could in fact be simultaneously set to zero without sig- nificant loss in model fit. Conversely, the Lagrange Multiplier Test assessed whether the addition of certain paths or parameters not present in the model would result in a significant increase in model fit (Bentler, 1986). The statistical significance of indirect (ormediational) effects was tested via EQS in which the Sobel method (1987) was implemented. Results Preliminary analyses Descriptive statistics, reliabilities, and correlations between the scales are provided in Table 1. An inspection of the Cronbach's alpha suggested removing an item from the measure of Faith in Science (i.e., \" Overall, modern science does more harm than good \" reverse score; item-total correlation \u00bc.13). The skewness and kurtosis of both of the dimensions of conspiracy beliefs(i.e., general conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 conspir- acy beliefs) and the measure of informational contami- nation were above |2|, indicating a non-normal distribution of the data. A natural log transformation was performed for each of the three dimensions (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). The results indicated that, on average, participants scored low in general con-spiracy belief and COVID-19 conspiracy belief levels, and demonstrated high levels of positive attitude toward vaccines in general and COVID-19 vaccines in particular, and strong faith in science. Moreover, the participants were supportive of the restrictive measures implemented by the government during the pandemic and did not perceive that the information they receivedfrom the media was contaminated. With the exception of support for governmental restrictions, political orienta- tion, and moral purity, the correlations were all signifi- cant and in the expected direction. Furthermore, attitudes toward vaccines in general and COVID-19 vac- cines in particular were strongly related, whereas they were negatively correlated with general conspiracybeliefs and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs.

All the coefficients associated with solid lines are significant, while those associated with dashed lines are not significant beyond the p<.05 level.8 Journal of Pacific Rim PsychologyStructural equation modelling The hypothesized serial mediational model specified in Figure 1 provided an acceptable fit to the Test indicated that the model fit could besignificantly improved by adding one path from polit- ical orientation paths (a) from political orientation to faith in science, (b) from polit-ical orientation to attitudes toward vaccines, and (c) from moral purity to attitudes toward COVID-19 vac- cines were fixed to 0 (not supporting H4a,H4d, and H5e) based on a Wald test, even if path (a) and (c) were significant in Pivetti et al. (2021). The final model was for a significant amount of variance in COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs ( R 2\u00bc.45), in attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines ( R2\u00bc.43), in attitudes toward vaccines ( R2\u00bc.33), and in informational con- tamination ( R2\u00bc.20; see Figure 3). Direct, indirect, and total effects for the final model are reported in Table 2, from which the following results are explained in detail. Conspiracy beliefs strongly predicted COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (b\u00bc.60), and those participants endorsing more con- spiracy beliefs in general were also more willing to endorse specific COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (in line with H1e). As predicted (see H1a), conspiracy beliefs negatively predicted general attitudes toward vaccines both directly ( b\u00bc/C0.17) and indirectly via COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs ( b\u00bc/C0.19), with those participants endorsing conspiracy beliefs endorsing more COVID- 19 conspiracy beliefs and, consequently, being less in favor of vaccinations in general. In addition, conspira-cy beliefs were related to attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines (total b\u00bc/C0.33), mainly indirectly via attitudes toward vaccines ( b\u00bc/C0.10) as well as via the serial mediation of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and atti- tudes toward vaccines ( b\u00bc/C0.11; total indirect b\u00bc/C0.24). Those participants endorsing conspiracy beliefs also endorsed COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and had more negative attitudes toward vaccinationsin general, which in turn predicted being specifically less in favor of COVID-19 vaccinations (supporting H1b). Finally, consistent with the hypotheses ( H1c and H1d) of this study, general conspiracy beliefs were negatively related to support for governmental restrictions (total b\u00bc/C0.16) and positively related to informational contamination (total b\u00bc.25), mainly through the mediation of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (bs\u00bc/C0.08 and .18, respectively).

Along the same line, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs directly predicted general attitudes toward vaccines (b\u00bc/C0.31; supporting H2a), with those participants endorsing conspiracy beliefs related to the COVID-19 pandemic being less in favor of vaccinations. COVID- 19 conspiracy beliefs were linked to attitudes towardCOVID-19 vaccines (total b\u00bc/C0.25), mainly through the mediation of attitudes toward vaccines ( b\u00bc/C0.16), with those endorsing conspiracy beliefs related to theCOVID-19 pandemic being less in favor of vaccina-tions in general and of COVID-19 vaccinations specif- ically (supporting H2b). Additionally, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were negatively and directly relatedto support for governmental restrictions ( b\u00bc/C0.14), with those participants endorsing such beliefs also being less supportive of strong governmental restric-tions to control the pandemic (supporting H2c). Similarly, those beliefs were also directly related to the perception of informational contamination(b\u00bc.30), with those participants endorsing COVID- 19 conspiracy beliefs also being more willing to per- ceive that the information received is not transparent or complete (supporting H2d). Neither support for governmental restrictions nor informational contami- nation predicted attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines (supporting neither H7norH8). Attitudes toward vaccines strongly and positively predicted attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines (b\u00bc.56), with those supporting vaccination also gener- ally being more supportive of COVID-19 vaccines inparticular (in line with H3). As for the antecedents of conspiracy beliefs, political orientation was found to directly predict COVID-19conspiracy beliefs ( b\u00bc.15) and to indirectly predict attitudes toward vaccines via COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs ( b\u00bc/C0.06), with more right-wing participants also endorsing more COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and more negative attitudes toward vaccines (in line with H4cand with H4d). However, political orientation did not predict faith in science, general conspiracy beliefs or attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines (not supporting H4a,H4b,o rH4e). Nevertheless, political orientation predicted informational contaminationboth directly ( b\u00bc.17) and indirectly via COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs ( b\u00bc.05), with those participants who are more right wing also being more willing toperceive that the information received in times of crisis is not accurate. Regarding moral purity, this factor negatively pre- dicted faith in science ( b\u00bc/C0.21), with those endorsingTable 2. Significant direct, indirect, and total effects in the final model.

Moral purity positively predicted COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (total b\u00bc.16), mainly directly (b\u00bc.09), with those endorsing more purity also endorsing more COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (sup-porting H5c). Moreover, moral purity predicted atti- tudes toward vaccines both directly ( b\u00bc/C0.12) and indirectly ( b\u00bc/C0.11), mainly via faith in science (b\u00bc.04). In addition, moral purity predicted attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, only indirectly ( b\u00bc/C0.15), mainly via attitudes toward vaccines in general(b\u00bc.07). In general, participants who endorsed more moral purity values were less in favor of vaccines and, consequently, of COVID-19 vaccines in particular(supporting H5d and H5e). However, moral purity was overall unrelated to general conspiracy beliefs(not supporting H5b). Finally, faith in science positively predicted attitudes toward the vaccine, both directly ( b\u00bc.20) and indirect- ly (b\u00bc.12), mainly via conspiracy beliefs ( b\u00bc.05) and the serial mediation of conspiracy beliefs and COVID- 19 conspiracy beliefs ( b\u00bc.05). Faith in science also positively and indirectly predicted attitudes towardCOVID-19 vaccines ( b\u00bc.22), mainly via attitudes toward vaccines ( b\u00bc.11). Therefore, those participants with greater trust in science also had a more positive attitude toward vaccines in general and COVID-19vaccines in particular (in line with H6a and H6b). Faith in science also negatively predicted conspiracy beliefs ( b\u00bc/C0.28) and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (total b\u00bc/C0.22), mainly indirectly via conspiracy beliefs (b\u00bc/C0.17), with those trusting science being less inclined to endorse general and, consequently,COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (in line with H6c and H6d). Additionally, faith in science predicted support for governmental restrictions (total b\u00bc.13) as well as informational contamination (total b\u00bc/C0.17), mainly indirectly ( bs\u00bc.05 and /C0.09, respectively) via the serial mediation of general and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Those trusting science endorsed less general and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, which in turn was relat-ed to being more supportive of governmental restric-tions and perceiving media information as lesscontaminated (supporting H6e andH6f). Discussion The present study provided a conceptual replication of findings by Pivetti et al. (2021) to examine antecedents and consequences of conspiracy beliefs on attitudestoward the COVID-19 vaccination. As the availabilityof COVID-19 vaccines does not imply that people willbe willing to receive the vaccination, this study has shed some light on the role played by COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and their antecedents, such as politicalorientation and the endorsement of purity moral foun- dations, in one's willingness to receive a COVID-19vaccine. Concurrent with original findings and with a broad body of research, this study of a sample of Finnishpeople showed that endorsing non-health-related con-spiracy beliefs negatively predicted attitudes towardvaccines. Previous studies suggested that anti-vaccination beliefs are part of a psychological propen-sity to believe in conspiracies (e.g., Goldberg & Richey, 2020). Additionally, conspiracy beliefs strongly pre- dicted COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, pointing to theexistence of a broader conspiracy tendency encompass-ing health- and non-health-related domains. Asexpected, conspiracy beliefs were inversely related totrust in science, which was also consistent with the rel-evant literature (e.g., Rutjens et al., 2018). When com- bined, these results suggest that conspiracy beliefs may present a substantial public health risk, as they werefound to be inversely related to reduced compliancewith public health guidance with regard to COVID-19, such as staying at home, social distancing of twometers, and prolonged hand-washing (Allington & Dhavan, 2020; Douglas, 2021). Moreover, general conspiracy beliefs have negative- ly and indirectly predicted attitudes toward COVID-19vaccines via the mediation of COVID-19 conspiracybeliefs and via the serial mediation of COVID-19 con-spiracy beliefs and attitudes toward vaccines. In addi- tion, this result points to the importance of specific COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs in predicting attitudestoward COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, COVID-19conspiracy beliefs also negatively predicted attitudestoward the COVID-19 vaccines with the mediation ofgeneral attitudes toward vaccines. This is in line with the results of Pivetti et al.'s study (2021) and with sim- ilar results found by Sallam et al. (2021) in Jordan andKuwait. COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs did not directlypredict attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines inFinland either, or in Italy, which could be due to thestrong correlation between the two measures: attitudestoward vaccines and attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. At the time of data collection during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic (i.e., in spring 2020),there was almost no media information on the devel-opment of the COVID-19 vaccine and no vaccine wasavailable at the time. Therefore, the general public,who were not directly involved in the preparation ofthe vaccines, did not have the possibility of developing a firm attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine. As atti- tudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were most stronglypredicted by the general attitude toward vaccines, thisstudy hypothesized the existence of a broader attitudetoward vaccinations, of which the attitude toward thePivetti et al. 11COVID-19 vaccination was just one specific case (Reno et al., 2021; Sherman et al., 2021). As for the antecedents of beliefs in conspiracy the- ories, political orientation and moral purity directlypredicted COVID-19 beliefs in conspiracy theories (but not general conspiracy beliefs) in the Finnish con- text, whereas in the Italian study, political orientationpredicted both types of conspiracy beliefs. Moreover,faith in science negatively predicted general conspiracy beliefs, consistently with the relevant literature (e.g., Rutjens et al., 2018), which in turn predictedCOVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. These results suggestthe need for a more in-depth investigation of the rela- tionship between health- and non-health-related con- spiracy beliefs. Regarding the consequences of conspiracy beliefs, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs directly predicted sup-port for governmental restrictions (negatively) andthe perception of informational contamination (posi- tively), showing the impact of those conspiracy beliefs on reducing public support for the central governmentand increasing distrust in the transparency of COVID-19 information circulating in the media. In addition,this result replicated the findings for the Italian sample. COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs also mediated the rela- tionship between general conspiracy beliefs and sup- port for government restrictions and informational contamination, underlining the role of specificCOVID-19 conspiracy beliefs in support for the gov-ernmental response to the pandemic. As trust in the government was found to predict intentional behaviors such as hand-washing and social distancing in a multi-country study (Pagliaro et al., 2021), this study drawsattention to the importance of studying trust in shaping positive behaviors that are crucial to limiting the spread of the virus. When it comes to attitudes toward COVID-19 vac- cines, the second strongest predictor after attitudes toward vaccines was conspiracy beliefs. In this sense,the results of this study parallel the findings ofNeumann B\u20acohme and colleagues (2020), who explored the reasons as to whether or not people were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Additionally, thoseparticipants with less faith in science were also less will-ing to get vaccinated against COVID-19, in line with the results of Palamenghi and colleagues (2020), show- ing that willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19was correlated with trust in research and in vaccines. Study limitations In spite of the valuable findings gained from this study,there are a number of limitations that could be addressed in future research. First of all, the cross- sectional nature of the study poses constraints on theability to draw causal inferences. Future studies can address this by testing the effects through longitudinal design. Second, it should be noted that the data were not based on a representative sample of Finns, as there was a tendency toward younger generations and medium- to-highly educated people and students in the data.Using a convenience sampling strategy in the data col-lection makes it challenging to evaluate why certain groups of people decided to answer the questionnaire, but it is likely to be more difficult to reach people withmore negative attitudes toward science or strong con-spiracy beliefs, for example. As V \u20acaliverronen, Sivel \u20aca, and Nohynek (2019) stated, more research and more versatile methods are required to better understand dif-ferent factors behind vaccination attitudes. On theother hand, the unique value of the present data was to provide insight into vaccination attitudes during an exceptional situation in which, for example, individualfreedom of movement was restricted. It is also worthbearing in mind that, during the data collection, no vaccine was available, and the vaccine development schedule and vaccine efficacy were still unclear. Additionally, as data were collected via online ques- tionnaires, it is possible that the participants were self-selected because older citizens and/or those lessfamiliar with social media did not complete the ques-tionnaire. However, to overcome this problem, the link to the questionnaire was also sent via WhatsApp and instant messaging to both close friends and distantacquaintances, in an effort to also reach those lessreachable participants. In addition, as data were collected during the first wave (i.e., in spring 2020), the results were highly time- specific. It is likely that during 2020 and 2021 the per- ceptions of COVID-19 vaccines may have evolved (e.g.,Hammer et al., 2021). However, addressing the ques-tion of changing perceptions would require a longitu-dinal approach which goes beyond the scope of the present study. Conclusions While some studies explored public compliance with health-related guidance during the COVID-19 pandem-ic (e.g., Allington & Dhavan, 2020), or the relationshipbetween conspiracy beliefs and support for COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., Bertin et al., 2020), this study provided a conceptual replication of the study by Pivetti et al.(2021) in a novel context, in Finland, in an effort toexpand current knowledge on COVID-19 vaccine hes- itancy across countries and cultures. Having greater knowledge of psychosocial determi- nants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy can help govern- ment agencies, healthcare workers, and other12 Journal of Pacific Rim Psychologyauthorities to mitigate the impact of vaccine skepti- cism. In order to do this, such bodies and individuals may need to address the issue of conspiracism and develop public information campaigns designed to reduce vaccine avoidance by increasing confidence in the effectiveness and safety of vaccines (Thunstr \u20acom et al., 2020; Karlsson et al., 2021).
