Studies have reportedthat almost four in every tenpeople in the US suffers fromregular tension headaches, andmore than one in ten suffers fromregular migraines. Relief options generally involve medications, which haveunwanted side-effects and limited effectiveness. Two review studies offer hope of another effective treatment. They show that acupunctureis effective in treating both tension headaches and migraines. Review studies take a substantial group of studies on a topic and perform a \"meta-analysis\"on them to see if there is a trend in one direction or another among a body of research. Both ofthese reviews were performed by researchers at the Centre for Complementary MedicineResearch in Munich, Germany. In the first meta-analysis on tension headaches, they looked at a collection of eleven studies with a total of 2,317 participants. In the secondreview studying migraines, they reviewed twenty-two studies that included 4,419 people. In theend, each review concluded that acupuncture isan effective treatment for both tension headachesand migraines. Of course, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is effective for more than just these two types ofheadaches, and eventually the research will catchup. In TCM, pain is generally due to stagnation of blood and/or chi. In order to ease the pain,TCM seeks to restore the flow of these precioussubstances, and most headaches respond veryquickly, noticeably reducing in strength if not disappearing during the acupuncture session. Tension headaches are due to tightness in the muscles of the neck, jaw and upper trapezoid muscles which restricts blood flow to and from the head, thus causing pain. To relieve this type of headache, we must first relieve the tension.Tight muscles respond very well to acupuncture,tuina bodywork, and herbs\u2014taken internally and even applied externally. Simply relieving this tension will ease the headache for themoment, but to create lasting relief, the sourceof the tension must also be addressed. So, during a treatment practitioners will select other points on the body to ease overall tensionand anxiety. Herbal therapy is again a key to this treatment's success. Practitioners often prescribe meditation and chi gong\u2014ancienttools designed to help prevent external life stress from becoming internal health problems. The causes of migraine headaches are generally less obvious and even in modern science, are not well understood. In TCM, though the mechanism of the headache\u2014lack of flow to and from the head remains the same, the causesof migraines are quite varied. For some, it is hormonal. Indeed, three times as many womensuffer from migraines as men\u2014often related totheir menstrual cycle. For other people, triggersinclude changes in the weather, diet, odors,lights, medications, too much or not enoughsleep, physical activity, sex, and stress. Migrainestend to respond best to acupuncture and internalherbal therapy, and can often be greatly reducedor even resolved with early intervention.Treatments may include other modalities depending on the trigger. Sinus headaches on the other hand are generally due to a build-up of phlegm and mucus in thesinuses, resulting in pressure. They must beresolved by both moving the mucus out of thesinuses and eliminating the cause of its over-abundance. Again, acupuncture, herbs and diet are integral in treatment.

Welcome to nutrition corner! This is a new section of the newsletter where I will give you tidbitsof information on what foodsto focus on each month tokeep your body full and your mind satisfied. DO I HAVE TO EAT EVERYTHING ORGANIC?This month we will focus on EWG's (environ- mental working group)\"Dirty Dozen and Clean 15\". Each year, EWG sends a list of fruits that have been tested for levels of pesticides and allows the consumers to have knowledge on which foods contain the most pesticide residue. Of course, it would be ideal to eat everything organic or pesticide free. But sometimes that isnot an easy task due to extra cost or lack ofavailability. With the EWG's list, we can nowmake better choices on which foods are mostimportant to eat organic and which foods areokay to eat conventional. \"DIRTY DOZEN\"- Apples, Peaches, Nectarines, Strawberries, Grapes, Celery, Spinach, Sweet bellpeppers, Cucumbers, Cherry tomatoes, Snappeas (imported), Potatoes, Hot Greens \"CLEAN FIFTEEN\"- Avocados, Sweet Corn, Pineapples, Cabbage, Sweet peas (frozen), Onions, Asparagus, Mangoes, Papayas, Kiwi,Eggplant, Grapefruit, Cauliflower, Sweet Potatoes,Cantaloupe For more information please visit www.ewg.org/foodnews. Until next time!NUTRITION CORNER WITH DR. CHENMercury is a naturally occurring metal that has several forms. It is increasingly found in our food sources andin our environment. Combinedwith other elements such aschlorine, sulfur, and oxygen,it forms inorganic mercury compounds or \"salts,\" which are usually whitepowders or crystals. It also combines with car-bon to make organic mercury compounds. Themost common one, methylmercury, is producedmainly by microscopic organisms in the wateror soil. This methylmercury, which may beformed in water, builds up in the tissues of fish.Larger and older fish tend to have the highestlevels of mercury. When you eat fish or shellfish contaminated with methylmercury, the mercury in your body passesto the fetus and may accumulate there. It canalso pass to a nursing infant through breast milk.Mercury's harmful effects that may be passedfrom the mother to the fetus include brain dam-age, mental retardation, incoordination, blindness,seizures, and inability to speak. Children poisoned by mercury may develop problems in their nervous and digestive systems, and kidney damage. Learn about wildlife and fish advisories in your area from your public health or naturalresources department. It's a small price to payfor a healthy child. Here are a couple resources for California: California Department of Fish and Wildlife health advisory:http://www.dfg.ca.gov/marine/healthadvisory.asp Safe eating guidelines from California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment:http://www.oehha.ca.gov/fish/so_cal/index.html I NUTRITION FOR NEW MAMAS RECIPES FOR POSTPARTUM CARE with Dr. Jessica Chen Saturday, June 27th , 2:30 - 4:00 pm at T ao of Wellness Santa Monica Besides rest, nutrition is one of the most important ways to restore the body duringthe postpartum period.
