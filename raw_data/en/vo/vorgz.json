FISCAL EFFECT : Unknown COMMENTS : Purpose of this bill . This bill is sponsored by the California Association of Naturopathic Physicians (CANP), to provide licensure of health practitioners who have acquired specified SB 907 Page 11 education and training in naturopathy and allopathic medicine. According to the author, this bill establishes scope of practice and standards specific to those particular persons, and would authorize them to practice under a broader scope than that authorized under the author's SB 577 enacted last year. The proponents of this bill obtain education and training in both naturopathic and allopathic healing methods and seek licensure so that they may offer both, including some of the treatment procedures not permitted to non-licensed physicians, chiropractors, and other licensed healing arts practitioners. C urrently, there are 11 other states and one U.S. territory that license or specifically regulate naturopathic doctors in some fashion. The scopes of this regulation and practice vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Support . The sponsor supports licensure for naturopathic doctors because it believes that such licensure will improve consumer access to safe and effective complimentary and alternative medicine therapies in addition to allopathic ones. It will provide for licensure consistent with the naturopathic doctor's education and training, and his or her scope of practice in other jurisdictions. Thus, it is argued that the bill will allow these practitioners to practice to the fullest extent of their training. CANP also believes that this bill is a title act that will not restrict the scope of legal practice by other health care practitioners, licensed or unlicensed, and permit the public continued access to any legal practitioner. California Citizens for Health Freedom supports this bill, arguing that licensing of naturopathic practitioners will increase citizens right of choice and help enhance the health/medical services in California. Enactment of this bill will reduce the rising cost of health care, assist in meeting the crisis of a decline in primary care physicians, and increase the professional resources of experts to the growing nutritional industry in California. This will set the stage for a university specializing in naturopathic medicine to be open in California in the near future. The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME), which accredits schools of naturopathic medicine, supports this bill stating that licensing will help ensure that patients know the doctor they are seeing has been thoroughly trained at a four-year naturopathic medical school which is all important to SB 907 Page 12 making correct diagnoses and prescribing effective treatments. CNME argues that people with little or no clinical training are practicing as \"naturopaths\" in states that do not regulate naturopathic medicine. National College of Naturopathic Medicine supports this bill, stating that it will ensure accountability that physician-level doctors be licensed and regulated in the most populous state in the United States. The college argues that the public deserves comparable (to allopathic medicine) regulatory standards for naturopathic doctors who are primary care providers, and that since one out of four Americans seek or utilize natural medicine, the passage of the bill would improve access to natural health care. Further, the college argues that the bill will improve public safety since, at present, California has no standards to inform consumers whether their naturopathic doctor has completed a four-year, graduate-level naturopathic medical school, passed standard board exams, and meets federally recognized standards of education and professional accountability. And like the sponsor, the college argues that this bill clearly defines the scope of professional practice consistent with the training of the licensee. Ameri can Specialty Health Plans (ASHP) also supports this bill. ASHP is a Knox-Keene licensed Specialty Health Plan in California that offers complementary health care benefits including chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy, dietetics and naturopathy in those states where licensure of these specialties has been enacted. ASHP states that this bill will allow Californians the right to access qualified Naturopathic Doctors as the citizens in 12 other states (including one U.S. territory) enjoy. ASHP believes that the proposed licensing will ensure public safety and accountability to appropriately trained and examined applicants for licensure - and that consumers deserve comparable regulatory standards and oversight mechanisms for all health care providers, including naturopathic doctors. This bill is also supported by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (which administers the national naturopathic physician examination - the NPLEX,) the University of Bridgeport - College of Naturopathic Medicine, the American Holistic Health Association, the American Association for Health Freedom, and others SB 907 Page 13 Arguments in Opposition . The California Medical Association (CMA) initially had an \"oppose unless amended\" position on this bill, and has made several suggestions that the author has amended into this bill. CMA has stated that it believes that a title act and licensure of naturopaths would significantly improve their ability to practice naturopathy. CMA requested that this bill be amended to delete any reference to \"physician,\" that the provisions that allow for prescribing authority, performance of minor surgical procedures and childbirthing all needed to be amended as initially proposed in this bill. All of those CMA suggestions have been amended in some form into this bill. The Coalition for Natural Health opposes this bill arguing that the expanded range of services that would be authorized, and which go beyond what has been permitted under SB 577 enacted last year, constitute the practice of medicine. The Coalition believes that the education and training of the proposed \"naturopathic physicians\" is inadequate to perform the functions contained in their proposed scope of practice that go beyond what has been permitted by SB 577. (The majority of these opponents receive far less training, many through correspondence schools and on-line programs, compared to the four-year post-graduate training model promoted by the sponsors of this bill.) The Coalition for Natural Health argues that this bill is not about patient access or care, but intended to serve the parochial self-interest of certain practitioners and the particular schools from which they have obtained their education. It believes that licensing of these practitioners as proposed would have the detrimental effect of putting other actively practicing naturopaths out of business, eliminating access by patients to their services, and destroying the progress California made last year when it enacted SB 577, legalizing many alternative health treatment modalities. Title protection issue . This bill protects the title \"Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine,\" \"Doctor of Naturopathy,\" \"Naturopathic doctor,\" and the professional abbreviation \"N.D.\" It is currently illegal to use these titles in a clinical setting. Under the Medical Practice Act no one may represent himself or herself as \"doctor\" unless they are licensed to practice a medical art. Some of these titles and abbreviations are terms of current and long-standing usage by a host of naturopathic SB 907 Page 14 health practitioners, only a few of whom have the type and amount of education that is required by this bill to continue to use those terms. This bill leaves the terms \"naturopath\" and \"naturopathy\" in the public domain so that graduates of naturopathic vocational programs or correspondence courses can describe their practice Comparison with SB 577 . Last year's SB 577 does not provide access to the primary care practice of natural medicine by naturopathic doctors who have completed four-year, graduate level, clinical training in naturopathic medicine. This bill (SB 907) appears to expand these choices for healthcare. Naturopathic doctors perform differential diagnosis, clinical assessments, and may perform minor office procedures, and prescribe medications. Diagnosis and treatment at these levels of practice should require similar regulatory standards as MD's, DO's, DC's, and Lac's. A California Appellate court decision, Oosterveen vs. Medical Board of Examiners (1952), established that naturopathy is the practice of medicine and that only those licensed as naturopathic doctors may practice naturopathic medicine. Recent amendments . As recently amended, this bill establishes standards that must be met in order to qualify for licensure. Applicants must show that they have met educational requirements and have competency by passing board exams. Licensees must meet ongoing continuing education requirements and be recertified every 10 years following initial licensure. This bill creates a Bureau under the DCA that is fiscally neutral and self funded. No loan from the General Fund is required. Proposed amendments . The California Naturopathic Association (CNA) initially opposed this bill, but has removed their opposition with the author's agreement to add a proposed amendment stating that nothing in this chapter will restrict the use of titles such as \"Naturopath, \"Naturopathic Practitioner\" or \"Traditional Naturopathic Practitioner.\" The Council of Acupuncture and Oriental Medical Association (CAOMA) initially opposed this bill, but has removed their opposition with the author's agreement to add a proposed amendment stating that a naturopathic doctor may not perform needle acupuncture, \"traditional Chinese medicine\" or \"traditional Oriental medicine.\" SB 907 Page 15 REGISTERED SUPPORT / OPPOSITION : Support California Association of Naturopathic Physicians (CANP - Sponsor) Alternatives for Women American Association for Health Freedom (AAHF) American Holistic Health Association American Specialty Health Plans (ASHP) California Citizens for Health Freedom California Pacific Medical Center Center for Natural Medicine College of Naturopathic Medicine, University of Bridgeport Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) Cypress Naturopathic Medicine Doctor Andrew Weil East West Wellness Center Health & Habitat Institute for Alternative Medicine Integrative Medical Clinic of Santa Rosa Light Spring Wellness Center Metagenics National College of Naturopathic Medicine National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA) North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) One Body Massage & Wellness Center Optimal Health Center Preventive Medical Center of Marin Quiet Star Center Triangle Research Partners Vitatech International Numerous Naturopathic doctors Opposition California Chiropractic Association (CCA) Coalition for Natural Health American Naturopathic Medical Association (ANMA) California Naturopathic Association (CNA) International College of Naturopathy American Naturopathic Association (ANA) Consumer Alliance for Consumer Protection Numerous Naturopaths SB 907 Page 16 Analysis Prepared by : David Pacheco / B. & P.
