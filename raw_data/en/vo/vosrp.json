ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY STAFF Alex Briscoe Agency Dir ector Rebecca Gebhart Financ e Director Ryan Gordon Admini CUTIVE SUMMAR Y One of the provisions of Measure A required the establishment of a Citizen Oversight Committee. The Committee's role is to annually review Measure A expenditures for each fiscal year and report to the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) on whether such expenditures conform to the purposes set forth in the Measure. The Measure states: \"The citizen oversight committee shall annually review the expenditure of the essential health care services tax fund for the prior year and shall report to the board of supervisors on the conformity of such expenditures. \" This report is based on a number of sources: Self-reported inf ormation pr easure A f unds A pr esentation by t he Al ameda H ealth S ystem (A HS, db a Al ameda Coun ty M edical Cen ter) The Al ameda Coun ty H ealth C are S ervices Agenc y (H CSA), whic h monit ors t he c ontracts w ith r ecipients of Me asure A funds\u2014including negotiating scope of work and payment schedule, developing contracts, preparing letters to the Board for approval, authorizing payments, and tracking expenditures. Measure A, the Essential Health Care Services Initiative, was passed by 71% of Alameda County voters in March 2004. It authorized the County of Alameda to raise its sales tax by one-half cent to provide additional financial support for emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low-income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. In June 2014, 76% of voters passed Measure AA, which extended the half-cent sales tax through 2034. These services faced sharply increasing costs with inadequate resources to meet the needs of County residents. Measure A funds substantially eased the countywide crisis in health care; however, the economic downturn and slow recovery experienced both county- and nationwide since the passage of the Measure have threatened some of the gains achieved. The initiative generated $121,049,205 in FY 12/13. AHS received 75% of these funds, and the Board distributed the remainder of the funds to other health care providers, including the following: Initiatives f unded by t he Al ameda Coun ty Public H ealth D epartment and B ehavioral H ealth C are S ervices (BHC S) Primary c are c linics Children's, S t. Ro se, V alleyCare, and W ashington H ospitals School he alth c enters In addition to he lping AHS stabilize its budget and expand its health care services, Measure A has helped enable serious long-term planning to meet future health care needs for County residents. For example, the Public Health Department has used Measure A funds to examine and address health inequities within the client population and to develop a strategic plan. These initiatives will continue to bear fruit over time. 4MAJOR CONCLUSION The Oversight Committee found that AHS and other recipients of the sales tax revenue spent the funds in compliance with the strictures of Measure A. In addition, the Committee found that in FY 12/13, Measure A enabled expansions in services and facilities, which reflects the stated primary goal of the measure. HIGHLIGHTS Even in light of recent and ongoing federal health care reform, according to American Community Survey data for 2013, an estimated 197,159 people, or 12.6% of County residents, are uninsured. Thus, Measure A revenues continue to play a critical role in helping indigent, uninsured, and low-income residents of Alameda County\u2014who depend on the County's health care safety net\u2014maintain access to medical services. With regard to Measure A recipient reporting, the Committee recognizes an ongoing trend of improvement in the quality and level of detail in the reporting compared to prior years. This is due in part to the ongoing effort of the Committee to revise and refine the reporting form to solicit more specific information from fund recipients and thereby improve their oversight accountability to Alameda County taxpayers. The sales tax revenue received through Measure A enabled the following positive developments in the delivery of health care services: In t he f ace of a s luggish e conomic r ecovery, M easure A ena bled a l arge n umber of pr oviders t o c ontinue exi sting programs and maintain the service levels offered by these programs. For example, AHS admitted almost 15,000 patients for hospitalization and conducted more than 311,000 outpatient visits, while the Public Health Prevention Initiative served more than 77,000 Measure A clients. Most pr oviders pr esented c lear, qu antified inf ormation t hat s howed inc reases in he n umber of c lients s erved, incr eases in desired outcomes, or decreases in harmful behavior as a result of Measure A-funded services. For example, the services provided by the Detoxification/Sobering Center resulted in reducing the number of individuals entering a County emergency department with a diagnosis of intoxication by 52% and decreased the length of stay for those who did enter an emergency department by four hours. Measure A f unds inc reased ac cess t o he alth c are s ervices b oth ge ographically and t hrough pr ovision of a gr eater number and variety of services. Asian Health Services and Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, Inc. (TVHC) used Measure A funding to support the development of new community health clinics that have expanded health services to more than 10,000 new patients in Oakland and Ashland/Cherryland. The C alifornia T elehealth Ne twork u sed M easure A f unds t o e quip t elehealth st ations (v ideo st ations a t whic h pa tients can access medical services remotely) for Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland (CHRCO), Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center, Madison School-Based Health Center, and Healthy Communities, Inc.

The D ay L abor Cen ter r eferred mor e t han 900 c lients f or pr imary and e pisodic he alth c are, r educing t he numb er of emergency room visits and saving an estimated $810,000. CHRCO and S t. Ro se ho spital, t Public H ealth Pr Initi ative, B ehavioral H ealth and Alc ohol and Ot her Drug Community-Based Providers, school health services, and many smaller providers used Measure A funds to qualify for over $42 million in federal, state, and private matching funds. The $1 million that CHRCO and St. Rose each received in matching funds represents a $1 match for every $2 in Measure A funds. AHS sig nificantly inc reased it s le vel of s ervices and im proved p atient sa tisfaction t hroughout it s in patient and outp atient network. Outpatient dental surgeries increased by 47%. The patient satisfaction score at John 5George jumped 20 points, from the 52nd to the 72nd percentile among psychiatric hospitals. The Fairmont Hospital campus received a 4-star overall quality rating, and a large number of staff also received awards and recognition for their quality service. Highland Hospital emergency department's Navigators program, which guides patients and families through the care process, won the 2013 California Association of Public Hospitals/Safety Net Institute Quality Leaders Award. AHS r educed w ait time s a t t he Hig hland emer gency de partment and im plemented t he P atient C all Manager pro gram to improve clinical outcomes, prevent readmissions, and improve satisfaction by calling patients post-discharge.

CHRCO also used its allocation to increase emergency department staff such that it could serve the highest volume of patients (46,000 visits) of any emergency department in the Bay Area. The average time for providing sickle cell patients with proper pain medication has gone from 90 minutes to 30 minutes, which is among the top in the nation.

Overall, Alameda Health Consortium member health centers provided an increased number of visits under HealthPAC compared to the previous year, up 18,000 visits from FY 11/12. The health centers also enrolled 4,600 more patients into the program, a 13% increase from the preceding fiscal year. Many or ganizations and de partments, inc luding t he Public H ealth D epartment, M ulticultural Instit ute, and Pre ventive Care Pathways, used Measure A funds to increase health outreach and education efforts, with a focus on prevention. Measure A also allowed for the continuation and expansion of mental health services among many providers. Measure A g ives t he Coun ty fle xibility t o addr ess unme t ne eds and ticipated c osts. S pecifically, t he $150,000 eac h member of the Board receives as a discretionary allocation gives the supervisors the flexibility to respond to unanticipated needs in their districts. Over the period of this report, there were 16 contracts for services for youth, children, seniors, and the general population from the allocations. During this period, the Committee noted an increased focus on healthy living, wellness, and prevention initiatives. CONCERNS In developing this report, the Oversight Committee has identified several concerns regarding the state of health care funding both during the years of Measure A implementation (2004-2012) and in the foreseeable future. These general concerns stem from a slow, uneven economic recovery rate, health care funding cuts, and a decrease in the number of uninsured Alameda County residents. Despite indicators that reflect a positive fiscal outlook, the path towards economic recovery still remains fragile. In addition, given the uneven impact of the recovery, many families living in disadvantaged communities have not benefited from the improved job and housing markets and continue to need access to the essential health care services that Measure A provides. At the same time, the Committee is paying close attention to the recent and ongoing state and federal health care reform initiatives, which promise to expand coverage and increase access to care to more than 150,000 County residents who are currently uninsured. At the start of 2014, Alameda County, through HCSA, successfully transitioned more than 40,000 uninsured residents from the Low-Income Health Program to state 6Medi-Cal insurance, which gives enrollees access to additional medical services from a wider network of health care providers. In addition, approximately 5,600 newly eligible residents were able to seek coverage through Covered California, the statewide health insurance exchange program. While these accomplishments represent a boost to health access for many children, adults, and families, many individuals in Alameda County remain uninsured. Moreover, funding cuts from the previous five years, Medi-Cal rate reductions, and potential state and federal funding cuts have deteriorated the County's safety net, decreased the ability of health providers to offer services to the Medi-Cal and uninsured populations, and challenged health care expansion efforts. Realizing the full promise of these reforms presents a significant challenge as the health care delivery system remains fragmented, eligibility systems are cumbersome and difficult to negotiate, and access to care continues to be compromised by low rates and a shortage of providers\u2014particularly in primary and preventative care. Measure A will continue to serve as an essential revenue stream to emphasize prevention in developing creative and innovative ways to improve access to care, lower the cost of care, and improve the patient experience. This in turn helps promote equity in health care services delivery by addressing the root causes of poor health outcomes. Outside the area of health care funding, the Committee recognizes that the composition of the Committee has improved in reflecting the diverse make-up of the population served by Measure A. The Committee notes that this should be an area of ongoing focus as Committee member selections are made moving forward. Regarding Measure A funding, the Committee raises the following concerns: N OTE : The Committee believes it is important to present any concerns it noticed while reviewing Measure A recipient reports. At the same time, the Committee wants to make clear that raising a concern does not necessarily mean that a problem exists with a recipient's use of Measure A funds. For example, the concern may arise because of incomplete or inaccurate reporting, not because of any inappropriate use of funds. General Funding Concerns The Committee recommends that HCSA create a process for Measure A recipients to verify that they are using Measure A funds to provide their described programs to the populations listed in the measure. This process can include HCSA staff providing training to Measure A recipients on how to effectively collect demographic data to report on the diverse populations of indigent, uninsured, and low-income clients they serve by race, ethnicity, geography, and language. The Committee further advocates that HCSA be sufficiently staffed to successfully implement such a process. Reporting and Review Concerns The Committee expresses an ongoing concern that the County Counsel's interpretation of the Measure A ordinanc e limits the Committee's ability to review program efficacy and cost-effectiveness. In addition, the Committee does not have the capacity to review HCSA's process of controls and review of how the money is spent\u2014via audit or other method. The Committee recommends that the Board authorize HCSA to include evaluations of Measure A programs as part of its initiative to improve oversight and outcomes in all its programs. This includes identifying an additional resource to ensure that Measure A contracts are included in the initiative.7 Both HCSA and the Oversight Committee believe that the interpretation of the statute must be revised to ex pand the role of the Committee and appropriately allocate Measure A funds for administrative staff to oversee the contracts and ensure the effective use of public funds to all grantees. Although r eporting c ontinues t o im prove, t he Commit tee e xpresses t he ongoing c oncern t hat it s r eview is im pacted by the varying level of detail provided in fund recipient reports, as well as varying levels of responsiveness to specific questions posed by the Committee to specific recipients. This makes it difficult for the Committee to determine whether funding is being spent on the Measure A target population. For example:- Multiple pr ovider reports listed objectives that are not measurable and/or stated positive outcomes without quantifying the statements. For example, Behavioral Health Care Services at Juvenile Justice Center makes assertions of \"increased coping skills\" and \"a great benefit\" from court-ordered evaluations without quantifying these statements. The Mind Body Awareness Project was unable to collect data during this period due to organizational transitions, which made it difficult for the Committee to determine program effectiveness. - For s ome reports, it is unclear whether the target population falls within one of the categories listed in the Measure A statute: \"indigent, low-income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. \" For example, the information presented by providers such as Service Opportunities for Seniors and the Teleosis Institute does not track whether the population served falls within the requirements of Measure A. - In other r eports, the provider's description of the services offered raises questions as to their relevance to the wording of the Measure A statute. For example, while the Committee recognizes the value of the California Product Stewardship Council drug disposal program, it is unclear whether these activities and their target populations fall within the wording of Measure A. In light of some of these reporting concerns, the Committee recommends that trainings reinforce proper and accurate completion of demographic information and adherence to Measure A services. Additionally, the Committee recommends that HCSA continue to work with recipients to improve the use of results-based performance measures and ensure that the population and services supported with Measure A comply with the ordinance. The Committee recommends that the recipient reporting form include a question about service delivery in multiple languages, as language barriers can potentially impede access to services for members of the Measure A target population. Alameda Health System The Oversight Committee urges AHS to define specific measureable program objectives for how it spent Measure A funds, and then to align reported results with these objectives. In the absence of such objectives, it is difficult for the Oversight Committee to ascertain their performance. Detoxification/Sobering Center The Center's 100% reliance on Measure A funds makes it entirely dependent on this funding source. St. Rose Hospital Even with Measure A funds at the present level, St. Rose Hospital remains in extreme financial distress. Since it is a safety net hospital for central and southern Alameda County, the Committee notes that other solutions are needed to maintain this vital service.8Tri-City Health Center, Inc. This provider used Measure A funds for financial stabilization. The Committee questions the use of Measure A funds to address internal management issues. Administration/Infrastructure Support Given the total annual expenditure of over $121 million and only 0.12% for administrative support, the Committee recommends exploring cost-effective ways to evaluate Measure A-funded programs and services and improve the accountability of Measure A investments by implementing the use of results-based performance measures. Board of Supervisors Discretionary Allocations As noted in the reporting concerns above, some Board allocations are for direct services, while others are infor mational, preventive, or long-term focused and therefore more difficult to quantify. It would be helpful to develop a process that ensures these Board allocations are aligned with the intent of the ordinance. The Commit tee e xpresses t he b elief t hat a f air and e quitable pr ocess s hould e xist f or pr oviders t o a pply f or Bo ard discretionary funds. This ensures transparency in the process of awarding Board allocations. Continuing an ongoing tr end, t he F Y 12/13 allo cations inc luded a l arge n umber of r elatively small dis cretionary Board allocations, which require the use of additional HCSA administrative time. Instead of granting allocations that represent an insignificant percentage of a program's budget, the Committee recommends that the Board consider setting a minimum amount of $25,000 for discretionary grants so that the Measure A funds can have a significant positive impact on a provider's program and services.

The Al ameda B oard of S t he r emaining 25% of f unds. On December 14, 2004, after initial passage of the ordinance, the Board approved the first funding allocations of its 25% share of Measure A funds, which the Board has since reviewed and allocated approximately every three years. In FY 12/13, the Board approved a total of $33,195,193 in Measure A funding, which includes base allocations and one-time allocations to provide essential health care services. Some of the providers, organizations, and allocations include the following: Alameda B oys & Gir ls C lub Alameda Coun ty A sthma S tart Alameda Coun ty B ehavioral H ealth are ealth Initi ative Alameda Coun ty obering/Detoxification Cen ter Behavioral H ealth and M edical Co sts f or t he J uvenile J ustice Cen ter Board of S upervisors allo cations Center f or E arly In D eafness Center f or Elders' Inde pendence City of S an L eandro Community-Based Or ganization Pr imary C are ustice creening and In-C ustody Direct and upport ervices in O akland Fire S tation H ealth P ortals Fremont Ag ing & F amily S ervices Health Enr ollment f or C hildren Health S ervices f or D ay L aborers Non-County H ospitals and F amily O pportunity Initi ative As a tool for reviewing funding allocations, the Measure A Citizen Oversight Committee developed a reporting form, which contains questions on specific uses of funds received, for all Measure A fund recipients to complete. 1SECTION10Most recently, the Committee developed a review form and revised the reporting form to solicit more specific information from fund recipients. While modifying the form to improve the quality of the responses is an ongoing effort, these revisions have improved the quality of reports. For the FY 12/13 report, the Committee received presentations on several allocations, including the Alameda Health System, Center for Healthy Schools and Communities' School Health Centers and School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative, Day Labor Center, Multicultural Institute, and Street Level Health Project. The Committee used the report forms returned by most Measure A fund recipients, along with information from the presentations, to review all funding allocations. Also as in prior years, varying levels of detail provided in the reports as well as varying levels of responsiveness to specific questions posed by the Committee to specific recipients made it difficult for the Committee to evaluate the reports consistently and thoroughly. However, as noted, the revised form and the informational sessions conducted to help providers understand how to complete the reporting form have improved the information reported to the Oversight Committee. 11HOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT The Alameda Health System (AHS, dba Alameda County Medical Center) receives 75% of Measure A funds through a specific designation. The AHS Board of Trustees allocates these funds within AHS. The Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) allocates the remaining 25% of Measure A funds. The Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) manages these funds. Figure 1 DISTRIBUTION OF MEASURE A FUNDS 25% 75%Alameda County Board of Supervisors Alameda Health System Board of Trustees In FY 12/13, Measure A generated $121,049,206 (not including interest earned). The funds were allocated as follows: Alameda Health System (75%) $90,786,904 Alame da County $30,262,301 TO TAL $121,049,205 In F Y 12/13, the Alameda County approved budget totaled $2,622,397,815. The HCSA approved budget totaled $664,880,978, or 25.4% of the total County budget. Measure A revenues not specifically designated for AHS accounted for 4.6% of the HCSA budget. The following sections provide more detail on the allocation and expenditure of Measure A funds.2SECTION12REVIEW OF FY 12/13 EXPENDITURES: 75% of Measure A Funds Allocated to the Alameda Health System (dba Alameda County Medical Center) FY 12/13 allocation: $90,786,904 services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health, Substance AbuseIndividuals served: Adults, Children, Families, Seniors, Indigent, Low Alameda Health System (AHS) is a patient- and family-centered system of care that promotes wellness, eliminates disparities, and optimizes the health of its diverse communities. In FY 12/13, AHS adopted a three-year strategic plan. The plan rests on six pillars: Growth/Access to Care goals relate to maintaining the health of all County residents by expanding access to services. Key goals in FY 12/13 included the following:- Implemen tation of electronic health records - Op ening of Highland Care Pavilion, including new specialty clinics and the same-day clinic - Op erating room expansion, with additional physicians and staff in anesthesiology, gastroenterology, urology, ENT, and muscular skeletal services - Sp ecialty care expansion at neighborhood-based wellness clinics and opening of the Hope Center for complex care Quality Enhancement goals align with patient safety initiatives, such as benchmarks set by the Joint Commission, a national accrediting organization for hospitals. Key goals in FY12/13 included the following:- Est ablishing an improved infrastructure for quality control - Incr eased focus on panel management - Incr eased focus on harm reductionMeasure A Helps ALAMEDA HEALTH SYSTEM Ms. X. is a 44-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, post-traumatic stress disorder, homelessness, and crack cocaine addiction. A HOPE Center nurse care manager enrolled her in the HOPE program and began working with her. The AHS team found short-term clean and sober housing for her, and worked to find Ms. X. long-term subsidized housing and an outpatient substance abuse treatment program. Ms. X. also began receiving primary care for the first time. After having established stable housing, the nurse care manager began to work on self-management support surrounding the potential for heart failure.

Key goals in FY 12/13 included the following:- Training st aff to improve the patient experience - Up grading facilities and expanding hours of service - Est ablishing new models of care designed to improve outcomes Fiscal Stewardship goals represent a commitment to financial stability, operational efficiency, and debt-reduction. AHS is working to offset declining federal funds with new patient revenues from expanded Medi-Cal, the Health Insurance Exchange under health care reform, and new contracts with commercial payers, and is working to deliver care more efficiently and cost-effectively. Key goals in FY 12/13 included the following:- Est ablishing a System Transformation Center to oversee a range of organizational improvement initiatives - Implemen ting a Cost Management initiative, aimed at decreasing use of overtime labor and improving core staff scheduling, redesigning the supply chain, improving purchased service contract pricing, implementing flex scheduling, and other initiatives - Ex panding Lean initiatives, which optimize business processes by breaking them down into component steps that permit the identification and elimination of efforts that confer no value - Be ginning implementation of Soarian Financials enterprise software to streamline billing with eventual integration into electronic health records Workforce Development goals seek to create a culture that encourages innovation and fosters high achievement by attracting, developing, and retaining competent and compassionate staff. Key goals in FY 12/13 included the following:- De signing a new physician operating model in which AHS reorganizes physician resources within the health system to improve and strengthen quality control, care coordination, billing and collections, and provider education - Incr easing education to clinical and support staff on providing patient- and family-centered care - Hiring additional ph ysician and support staff to expand service offerings - Wor king to increase employee engagement, which correlates to the quality of the patient experience Community/Image Enhancement goals address the need for community stakeholders and constituents to understand AHS's contributions to the well-being of the entire County. Key goals in FY 12/13 included the following:- The phas ed rollout of a new name and brand, Alameda Health System, to better communicate the Measure A Helps ALAMEDA HEALTH SYSTEM CF is a 17-year-old male who was having seizures that were not responding to medication. AHS caregivers collaborated with colleagues at Children's Hospital and Research Center Oakland and developed a plan for him to have brain surgery to eliminate the focus of his seizures. His first surgery was successful, but ultimately he required a second surgery. As a result of his continued seizures and hospitalizations, he became socially isolated and depressed. AHS established bi-weekly visits in its clinic to manage his seizure medications and provide psychological support. He has been seizure-free for six months and his mood is much improved. He is now volunteering for a local organization, working to improve the environmental conditions in his neighborhood.14operating model as a public health authority with multiple geographic locations serving patients throughout Alameda County - Str engthening linkages with community primary care providers - Ex panding health education activities - Be tter helping patients connect with community resources AHS's expansion strategy, facilities upgrades, and rebranding are designed to attract new patients and patient revenue as well as to exceed the expectations of patients who now have a choice under health care reform. At the same time, AHS is working hard to manage costs while improving satisfaction and quality and improving the health of the populations it serves. Figure 2 ALAMEDA HE ALTH SY STEM P MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A is a supplemental revenue source for AHS, reducing the gap between reimbursement for services from a variety of sources and the actual cost of providing those services to underinsured and uninsured persons. AHS used Measure A funds with the express purpose of providing primary care and specialty care, and preventative and mental health services, to indigent, low-income, and uninsured children, families, and seniors of Alameda County. AHS used Measure A funds to fill in budget gaps related to providing that care. For FY 12/13, AHS made the following percentage allocations per cute C are and Anc illary S ervices Measure A therefore supports all of AHS's services, with the exception of that fraction of AHS's business for which it receives full reimbursement for the cost of services provided.

HIGHLIGHTS Working with Alameda County, AHS leveraged its Measure A funds to obtain an additional $108 million in federal support. AHS significantly increased its level of services and improved patient satisfaction throughout its inpatient and outpatient network. Highland emergency department's Navigators program, which guides patients and families through the care process, won the 2013 California Association of Public Hospitals/Safety Net Institute Quality Leaders Award. Highland also opened the three-story, 80,000-square-foot Highland Care Pavilion, including the 4,340-square- foot same-day clinic with 11 examination rooms and 10 specialty clinics, which increased outpatient capacity. AHS reduced wait times at the Highland emergency department and implemented the Patient Call Manager program to improve clinical outcomes, prevent readmissions, and improve satisfaction by calling patients post-discharge. The care transitions program for patients with complex health needs resulted in a 19% reduction in overall 90-day readmissions. Outpatient dental surgeries increased by 47%.The John George patient satisfaction score jumped 20 points from the 52nd to the 72nd percentile. Fairmont Hospital campus received a 4-star overall quality rating. A large number of AHS staff received awards and recognition.17CONCERNS The Committee urges AHS to define specific measureable program objectives for how it spent Measure A funds, and then to align reported results with these objectives. In the absence of such objectives, it is difficult for the Oversight Committee to ascertain their performance.18REVIEW OF FY 12/13 EXPENDITURES: 25% of Measure A Funds Allocated by The Alameda County Board Of Supervisors In FY 12/13, the Board of Supervisors (Board) approved approximately $33.2 million in total Measure A allocations. The Board allocations are listed by group in the following chart. NOTE: Since most of the allocations are approved by the Board before and during each fiscal year based on sales tax revenue projections, the total allocation amount may not equal the actual revenue received. For more details on Board allocations, see Appendix B: FY 12/13 Budget Information and Appendix C: FY 12/13 Measure A Fund Distribution by Provider or Program.

MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y The BHCS-contracted CBOs used Measure A funds to provide a broad array of mental health and substance use disorder services, ranging from outreach to intensive programs, in multiple geographic areas across the county. Measure A funds have helped mitigate budget cuts and the lack of cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) that would have resulted in program cuts. Measure A funds have also helped offset the impact of reductions in funding, thereby contributing to system stability. The use of Measure A funds to mitigate budget cuts allowed providers to serve approximately the same number of County residents in alcohol and other drug (AOD) programs, despite unavoidable cost increases for insurance, utilities, and other nonservice-related operational expenses. These additional funds contributed to significant client-level outcomes, such as service continuity, outreach effectiveness, and client engagement in treatment objectives that would be put at risk by cutbacks in provider service capacity. HIGHLIGHTS Despite significant reductions in County General Funds available to support behavioral health services, Measure A funds supplemented the budgets of CBOs that deliver these services, allowing these CBOs to provide a higher level of access to services for uninsured and health care safety net populations. Specifically, compared to the preceding year, FY 12/13 saw a decline of only approximately 2% in both the total number of unique clients served (about 36,000 unique persons) across the behavioral health system, and the total number of services delivered to that population. In light of County General Fund reductions of about 10% and a Bay Area cost of living increase of about 2.4% for that same period, the Measure A supplement to providers' maintenance of effort was very effective in mitigating those declines. In addition, the BHCS-contracted CBOs leveraged their Measure A allocations to obtain an additional $20,821 in matching funds from Medi-Cal and the Medi-Cal Administrative Activities (MAA) program. CONCERNS To increase accountability and transparency, the Committee recommends that in the future BHCS make allocations to fewer agencies in larger amounts, to more easily track actual expenditures.22BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES FY savings transferred to reserve: $0 Types of services provided: Mental Health, Substance Abuse Individuals served: Adults, Children, Families, Seniors, Indigent, Low Income, UninsuredMeasure A clients served: NA* ( Total clients: 800) Service area: Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Castro Valley, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Newark, Oakland, Piedmont, Pleasanton, San Leandro, Union City, Homeless or transient*Funding not used for direct services AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND Building Opportunities for Self-Sufficiency (BOSS) helps homeless, poor, and disabled people achieve health and self-sufficiency, and fights against the root causes of poverty and homelessness. BOSS serves approximately 1,500 homeless families and individuals in Alameda County every year. Its residential capacity includes 168 beds for singles and 48 units for families, plus a variable-unit program that houses up to 29 people. BOSS also operates nonresidential programs (income advocacy, drop-in center, leadership development project, temporary jobs program). Over 40% of BOSS participants are homeless for the first time. Another 30% are chronically homeless, and the remaining 30% have experienced more than one episode of homelessness as they work to rebuild their lives. Homeless advocates estimate it can take 37 hours a week to travel between service providers for services homeless people need. BOSS reduces this burden by housing multiple services and resources in each of its programs. These services include benefits advocacy, health care referrals, assistance in obtaining health care coverage, case management services, payee/money management services, mental health services, recovery services, housing placement services, employment services, and adult education services.Measure A Helps BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELF-SUFFICIENCY (BOSS) Because of drug and alcohol addiction, George spent 10 years living on the streets in Berkeley and Oakland, finally spending two years in jail for a violent crime. Upon release, he was referred to the BOSS Single Adult program, where he lived for six months, receiving services to support his recovery and search for employment and housing. He met all his parole requirements, completing his program and paying restitution to his crime victim. Through the BOSS transitional housing and employment programs, George obtained an apartment and job for six months before transitioning to a permanent position with a local Business Improvement District. A permanent housing subsidy enabled George to move into a one-bedroom apartment. 23MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y BOSS used its Measure A allocation to achieve two high-level objectives, as follows: Facilitate and c omplete it s e xecutive/leadership t eam transition t o b est addr ess agenc y ne eds and emer ging comm unity issues, including the following tasks: - Cre ate a dedicated Human Resources department with full-time staff - Cre ate and fill an Operations Director position - Comple te the transfer of computer logins, budget, and signature authority - Est ablish and implement a regular schedule of internal meetings - Conduct 25 one-on-one st akeholder meetings - Rev iew personnel performance and mentor three staff monthly - Monit or performance of current projects - Comple te strategic planning and develop monthly action Item lists Complete t he s ervice/site r eorganization, inc luding t he f ollowing t asks: - Implemen t new program curricula and establish new program goals, focusing on housing first, critical time intervention, and trauma informed care. - Est ablish and submit an administrative policies and procedures manual - Submit a p olicies and procedures manual for programs/projects CENTER FOR EMPOWERING FY savings transferred to reserve: $0 Types of services provided: Public Health, Mental Health Individuals served: Children, Families, Indigent, Low Income, UninsuredMeasure A clients served: 16 (Total clients: 32)Service area: Berkeley, Oakland, Union City AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants (CERI) is a grassroots, nonprofit organization dedicated to providing culturally competent mental health and other social services to refugee and immigrant families with multiple layers of complex needs, exposure to violence and trauma both in their current environment and in their native countries, and weakening intergenerational relationships. The agency's focus is on Cambodian survivors of the Khmer Rouge genocide and their families. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funding supported the following CERI programs and outcomes: Young women's group. This group serves 11 young women. Two women graduated this spring and are both 24enrolled in community college. At the onset of this program, three of the young woman were involved in underground sex trafficking and/or drug dealing. Currently all are free of illegal activity. Boys middle school group. This group serves six to eight boys. All of the young men are at risk of probation involvement and are failing school. Last year none of the boys were referred to probation and all of them progressed to 7th or 8th grade. Latency-age after-school program. Three youth in this program received one-on-one interventions and are enrolled in community college. One family with two young boys has been provided intensive case management services, and the boys have received much needed IEPs that have helped them to stay in school. In addition, CERI used its Measure A allocation to meet the following objectives: Outreach and Education Community events. Hold two community-wide events annually with outreach to at least 200 individuals. Home and school visits. Provide 196 hours of visits annually to individuals and/or families. Psycho-educational workshops. Hold 12 workshops annually (one per month). Support groups, including life skills classes, art, and other nontraditional mental health prevention activities. Hold six ongoing support groups annually (all with the participation of a marriage and family therapy intern or a psychology intern), with at least five individuals served by each. Workshops for community and schools. Hold two cultural wellness workshops annually for community groups. Mental Health Consultation Consultation and/or training for community-based organizations (CBOs). Hold three or more training events annually. Consultation and/or training for schools, probation officers, child welfare workers, health clinics. Provide ongoing and continuous training.

She felt hopeless and suicidal. Her parents, survivors of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia, are active substance abusers, and her home life was chaotic. After Vani started attending CERI, she got her grades on track and connected with many young women in the group. Through CERI, Vani committed to stop \"living the life.\" She graduated high school and is enrolled in community college. She works part-time at CERI, providing administrative support and peer mentoring to other youth. She no longer feels depressed and hopes to become a probation officer. 25HIGHLIGHTS The CERI program has resulted in the following positive outcomes for youth clients: Feeling mor e c onnected t o t heir p eers and t heir f amilies, b etter r elationships w ith t heir p arents, and le ss is olation, as reported in client surveys An inc rease in g raduation f rom hig h s chool and enr ollment in c ollege A r eduction of yout h in volved in c riminal ac tivity f rom t hree a t t he ons et of t he pr ogram t o none c urrently involve d In addition, CERI leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain an additional $75,000 in matching funds from the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) and private funders. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SCREENING FY savings of provided: Hospital Inpatient, Mental Health Individuals served: Adults, Indigent, Low Income, Seniors, Uninsured, Other residentsMeasure A served: Countywide AGENCY OGRAM BACkGROUND Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) works to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of all eligible Alameda County residents who are developing or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns. A program of BHCS, Criminal Justice (CJ) Screening/In-Custody Services provides a full range of mental health services to approximately 1,400 County jail inmates every month. An estimated 16% of inmates have serious mental illnesses. Without jail mental health services, mentally ill inmates would go untreated. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y BHCS used its Measure A fund allocation to maintain staff at CJ Screening/In-Custody Services who provided assessment of all inmates and improved care for adults in the jail settings with timely access to medications and reduced potential medication abuse at Santa Rita Jail. The mental health service is staffed seven days a week, for 16 hours each day, to assess inmates as they enter the jail for mental health conditions and suicide risk factors. Mental health staff also works in other areas of the jail including the inmate housing units where inmates with mental illnesses can be assessed, monitored, and provided with ongoing treatment as well as crisis intervention. The jail's suicide prevention program, a collaborative effort between mental health and other staff, has resulted in a significant decrease in inmate suicides.26Specific services supported by Measure A include the following: Mental Health Screening Initial (Intake). At the time of booking, all inmates are screened for medical and psychiatric treatment needs. Inmates found to need further mental health screening are forwarded to the Criminal Justice Mental Health (CJMH) department. Within 14 days, staff conducts an additional mental health appraisal on all inmates. Inmates found to need a further mental health evaluation are referred to CJMH. The screening assessment includes an evaluation of the inmates' current psychiatric condition, psychiatric history, substance abuse (addictions) history and current use, psychiatric medication history and current need for medications, suicide history and current risk factors, and more. Post-booking. CJMH clinicians triage and screen all referred inmates for mental health service needs and recommend appropriate treatment plans based on the assessment. Onsite services allow CJMH staff to proactively deliver mental health services to mentally ill inmates who might otherwise fall through the cracks. Crisis Intervention Onsite. CJMH clinicians respond to urgent calls from deputies and nurses regarding seriously distressed inmates, and, where clinically indicated, provide crisis counseling, make recommendations for interventions, initiate interim placements, and/or make arrangements for psychiatric hospitalization for inmates who meet the criteria. On-call. When there are no mental health staff members onsite, a CJMH clinician is on-call and can be reached by deputies and nurses by pager to assist with urgent mental health matters. Management of Inmate Behavioral Problems CJMH clinicians collaborate with and provide consultation to deputies and staff to develop and implement plans for appropriate management of inmate behavioral problems. Suicide Prevention CJMH participates with sheriff's personnel and medical staff in training, oversight, and procedures designed to prevent inmate suicides. At the time of booking, all inmates are assessed for suicide risk. In addition, CJMH conducts a suicide risk assessment on all inmates called to their attention by deputies and nurses as a result of inmates expressing suicidal thoughts or demonstrating self-injurious behaviors. CJMH takes preventive action on all inmates expressing suicidal thoughts and/or demonstrating self-injurious behaviors. Deputies and medical staff receive regular training in how to identify suicidal inmates and what actions to take. CJMH staff work with inmates who demonstrate a risk for suicide and address risk factors, develop relapse prevention strategies including understanding warning signs for relapse, and discuss coping strategies. Ongoing Treatment Services, Treatment Planning, Stabilization of Mental Disorders, and Other Services All inmates receiving mental health services are seen by CJMH clinicians who develop individualized treatment plans, with the goal of assisting the inmates to achieve mental stability, develop an awareness of their psychological and behavioral problems, and acquire coping skills while incarcerated. Clinicians develop treatment plans with short and long-term goals, identifying how these goals will be carried out. Medication support services. When appropriate, CJMH psychiatrists evaluate inmates and prescribe psychotropic medications to alleviate symptoms and allow the inmates to achieve an optimal level of functioning while incarcerated. Counseling services. Inmates referred for counseling services receive an additional post-booking assessment and are provided ongoing counseling sessions as determined by their treatment plan. 27 Misdemeanant incompetents. Whenever possible, with regard to misdemeanant Incompetent to Stand Trial (PC 1370.01) inmates, CJMH staff collaborate with the courts to provide treatment geared to restoring competence and/or refer inmates to community programs that can address competency. Court-ordered evaluations (PC 4011.6s). CJMH clinicians conduct court-ordered psychiatric evaluations (PC 4011.6s) to assess the need for acute inpatient psychiatric care and provide reports back to the courts. Inpa tient services. CJMH staff or deputies send inmates requiring acute inpatient hospitalization to acute psychiatric inpatient hospitals. When inmates are returned to the jail, they are held in the Outpatient Housing Unit (Infirmary) until CJMH clinicians can assess them, continue their medications, and clear them for housing Inmates who refuse treatment. All treatment in the jail is voluntary. CJMH staff monitor inmates with serious mental illnesses who refuse treatment and make an ongoing attempt to engage these inmates in treatment. Outreach and teamwork. Dedicated CJMH staff (clinicians and psychiatrists) work on Special Housing Units: Ad Seg, Mental, Women's. These staff closely monitor inmates on these units. Visits occur several times a week, including cell checks for inmates who refuse to be seen or who are noncompliant with treatment. Substance abuse treatment. Inmates have access within the jail to programs that specifically address addiction problems. CJMH clinicians also address substance abuse as part of their ongoing interventions with inmates. Mental Health On-call/Emergency Services Emergency mental health services are available 24 hours a day by onsite staff or by mental health professionals who work on-call. When needed, access to 24-hour acute psychiatric hospitalization is available. A CJMH psychiatrist is on-call to accommodate the continuity of psychotropic medications. Discharge Planning/Continuity of Care When CJMH staff have advanced notice of an inmate's date of release, staff make a referral for follow-up outpatient treatment to the BHCS ACCESS program or to the inmate's previous community mental health services provider. CJMH staff work closely with court mental health advocates CAP (Court Advocacy Project), the FACT (Forensic Assertive Community Treatment) team, the BHC (Behavioral Health Court), and community service providers in coordinating treatment plans and release plans for persons in custody with serious mental illnesses. Measure A Helps CRIMINAL JUSTICE SCREENING AND IN-CUSTODY SERVICES Mr. A., assigned to a community case management team, failed to cooperate with his treatment. He didn't take his psychiatric medications, used substances, and was often homeless. Over time, he experienced hundreds of intakes to John George Psychiatric Pavilion and was ultimately arrested and incarcerated for a misdemeanor. A collaborative effort involving the Court Advocacy Project, the court, the jail mental health team, the outpatient case management team, and BHCS Bed Control developed a plan to engage Mr. A. in treatment, establish stabilization, and transition him to a rehabilitation center for longer term care. This plan, which broke Mr. A's pattern of recidivism, would not have been possible without this collaborative effort beginning with mental health services in the jail. 28Training The CJMH Director, the Senior Clinician(s), and other mental health professionals provide training to sheriff's personnel and civilian staffs in mental illnesses and suicide prevention on a regular basis. All new CJMH staff receive 40 hours of initial training before assuming independent work assignments. CJMH managers and psychiatrists provide ongoing training to CJMH line staff in topics related to the practice of jail psychiatric services. CJMH schedules regular training for CJMH staff by outside trainers on a variety of topics related to jail and community mental health matters Administration of Psychotropic Medications to Patients in a Psychiatric Emergency As defined in section 5008(m)* of the Welfare and Institutions code, psychiatrists can legally prescribe psychotropic medication for emergency situations. CJMH staff have access to trainings provided by BHCS. The CJMH Lead Psychiatrist attends the monthly BHCS Psychiatric Practices Committee convened by the BHCS Medical Director's office and shares information learned with other CJMH psychiatrists. CONCERNS The recipient has provided identical reports for the past three years, which makes it difficult to determine significant improvements and outcomes. DETOXIFICATION/SOBERING CENTER FY savings transferred to Types of services provided: Substance Abuse Individuals served: Adults, Seniors, Indigent, Low AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Detox/Sobering Center works to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of all eligible Alameda County residents who are developing or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns. The Detox Center is a social model nonmedical detoxification center specifically designed for individuals requiring 24-hour/7-day-a-week monitoring. It offers van transport for individuals needing transportation to and from medical/psychiatric/treatment/housing or any other ancillary service they may need. These services allow clients to fulfill all admission requirements for their next level of treatment. The Sobering Center is designed to assist those needing immediate sobering services from alcohol/drugs. It provides a brief visit of 23 hours or less with continual monitoring for safe withdrawal, 24 hours per day, seven 29days per week. Within the Sobering Center, the Health Center is staffed with nurse coordinators who monitor withdrawal and assist with medical triage/assessment to ensure safe and healthy withdrawal. The center also provides TB tests and referrals to medical/psychiatric services for all individuals as needed. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A provides 100% of the funding to Cherry Hill Detoxification Services Program/Horizon Services, Inc., the sole provider of the Detox/Sobering Center. With this funding, the Detox/Sobering Center achieved the following measurable outcomes: Cherry Hill Sob ering Cent er prov ided 4,946 ser vices. The D etox Cen ter pr ovided 2,235 s ervices.

Law enf orcement le adership and offic ers a ttend bi-mont hly trainings in groups 25-30 for training, education, and orientation around the Detox/Sobering Center's programs and services. HIGHLIGHTS An internal research project shows that services provided by the Detox/Sobering Center reduced the number of individuals entering a County emergency department with a diagnosis of intoxication by 52%, and decreased the length of stay for those who did enter an emergency department by four hours. The expanded outreach to include more law enforcement collaborations\u2014providing officers with an alternative for intoxicated individuals\u2014has resulted in more residents being offered a treatment approach to public intoxication rather than incarceration and/or hospitalization. Measure A Helps DETO xIFICA TION/SOBERING CENTER When a male with a 20-year-history of alcohol dependence arrived at the Detox/Sobering Center as a returning client, he was angry, resistant, and not taking his bipolar disorder medication. He rarely communicated with staff, making critical comments regarding staff and other clients. After several visits, he became more receptive and willing to share his story.

The services provided consist of individual therapy, case management, court-ordered evaluations, crisis intervention, and consultation to Juvenile Hall staff, probation officers, and the Juvenile Court. Youth who are detained in Juvenile Hall by nature of being in a locked facility away from family and friends experience anxiety, agitation, and depression in regards to their situation. This is in addition to any already pre-existing mental health conditions that the youth are struggling with prior to being admitted into Juvenile Hall. The goal of BHCS is to mitigate as much as possible the negative emotional impact of detention. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y BHCS used its Measure A allocation to provide mental health services to youth detained in the Juvenile Hall facility. The funding helped BHCS attain the following objectives: Help mitig ate t he men tal he alth i ssues of yout h de tained, inc luding c risis in tervention and ongoing men tal healt h support while detained.

NAMI Tri-Valley conducted a weekly 90-minute peer support groups for persons with a psychiatric diagnosis. An estimated 30 people on average attended the group weekly. NAMI Tri-Valley Family/Caregiver Support Groups. NAMI Tri-Valley offered twice-monthly peer support groups for families and caregivers. The groups provide a safe place to talk, network, learn new coping skills, and gain resources in the community around a mentally ill loved one. This program is specifically directed to family members of adults with mental illness. On average, 12 to 18 people attend each meeting. 33 NAMI Tri-Valley Resource and Support Group. NAMI Tri-Valley offered a once-monthly peer support group to support parents of children suspected of or diagnosed with a mood disorder. On average, six people attend the monthly meeting. While the support groups were held twice monthly in early FY 12/13, because of a personal situation for the facilitator, they later tapered to once a month. NAMI Tri-Valley General Meetings. NAMI Tri-Valley held a once-monthly public meeting at which invited guest speakers talked about mental health topics or issues. The speakers are experts in their field.

The mother was terrified about how her son would act and unsure how to talk with him. The facilitator invited the parents to a support group so they would not feel alone in this situation. They attended the Family-to-Family classes, which helped them gain the understanding to fully support their son through his recovery. Through the NAMI Tri-Valley support programs, the son is now back at college and the parents are cautiously optimistic about his future.34SAFE ALTERNATIVES TO VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTS Board of Supervisors FY savings transferred to Types of services provided: Mental Health Individuals served: Adults, Children, Families, Seniors, Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured, Other: Victims of domestic violenceMeasure A clients served: 310 ( Total clients: 3,324) Service area: Alameda, Berkeley, Castro Valley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Newark, Oakland, Pleasanton, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Union City AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments (SAVE) promotes alternatives to domestic violence through support services, advocacy, and education and assists domestic violence victims and their families to end the cycle of violence. All SAVE services are provided free of charge. In FY 12/13, more than 90% of the clients who received SAVE counseling services met the HUD definition of low income, with the majority falling into the \"extremely low income\" category. Approximately 40% of clients self-reported a disability of some kind. Approximately 80% of clients served were from Alameda County, mainly coming from Fremont, Hayward, and Oakland. The clients from neighboring counties were largely shelter clients who had been forced to flee their home counties for safety. Only 30% of clients had some form of health insurance. In most cases, that was Medi-Cal. Because SAVE services are provided to any victim in need, lack of adequate insurance was a nonissue for clients. At SAVE, the only criteria for participation in counseling services is that the client has experienced or is experiencing domestic violence. Drop-in domestic violence support groups are available to victims three Measure A Helps SAFE ALTERNATIVES TO VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTS Janelle came to the SAVE shelter with her three daughters. During her stay, Janelle lost custody of two of her daughters because of her inability to properly care for their medical and mental health needs. Janelle is a life-long victim of abuse. The depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that she suffers have made it difficult to care for her children. With twice-weekly counseling with the SAVE psychologist, Janelle began dealing with the separation from her children and addressing the issues that have contributed to her situation. With support from her shelter case manager, she has reunited with one of her daughters. She recently qualified for transitional housing and continues receiving weekly case management and attending counseling and parenting classes.35days a week.

In partnership with school districts and service providers, and by leveraging and blending local, state, and federal resources, the Initiative invests over $24 million annually toward delivering a continuum of school-based behavioral health supports to students in schools throughout Alameda County. The Initiative has implemented school-based behavioral health supports throughout the County. Measure A Helps SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES (SCHOOL-BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE) The Coordination of Services Team (COST) provides students facing learning and behavioral health challenges intensive case management fluidly and effectively. Michael, a 10th grader, needed a wide range of support. His brother, whom Michael lived with, was facing eviction; his mother's location was unknown; and his father struggled with substance abuse. Through COST, collaboration occurred among the primary care services team, principal and teachers, Family Resource Center coordinator, District Nurse, and community agencies. Meetings were held with Michael's father, CPS, and a potential foster family. Michael was successfully placed in a supportive home, did not miss school, and is on track with his credits towards graduation. He receives ongoing counseling and will continue with the same counselor next year. 37CHSC and BHCS used their Measure A allocation to enhance two core programs of the Alameda County School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative: The Our Kids Our Families program and the School-District Consultation program.

The Our Kids Our Families program supports prevention efforts at the school sites, as well as early intervention and treatment services for any student and their family that needs it. The program pairs clinical case managers from the CHSC or Hayward Youth and Family Services Bureau with nonprofit providers who access Medi-Cal funding through BHCS. The clinical case managers work with the schools to provide prevention supports and intervention services to students and their families who are not Medi-Cal eligible.

At intake and discharge, school-based providers and BHCs assess their clients on six common problem areas, including the following: Academic f unctioning Social r elationships Exposure t o v iolence/challenging en vironments Emotional and b ehavioral f unctioning Health/basic ne eds Living ar rangements and b asic f unctioning In addition to coordinating and providing direct services to students and their families, BHCs in Emery, Newark, New Haven, San Leandro, and Hayward Unified School Districts kicked off the first year of the Our Kids Our Families intern program. By supervising a total of 22 (an increase of 7 over 2011-2012) social work interns, the program was able to increase capacity and service access for students and their families in each of these districts. Strengthen the Use of Evidence-Based Practices Along a Continuum of Behavioral Health Supports That Includes Prevention, Early Intervention, and Treatment BHCs in all eight school districts were responsible for planning and/or implementing evidence-based prevention programs that promote social emotional learning and development (SEL) learning in students and SEL application in adults, including the following: Positive b ehavioral in terventions and alth onsultation w ith t eachers, st aff, p arents, and st udents In addition, BHCs wor ked to strengthen the quality of early intervention and treatment programs in all school districts. Fundamental to the Initiative's evidence-based framework, BHCs provided and worked with current providers and interns to expand the use of therapeutic groups to serve students showing early signs of behavioral health struggle and students assessed to be \"at risk. \" BHCs in all district either directly provided crisis response services or coordinated crisis response, all of which function to minimize harm and ensure appropriate support for everyone in the school environment impacted by crisis. Implement Consistent Criteria, Procedures, and Practices for Behavioral Health Assessments, Referrals, and Linkages in the Schools BHCs support the implementation of Coordination of Services Teams (COST) in the schools.

HIGHLIGHTS While the full countywide and district-specific analysis for FY 12/13 is still in progress, an initial sample of programs in Hayward and Oakland, as well as through select school-based providers, is quite promising. In aggregate, students who were assessed as struggling in any one of the presenting problem areas at intake showed significant improvements at discharge. Behavioral health providers and BHCs also assess clients on observed strengths at intake and discharge, including eight different \"Internal Factors\" and three \"External Factors. \" The initial sample indicates significant improvements in strength areas, an indication that students receiving treatment services are increasing their resilience.

CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RESEARCH CENTER OAKLAND of services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental HealthIndividuals served: Children, Indigent, Low Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland (CHRCO) provides highly specialized pediatric emergency services for the children of Alameda County, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. CHRCO's emergency department (ED) sees a broad array of pediatric disease and injury, from the basic to the most complex. CHRCO is the leading provider for Alameda County children in need of acute care. Children with Medi-Cal rely nearly exclusively on CHRCO for emergency service, because the public hospitals in the area do not provide specialized pediatric care and do not have any beds for children in the event a child needs to stay overnight. Trauma services are a subset of the ED, requiring highly specialized equipment, facilities, and highly trained staff. CHRCO's ED is one of two designated Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers in Northern California and the only one in the Bay Area. CHRCO's Trauma Center has 24-hour in-house staff and resources that include ED attending physicians who are pediatric specialists in emergency medicine, trauma surgery, anesthesiology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, diagnostic imaging, and critical care. CHRCO maintains an extensive in-house and outpatient rehabilitation department for pediatric trauma patients. The Trauma Center also supports an injury prevention program for the hospital and the community. For many children, the ED also functions as the gateway to a regular medical home, specialty care, or other community programs sponsored by CHRCO or other organizations.43The ED also has a fellowship training program and hosts three fellows in pediatric emergency medicine. There are no other pediatric emergency fellow programs in Northern California. Unfortunately, the children seen in the CHRCO ED have experienced some kind of misfortune, and nearly all had no choice but to seek emergency care. The ED's impact is immeasurable. Without the CHRCO ED, children would need to travel further and/or receive care that is not specialized to children. With little doubt, more children would die without the CHRCO ED. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Seventy percent of patients seen in the CHRCO ED receive Medi-Cal. This number is higher than almost any other hospital\u2014child or adult\u2014in California. Medi-Cal reimbursement is significantly less than from private payers. The percentage of children on Medi-Cal has been trending higher over the last decade. With a nearly 3:1 public-to-private-payer ratio, CHRCO relies on supplemental funding from Alameda County via Measure A to sustain its vital services for Alameda County's children. At CHRCO, Measure A funding supported the pediatric ED, specifically to provide 18 full-time staff for the large volume of children seen. This program is consistent with the stated intent of Measure A to \"provide additional financial support for emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low-income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. \" In FY 12/13, there were a total of 46,513 visits and 32,581 unique patients to the CHRCO ED, making it the highest volume ED in the Bay Area. Six hundred seventy-nine of these visits were trauma cases where the child faced an immediate life-threatening situation. Measure A monies allows the CHRCO ED to provide faster and more efficient care. The total average time children spent at the CHRCO ED, from arrival to discharge, shrunk to 3.1 hours. According to studies conducted by McKesson, this figure compares with 4.1 hours for CHRCO's peer group. Measure A funding also helped the ED upgrade its space to be more kid-friendly and purchase state-of-the-art equipment, such as new monitors and imaging equipment. The CHRCO ED is the only children's ED on the West Coast that does ultrasounds, rather than higher risk CT scans. About 10% of all children who present at the ED do not have a regular provider, and staff offer solutions through primary care clinics as well as community-based clinics.Measure A Helps CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RESEARCH CENTER OAkLAND The day before Kailee turned 11 years old, she landed badly while jumping on a trampoline, heard a crack, and felt sharp pains in her left arm. At the CHRCO ED, X-rays confirmed that both bones in her forearm were broken and would require orthopedic intervention. Accustomed to calming kids of all ages, Kailee's ED nurse had a pocketful of jokes that she routinely tells patients. Soon Kailee, her sister, and her mom were laughing. Kailee sailed through her procedure with flying colors, and was all smiles as she admired her new neon green cast. Kailee's mom says, \"I'm so glad we came to Children's! Thank you so much for taking such good care of us.\"44The CHRCO ED has also gained national recognition for its treatment of sickle cell disease patients, most of whom present to the ED with severe pain. HIGHLIGHTS CHRCO effectively used its Measure A allocation to reduce patient wait times in a number of service areas\u2014by over 50% in providing pain medication to sickle cell patients\u2014or to provide services more quickly when compared to peer hospitals. CHRCO also used its allocation to increase ED staff such that it could serve the highest volume of patients (46,000 visits) of any ED in the Bay Area. In FY 12/13, over 400 children seen in the ED were referred to and seen at CHRCO's asthma clinic for follow-up care and asthma education. The average time for providing sickle cell patients with proper pain medication has gone from 90 minutes to 30 minutes, which is among the top in the nation. In addition, CHRCO leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain an addition $1,000,000 in matching funds from the California Medical Assistance Commission.

These services include the following: Critical access. SRH serves as a critical access point form Alameda County and is the only Medi-Cal contracted facility between Oakland and Fremont. Additionally, SRH serves as a safety net hospital and provides health care access to many low-income residents that do not have adequate transportation to the Alameda County Medical Center. Hospitalists programs. The Hospitalists assume care of indigent and uninsured patients who are admitted to SRH. This alleviates the financial impact of the private physicians who request compensation for lack of reimbursement. Women's services. SRH operates the Women's Center to meet the growing demand for OB/GYN services in the community, because many OB practitioners do not accept Medi-Cal rates. The program provides immediate and emergency care for pregnant women who present to the emergency room, often with no history of prenatal care. Over 74% of patients seen in the clinic are Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Cardiac care. SRH is the only Medi-Cal contracted facility to provide elective cardiac and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) services in Central Alameda County. There has been a 3% increase in procedures for Medi-Cal beneficiaries in FY 2013 over 2012. SRH routinely accepts hospital transfers for emergency and elective cardiac care from non-Medi-Cal providers.Measure A Helps ST. ROSE HOSPITAL A 61-year-old female with severe chest pain received a cardiac catheterization procedure at the SRH ER. Three months later she returned to have a permanent catheter inserted to treat her diabetes. Unfortunately, the patient reached her lifetime maximum benefit, and her health plan stopped paying her claims. Overnight she became \"uninsured,\" leaving her with thousands of dollars of unpaid hospital bills. Compounding this, the patient's husband attempted to commit suicide and was hospitalized due to his injuries. The patient's daughter asked if SRH could help. SRH made the compassionate decision to waive the patients' remaining bills. Measure A support in part enables SRH to provide this level of charity care and still keep its doors open to serve the community.46MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y SRH used its Measure A allocation to help achieve the following objectives: Provide emer gency c are f or uninsur ed p atients.

Half of this Measure A allocation supported the planning and rollout of NextGen Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems at the health centers and affiliated school-based health centers. Measure A funds provided initial support for the transition from paper medical charts to electronic systems, including training staff and health care providers on the NextGen EHR technology, increasing IT staff, extracting data from thousands of paper charts and entering the data into newly created EHRs for each patient, and purchasing necessary software and hardware to connect critical patient data (e.g., labs, scheduling information) from different departments and vendors into single records. The other half of this allocation supported health center building improvements, reconfigurations of departments and facilities to improve efficiency and capacity, and the building of entirely new clinic locations in preparation to serve more Alameda County residents under the Affordable Care Act. Specific implementation details for each of the Consortium members are as follows. Asian Health Services EHR Implementation Measure A funds supported Asian Health Services' planning throughout the year leading up to the initial launch of the EHR at its new clinic in Oakland Chinatown. Asian Health Services documented the workflow of clinicians, created electronic interfaces, and developed a training curriculum and schedules for the clinical teams to phase in the adoption of the EHR. Capital Infrastructure With Measure A support, Asian Health Services completed the conversion of the former Silver Dragon Restaurant in Oakland into a comprehensive health center with 20 exam rooms and a staffing model designed to provide a patient-centered health home. Axis Community Health EHR Implementation55Axis Community Health successfully achieved full EHR implementation at all clinical sites, affecting the care of more than 10,000 patients. Axis has continued to optimize the system, enhance interfaces, develop and refine additional templates, and provide ongoing training for staff to further optimize the use of the system. Capital Infrastructure Axis is currently developing additional clinical space to expand capacity to meet the urgent need for primary care services in eastern Alameda County. Renovation of a recently purchased space, estimated to be completed in late 2014, will result in 28 exam rooms, eight behavioral health rooms, a pharmacy, and administrative space. La Cl\u00ednica EHR Implementation La Cl\u00ednica used its Measure A funding to expand its capacity to utilize EHR and its capabilities by centralizing and e xpanding it s IT de partment. L a C l\u00ednica hir ed additional IT st aff t o supp ort im plementation of t he Elec tronic Practice Management (EPM), a part of the NextGen system that manages all patient appointment scheduling, tracking of patient demographic and diagnoses and visit data, and billing data. Implementing the EPM is the precursor and part of preparing for the EHR rollout. During the program year six sites went live with EHR, inc luding five s chool-based he alth c enters. L a C l\u00ednica i s wor king t o train st aff on E HR and ensur e t hat all site s have EHR properly up and running by 2015. Capital Infrastructure In May 2013, La Cl\u00ednica IT staff began relocating to the larger facility in Oakland that now houses all IT staff and c onsultants. The f ormer IT ar ea i s b eing r enovated t o c entralize L a C l\u00ednica's billing de partment. The cen tralization of billing staff and the billing hotline will build billing's capacity and improve services. LifeLong Medical Care EHR Implementation LifeLong has \"gone live\" with EHR systems at three major sites, which combined serve more than 11,000 patients. Two of the three sites have met federal EHR Meaningful Use requirements, with the third scheduled to meet these requirements in mid 2014. Capital Infrastructure The LifeLong West Berkeley capital project\u2014rehabilitation of an existing historic structure and a 12,000-square-foot addition\u2014is nearing completion, with occupancy scheduled for mid-August 2014. The project is being completed six weeks early and on budget. This project increases clinic capacity to provide high-quality care for current and new patients; better serves clients by improving efficiency; creates work areas designed for family-focused health care; promotes a collaborative, person-centered approach to physical and mental health; preserves the historic elements of the landmark 1927 building; and increases energy efficiency and reduces negative environmental impact. Native American Health Center EHR Implementation Native American Health Center used its Measure A allocation to support EHR planning and implementation 56at the 7 Directions clinic site in Oakland and to meet and achieve federal Meaningful Use standards. Funds supported the salaries and benefits of the EHR Project Assistant/Meaningful Use Coordinator and Information Database Technician. A small portion was also spent on supplies for developing EHR training materials for providers and support staff. As of June 30, 2013, all behavioral health care sites and school-based medical sites went live on EHR. Capital Infrastructure Native American Health Center used Measure A capital monies to beautify the Native American Health Center's International Blvd. location in Oakland, which houses the computer training room and the WIC, billing, pediatric dental, and behavioral health departments. Specific improvements include removal of an oil tank that had been left over from a previous tenant, purchasing an evaporative fan cooler for the 7 Directions clinic, and upgrading the alarm systems at both the 7 Directions clinic and the 3124 International Blvd. location. Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center EHR Implementation Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center used its Measure A funds to purchase additional NextGen licenses, a MAS 90 general ledger accounts receivable interface that allows them to download revenue data from MAS 90 directly to their accounting software, a Quest orders result interface that allows them to electronically retrieve lab results faster and directly to the patient files, a phone reminder interface to automatically call patients to remind them of appointments, and an i2i referral manager interface that automatically sends referrals documented in the NextGen EHR to the i2i software to produce internal and external reports to monitor and improve access to care for patients. Capital Infrastructure Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center applied $51,345.98 of its grant to acquire a property in San Leandro, on which they will build a 20,000-square-foot clinic to provide primary care, women's services, pediatrics, dental care, and some specialty care. The new clinic will dramatically expand access to services for residents in the unincorporated area of Ashland as well as San Leandro. Tiburcio Vasquez spent the remaining $33,000 of the grant on computers and dental equipment purchased for the Silva Pediatric Clinic in Hayward, which Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center newly acquired from St. Rose Hospital. The organization serves more than 3,000 low-income children at this location. Tri-City Health Center EHR Implementation Tri-City Health Center conducted planning with clinicians and staff in preparation for the launch of the EHR implementation in the fall of 2013. Tri-City Health Center is converting a large volume of patient records to the new EHR system. They used Measure A funds to purchase lab tracking software and to partially offset the cost of scanning and abstracting medical records. Tri-City Health Center expects all sites to fully implement the EHR system by September 2014, supporting the care of more than 20,000 patients. Capital Infrastructure Tri-City Health Center used its capital allocation to complete computer hardware and cabling for the EHR implementation at its Mowry Ave. and Liberty St. clinic sites. Tri-City Health Center also used a portion of its 57capital allocation to increase its primary care capacity to see more patients. To do so, Tri-City Health Center contracted with Coleman and Associates to help improve workflows and enhance productivity and efficiency. West Oakland Health Council EHR Implementation West Oakland Health Council implemented the NextGen EHR at all primary care sites. West Oakland Health Council used its Measure A funds to purchase an i2i interface referral tracking system, purchase a pharmacy management system, and cover other hosting, licenses, and training expenses. The new EHR system supports the care of more than 17,000 patients seen by West Oakland Health Council. Capital Infrastructure West Oakland Health Council used its capital funds to improve disabled access by installing three new handicap-accessible doors; improve access to cancer screening by installing mammography equipment; and conduct necessary building maintenance such as replacing flooring and repairing the roof.

Care coordination for adjudicated or foster care youth confined to the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center, a facility run by the county's Probation Department, and treated by physicians from Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland, has been significantly improved through the California Telehealth Network (CTN), a new collaboration afforded through use of telehealth equipment. The benefit of this collaboration through care transitions can continue as patients return to their communities after being released. One of the best opportunities for using the telehealth technology resides at Children's Hospital Oakland, with a large physician base that benefits from access to learning opportunities. More opportunities can be explored 58as site partners begin to consider the wider circle of telehealth use outside of patient/doctor interactions. With the large numbers of diverse Limited English Proficiency (LEP) populations in the County, implementing video capability for medical interpretation is becoming an imperative. The telehealth carts include videoconferencing equipment that allows for the interpreter to be \"virtually\" present in the room. Video allows interpreters to access important visual body language cues that enhance their ability to facilitate the most effective, sensitive, high-quality, and safe communication between patient and provider. Reducing wait times to access interpreter services and removing costs associated with travel and wait time for interpreters allows hospitals and clinics to become more efficient in serving both providers and patients.

He had to sit at an almost 90-degree angle while sleeping to be able to breathe properly. Staff repeatedly tried to make follow-up appointments to take place after his release, but they never took place. Attempts to place him in a group home setting were unsuccessful, as every home refused him because of his medical condition. The JJC clinician then decided to use telemedicine to provide additional care via ENT department and outpatient surgery. Although challenges existed with CHRCO because of the youth's size and condition, the use of this technology enabled the youth to avoid extended detainment at JJC.59CAPITAL EXPANSION: ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES, AXIS COMMUNITY HEALTH, LIFELONG MEDICAL CARE, INC., TIBURCIO VASQUEZ HEALTH CENTER, INC.

The objective of the Fire Station Health Portals is to provide a new access point for comprehensive primary and preventative care to communities in critical need of health care services. In addition, the portal will provide insurance enrollment assistance, connection to a medical home, and emergency department and hospital discharge follow-up. The portal model in Hayward, the first site, will reduce wait times for patients seen at community clinics by guaranteeing primary care appointments within 72 hours and providing extended hours. During the first two years of operation, over 5,000 new patients are projected to be seen at the Hayward site, the majority of whom will consist of low-income, uninsured, and indigent residents. Ability to pay is not a factor in receipt of care. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Rollout of the first portal site in Hayward is anticipated in spring 2015. Thus, no clients have been served at the clinic at this time.

He gained a lot of weight from his medication and experienced several visits to the emergency room. Through the Health Promoter program, the client became more engaged about changing his behaviors. He enjoyed the support of the group environment. The Health Promoter started attending the client's doctor's appointments and helped facilitate a referral to a physical therapist. The client learned he was incorrectly taking his medication and was educated on diabetes and healthy eating. Within two years he was meeting his goals, and his diabetes was considered controlled. His vision and his ability to walk were no longer an issue. 64 Mental health and well-being.

A specific program of HCSA focused on increasing eligibility and enrollment into the Health Program of Alameda County (HealthPAC), a low-income health program, to ensure that clients enrolled in HealthPAC made a seamless transition to Medi-Cal in 2013 as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funds allowed HCSA to develop the necessary data systems to administratively transfer a subset of HealthPAC enrollees to Medi-Cal. To achieve this objective, HCSA employed a consulting firm to assist in developing the appropriate business processes, policies and procedures, and data systems, which ultimately led to 40,000 Alameda County newly eligible residents enrolled in Medi-Cal on January 1, 2014. In concert with HCSA, the consultants provided the following services: Database development. Developed a database used to document and track HealthPAC enrollees who would transition to Medi-Cal on January 1, 2014.Measure A Helps HEALTH INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT Seventy-one-year-old Betty, a retiree, had Medicare but needed supplemental insurance. Betty was denied Medi-Cal for being over the limit of allowable assets/property. The Medi-Cal worker explained that Betty had to decrease the $30,000 balance in her IRA to an allowable $3,000 to be approved for Medi-Cal. Although she needed the supplemental coverage, Betty did not want to risk spending down her IRA for fear of losing her life savings. After examining the situation, a Health Insurance Enrollment Assistance technician determined Betty was eligible for HealthPAC. Betty applied for and was accepted into the HealthPAC program, which provided supplemental coverage while not penalizing her for saving money for her retirement.67 Staff training. Trained health insurance technicians and auditors on how to properly document HealthPAC enrollees that transitioned to Medi-Cal, so that this information could be regularly provided to the State Department of Health Care Services. Data provided. Worked with staff to provide detailed data to each of the HealthPAC medical homes showing which HealthPAC members were transitioning to Medi-Cal and which ones would remain in the program. Coordination with Social Services. Participated and facilitated regular meetings with HCSA and Alameda County Department of Social Services staff about the transition. The consultants also worked on ensuring that Social Services received data regularly on the people who transitioned.

The DLC continues to develop culturally competent material for its clientele and to train Peer Health Educators to provide outreach and information services to this population. The DLC provides services in the following areas: Mental health. The DLC works provides workshops and informational meetings to help educate workers about mental health needs and issues related to domestic violence. Alcohol and drug. The DLC provides workers with literature about the effects of alcohol and drug use and abuse. Hospital and inpatient services. The DLC portal services use hospital services for extreme and/or 68emergency cases only, with use of lab and other specialty services as needed. Public health prevention. The DLC offers Zumba classes for women workers, develops and monitors individual health plans for weight and diabetes management and prevention, and provides HIV prevention education and screening. Outpatient services. In addition to ancillary services provided by the Davis Street Clinic and/or St. Rose Hospital sites, the County provides DLC workers with dental services three months out of the year. Youth and community services. The DLC provides services to the indigent population and youth from the surrounding neighborhood, including job skills training and community volunteer service opportunities. Socialization. The DLC maintains a community garden and has a 20-team soccer league to address the workers' ailments of depression, isolation, and loneliness due to being separated from the families in their home countries. Other services. When workers are physically attacked for their cash, DLC helps them fill out police reports and supports them to recuperate both physically and mentally. DLC also helps workers with the \"U-Visa\" process, which allows them to reside in the U.S. legally.

The Alameda County \"Getting the Most Out of Life (GMOL)\" program is designed to increase knowledge and utilization of the hospice benefit. The GMOL mission is to reduce suffering and improve quality of care for residents of Alameda County. Its key indicators are community members and organizations, medical providers/clinical staff and referring providers, health plans and associations, public health leadership, the terminally ill, hospice patients, and family members. GMOL addresses bereavement, loss, and grief in terms of understanding these emotions as part of the healing process and learning how to cope as individuals transition through the stages. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A provides 100% of the funding for the GMOL program.

MBA's mission is to help youth transform harmful behavior and live meaningful lives through the practices of mindfulness meditation and emotional awareness. MBA also engages in customized curriculum development and training for service providers working with at-risk youth regionally and nationally. The heart of MBA's work is to provide the most at-risk youth in the most difficult environments\u2014probation detention facilities, youth detention camps, and at-risk schools\u2014with concrete tools to reduce stress, impulsivity, and violent behavior and increase self-esteem, self-regulation, and overall well-being.

MBA Executive Director Sam Himelstein met at various times with medical staff and guidance clinic (BHCS) staff to collaborate about reinforcing services. HIGHLIGHTS Measure A funding helped enable MBA to provide services to 750 transitional age youth. Research data analyzed in the past year revealed a 10-15% decrease in stress and 15-20% increase in self-regulation among the youth served. MBA program staff worked effectively at establishing a cooperative working relationship with probation department staff. Measure A support also enabled MBA to hire a new executive director with a comprehensive clinical vision to serve ACJJC youth after they become released. The goal of this new expanded program will be to track youth in MBA programs once released to help reduce recidivism and prevent violence. CONCERNS MBA was unable to collect any data in FY 12/13, due in part to data collection being halted by MBA's leadership transition. This makes it difficult to determine program effectiveness.78MEDICAL COSTS FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE CENTER: VICTIMS FY savings transferred to Types of services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Mental Health Individuals served: Adult, Children, Families, Seniors, Indigent, Low Income, UninsuredMeasure A /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Victim/Witness Assistance Division of the Alameda County District Attorney's Office supports and empowers crime victims and their families by promoting their rights within the criminal justice system and providing services to aid in their recovery from the emotional, psychological, social, and economic impact of crime as they reclaim their sense of safety, well-being, and dignity.

The program spoke to Dee's doctor and clarified her care as mom had misunderstood the doctor, thinking she was to take Dee to Oakland from Livermore each time she wheezed, which was a hardship because they did not have a car. The family was followed for four months and during this time, Dee has not required any emergency room or urgent care visits. 96vacuums, etc. Families are linked to any needed services such as food, housing, medical home, and insurance. Eighty-three percent of the children/adolescents seen last year were covered by a Medi-Cal program and from low-income families. Asthma Start is the only program in the County doing in-home asthma case management, which is key for identifying triggers and controlling asthma. Physicians do not see their patient's home where the triggers exist, so medication can be given but control may not be obtained. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Asthma Start used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following objectives: Increase c aregivers k nowledge of a sthma (t arget: 90% of car egiver passing an asthma with a score of 90% or better; actual: 98% of caregivers) Help c tain or r educe a sthma s ymptoms lowest children; actual: 99%) Help c a t ast one iden hma trigger (target: 95% of caregivers; t c hildren r equiring ho spital or emergenc y department c c onfidence in heir c hild's sthma 367 children/adolescents in FY 12/13, 100 more than in any other year of the program. Measure A funding helped enable the program to meet or exceed all of its target objectives. The effectiveness of this program is evident in the reduction of hospitalizations from 32% prior to case management to 3% post-case management, and emergency department visits from 56% prior to case management to 13% post. In addition, the Asthma Start program leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $36,300 in matching funds from the following sources: Every C hild Coun ts Kaiser Comm unity B enefit Targeted C ase Managemen tMeasure A Helps ALAMEDA COUNTY ASTHMA START Zach, 4, was referred to Asthma Start after being diagnosed with asthma with symptoms including severe coughing and shortness of breath. Zach was taking a controller and allergy medication. The Asthma Coordinator worked with Dad to get Zach's medications organized. At the home, the corner near the fireplace had mold, the fireplace had no flue, the stove fan needed a cover, and the heater contained fiberglass. Asthma Start referred the case to Healthy Homes, who put in a fan over the stove and worked with the landlord to fix the fireplace and heater. The family received dust-mite mattress and pillow covers as well as a vacuum. Zach is now doing much better and has not had any recent symptoms. 97 CALIFORNIA PREVENTION & EDUCATION PROJECT FY 12/13 allocation: $250,000 Expended/encumbered FY savings transferred to Types of services provided: Public Health Individuals served: IncomeMeasure the FY 12/13 reporting period AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The California Prevention & Education Project (CAL-PEP) was founded in 1984 and is nationally recognized for its effective approaches to working with hard-to-reach, high-risk populations. CAL-PEP works in East and West Oakland, as well as other communities throughout Alameda and San Francisco Counties, to serve those who have limited access to health care. CAL-PEP has assisted in pioneering effective prevention strategies in street outreach and mobile HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted disease (STD), and hepatitis testing. CAL-PEP provides accessible health education, disease prevention, risk reduction, and support services to people at high risk for or currently living with HIV/AIDS. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y CAL-PEP will use its Measure A allocation to purchase a mobile clinic vehicle. Once the medical van is in use, the program will provide family planning services and STD testing and treatment to underserved areas in East and West Oakland. The clinic will also address issues of stigma many people in these areas face when seeking treatment, especially for STDs. During the FY 12/13 reporting period, CAL-PEP identified the mobile clinic vehicle for purchase and bought some equipment and medical supplies. CAL-PEP expected to start services in August 2013.98 CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL Board of FY savings transferred to Types of services provided: Public Health Individuals served: Adults, Children, Families, Seniors, Indigent, Low Income, UninsuredMeasure NA*) direct services AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND California Product Stewardship Council (CPSC) works to shift California's product waste management system from one focused on government-funded and ratepayer-financed waste diversion to one that relies primarily on producer responsibility to reduce public costs and drive improvements in product design that promote environmental sustainability. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y CPSC used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following objectives: Monitor legislation and policy relevant to pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical take-back, and drug disposal at the state and federal level. CPSC monitored federal, state, and local legislation and reported to County staff on what was happening in other areas regarding safe medication disposal rules. Educate local hospitals on the Alameda Drug Ordinance. CPSC organized and participated in a webinar hosted by the Center for Environmental Health for the Northern California hospital group to ensure they understood the ordinance and its benefits to public health, encouraging rollout of the program. Set up and organize a national call to create a sustainable hospital group on education and understanding of the Alameda Drug Ordinance. CPSC presented on two national webinars on the subject of medication disposal and discussed organization of a national hospital group. There is not enough activity nationally to support such a working group at this time. Organize Sacramento stakeholder meetings to support the implementation of the ordinance. A site visit is planned for fall 2014. Organize a national call to engage stakeholders regarding the progress and gather support for the ordinance. CPSC participated in two national calls and presented at the northwest conference of Hazardous Materials Managers on the Alameda medication ordinance and the need to coordinate efforts between counties considering the same. Coordinate with radio and other media outlets about press coverage, including developing articles and op-eds to bring awareness of the ordinance and press release development and support. CPSC reviewed an op-ed and made corrections to one published in June by a UC Berkeley student in the paper. CPSC was co-99lead finalizing the joint press release with King County Washington and the Product Stewardship Institute. Develop outreach material messaging as requested by the County, including a fact sheet about the ordinance. CPSC completed the fact sheet on the ordinance development and updated it to include new information about the ruling in the Ninth Circuit Court. Provide assistance and support as requested by County in responding to challenges of the ordinance. CPSC compiled data and facilitated communication efforts to respond to local challenges by the Sierra Club regarding the fact that the medications once collected are incinerated. Attend and participate in the Alameda County Medical Disposal (MEDS) coalition meetings and program rollout meetings as requested by the County. CPSC participated in all the MEDS coalition meetings either in person or via conference, presenting updates on legislation, data, and future presentations and connections. Assist and provide input for the Safe Drug Disposal Conference. CPSC participated in the planning, arranged speakers, and conducted a presentation at the conference. Participate in other research, education, and outreach projects requested by the County to assist in the purposes set forth above. CPSC responded to a variety of requests during the grant term, including contacting legislators from other states to coordinate support from the National Association of Counties for safe medication disposal across the country, posting to social media, coordinating with professors from Georgia to get funding for more research on the benefits of ordinances like Alameda's, and meeting with new product developers of medication disposal bins. CONCERNS CPSC used its Measure A funding to implement a County ordinance promoting the safe disposal of medications for all residents. The Committee questions whether this meets the letter or spirit of the Measure A statute. CPSC used these funds as part of a public awareness campaign that was not limited to \"indigent, low-income, and uninsured adults, children, families, and seniors of Alameda County. \" While the Committee does not question the usefulness of the safe medication disposal ordinance, the use of Measure A funds for this purpose appears to fall outside the scope of the statute. In addition, the provider included no specific measurements or statistics to indicate the effectiveness of the public awareness campaign.100CENTER FOR EARLY INTERVENTION FY savings transferred to Types of services provided: Public Health Individuals served: Children, Families, Indigent, Low IncomeMeasure clients served: 857 ( Total clients: 1,475) Service area: Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Castro Valley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Newark, Oakland, Pleasanton, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Union City AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Center for Early Intervention on Deafness (CEID) provides a wide range of services and supports for families to maximize the communication potential of children, from birth through 5, who are deaf, are hard of hearing, and/or have severe speech and language delays. CEID provides audiological services, including hearing evaluations and dispensing of hearing devices, to Alameda County children, many from low-income, ethnically diverse families. Without the availability of CEID's audiological services, many of these children would be undiagnosed and would not have proper hearing devices. In addition, CEID provides regular trainings to pediatric residents from Alameda County hospitals in the early identification of hearing loss and the resources available to them and their patients. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funding helped enable CEID staff (two part-time audiologists, one part-time hearing screening specialist, one full-time bilingual audiology coordinator, and one part-time bilingual audiology assistant) to provide services five days per week by appointment and through referrals from medical providers.Measure A Helps CENTER FOR EARLY INTERVENTION ON DEAFNESS Freddy began to lose hearing in both ears around age 2. His family did not have enough money for two hearing aids. When Freddy came to CEID for preschool, he had lost almost all hearing in both ears, and his one hearing aid was not programmed to his current level of hearing loss. When Freddy was referred to the CEID audiology clinic, the audiologist reprogrammed Freddy's one hearing aid and provided a loaner for the other ear. As an active preschooler, Freddy was rough on his hearing aid, breaking the tubing, separating the ear mold, etc. Instead of waiting days or weeks to get an appointment, he could walk across the courtyard and have it repaired the same day. 101Measure A funding helped CEID provide the following services: Newborn he aring s creenings (t arget: 135 p atients; ac tual: 139) Audiological e valuations (t arget: 392 p atients; ac tual: 265) Hearing aid s and mold s (t arget: 230 p atients; ac tual: 289) Hearing s creenings/Head S tart (t arget: 122 p atients; ac tual: 93) Training f or p ediatric r esidents (t arget: 78 r esidents; ac tual: 71) HIGHLIGHTS In areas of newborn hearing screenings and hearing aids and molds, CEID exceeded its target numbers in providing services. CEID served a large number of patients overall. In addition, CEID leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain an additional $25,000 in matching funds (the maximum possible) from the Medi-Cal Administrative Activities (MAA) program. CONCERNS CEID reports that 58% of patients were treated using Measure A funds. However, Measure A funds represent only 2.5% of the agency's total budget and only 18% of the budget allocated to performance of services. The Committee would like some clarification about this discrepancy.

Centerforce partners with state prisons, county jails, law enforcement, and social service and medical providers to reach over 20,000 individuals annually. Headquartered at San Quentin, Centerforce provides direct services in Santa Rita Jail and four state prisons as well as direct services to communities and families of the incarcerated in Oakland, San Francisco, the Bay Area counties, and Fresno and Madera counties.102MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Centerforce used its Measure A allocation to conduct focus groups with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people, as well as individual interviews with hepatitis C care providers. With this funding, Centerforce was able to discover information about the Hepatitis C services available to indigent populations in Alameda County as well as awareness of these services. Specifically, Centerforce conducted five focus groups with 52 participants total: 35 inside Santa Rita Jail (10 men and 25 women) and 17 on the outside (five men and 12 women). Centerforce also interviewed 13 community health clinicians or program directors (seven M.D.s, one nurse practitioner, one physician's assistant, four program directors) representing 14 different agencies/entities. HIGHLIGHTS As a result of this assessment, Centerforce was able to successfully compete for funding to provide Hepatitis C testing, treatment, and care services to men and women transitioning back to Alameda County from incarcerated settings. Centerforce leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $200,000 in matching funds from an Alameda County Public Health Innovations grant (Innovations in Reentry). CONCERNS The Committee notes that the organization does not list any accomplishments and is unsure of the connection between the purpose of Measure A and the services this organization provides. While the organization lists a $200,000 matching grant, Centerforce used Measure A funds to conduct focus groups with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people and did not provide direct health services. CITY OF SAN LEANDRO FY savings transferred to of Health AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The City of San Leandro offers a wide range of activities, services, and resources for seniors. Within the city, the Recreation and Human Services Department strongly emphasizes the importance of health and wellness. Programs are designed to foster healthy independent living, educate the public about how they can achieve 103improved health and wellness, enhance quality of life, and build a sense of belonging and community among older adults, caregivers, and families. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funding has supported the City of San Leandro in offering programs, services, and education that are aimed at prevention and improving health outcomes. The opening of the new Senior Community Center combined with the additional support of Measure A has significantly impacted the opportunities afforded to the local senior population. Prior to opening the Senior Community Center, the Senior Services staff was significantly reduced through budget cuts. Although the Senior Community Center has been thriving since opening in April, it has been a challenge to operate the facility and grow programs with limited staff. The additional part-time staff provided by the Measure A grant have allowed Recreation and Human Services to maintain quality senior services, grow programs, and continue to offer critical health and wellness services to San Leandro seniors. Measure A funding supports a comprehensive health and wellness framework by allowing the City of San Leandro to offer the following critical programs to seniors. The City of San Leandro set an attendance objective of 50% of Senior Community Center members participate in programs and services formulated to promote health and wellness.

For over 40 years, DSFRC has provided \"just in time\" services to working poor families, supporting single mothers and fathers to move out of poverty through safety net programs and by caring for nearly 1,200 children each day. DSFRC safety net programs include an emergency food and clothing program; information and referral; and a free and low-cost medical, dental, and mental health clinic. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y DSFRC used its Measure A allocation to hire a clinical supervisor and part-time family advocate, providing a reliable fiscal stream to expand and strengthen its outpatient mental health program. These funds enabled DSFRC to offer the necessary supervision, training, program evaluation, and planning for eight mental health interns who were placed in five San Leandro Unified School District schools. The interns provided family and individual counseling and assessment to 130 low-income and underinsured/uninsured clients, who otherwise would not have accessed mental health services either due to long waiting lists, cost, or other barriers. Measure A funding helped DSFRC achieve the following measurable objectives: Health services. Full integration of uninsured and underinsured clients who currently access acute, primary Measure A Helps DAVIS STREET FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER A tragedy four days before Christmas led Susan to DSFRC, after her two school-age nieces arrived home from school to find that their mother had passed. Susan appealed to Davis Street's mental health staff for toys and a holiday basket for her nieces. Although the toys and baskets had been allocated, staff was able to fulfill Susan's request and worked to integrate supportive services that included assistance in obtaining legal guardianship and mental health services. Susan's nieces began receiving services in the outpatient mental health clinic and continue to work through their grief one day at a time. Today, Susan's eldest niece actively participates in a youth development program and is an honor roll student. 105care, physical therapy, dental, and mental health services (target: 1,225 clients) - Prov ided access to all DSFRC services to 2,083 clients - Prov ided family, individual counseling, and assessment to Medi-Cal clients through ACCESS to 165 clients - Prov ided low-cost individual and family counseling to 130 clients - Prov ided case management to ensure access to all services to 2,083 clients Family support services.

REACH AYC works in partnership with the Alameda County Deputy Sheriffs' Activities League (DSAL) to provide recreation programming to young people in the unincorporated Ashland and San Lorenzo areas of Alameda County.106MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y The DSAL and REACH AYC used their Measure A allocation to achieve the following objectives: Create a menu of fitness and recreation programs for each of the three zones: Bohannon Middle, Edendale Middle, and Washington Manor Middle. In a four-month period, all three middle school locations had a specific recreation component designed, comprised of boxing conditioning, yoga, volleyball, strength and fitness, hip-hop dance, and talk-it-out/walk-it-out. Coordinate all coaches/volunteer leaders to run each program/class. Enroll youth into the activities so that each program has participants who are most local to that particular zone. One hundred fifty members enrolled across school sites, including 40 girls in volleyball, 50 in basketball, 30 in dance, and 45 in boxing. Conduct pre-assessments with all new participants and post-program assessments. The surveys revealed that programming improved the attitudes of 90% of participants toward fitness programs. It also enhanced the confidence of 85% of participants to try new things and take part in sports activities. Maintain regular contact with participants and their families to ensure ongoing participation and satisfaction with the programming. DSAL's community organizer checked in with youth and families on a regular basis via phone calls and emails. Approximately 10 email blasts went out to families about additional health and safety resources available to them. Increase awareness of healthy food and other resources for health and safety in the community. One hundred community members attended a spaghetti feed where food was prepared with healthy ingredients. The fair featured six community resource tables disseminating information from resources including the library, drug awareness organizations, the Hayward Area Recreation and Park District, and the food bank.

Drivers for Survivors used its Measure A allocation to produce and distribute appropriate amounts of outreach materials that matched its size. These materials include brochures distributed to a wide range of hospitals and medical centers throughout the Bay Area, as well as volunteer packets and client packets distributed to all new clients and volunteer drivers. Drivers for Survivors created and distributed packets to 1,250 patients at a cost of $2.00 each. HIGHLIGHTS Measure A funding helped Drivers for Survivors surpass its goal of providing 1,000 client rides over a 10-month period (actual: 1,110 rides provided). Client surveys report 100% client satisfaction and an 85% \"excellent\" rating for on-time arrival. Measure A Helps DRIVERS FOR SURVIVORS, INC. Katherine, age 90, volunteered at the Kaiser Permanente Fremont Medical Center until a few years ago. Katherine doesn't drive, so a doctor at Kaiser recommended Drivers for Survivors as a way to get to her weekly oncology appointments. She lives three miles from the hospital and had no other viable options. \"Most of my friends have passed away, and the others have canes or medical problems,\" she said. Since August, a Drivers for Survivors volunteer has been providing weekly transportation for Katherine. The driver waits at the hospital and then drives her home again.

The Center also offers preventive health care and education, such as physical exercise, line dance, yoga, meditation, fall prevention, and nutritional education, to support the physical and mental health of the seniors and reduce their medical expenses. Finally, the Center helps seniors obtain and manage social services including Medicare, Medi-Cal, in-home support services (IHSS), Social Security disability insurance (SSI), Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants (CAPI), general assistance, and more, and provides translation and interpretation of English documents into Korean. The Center provides an information respite center for spouses and caregivers of dementia patients. By attending the Center together, the caregivers can enjoy a social experience while the rest of the group helps watch out and care for the dementia patient. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y East Bay Korean American Senior Services Center used its Measure A allocation to install new flooring in its multipurpose room, social room, and office. This one-time capital improvement helped ensure that senior clients can participate in all the activities the Center offers.Measure A Helps EAST BAY kOREAN AMERICAN SENIOR SERVICES CENTER As one example of the care seniors at the Center receive, the Executive Director noticed one woman's complexion was very yellow and talked to the woman about her condition. This prompted the woman to visit her doctor, who discovered that the woman had a blocked carotid artery and needed surgery right away. Now she is healthy and does lots of volunteer work in the Center kitchen. In another example, a male senior got very sick at the Center, with vomiting and diarrhea. While other seniors helped clean him up, the Executive Director called 911 for an ambulance. It turned out the man had a bad case of food poisoning, but was back rejoining the activities at the Center the next day.109HIGHLIGHTS Before replacing the floor, Center staff had concerns that a senior might be caught by the tears in the floor and fall down. The new floor alleviates that worry and allows seniors who may otherwise not have an opportunity to socialize among their own culture to fully enjoy meals and entertainment. CONCERNS The Committee notes that the provider did not mention how many meals it served during the year, and that it provided services for a total of 125 clients. This seems like a low number.

While the outreach and education associated with the HNSR program are geared toward nail salon workers and owners, the program helps prevent exposure to chemicals to the unborn via mothers' exposure in the workplace. It also helps prevent second-hand exposure to children via contaminants brought by workers from workplace to home on their work clothing. The HNSR program achieves its goals through the following activities: Identifying t he mo st pr oblematic nail salon pr oducts and pr ocesses s o t hat salon wor kers k now wher e t he highe st risks are and where the highest priorities are to seek alternatives Identifying pr eferable pr oducts and prac tices f or im proved wor ker, c lient, and c ommunity saf ety Identifying r eliable inf ormation s ources f or salon wor kers Offering a r ebate t o c over all or mo st of t he c ost of pur chasing and inst alling a pproved air pur ification equipmen t for work stations Providing a t ool (r ecognition c ertificate and u se of lo go) t o salons t o pr omote t hemselves a s H ealthy N ail Salons Providing a w ay f or public/c lients t o iden tify salons w ith he pr oducts and prac tices Issuing training c ertificates f or wor kers s o t hat t heir ne w k nowledge i s do cumented and transf erable t o ne w po sitions MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y ACEH used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: HNSR pr ogram de velopment - Le arn technical/toxics issues and industry sector materials and practices - Rec ruit program partners and establish local advisory work group - Iden tify program models and appropriate standards for recognition - De velop training curriculum for nail salon owners and workers - Engage c ulturally competent staff and outside resources - Se t up forms and tracking mechanisms - Wor k with the California Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative and Asian Health Services to do outreach to members, direct mail, workshops, and media outreach - Par ticipate in regional government work group to gain information from compliance agencies and other local HNSR programs and to share lessons learned Provide training f or salons - Offer wor kshops for interested salon owners or managers considering applying - Prov ide onsite worker training for employees Measure A funding helped the ACEH/HNSR program achieve the following measurable outcomes: Notify over 330 Al ameda Coun ty nail salons a bout t he H NSR pr ogram by mail, and notif y an additional 35 Alame da County salons that are members of the CA Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative through the Collaborative Provide wor kshop training t o 22 salon ow ners and managers Receive a pplications f rom 16 salons f or H NSR r ecognition Train 30 wor kers a t salons or a t ow ner wor kshops113 Replace over 75% of nail polish products at seven salons with safer formulations HIGHLIGHTS With a very small budget and less than half expended, the report notes that 357 clients were served.

ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH: GPS MONITORING SYSTEM FY savings transferred to Types of services provided: Public Health Individuals served: Adults, Children, Families, Seniors, Indigent, Low Income, UninsuredMeasure NA*) provide direct services AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Alameda County Environmental Health Department (EHD) supports the health, safety, and well-being of the public through promotion of environmental quality. EHD uses enforcement authority, education, and cooperation to promote awareness of environmental protection, environmental justice, and pollution prevention. The EHD mobile food placarding program incorporates GPS surveillance and other tools to help ensure a safer food supply for all consumers of food sold by mobile food operations in Alameda County. Identifying which trucks are operating improperly through field inspections and then posting placards encourages the mobile food operators to make the necessary changes so their food is safer. Safer food reduces the incidence of illness from food trucks. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y EHD used its Measure A allocation to help develop a Mobile Food Facility (MFF) placarding program as an augmentation to the existing food vehicle compliance program, which is charged with monitoring and regulating mobile food vendors.

The Committee expresses a concern that these services, while worthwhile, have no relation to the original intent for distribution of Measure A funds. The Committee also notes that the amount of Measure A funding spent on salaries and administrative costs far exceeds the amount spent on actual program costs, but the agency does not give any explanation of the benefit achieved by these expenditures. Finally, the agency does not account for the approximately $15,000 left unspent from its Measure A allocation.Given these concerns, the Committee recommends that this agency not receive Measure A funding in the future.115HIV EDUCATION & PREVENTION PROJECT OF ALAMEDA COUNTY Board of Supervisors discretionary allocation: District 3/Supervisor Chan, FY savings transferred to reserve: $0 Types of services provided: Emergency Medical, Public Health, Substance Abuse Individuals served: Adults, Children, Seniors, Indigent, Low Income, UninsuredMeasure 536 ( 1,284) Service area: Alameda, Hayward, Oakland, San Leandro, Homeless or transient, Outside of Alameda County AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The HIV Education and Prevention Project of Alameda County (HEPPAC) works to stop the further spread of preventable diseases among increased risk populations in the communities it serves. HEPPAC strives to reduce the impact of harm by addressing external barriers and increasing access to basic needs services. HEPPAC clients can conveniently access free drop in services that are client-centered and low threshold. The HEPPAC clinical staff are highly skilled and provide safer injection trainings, conduct overdose prevention trainings, and distribute life-saving Narcan to intravenous drug user (IDU) clients receiving wound care services through the clinic. Clients have reduced the mortality and morbidity related to active substance use as a result of these services. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A has contributed to improving the overall health results of HEPPAC's client population by providing critical wound care and clinical services to extremely low income, marginalized active injection drug users and high-risk youth and young adults engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners who generally do not access traditional hospital and clinic settings. Measure A Helps HIV EDUCATION & PREVENTION PROJECT OF ALAMEDA COUNTY Ms. M. was homeless when she first accessed HEPPAC clinic services. Through a referral to a shelter, she was able to receive housing. Ms. M. was a substance user who refused to go to a traditional medical facility because of stigma and poor treatment. She did not have a primary care physician. Through risk-reduction counseling at HEPPAC, Ms. M. reported a reduction in use. In addition, Ms. M. tested positive and was subsequently treated for chlamydia. Ms. M. was also tested and referred into primary care services for Hepatitis C (HCV). Because of Ms. M.'s resistance to medical services at traditional clinics, she would not have accessed support and would not have gotten treatment if not for HEPPAC. 116Measure A-funded services conducted by HEPPAC include the following: Testing and tr eatment f or s exually transmit ted inf ections t o yout h and young adult s pr imarily r esiding in E ast Oak land Abscess/wound c are t o p eople who in ject dr ugs Overdose pr evention e ducation and N arcan di stribution Safer in jection training s f or ac tive I DUs General he alth s creenings f or Coun ty r esidents who ar e home less and a t le ast 13 ye ars of age H EPPAC used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following measurable objectives: Perform a bscess/wound c are s ervices a t t he C asa S egura sit e (t arget: 200 I DU v isits, 50 unduplic ated I DUs; act ual: 417 IDU visits, 228 unduplicated IDUs) Perform a bscess/wound c are f ollow-up s ervices a t H EPPAC's s yringe (S EP) lo at Segura site; actual: 326 IDUs, 127 at Casa Segura site) Refer c lients f rom H EPPAC S EPs t o C asa S egura f or S TI, H IV, and/or H CV ra pid t esting, and pr ovide tre atment for those who test positive for chlamydia and/or gonorrhea at the Casa Segura drop-in center (target: 100 client referrals; actual: 119 client referrals) Refer I DUs and/or t heir s exual p artners who t est p ositive f or H IV and/or H CV t o pr imary c are s ervices a s nee ded (actual: 140 referrals) Conduct S afer In jection wor kshops and O verdose Pr evention training t o all wound c are p atients dur ing sy ringe access hours and at the Casa Segura drop-in center (actual: 56 Safer Injection workshops with 98 participants, 34 Overdose Prevention trainings with 38 participants) LATINO COMMISSION ON ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE FY 12/13 allocation: $150,000 Expended/encumbered FY savings transferred to Types of services provided: Substance Abuse Individuals served: Families, Indigent, Oakland AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Latino Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse of Alameda County provides education, prevention, intervention, and treatment of alcohol- and drug-related problems through multi-modality, culturally, and linguistically appropriate programs and services. The agency has been providing services to the population of Alameda County for almost 43 years through six major components. Centro de Juventud is a youth center dedicated to the prevention of the use of drugs and alcohol by youth between t he age s of 7-18 ye ars.

Since its inception, Centro de Juventud has continually conducted community assessments to identify and address the ever-changing needs of a community in transition. The staff of Centro de Juventud participates in yearly ongoing staff trainings to deepen their cultural competency skills. Centro serves clients from many Latin American nations (predominantly Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), and training focuses on appreciating the differing styles and needs of sub-groups within the Latino population based on geographic regions (country of origin), socioeconomic status, and indigenous status.

Of the four children, three have attended Centro de Juventud at one time or another, two on a regular basis. Their mother says, \"I'm so grateful for Centro staff. If not for their efforts, my daughter could have lost a year in school. Staff have made every effort to speak to teachers and the principal to find out how to help my daughter succeed.\" The mother said that Centro has had other positive outcomes in their lives such as being able to navigate systems of care, being aware of their children's school progress, and showing their children positive activities and healthy relationships.118addition, Centro staff provided reading assistance and support to 75 youth.

Foster Advocacy Efforts to Address Community Priorities Coordinate grassroots advocacy skill-building workshops. An H2H resident planned and presented a Healthy Conductor workshop to help people become more accountable for their own health. The training included a video on African-American risks for stroke and heart attack and steps individuals and communities can adopt to reduce risk. Assist in organizing community meetings to bring together city departments and/or elected officials and neighbors to share successes and priorities. Over 75 residents mingled with city leaders, rekindled friendships, and made new friends at the Spring Block Party, a collaboration of LifeLong and the City of Berkeley Public Health Department (COB-PH). H2H and COB-PH offered glucose, HIV, and dental health screenings as well eligibility screening for food stamps and health insurance. A presentation and Q&A about the Affordable Care Act provided residents the opportunity to increase their understanding of health insurance options and identify next steps. Distribute mini-grants to support advocacy efforts. H2H awarded the following mini-grants:- Tw inkle Little Stars program: $2,700. This program is a social etiquette program designed to improve, 120enhance, and preserve the social skills of underserved young women between the ages of 6-18. The workshop served 32 youth and met for two hours per week over eight consecutive Saturdays. - McG ee Avenue Baptist Church: $2,100. This mini-grant helped the church expand its Backyard Garden Program to construct and maintain seven new Backyard Gardens for seniors and low-income residents in the H2H neighborhood. The Backyard Garden Program offers youth-led training for young parents and the elderly on organic gardening and healthy eating, as well as cooking demonstrations for heart-healthy meals. - Colla borating Agencies Responding to Disasters (CARD): $2,700. This mini-grant enabled CARD to provide a series of classes for the H2H community to promote empowering, sustainable disaster preparedness and response. (Note: Due to staff changes at CARD, the agency did not implement the classes.) Support Community Efforts to Build Strong Networks Among Neighbors Collaborate with the fire department, schools, COB-PH, and community-based organizations (CBOs) to provide disaster preparedness education to the H2H community including parents and students. H2H conducted disaster preparedness training at San Pablo Park in Berkeley, including valve shut-off and emergency kit preparation. H2H also held ongoing meetings at Oregon Park to develop an application for an emergency cache. Support neighbor-led projects, workshops, and classes in collaboration with public health. A group of neighbors who came together last year in conjunction with a mini-grant project have continued to meet regularly to plan neighborhood improvement efforts such as a neighborhood watch program. Reconnect with the Spanish-speaking population in H2H neighborhood. The program held one bilingual workshop in conjunction with Farm Fresh Choice, educating residents about healthy eating, smart food choices, and the CalFresh program. H2H volunteers also conducted door-to-door surveys with tenants at a housing complex in the neighborhood where the majority of the tenants are Spanish-speaking. Engage Residents in Activities to Promote Healthier Behaviors Organize produce distribution and at least two cooking classes in conjunction with local food justice and community gardening organizations. Weekly fresh produce giveaways continue at the LifeLong West Berkeley and LifeLong Over 60 Health Center sites, adjacent to the H2H neighborhood, under the auspices of the AmeriCorps volunteers and in partnership with various local farmers' market programs. Other food justice activities include the following:- The six -week Cooking Matters, presented twice to a total of 20 participants, teaches families how to cook healthy, affordable meals. Participants learn to shop smarter, make healthier food choices, and cook delicious meals. Food for these series is provided through another funding source. - In par tnership with the Ecology Center, the Fruit/Vegetable Rx Program features a medical provider who gives patients a \"prescription\" for fresh produce, redeemable at the local farmers market, as well as healthy cooking tips and nutrition counseling. - At a C alFresh food giveaway at Oregon Park Apartments, approximately 15 residents in attendance received fresh produce giveaways, provided by Farm Fresh Choice. - An \"It 's Time for Recess\" event held at the Young Adult Project (YAP) in honor of National Food Day brought neighbors together to share successes and identify priorities in an informal \"health fair\" atmosphere. - The Har vest Celebration at Oregon Park provided healthy Mediterranean food to nearly 30 people joining in the celebration. Offer health education workshops based on community requests, including healthy cooking, meditation, health insurance info, and other topics. In collaboration with COB-PH, H2H offered a series 121of 13 healthy eating workshops, with an average attendance of ten. H2H also held health education workshops in the community, including a blood pressure screening training workshop, and monthly informal trainings held on the City of Berkeley (COB)'s mobile van, which parks in the H2H neighborhood one Saturday per month. Increase the Social and Environmental Supports for Healthier Behavior Collaborate with other partners to establish \"Health Hubs. \" H2H and COB-PH staff, accompanied by volunteers, visit neighborhood barbershops a least once per month to support the barbers, provide information on hypertension and nutrition, make referrals for health and social service resources, and answer health-related questions. Assist in the coordination of door-to-door neighborhood visits. H2H conducted one door-to-door blood pressure screening event, in which every household was approached by Alameda County Health Pipeline Partnerships (ACHPP) EMS Corps, with additional support from two nurses. Provide \"benefit check-ups\" at H2H events. At virtually all H2H events, eligibility experts screen residents for a variety of benefits, including health insurance and CalFresh. In addition, online benefits check-ups are available for seniors. The program screened a total of 45 individuals. CONCERNS The Committee notes that this fund recipient spent 78% of the funds on 1.18 FTE staff and administrative overhead, and only 22% on direct services. Of the services provided, much of that was \"community empowerment\" and \"community mobility\" (including \"social etiquette\")\u2014the recipient report was not clear about specific outcomes. Finally, it appears that what was spent on direct services calculates out to about $190/target household. It is unclear what impact, if any, that had or could have on the Measure A target population. While recognizing that the expenditures on fresh food programs and improving eating habits do conform to the intent of Measure A, and while recognizing the value of disaster-preparedness and neighborhood watch programs, the Committee questions whether these latter programs meet the requirements of Measure A. 122OFFICE OF AIDS ADMINISTRATION: RYAN FY savings transferred to reserve: $0 Types of services provided: Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health, Substance Abuse Individuals served: Adults, Children, Families, Seniors, Indigent, Low Income, UninsuredMeasure 1,898) Service area: Countywide, transient, Outside of Alameda County AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Alameda County Public Health Department works in partnership with the community to ensure the optimal health and well-being of all people through a dynamic and responsive process respecting the diversity of the community and providing for present and future generations. Within the Public Health Department, the Office of AIDS Administration (OAA) works to reduce the rates of new HIV infections, increase the number of County residents who know their HIV status earlier through HIV testing, and link individuals who are positive into care. OAA released a Request for Applications (RFA) to agencies already receiving Ryan White program dollars to serve low-income clients living with HIV/AIDS. The purpose was to support quality improvement (QI) activities related to transferring clients into the Low Income Health Plan (LIHP) in preparation for health care reform. Samples QI activities include the following: Production and/or trans lation of ma terials f or monolingu al clients Retention of c onsultant s ervices f or QI-r elated wor k Ensuring t hat c lient d ata c ollection i s ac curate, com plete, and up-to-date Development of \" standing or ders\" f or effic ient deliver y of health care for clients across the patient spectrum Development of p erformance me asures t o trac k out comes of c lient c are E valuating and r esponding t o c lient sa tisfaction Tracking link age t o c are, c lient r eferrals, or c lient no- show ra tes Measure A Helps PROJECT OPEN HAND ( POH) POH organized focus groups for clients living with HIV to understand how receiving food from POH affects them. Overwhelming feedback from the focus groups indicated that improved food security and health impacts are the main impact of POH. One male client said, \"You know you have food for the next day,\" while another client talked about how his income falls below the poverty line and he subsidizes his normal grocery shopping with POH food. A female client shared an inspiring story: Before coming to POH, she was having a problem with diabetes; now, she has gotten her diabetes under control and does not need to take medication. She attributed that change to the healthy groceries she receives from POH. 123 Development of protocols for seamlessly transferring clients to other agencies The Ry an White providers receiving funding under the OAA RFA include the following: AIDS Pr oject of t he E ast B ay Allen T emple H ealth and S ocial S ervices Facente Consulting La C l\u00ednica de l a R aza LifeLong M edical Project O pen H and Tri-City H ealth Cen ter MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y AIDS Project of the E ast Bay AIDS Project of the East Bay (APEB) used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Install a s erver f or M edisoft, t he agenc y's e lectronic he alth r ecord (E HR) s ystem Complete t he pr ogramming of t he s ystem Develop st anding or ders f or pr imary me dical c are These improvements have allowed APEB to increase patient tracking for better medical care and continuity of care, as well as decrease medical errors.

Measure A funding has helped improved lives by increasing client access to additional services such as CalFresh and Medi-Cal onsite enrollments, and through the offering of expanded nutrition education services provided by peer leaders trained in the CalFresh curriculum. Facente Consulting Facente Consulting used its Measure A allocation to conduct a needs assessment of HIV-positive clients in the Oakland Transitional Grant Area to guide the HIV service priorities and funding allocation process for Ryan White program funds. This assessment focused on four goals: Mapping s ervice lo cations and in vestigating t he di stance c lients m ust tra vel t o ac cess H IV s ervices Examining t he im pact of t he L IHP on c onsumers of H IV s ervices and c onsumer a wareness of t he he alth c are change s resulting from the Affordable Health Care Act124 Assessing the needs of HIV-positive heterosexual men in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, including identif ying disparities in accessing services Exploring t he inc idence of in timate p artner v iolence and it s im pact on H IV inc idence, pr evalence, and outc omes For each focus goal, the needs assessment included recommendations based on the findings. Facente made these recommendations in hopes of increasing the quality of service, and ultimately improving outcomes, for HIV-positive individuals.

Standing orders allow medical and panel management assistants to work at the top of their licenses in coordinating care as part of a care team. Finally, documenting the referral process in writing enables staff across all sites, including but not limited to Family Medicine, to ensure that the loop is closed on referrals. La C l\u00ednica's s ervices c ontribute t o im proved out comes f or p eople liv ing w ith H IV/AIDS by eng aging c lients, making s ervices more comprehensive when the client is there for an appointment, and making referrals to external providers much simpler. Via i2iTracks population management, panel managers track patients and establish individual relationships. If/ when a client misses an appointment; the panel manager calls the patient to follow-up, check in on what is going on in the client's life, and re-engage the patient in care as much as possible. As a result of panel management efforts, 100% of clients are retained in care as evidenced by having had a viral load test in the past 12 months. LifeLong Medical LifeLong utilized Measure A funds to transition from LAB TRACKER to NextGen. For many years, the HIV health care team at LifeLong Berkeley Primary Care utilized LAB TRACKER HIV, an HIV-specific EHR. LAB TRACKER HIV was an essential tool for managing patient care, collecting and reporting Ryan White program data, and tracking progress towards program objectives. As LifeLong moved to utilizing NextGen for all patient types, the functionalities to appropriately manage and continually improve HIV care had to be transitioned into NextGen. Specifically, LifeLong used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Monitor t he im pact of t he L IHP transition on p atient c are p atterns. L ifeLong c ollected and u sed d ata t o monitor v arious measures that identify and address adverse impacts on access, retention in care, and clinical outcomes. Utilize t he Ne xtGen E HR t o f acilitate e vidence-based c are and c ontinuously im prove H IV me dical and c ase management c are. LifeLong created customized templates/protocols within NextGen to ensure HIV-positive clients receiving medical care are given timely diagnostic tests and follow-up care, and that HIV-positive 125clients receiving case management services are given timely diagnostic tests and follow-up care. Over the coming months, the team will finalize exactly how to track each measure within the NextGen system, enabling auto-population/integration of data from the \"visit notes\" and lab modules of the system to the greatest extent possible. Through the use of health information technology, such as the former LAB TRACKER tool and now NextGen EHR, LifeLong's HIV care team can systematically monitor how well they are addressing the needs of their clients and ensure care is delivered based upon evidence-based guidelines. As a result, clients are far more likely to receive the care they need in a timely manner and therefore experience positive health outcomes and a better quality of life. Project Open Hand Project Open Hand (POH) used its Measure A allocation to conduct focus groups to identify seven performance measures to track health outcomes of HIV-positive consumers in the agency's nutrition program.

Tri-City uses daily huddles to identify patients with a high no-show rate. These daily huddles (with chart reminders) also provide a means to address outstanding health maintenance screenings, such as hepatitis and pneumococcal vaccinations; syphilis screenings; and cervical, breast, and colon cancer screenings. Coupling two proactive strategies, one aimed at bringing the no-show rate down and another targeting health maintenance, helps positively influence health outcomes for clients. Measure A Helps TRI-CITY HE ALTH CENTER A young transgender woman was about to fall out of care. The Tri-City Early Intervention Services Linkage Coordinator, in conjunction with the TransVision staff, contacted the client to schedule a medical appointment. During the appointment, the RN Primary Care Coordinator found active syphilis. After syphilis treatment, he discovered that the client had been noncompliant with her HIV medication and using methamphetamines. Adherence counseling and harm reduction helped her get back on medication and to break her methamphetamine addiction. Front desk and clinical staff helped keep the client in care by rescheduling follow-up appointments and contacting her after a no-show. After two appointments, the client showed a reduced viral load, gained 40 pounds, and stated she had stopped using methamphetamines.126PUBLIC HEALTH PREVENTION INITIATIVE FY savings transferred to reserve: $365 Types of services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health Individuals served: Adults, Children, Families, Seniors, Indigent, Low Income, UninsuredMeasure 124,233) Service area: Countywide, transient, Outside of Alameda County AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Alameda County Public Health Department works in partnership with the community to ensure the optimal health and well-being of all people through a dynamic and responsive process respecting the diversity of the community and providing for present and future generations.

Among these accomplishments, many providers met or exceeded their target goals for their programs, sometimes substantially. One item that seems to make a significant impact in the community, especially youth, is the mentorship program that allows low-income youth to have an opportunity to experience Health Careers at an early age. In addition, Public Health Prevention Initiative providers leveraged their Measure A allocations to obtain a total of $884,226 in matching funds from the following sources: Asthma Start: Every Child Counts, Kaiser Community Benefit, and Targeted Case Management Diabetes: Medi-Cal Administrative Activities (MAA) Dental Health-MCAH: Federal financial participation from MCAH Project New Start: MAA and large in-kind contributions/partnerships with volunteer medical professionals whose service provision amount to well over $200,000 per year Emergency Medical Services (contract with City of Fremont): City of Fremont General Funds CAPE : A grant from Kaiser Family Foundation for the SPTB 2013 Health Fair Nutrition Services: CalTrans (Safe Routes to Schools and CDPH Nutrition Network), and Public Health Institute for Community Transform Grant (CTG) local funds Community Designed Initiative-Lotus Bloom: Two organizations through in-kind services (Luna Kids Dance and Niroga Institute), plus a $150 gift card from Safeway Community Designed Initiative-Mandela Market: Kresge Foundation and California FY savings transferred to Types of services provided: Public Health Individuals served: Adults, Children, Families, Seniors, Low IncomeMeasure A clients (Total clients: 60)Service area: Countywide AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND Alameda County Nutrition Services works to ensure that all people live in safe, connected neighborhoods that offer fresh, affordable foods; are choosing active, healthy lifestyles; and are engaged in their communities. Food to Food (F2F) health centers provide pregnant women with fresh produce prescriptions that connect them with local food access points as well as healthy living classes, which include exercise, cooking, and stress-reduction components. Young adults in West Oakland manage the produce supply business at participating corner stores in their community and promote produce sales. Young adults in Ashland/Cherryland grow, produce, and distribute community-sustained agriculture food boxes. F2F also contains a mini-grant component, which funds innovative, locally defined community-based projects that align or build on the foundation of F2F. The mini-grants have helped develop curricula on subjects such as stress management and eating well on a budget, which local Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Tiburcio Vasquez and West Oakland Health Center, have included in their classes. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y The F2F program used its Measure A allocation to provide mini-grants of $500-$1,500 to six community org anizations to improve food environments in West Oakland and Ashland/Cherryland. These funds and grants enabled F2F to transform the food landscape in the West Oakland and Ashland/Cherryland communities. West Oakland Team Fresh-West Oakland added one new market as a food access point for families in the program and the comm unity at large. As a result, Mandela MarketPlace's Healthy Neighborhood Store Alliance now has four participating stores. Due t o p artnerships b etween Mande rantee City Slic ker F arms (C SF), CS F became an additional site for coupon redemption. CSF built a g arden t hat now g rows f resh f ruits, ve getables, and herb s a t t he W est O akland H ealth Cen ter (WOH C).

The greenhouse raising was held on Wednesday, Oct. 24, 2012. The greenhouse will double as a farm stand with hopes to become the first fixed-site retail establishment for DDFP providing Ashland/Cherryland residents healthy and locally grown fruits and vegetables. DDFP continues to work in partnership with the Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center (TVHC) to provide healthy produce bags to 30 F2F participants. These funds also helped achieve the following measurable objectives: Ashland/Cherryland enr olled 39 women, 23 of whom c ame b ack f or a s econd v isit f or pr enatal c are and t o obtain pr escriptions for healthy grocery bags.

ACPHD is part of a working partnership with the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA), District Attorney's office, and Interagency Children's Policy Council that seeks to address the issue of chronic absenteeism and truancy as it relates to health issues countywide. Barriers to attendance, particularly for younger students, include chronic health issues that do not get addressed. This project seeks to work with early grades to impact third-grade reading level and long-term educational achievement and prevent progression to school district Student Attendance Review Boards and to Truancy Court. Ensuring students miss less school has been strongly linked to better short-term and long-term educational outcomes. ACPHD Asthma Start has already had significant success in working with the District Attorney's office in the Alameda County Truancy Court in reducing unnecessary absences due to health issues. This project should help school districts prevent further progression of absences, keep kids in school, and help them do better academically. Specifically, the partnership seeks to support school districts to address chronic absenteeism through the following activities: Coordinating s ervices and pr ograms ac ross t he v arious Coun ty agenc ies (H CSA, Di strict A ttorney, Int eragency Children's Policy Council, Behavioral Health, ACPHD) working on truancy prevention related to health Increasing k nowledge and outr each of t he c onnection b etween c a bsenteeism, he alth i ssues, and educ ational outcomes by conducting literature review, creating materials, and consulting with experts Supporting c oordination of c ase managemen t s ervices f or a sthma, di abetes, and ot her me dical c onditions be tween ACPHD, Behavioral Health, and school districts, including the San Lorenzo, Hayward, and Oakland Unified School Districts. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y ACPHD received a one-time Measure A allocation to develop a closer relationship with a school district to track 139health and absences and set up referral linkages from elementary schools addressing high chronic absenteeism. The program used part of its allocation to establish a pilot project with the Hayward Unified School District, which seeks to develop and implement processes at the district and school level to track, plan, and intervene around excessive absenteeism through the following activities: Increasing di strict c apacity t o c ode and trac k a ttendance d ata r elated t o he alth i ssues in t he st udent infor mation system, ZANGLE Working w ith f our t arget e lementary s chools\u2014Cherryland, H ard, P ark, and S chafer P ark\u2014to e xamine t he at tendance recording and intervention processes, in particular aligning attendance promotion with school and community-based supports through school-based Coordination of Services Teams (COST) Implementing pr ocesses and le ssons le arned a t t he r emaining e lementary s chools and di strict-wide ACPHD also accomplished the following as part of the County agency collaboration: Meeting r oughly bi-mon thly w ith H CSA, t he Di strict A ttorney's offic e, and t he In teragency C hildren's P olicy Council Developing he alth g uidelines t o inf orm p arents when t o k eep t heir c hildren home f rom s chool and when t hey should b e sent to school Through t he A CPHD A sthma S tart and N ursing pr ograms, me eting w ith t he S an L orenzo U nified S chool Distr ict to identify students with excessive absences due to health issues at the Student Attendance Review Board (SARB) to prevent truancy and to provide case management and referral services for students identified Developing b ackground inf ormation on c hronic a bsenteeism and he alth Referring 13 f amilies/children f rom tr uancy c ourt t o A sthma S tart and 10 c hildren t o Public H ealth N ursing CONCERNS The project spent this year's allocation for program setup and system development. However, as noted in the report, the program has no reportable data yet. It remains to be seen if any service-related outcomes result. Without baseline data, there is no way to determine how the program impacts third-grade reading levels or absenteeism. In addition, with respect to Harder Elementary specifically, the program does not indicate how it will determine the impact of Measure A funds vs. the impacts of the Hayward Promise Neighborhood program.140Measure A Helps LIFE ELDER CARE SENIOR INJUR Y PREVENTION PR OGRAM Florence, 81, is a very active person, but she was concerned that her balance was declining. When she was tested in the fall prevention program, she could stand barely \u00bd second on each foot. The instructors worked with her for one hour a week, and she practiced herself on the other days. Florence was so happy to see the improvement, it motivated her to continue to practice. Her focus and commitment paid off. After 12 weeks, she was able to stand on each foot for 5 seconds. The other students helped Florence compile her different medications and vitamins into a booklet. Florence is now exercising on her own and is confident in her ability to stay active.

Measure A Helps SPECTRUM COMMUNITY SER VICES - SENIOR INJUR Y PREVENTION PR OGRAM Ruth, 66, suffered a stroke that left her unable to walk, speak, swallow, bathe, feed herself, dress herself, get up and down, or sit up. She has gone through several specialized facilities for rehabilitation that have enabled her to walk again using a cane and move around her home. Regular attendance at Spectrum's exercise classes helped her make further progress. She gained more strength and confidence and kept working on getting up her staircase. In February, Ruth was able to climb the entire staircase. It was the first time she had been on the second floor of her house since her stroke. She credits Spectrum's classes for giving her the strength in her legs to get to the top.142Measure A Helps EMS ( CONTRACT WITH ADUL T DAY SER VICES NETW ORk ) A 76-year old Vietnamese-speaking widow lives alone in senior housing, and has no family support system. She has multiple medical problems including diabetes type II, hypertension, chronic bronchitis, degenerative joint disease in the knee, and obesity. She suffers from depression and feels isolated. During the home visit, workers discovered 12 different medications, nine of which were prescribed. She was taking a wrong dosage of one medication and did not know what several of the others were for. Interventions during the home visit helped educate the client about medication indications and dosage and resulted in the primary care physician making adjustments to the prescriptions. The client was confused with these changes at first but now feels she can adhere to them. Eight me dicine c ompliance t ools, suc h a s me di-sets, were off ered and accepted, and seven gallon-size containers collected old or unused medications for disposal, using drop-off sites. Thirteen mail-in en velopes wer e pr ovided t o par ticipants. Eighty-three p articipants c ompleted a pr e and p ost survey with slightly over half (58) showing a self- reported improved quality of life score. Contract with Senior Support of Tri Valley- Medication Safety Pilot program Thirty-eight clients were served in the Medication Saf ety program. Seven c lients ac tually di sposed of me dications. All other p articipants had no medications to dispose of or had already disposed of medications via their pharmacy or take-back days. Six c lients made sp ecific in-offic e or over -the-phone app ointments with their doctors to discuss any questions they had about their medications. Of t he 38 c lients s erved, 11% had t heir me dications adjust ed, 28% stated they had become more compliant with their medication regime, and 24% reported that they felt better overall. Contract with United Seniors of Oakland Four pre-trained senior volunteers offered 19 trainings in Eng lish and Spanish to seniors, covering medication safety topics (target: 20 trainings to 300 seniors; actual: 19 trainings to 202 seniors).

HIGHLIGHTS In several cases, actual provider outcomes greatly exceeded targets. For example, through the MOU with SSA, providers offered physical activity sessions to 1,203 seniors, compared to a target of 508. In addition, Adult Day Services Network leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $5,741 in matching funds from foundation dollars.143SERVICE OPPORTUNTIES FOR SENIORS (MEALS ON WHEELS) Measure A one-time allocation, Board of Supervisors discretionary FY savings transferred to reserve: $0 Types of services provided: Hospital Outpatient, Public Health Individuals served: Seniors, Indigent, Ashland, Castro Hayward, Oakland, San Leandro, San Lorenzo AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND Service Opportunity for Seniors (SOS) Meals on Wheels offers a home-delivered nutrition program to maintain or improve the physical and social well-being of seniors with a hot meal and a daily check-in. The nutrition services include procurement, preparation, transporting, and serving meals, as well as nutrition education. Meals on Wheels targets low-income seniors who are age 60 and older, homebound, alone, recently discharged from the hospital, or having a physical or mental impairment. Ninety-five percent of Meals on Wheels clients receive SSI or Medicare income, while the other 5% have insufficient income to meet all their monthly expenses. In addition, Meals on Wheels establishes a safety net for an at-risk population. The drivers interact with homebound seniors daily and report significant problems or changes that occur, especially for seniors living alone. The office staff is trained to deal with a wide range of situations and makes sure that the appropriate care is provided for seniors who need assistance. The combination of daily nutritious meals and wellness monitoring enables homebound seniors to retain their independence and to remain in their home for as long as they can.Measure A Helps SERVICE OPPORTUNTIES FOR SENIORS (MEALS ON WHEELS) Linda, 61, is semi-retired and volunteers part- time at a homeless shelter. One morning, while getting her regiment of pills for morning pain, she slipped and fell, breaking her hip. Several weeks after the surgery, she was ready to go home from the rehab center. Her daughter, who could check on her morning and evening, was concerned about a lunchtime meal. The discharge planner contacted Meals on Wheels, and Linda was scheduled to receive her meal service the very next day. When the bell rang, Linda made her way to the door. As she opened it, Linda could not believe what she saw. Standing in front of her was that same driver that delivered meals to Linda's mother many years ago. 144MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y The SOS Meals on Wheels program received two Measure A allocations in FY 12/13. Meals on Wheels used the first to deliver 5,000 meals to seniors in the unincorporated Castro Valley area, and the second to deliver approximately 51,936 meals in central Alameda County and parts of Oakland. Meals on Wheels also provided 34,280 bulk meals to Bay Area Community Services (BACS) of Oakland. In addition, Measure A funds helped Meals on Wheels move into a bigger kitchen which produced quality meals at a faster and more efficient rate. The new kitchen and equipment gave Meals on Wheels the capacity to produce 86,216 meals (including those supplied to BACS) and directly serve 1,335 seniors. HIGHLIGHTS Every eligible senior received a hot nutritious meal, and no waiting list occurred in FY 12/13. In addition, SOS Meals on Wheels leveraged its second Measure A allocation to obtain $260,000 in matching funds from the Valley Foundation and Alameda County Meals on Wheels.

Spectrum employs multiple strategies to implement this mission, offering individuals and families programs that remedy crisis, maintain and improve health and functionality, and develop skills and the capacity to help themselves. Spectrum's Fall Risk Reduction Program (FRRP) promotes wellness and delivering preventive services to a population at high risk for falls and fall-related injuries. FRRP uses a multipronged approach to address the physical, behavioral, and environmental factors that contribute to falls. FRRP employs strategies that educate 145about fall prevention; guide and refer for home safety modifications that can prevent falls; and offer training to build strength, stamina, mobility, balance, and fall prevention skills. Each program component focuses on empowering seniors to implement solutions and to become more confident of their control over their own lives. Spectrum targets its FRRP classes at senior housing and recreation centers located in low-income neighborhoods. These sites are also where Spectrum holds its senior meal program for low-income seniors. The program also emphasizes social interaction, giving isolated seniors the opportunity to develop new friendships and improve conditions like depression. The FRRP contributes to a healthier, independent lifestyle, greatly improving the functional ability and quality of life for the fastest-growing segment of the population. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Spectrum's FRRP used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following objectives: Offer f all pr evention e ducation and r egular e xercise cl asses designed to build strength, mobility, and balance to elders who are at risk for falls Reduce of inc idence of f alls among pr ogram p str ength, mobility , and a bility t o w alk w ith c onfidence Offer s eniors and c aregivers t hroughout t he t arget ar ea f all r isk pr evention wor kshops a t whic h p articipants can obt ain practical information about how to minimize fall risk Services funded by Measure A included the following: Weekly f all pr evention s kill-building c lasses a t s even sit es in t he t arget ar ea Evaluation and r eassessment of c lass p articipants t o t ailor e xercise pr ograms and me asure pr ogress Quarterly wor kshops a t five lo cations t hat pr ovided prac tical training in pr eventing f alls FRRP conducts senior fitness tests every six months to chart the impact of the program and the progress in the participants.

Bob, an 80-year-old Caucasian male, suffers from high blood pressure and arthritis. His initial health assessment revealed chronic lower back pain and decreased mobility. After two months of attending class, his mobility and flexibility improved to where he could get up and proceed with his morning activities with less pain. Prior to joining the class, Bob tried walking for fitness. His walks lasted about 15-20 minutes, 1-2 times per week. He can now easily walk on a treadmill for 30-40 minutes, 2-3 times per week, and has decreased his lower back pain has significantly. Bob says, \"I tell everybody how much this class has helped!

With the extra housing subsidy, he was able to move indoors and now lives in a studio apartment. He is visibly happier and healthier. Another client, a 59-year-old woman who has diabetes, depression, and anxiety, was on the verge of being evicted. The subsidy prevented her from becoming homeless. A 36-year-old man with depression who was living under an overpass was able to move into a single-room occupancy hotel and is now looking for permanent housing. A 53-year-old woman who has bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder used the extra income from the housing subsidy to escape an abusive relationship and secure her own housing.SSI HOUSING TRUST FY savings transferred to reserve: $0 Types of services provided: Public Health, Mental Health Individuals served: Adults, Seniors, Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured, Other residents: Disabled and Chronically HomelessMeasure A clients served: 47 (Total 1,487)Service area: Countywide, Homeless or transient AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Alameda County Health Services Agency (HCSA) helps poor, disabled Alameda County residents receive disability income and mitigates the negative impact of long processing times by stabilizing their health and living situations while their applications are pending. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y HCSA used Measure A funds to establish the SSI housing trust, a revolving fund to increase housing stability for clients. When clients are approved for disability benefits, the fund is replenished from the client's retroactive benefits. This increase in housing stability improves clients' ability to access care and support from disability advocates, and helps improve their mental health as well. Overall the program provided disability advocacy services, including care coordination, to 1,488 individuals, of whom 755 were approved for disability benefits and 533 still had claims pending at the end of the fiscal year. These awards in disability income resulted in clients receiving over $9 million in ongoing income since the date of their approvals. HIGHLIGHTS When clients enter the program, generally they receive a maximum of $336/month in income. Measure A funds enable clients to nearly double their income to $654/month while their disability application is pending. Upon approval for disability benefits, clients receive at least $865/month in income, almost tripling their original income.147Connecting clients to care ultimately reduces unnecessary use of emergency room services. Having a disability advocate can lead to better health outcomes for clients because there is an outside source corroborating client complaints and providing information\u2014for example, emergency room records\u2014from other treatment sources that would otherwise be unavailable to care providers. In addition, the program leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $2,060,000 in matching funds from the following sources: Mental H ealth S ervice A ct (MH SA) Medi-Cal A t (C SBG) Alameda Coun ty G eneral F und These leveraged funds help recover 95.4% of the Measure A funds expended and can be reinvested in the project.

Board of Supervisors discretionary allocation: FY savings transferred to Types of services provided: Public Health Individuals served: Adults, Children, Families, Seniors, Indigent, Low Income, UninsuredMeasure NA*) provide direct services AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND Urban Strategies Council works with partners to eliminate persistent poverty by building vibrant, healthy communities. Urban Strategies Council is a social impact organization using tools of research, policy, collaboration, innovation, and advocacy to achieve equity and social justice. The Violence Prevention Initiative Executive Committee is responsible for implementation and monitoring of the Violence Prevention Blueprint adopted by the Board of Supervisors in 2005 and is an effort to work with County agencies, cities, and community groups to identify ways in which the County can support efforts at violence prevention and intervention. Urban Strategies has worked with the Executive Committee to build the capacities of County agencies and community-based organizations to understand the causes of violence and to implement effective strategies to prevent or intervene in violence. Urban Strategies provides accurate, up-to-date data on the incidence of violence in the County and changes over time so that stakeholders understand 149where inroads are being made and where additional efforts need to be made to reduce violence. Urban Strategies also provides information on evidence-based practices for preventing and reducing violence so that public agencies and community-based organization can consider them in the course of improving their strategies and program interventions related to violence. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Urban Strategies does provide direct services. It supports the Violence Prevention Initiative Executive Committee by providing staffing for meetings, work plan development, data and policy analysis, mapping, and resource development. Urban Strategies used its Measure A allocation to provide program support services for the Violence Prevention Initiative and Public Health with the following specific objectives: Staff the Violence Prevention Initiative Executive Committee. Urban Strategies staffed 10 monthly meetings of the Violence Prevention Initiative Executive Committee. Support work plan development. Urban Strategies provided support to the Executive Committee and completed a work plan for the FY 12/13 program period including recommendations related to essential public health and substance abuse services to the indigent, low-income, reentry, and uninsured populations . Provide data analysis and map production. Urban Strategies produced an annual report tracking violent crime countywide and within each city in the County over the past decade, providing a source of information for local jurisdictions, County officials, and community-based organizations to determine changes in patterns of violent crime and to inform their planning and actions. Communicate with Supervisors' staff on district projects. Urban Strategies communicated with and provided advice and support to the Board of Supervisor's staff on their respective district projects and efforts and how these projects and efforts assist in providing essential public health and substance abuse services to the indigent, low-income, and uninsured populations. Assist in funding applications. Urban Strategies provided assistance to County agencies and Supervisor Miley's office to identify funding possibilities and prepare applications for district violence prevention projects and other public health and substance abuse services. CONCERNS While the Committee recognizes that dealing with re-entry issues benefits the entire population, it questions whether Measure A funding is appropriate for this organization, given that it provides no direct services and performs activities that are much broader in scope than public health.150YOUTH AND FAMILY OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVES FY savings transferred to reserve: $0 Types of services provided: Mental Health, Substance Abuse Individuals served: Adults, Children, Families, Indigent, Low Income, UninsuredMeasure OGRAM BACkGROUND The Center for Healthy Schools & Communities works to foster the academic success, health, and well-being of Alameda County youth by building universal access to high-quality supports and opportunities in schools and neighborhoods.

The family strengthening programs provide parents with emotional support and tools to foster nurturing relationships with their children. They also provide other types of support, such as financial planning or work training, to encourage stability and reduce stress for families. Youth and Community Services The CBOs offered enrichment programs to promote health and wellness and improve the social, emotional, and physical health of youth and their families.
