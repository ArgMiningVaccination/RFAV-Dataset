We sought to determine the pattern of tumor progression in patients treated with 5 fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with 5 mm margins.METHODS: Thirty adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM were treated with 5 fraction SRS in escalated doses from 25 Gy to 40 Gy with a 5 mm total treatment margin. Progression was scored as 'in-field' if the recurrent tumor was within or contiguous with the 5 mm margin, 'marginal' if between 5 and 20 mm, and 'distant' if entirely occurring greater than 20 mm. As geometric patterns of progression do not reflect the biologic dose received, we calculated the minimum equieffective dose in 2 Gy per day (EQD2) at the site of tumor recurrence. Progression was 'dosimetrically in-field' if covered by a minimum EQD2 of 48 Gy10.RESULTS: From 2010 to 2016, 27 patients had progressed. Progression was in-field in 17 (63%), marginal in 3 (11%) and distant in 7 (26%) patients. In the 3 patients with marginal progression, the minimum EQD2 to recurrent tumor were 48 Gy10, 56 Gy10 (both considered dosimetrically in-field) and 7 Gy10 (i.e., dosimetrically out-of-field). Median overall (OS) was for in-field (95%CI 8.9-17.6), 15.1 months (95%CI 10.1-not achieved) for marginal and 21.4 months (95%CI 11.2-33.5) for distant progression. Patients with radiation necrosis were less likely to have in-field progression (1 of 7; 14%) compared to those without radiation necrosis (16 of 20; 80%; p=0.003); those with necrosis had a median overall survival of 27.2 months (95%CI 11.2-48.3) compared to 11.7 months (95%CI 8.9-17.6) for patients with no necrosis (p=0.077).CONCLUSION: In patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated with a 5 mm CTV margin, 3 patients (11%) had marginal progression within 5-20 mm; only 1 patient (4%) may have dosimetrically benefitted from conventional 20 mm margins. Radiation necrosis was associated with in-field tumor control.

Our institution developed the \"Non-Intensive CarE\" (NICE) protocol to identify craniotomy patients who did not require postoperative ICU care.To determine the longitudinal impact of the NICE protocol on postoperative length of stay (LOS), ICU utilization, readmissions, and complications.In this retrospective cohort study, our institution's electronic medical record was queried to identify craniotomies before protocol deployment (May 2014-May 2018) and after deployment (May 2018-December 2021). The primary end points were average postoperative LOS and ICU utilization; secondary end points included readmissions, reoperation, and postoperative complications rate. End points were compared between pre- and postintervention cohorts.Four thousand eight hundred thirty-seven craniotomies were performed from to December and 2535 postprotocol). Twenty-one percent of postprotocol craniotomies were enrolled in the NICE protocol. After protocol deployment, the overall postoperative LOS decreased from 4.0 to 3.5 days (P = .0031), which was driven by deceased postoperative LOS among protocol patients (average 2.4 days). ICU utilization decreased from 57% of patients to 42% (P < .0001), generating $760000 in savings. Return to the ICU and complications decreased after protocol deployment. 5.8% of protocol patients had a readmission within 30 days; none could have been prevented through ICU stay.The NICE protocol is an effective, sustainable method to increase ICU bed availability and decrease costs without changing outcomes. To our knowledge, this study features the largest series of patients enrolling in an ICU utilization reduction protocol. Careful patient selection is a requirement for the success of this approach.

This report reviews a single institution's experience in treating secondary TN with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and focuses on the durability of pain relief with respect to various treatment targets, i.e., the trigeminal nerve, offending tumor, or both.Between the years 2009 and 2021, 21 patients with TN secondary to benign (n = 13) or malignant (n = 8) tumors underwent SRS. Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain intensity scale scores were collected from patient electronic medical records at baseline, initial follow-up, and 1 and 3 years post-SRS. The interval change in BNI scale score (BNI) at the various follow-up time points was also calculated to assess the durability of pain relief following SRS.The median follow-up period was 24 (range 0.5-155) months. Five patients (24%) received treatment to the trigeminal nerve only, 10 (48%) received treatment to the tumor only, and 6 (29%) had treatment to both the nerve and tumor. The overall radiation dosage ranged from 14 to 60 Gy delivered in 1-5 fractions, with a median overall dose of 26 Gy. The median dose to the tumor was 22.5 (range 14-35) Gy, delivered in 1-5 fractions. Of the treatments targeting the tumor, 25% were delivered in a single fraction with doses ranging from 14 to 20 Gy, 60% were delivered in 3 fractions with doses ranging from 18 to 27 Gy, and 15% were delivered in 5 fractions with doses ranging from 25 to 35 Gy. The most common dose regimen for tumor treatment was 24 Gy in 3 fractions. The median biologically effective dose (with an assumed alpha/beta ratio of 10 [BED10]) for tumor treatments was 43.1 (range 13.3-60.0) Gy. There was a significant difference in the proportion of patients with recurrent pain (BNI score 0) at the time of last follow-up across the differing SRS treatment targets: trigeminal nerve only, tumor only, or both (p = 0.04). At the time of last follow-up, the median BNI score after SRS to the nerve only was -1, 0 after SRS to tumor only, and -2 after SRS to both targets.SRS offers clinical symptomatic benefit to patients with TN secondary to tumor. For optimal pain relief and response durability, treatment targeting both the tumor and the trigeminal nerve appears to be most advantageous.

However, data for intracranial response to these drugs are limited.We aimed to evaluate the intracranial efficacy of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma with brain metastases (BM) and to determine patterns of failure of these new agents to inform optimal integration of local intracranial therapy. Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma with metastasis to the brain with at least one untreated brain metastasis at the time of initiation of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors at our institution from 2006 to 2020. We collected per-patient and per-lesion data on demographics, treatment modality, and outcomes. The cumulative incidence of local (LF), distant intracranial (DF), and extracranial failure (EF) were calculated with competing risk analysis with death as a competing risk and censored at the last brain MRI follow-up. LF was calculated on a per-lesion basis while DF and EF were calculated on a per-patient basis.DF was defined as any new intracranial lesions.Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors for LF. Results We identified 10 patients with 63 untreated brain metastases. The median age was 50.5 years. The median sum of thediameters of thefive largest untreated brain metastases per patient was 20 mm (interquartile range 15-39 mm) and the median diameter for all measurable lesions was 4 mm. Median follow-up time was 9.0 months (range 1.4 months-46.2 months). Median OS was 13.6 months. The one-year cumulative incidence of LF, DF, and EF was 17.1%, and median time to LF, DF, and EF from the start of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors was 9.0 months, 4.7 months, and 7.0 months, respectively. The larger size of the BM was associated with LF on univariate analysis (odds ratio 1.13 per 1 mm increase in diameter, 95% confidence interval 1.019 to 1.308,p<0.02). Two (20%) patients 2 (20%) received radiotherapy Conclusion Although patients withBRAF-mutant melanoma with BM had fair local control on BRAF plus MEK inhibitors, the competing risk of death and distant intracranial and extracranial progression was high. Patients with larger brain metastases may benefit from local therapy.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of reirradiation using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with recurrent pediatric primary brain tumors.This IRB-approved retrospective review included pediatric patients with recurrent primary brain tumors treated at Stanford University from 2000 to 2019 using frameless SRS. Time to local failure (LF) and distant intracranial failure (DIF) were measured from the date of SRS and analyzed using competing risk analysis. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.In total, 37 patients aged 2-24 years (median age 11 years at recurrence) were treated for 48 intracranial tumors. Ependymoma (38%) and medulloblastoma (22%) were the most common tumor types. The median (range) single fraction equivalent dose of SRS was 16.4 (12-24) Gy. The median (range) follow-up time was 22.9 (1.5-190) months. The median OS of all patients was 36.8 months. Eight of 40 (20%) lesions with follow-up imaging locally recurred. The 2-year cumulative incidence of LF after reirradiation with SRS was 12.8% (95% CI incidence 25.3% (95% CI 12.9%-39.8%). The median PFS was months (95% CI 8.9-44). Five (10.4%) patients developed toxicities potentially attributed to SRS, including cognitive effects and necrosis.Reirradiation using SRS for recurrent pediatric brain tumors appears safe with good local control. Innovations that improve overall disease control should continue because survival outcomes after relapse remain poor.

We describe lesion-level outcomes of brain metastases treated with osimertinib alone.We retrospectively patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with untreated brain metastasis measuring5mm at the time of initiating osimertinib. Cumulative incidence of local recurrence in brain (LRiB) was calculated with death as a competing risk, and univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with LRiB.We included 284 brain metastases from 37 patients. Median follow-up was 20.1months. On initial MRI after starting osimertinib, patient-level response was complete response (CR) in 11 (15%), partial response (PR) in 33 (45%), stable disease (SD) in 18 (25%) and progressive disease (PD) in 11 (15%). The 1-year cumulative incidence of LRiB was 14% (95% CI 9.9-17.9) and was significantly different in patients with a CR (0%), PR (4%), and SD (11%; p=0.02). Uncontrolled primary [aHR] 3.78, 95% CI 1.87-7.66; p<0.001), increasing number (aHR 2.12, 95% CI 1.49-3.04; p<0.001), and higher ECOG score (aHR CI 1.99-31.81; p=0.003) were associated with LRiB.Although 1-year cumulative incidence of LRiB is<4% with a CR or PR, 1-year cumulative incidence of LRiB is over 10% for patients with less than a PR to osimertinib on initial MRI. These patients should be followed closely for need for additional treatment such as stereotactic radiosurgery.

Current multimodal treatment is associated with a 70%-90% 5-year survival rate; however, the prognosis for patients with tumor dissemination and recurrent MB remains poor. The majority of survivors exhibit long-term neurocognitive complications; thus, more effective and less toxic treatments are critically needed. Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low-intensity, alternating electric fields that disrupt cell division through physical interactions with key molecules during mitosis. Side effects from TTField therapy are minimal, making it an ideal candidate for MB treatment.To determine if TTFields can be an effective treatment for MB, the authors conducted an in vitro study treating multiple MB cell lines. Three MB molecular subgroups (SHH [sonic hedgehog], group 3, and group 4) were treated for 24, 48, and 72 hours at 100, 200, 300, and 400 kHz. Combinatorial studies were conducted with the small-molecule casein kinase 2 inhibitor CX-4945.TTFields reduced MB cell growth with an optimal frequency of 300 kHz, and the most efficacious treatment time was 72 hours. Treatment with TTFields dysregulated actin polymerization and corresponded with a reduction in cell motility and invasion. TTFields also induced DNA damage (H2AX, 53BP1) that correlated with an increase in apoptotic cells. The authors discovered that CX-4945 works synergistically with TTFields to reduce MB growth. In addition, combining CX-4945 and TTFields increased the cellular actin dysregulation, which correlated with a decrease in MB migration.The findings of this study demonstrate that TTFields may be a novel and less toxic method to treat patients with MB.

Guidelines propose early initiation of PC for patients with advanced cancers. We analyzed a cohort of privately insured patients with malignant brain or spinal tumors derived from the Optum Clinformatics Datamart Database to investigate health disparities in access to and utilization of supportive services. We introduce a novel construct, \"provider patient racial diversity index\" (provider pRDI), which is a measure of the proportion of non-white minority patients a provider encounters to approximate a provider's patient demographics and suggest a provider's cultural sensitivity and exposure to diversity. Our analysis demonstrates low rates of PC, home health, and social work services among racial minority patients. Notably, Hispanic patients had low likelihood of engaging with all three categories of supportive services. However, patients who saw providers categorized into high provider pRDI (categories II and III) were increasingly more likely to interface with supportive care services and at an earlier point in their disease courses. This study suggests that prospective studies that examine potential interventions at the provider level, including diversity training, are needed.

Identifying seizure-naive patients at highest risk for postoperative seizure events remains a clinical need. In this study, the authors sought to develop a predictive modeling strategy for anticipating postcraniotomy seizures after brain tumor resection.The IBM Watson Health MarketScan Claims Database was canvassed for antiepileptic drug (AED)- and seizure-naive patients who underwent brain tumor resection (2007-2016). The primary event of interest was short-term seizure risk (within 90 days postdischarge). The secondary event of interest was long-term seizure risk during the follow-up period. To model early-onset and long-term postdischarge seizure risk, a penalized logistic regression classifier and multivariable Cox regression model, respectively, were built, which integrated patient-, tumor-, and hospitalization-specific features. To compare empirical seizure rates, equally sized cohort tertiles were created and labeled as low risk, medium risk, and high risk.Of 5470 patients, 983 (18.0%) had a postdischarge-coded seizure event. The integrated binary classification approach for predicting early-onset seizures outperformed models using feature subsets (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.751, hospitalization features only AUC = 0.667, patient features only AUC = 0.603, and tumor features only AUC = 0.694). Held-out validation patient cases that were predicted by the integrated model to have elevated short-term risk more frequently developed seizures within 90 days of discharge (24.1% high risk vs 3.8% low risk, p < 0.001). Compared with those in the low-risk tertile by the long-term seizure risk model, patients in the medium-risk and high-risk tertiles had 2.13 (95% CI 1.45-3.11) and (95% CI 4.40-8.84) times higher long-term risk for postdischarge seizures. Only patients predicted as high risk developed status epilepticus within 90 days of discharge (1.7% high risk vs 0% low risk, p = 0.003).The authors have presented a risk-stratified model that accurately predicted short- and long-term seizure risk in patients who underwent brain tumor resection, which may be used to stratify future study of postoperative AED prophylaxis in highest-risk patient subpopulations.

Methods: Thirty-one high-grade = 5), head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC, n = 23) or lung adenocarcinoma (LAC, n = 3) were systemically infused with 50 mg panitumumab-IRDye800, 1 - 3 days prior to surgery. Intraoperative open-field fluorescent images of the surgical field were acquired, where imaging device settings and operating room lighting conditions were tested on tissue-mimicking phantoms. Fluorescence contrast and margin size were measured on resected specimen surface. Antibody distribution and EGFR immunoreactivity were characterized in macroscopic and microscopic histological structures. Integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was examined via tight junction protein (claudin-5) expression with immunohistochemistry. Stepwise multivariate linear regression of biological variables was performed to identify independent predictors of panitumumab-IRDye800 concentration in tissue. Results: Optimally acquired at the lowest gain for tumor detection with ambient light, intraoperative fluorescence imaging enhanced tissue-size dependent tumor contrast by 5.2-fold, 3.4-fold and 1.4-fold in HGG, HNSCC and LAC, respectively. Tissue surface fluorescence target-to-background ratio correlated with margin size and identified 78 - 97% of at-risk resection margins ex vivo. In 4 m-thick tissue sections, fluorescence detected tumor with 0.85 - 0.89 areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Preferential breakdown of BBB in HGG improved tumor specificity of intratumoral antibody distribution relative to that of EGFR (96% vs 80%) despite its reduced concentration (3.9 ng/mg tissue) compared to HNSCC (8.1 ng/mg) and LAC (6.3 ng/mg). Cellular EGFR expression, tumor cell density, plasma antibody concentration and delivery barrier were independently associated with local intratumoral panitumumab-IRDye800 concentration with 0.62 goodness-of-fit of prediction. Conclusion: In multi-cancer clinical imaging of receptor-ligand based molecular probe, plasma antibody concentration, delivery barrier, as well as intratumoral EGFR expression driven by cellular biomarker expression and tumor cell density, led to heterogeneous intratumoral antibody accumulation and spatial distribution while tumor size, resection margin, and intraoperative imaging settings substantially influenced macroscopic tumor contrast.

Purpose To assess the role of 18F-FSPG PET/CT in intracranial malignancies. Materials and Methods Twenty-six patients (mean age, 54 years 12; 17 men; 48 total lesions) with primary brain tumors (n = 17) or brain metastases (n = 9) were enrolled in this prospective, single-center study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02370563) between November 2014 and March 2016. A 30-minute dynamic brain 18F-FSPG PET/CT scan and a static whole-body (WB) 18F-FSPG PET/CT scan at 60-75 minutes were acquired. Moreover, all participants underwent MRI, and four participants underwent fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging. PET parameters and their relative changes were obtained for all lesions. Kinetic modeling was used to estimate the 18F-FSPG tumor rate constants using the dynamic and dynamic plus WB PET data. Imaging parameters were correlated to lesion outcomes, as determined with follow-up MRI and/or pathologic examination. The Mann-Whitney U test or Student t test was used for group mean comparisons. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used for performance comparison of different decision measures. Results 18F-FSPG PET/CT helped identify all 48 brain lesions. The mean tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) on the whole-brain PET images at the WB time point was 26.6 24.9 (range: 2.6-150.3). When 18F-FDG PET was performed, 18F-FSPG permitted visualization of non-18F-FDG-avid lesions or allowed better lesion differentiation from surrounding tissues. In participants with primary brain tumors, the predictive accuracy of the relative changes in influx rate constant Ki and maximum standardized uptake value to discriminate between poor and good lesion outcomes were 89% and 81%, respectively. There were significant differences in the 18F-FSPG uptake curves of lesions with good versus poor outcomes in the primary brain tumor group (P < .05) but not in the brain metastases group. Conclusion PET/CT imaging with (4S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-l-glutamate (18F-FSPG) helped detect primary brain tumors and brain metastases with a high tumor-to-background ratio. Relative changes in 18F-FSPG uptake with multi-time-point PET appear to be helpful in predicting lesion outcomes. Clinical trial registration no.

Tumor fluorescence was detected through intact dura, and the visual contrast between disease and peritumoral healthy brain was enhanced after tumor exposure. Residual cancerous tissue was identified with strong fluorescence in resection cavity after en bloc tumor removal. Minimal fluorescence remained in the final wound bed, likely from nonenhancing tumor. Fluorescence was heterogeneously distributed at the infiltrative margin in resected pieces imaged ex vivo. Postoperative MRI confirmed gross-total resection. The video be found here: https://stream.cadmore.media/r10.3171/2021.10.FOCVID21201.

Utilizing a national cancer registry, the authors sought to characterize the risk of SN development after EBRT treatment of pediatric LGG.A total of 1245 pediatric patient (aged 0-17 years) records from 1973 to 2015 were assembled from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariable and multivariable subdistribution hazard regression models were used to evaluate the prognostic impact of demographic, tumor, and treatment-related covariates. Propensity score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics. Cumulative incidence analyses measured the time to, and rate of, SN development, stratified by receipt of EBRT and controlled for competing mortality risk. The Fine and Gray semiparametric model was used to estimate future SN risk in EBRT- and non-EBRT-treated pediatric patients.In this study, 366 patients received EBRT and 879 did not. Forty-six patients developed SNs after an LGG diagnosis, and 27 of these patients received EBRT (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.90-6.95; p < 0.001). For patients alive 30 years from the initial LGG diagnosis, the absolute risk of SN development in the EBRT-treated cohort was 12.61% (95% CI compared with 4.99% CI 4.38-12.23) in the non-EBRT-treated cohort (p = 0.013). Cumulative incidence curves that were adjusted for competing events still demonstrated higher rates of SN development in the EBRT-treated patients with LGGs. After matching across available covariates and again adjusting for the competing risk of mortality, a clear association between EBRT and SN development remained (subhazard ratio 2.26, 95% CI 1.21-4.20; p = 0.010).Radiation therapy was associated with an increased risk of future SNs for pediatric patients surviving LGGs. These data suggest that the long-term implications of EBRT should be considered when making treatment decisions for this patient population.

In this time period, FUS has gained US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of two neurological disorders, and ongoing efforts seek to expand the lesion profile that is amenable to ultrasonic intervention. In the following review, we highlight future applications for FUS therapy and compare its potential role against established technologies, including deep brain stimulation and stereotactic radiosurgery. Particular attention is paid to tissue ablation, blood-brain-barrier opening, and gene therapy. We also address technical and infrastructural challenges involved with FUS use and summarize the hurdles that must be overcome before FUS becomes widely accepted in the neurosurgical community.

T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM3) is a late-phase checkpoint receptor traditionally associated with T cell exhaustion. We apply fluorescent imaging techniques to explore feasibility of in vivo visualization of the immune state in a glioblastoma mouse model.TIM3 monoclonal antibody was The TIM3 experimental conjugate control were assessed for specificity with immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry over intravenous TIM3-800CW injection to assess tumor-specific uptake. Cell-specific uptake was then assessed on histologic sections.The experimental TIM3-800CW, but not its isotype control, bound to RAW264.7 macrophages in vitro. Specificity to RAW264.7 macrophages and not GL261 tumor cells was quantitatively confirmed with the corresponding clone of TIM3 on flow cytometry. In vivo fluorescence imaging of the 800CW signal was localized to the intracranial tumor and significantly higher for the TIM3-800CW cohort, relative to non-targeting isotype control, immediately after tail vein injection and for up to 48h after injection. Resected organs of tumor bearing mice showed significantly higher uptake in the liver and spleen. TIM3-800CW was seen to co-stain CD206 (26%).We propose fluorescent imaging of immune cell imaging as a potential strategy for monitoring and localizing immunologically relevant foci in the setting of brain tumors. Alternative markers and target validation will further clarify the temporal relationship of immunosuppressive effector cells throughout glioma resistance.

Understanding care heterogeneity could inform future approaches for standardization of practices.To describe treatment heterogeneity in surgically-managed LBP and LEP.Retrospective study of a nationwide commercial database spanning inpatient and outpatient encounters for enrollees of eligible employer-supplied healthcare plans (2007-2016).A population-based sample of opioid-nave adult patients with newly-diagnosed LBP or LEP were identified. Inclusion required at least 12-months of pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis continuous follow-up.Included treatments/evaluations include conservative management (chiropractic manipulative therapy, physical therapy, epidural steroid injections), imaging (x-ray, MRI, CT), pharmaceuticals (opioids, benzodiazepines), and spine surgery (decompression, fusion).Primary outcomes-of-interest expenditures (inpatient and outpatient) and 12-month opioid usage.Analyses include interrogation of care sequence heterogeneity and temporal trends in sequence-initiating services. Comparisons were conducted in the framework of sequence-specific treatment sequences, which reflect the personalized order of healthcare services pursued by each patient. Outlier sequences characterized by high opioid use and costs were identified from frequently observed surgical treatment sequences using Mahalanobis distance.A total of 2,496,908 opioid-nave adult patients with newly-diagnosed LBP or LEP were included (29,519 surgical). In the matched setting, increased care sequence heterogeneity was observed in surgical patients (0.51 vs 0.12 previously-unused interventions/studies pursued per month). Early opioid and MRI use has decreased between 2008 and 2015 but is matched by increases in early benzodiazepine and x-ray use. Outlier sequences, characterized by increased opioid use and costs, were found in 5.8% of surgical patients. Use of imaging prior to conservative management was common in patients pursuing outlier sequences compared to non-outlier sequences (96.5% vs 63.8%, p<0.001). Non-outlier were early conservative interventions (31.9% vs 7.4%, p<0.001).Surgically-managed LBP and LEP care sequences demonstrate high heterogeneity despite established practice guidelines. Outlier sequences associated with high opioid usage and costs can be identified and are characterized by increased early imaging and decreased early conservative management. Elements that may portend suboptimal longitudinal management could provide opportunities for standardization of patient care.

Characterizing the effect of obesity on LDD surgery is important given the growing elderly obese population.This study identified patients with who underwent surgery for LDD between 2007 and 2016. Patients were stratified based on whether the patient had a concurrent diagnosis of obesity at time of surgery. Propensity score matching (PSM) was then utilized to mitigate intergroup differences between patients with and without obesity. Patients who underwent three or more levels surgical correction, were under the age of 18years, or those with any previous history of trauma or tumor were excluded from this study. Baseline comorbidities, postoperative complication rates, and reoperation rates were determined.A total of 67,215 patients underwent primary lumbar degenerative surgery, of which 22,405 (33%) were obese. After propensity score matching, baseline covariates of the two cohorts were similar. The complication rate was 8.3% in the nonobese cohort and 10.4% in the obese cohort (P<0.0001). Patients with obesity also had longer lengths of stay (2.7days vs. 2.4days, P<0.05), and higher rates of reoperation and readmission at all time-points through the study follow-up period to their nonobese counterparts (P<0.05). Including payments after discharge, lumbar degenerative surgery in patients with obesity was associated with higher payments throughout the 2-year follow-up period ($68,061 vs. $59,068 P<0.05).Patients with a diagnosis of obesity at time of LDD surgery are at a higher risk for postoperative complications, reoperation, and readmission.Level of Evidence: 4.

European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaires core-30 (QLQ-30) and brain cancer specific module (QLQ-BN20) were obtained before SRS and at each follow-up. Nine scales were analyzed (global health status; physical, social, and emotional functioning; motor dysfunction, communication deficit, fatigue, insomnia, and future uncertainty). QoL was assessed with mixed effects models. Differences 10 points with q-value (adjusted P-value to account for multiplicity of testing) <0.10 were considered significant.Between 2009 and 2014, 50 enrolled patients completed 277 QoL questionnaires. Median questionnaire follow-up was 11.8 months. After SRS, insomnia demonstrated significant improvement (q=0.032, -17.7 points at 15mo post-SRS), and future uncertainty demonstrated worsening (q=0.018, +9.9 points at 15mo post-SRS). Following intracranial progression and salvage SRS, there were no significant QoL changes. The impact of salvage whole brain radiotherapy could not be assessed because of limited data (n=4 patients). In the 28% of patients that had adverse radiation effect, QoL had significant worsening in 3 metrics (physical functioning, q=0.024, emotional functioning q=0.001, and future uncertainty, q=0.004).For patients treated with 3-fraction SRS for large brain metastasis cavities, 8 of 9 QoL metrics were unchanged or improved after initial SRS. Intracranial tumor progression and salvage SRS did not impact QoL. Adverse radiation effect may be associated with at least short-term QoL impairments, but requires further investigation.

We characterize the extent of financial toxicity among this population and identify factors associated with financial toxicity.We prospectively surveyed adult patients with brain and spine metastases who received radiosurgery at a large academic medical center between January 2018 and December 2019. Financial toxicity was measured with the Personal Financial Wellness (PFW) Scale.In total, 93 patients were included with a median survival of 17.7 months. Most patients had private insurance (47%) or Medicare with supplemental insurance (42%) while 11% of patients were uninsured or insured by Medicaid/Medicare/Veterans Affairs. 60% of patients were primary income earners of which 52% had dependents. The median PFW score was 7.0 (interquartile range, 5.1-9.1) with financial toxicity reported in 23 (25%) patients. After adjusting for age and education level, private insurance (OR 0.28; p=0.080) was associated with a lower likelihood of financial toxicity. At least one emergency department visit (OR 3.87; p=0.024) and a cancer-related change in employment status (OR 3.63; p=0.036) were associated with greater likelihood of reporting financial toxicity.Most poor prognosis cancer patients with brain and spine metastases treated at a tertiary center are primary income earners and experience financial toxicity. Further studies are warranted to assess the longitudinal impact of financial toxicity in patients with metastatic cancer, particularly those with at least one emergency department visit and a cancer-related change in employment status.

In one of the first studies of SE after neurosurgery, the authors assess the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of postneurosurgical SE (PNSE).Neurosurgical admissions from the MarketScan Claims and Encounters database (2007 through 2015) were assessed in a longitudinal cross-sectional sample of privately insured patients who underwent qualifying cranial procedures in the US and were older than 18 years of age. The incidence of early (in-hospital) and late (postdischarge readmission) SE and associated mortality was assessed. Procedural, pathological, demographic, and anatomical covariates parameterized multivariable logistic regression and Cox models. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the incidence of early and late PNSE. A risk-stratification simulation was performed, combining individual predictors into singular risk estimates.A total of 197,218 admissions (218,217 procedures) were identified. Early PNSE occurred during 637 (0.32%) of 197,218 admissions for cranial neurosurgical procedures. A total of 1045 (0.56%) cases of late PNSE were identified after 187,771 procedure admissions with nonhospice postdischarge follow-up. After correction for comorbidities, craniotomy for trauma, hematoma, or elevated intracranial pressure was associated with increased risk of early PNSE (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.538, 95% CI 1.183-1.999). Craniotomy for meningioma resection was associated with an increased risk of early PNSE compared with resection of metastases and and CSF diversion (aHR 1.307, 95% CI 1.076-1.587) were associated with highest risk of late PNSE. Use of continuous electroencephalography in patients with early (p < 0.005) and late (p < 0.001) PNSE rose significantly over the study time period. The simulation regression model predicted that patients at high risk for early PNSE experienced a 1.10% event rate compared with those at low risk (0.07%). Similarly, patients predicted to be at highest risk for late PNSE were significantly more likely to eventually develop late PNSE than those at lowest risk (HR 54.16, 95% CI 24.99-104.80).Occurrence of early and late PNSE was associated with discrete neurosurgical pathologies and increased mortality. These data provide a framework for prospective validation of clinical and perioperative risk factors and indicate patients for heightened diagnostic suspicion of PNSE.

These agents often cause immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), which have been associated with increased overall survival (OS). Intracranial disease control and OS for patients experiencing IRAEs with metastatic NSCLC and brain metastases have not yet been described.We performed a single-institution, retrospective review of patients with NSCLC and existing diagnosis of brain metastasis, who underwent pembrolizumab treatment and developed any grade IRAE. The primary outcome of the study was intracranial time to treatment failure (TTF), defined from time of pembrolizumab initiation to new intracranial disease progression or death. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed.A total of 63 patients with NSCLC brain metastasis were identified, and 24 developed IRAEs. Patients with any grade IRAEs had longer OS (21 vs. 10months, p=0.004), systemic TTF vs. p=0.001), relative patients without IRAEs. Presence of IRAEs and high PD-L1 (50%), but not absent/moderate PD-L1 (0-49%), had a positive association for OS, systemic TTF, and intracranial TTF. Following multivariable analysis, IRAE experienced on pembrolizumab was an independent predictor of OS, systemic TTF, and intracranial TTF.In our series of patients with NSCLC and brain metastases treated with pembrolizumab, IRAE presence was associated with a significant increase in OS, systemic TTF, and intracranial TTF. Future studies with increased cohorts will clarify how IRAEs should be interpreted among molecular subtypes.

Here, we review the literature and discuss the management of patients who present with brain tumors during pregnancy. Between 2009 and 2019, 9 patients were diagnosed at our institution with brain tumors during pregnancy. Clinical information was extracted from the electronic medical records. The median age at presentation was 29 years (range, 25-38 years). The most common symptoms at presentation included headache (n=5), visual changes (n=4), hemiparesis (n=3), and seizures (n=3). The median gestational age at presentation was 20.5 weeks (range, 11-37 weeks). Of note, 8 patients (89%) delivered healthy newborns, and 1 patient terminated her pregnancy. In addition, 5 patients (56%) required neurosurgical procedures during pregnancy (gestational ages, 14-37 weeks) because of disease progression (n=2) or neurologic instability (n=3). There was 1 episode of postneurosurgery morbidity (pulmonary embolism [PE]) and no surgical maternal mortality. The median length of follow-up was 15 months (range, 6-45 months). In cases demonstrating unstable or progressive neurosurgical status past the point of fetal viability, neurosurgical intervention should be considered. The physiological and pharmacodynamic changes of pregnancy substantially affect anesthetic management. Pregnancy termination should be discussed and offered to the patient when aggressive disease necessitates immediate treatment and the fetal gestational age remains previable, although neurologically stable patients may be able to continue the pregnancy to term. Ultimately, pregnant patients with brain tumors require an individualized approach to their care under the guidance of a multidisciplinary team.

The effects on patients' interest of elective neurosurgical procedures are currently unexplored.Using Google Trends (GT), search terms of seven different neurosurgical procedure categories (Trauma, Spine, Tumor, Movement Disorder, Epilepsy, Endovascular, and Miscellaneous) were assessed in terms of relative search volume (RSV) between January 2015 and September 2020. Analyses of search terms were performed for over the short-term (Feb 18th, 2020-Apr 18th, 2020), intermediate-term (Jan 1st, 2020-May 31st, 2020) and long-term (Jan 2015-Sept 2020). State-level interest during phase I re-opening (Apr 28th, 2020-May 31st, 2020) was also evaluated.In the short-term, RSV of four categories (epilepsy, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. In the intermediate-term, RSV of five categories (miscellaneous, epilepsy, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. In the long-term, RSV of nearly all categories (endovascular, epilepsy, miscellaneous, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. Only the movement disorder procedure category had significantly higher RSV in states that reopened early.With the recommendation for cessation of elective surgeries, patient interest in overall elective neurosurgical procedures have dropped significantly. With gradual reopening, there has been a resurgence in some procedure types. GT has proven to be a useful tracker of patient interest and may be utilized by neurosurgical departments to facilitate outreach strategies.

How socioeconomic status (SES) impacts treatment access and outcomes for brain tumor subtypes is an emerging area of research. Few studies have examined the relationship between SES and meningioma survival and management with reference to relevant clinical factors, including age at diagnosis. We studied the independent effects of SES on receiving surgery and survival probability in patients with intracranial meningiomaMethods: 54,282 patients diagnosed with intracranial meningioma between 2003-2012 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program at the National Cancer Institute database were included. Patient SES was divided into tertiles. Patient age groups included \"older\" (>65, the median patient age) and \"younger\". Multivariable linear regression and Cox proportional hazards model were used with SAS v9.4. Results were adjusted for race, sex, and tumor grade. Kaplan Meier survival curves were constructed according to SES tertiles and age groups.Results: Meningioma prevalence increased with higher SES tertile. Higher SES tertile was also associated with younger age at diagnosis (OR= 0.890, p <0.05), an increased likelihood of undergoing gross total resection (GTR) (OR =1.112, p<0.05), and a trend towards greater 5-year survival probability (HR =1.773, p=0.0531). Survival probability correlated with younger age at diagnosis (HR =2.597, p<0.001), but not with GTR receipt.Conclusion: The findings from this national longitudinal study on patients with meningioma suggest that SES affects age at diagnosis and treatment access for intracranial meningiomas patients. Further studies are required to understand and address the mechanisms underlying these disparities.

Patients were stratified by approach type-anterior, posterior, or circumferential. Patients undergoing anterior and posterior approach surgeries were additionally compared using propensity score matching.A total of 6575 patients underwent multilevel cervical fusion for ACD correction. Circumferential fusion had the highest postoperative complication rate (46.9% vs posterior: 36.7% vs anterior: 18.5%, P < .0001). Anterior fusion patients more commonly required reoperation compared with posterior fusion patients (P < .0001), and 90-day readmission rate was highest for patients undergoing circumferential fusion (P < .0001). After propensity score matching, the complication rate remained higher in the posterior, as compared to the anterior fusion group (P < .0001). Readmission rate also remained higher in the posterior fusion group; however, anterior fusion patients were more likely to require reoperation. At index hospitalization, posterior fusion led to 1.5 higher costs, and total payments at 90 days were 1.6 higher than their anterior fusion counterparts.Patients who undergo posterior fusion for ACD have higher complication rates, readmission rates, and higher cost burden than patients who undergo anterior fusion; however, posterior correction of ACD is associated with a lower rate of reoperation.

This paper discusses how trauma during WWI led to advances in brain mapping from occipital injuries. Gordon Holmes was a British neurologist who was able to create a retinotopic map of the visual cortex from studying more than 400 cases of occipital injuries; his work has contributed immensely to our understanding of visual processing. There have been many extensions from Holmes' work in regard to how we analyze other sensory modalities and in researching how the brain processes complex stimuli such as faces. Aside from the scholastic benefit, brain mapping also has functional use and can be used for neurosurgical planning to preserve important structures. With the advent of more advanced modalities for analyzing the brain, there have been initiatives in total brain mapping which has added significantly to the body of work started by Holmes during WWI. This paper reviews the history during WWI that led to advances in brain mapping, the lasting scholastic and functional impact from these advancements, and future improvements.

The ReACT study investigated whether the addition of rindopepimut to standard bevacizumab improved outcome for patients with relapsed, EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma.In this double-blind, randomized, phase II study (NCT01498328) conducted at 26 hospitals in the United States, bevacizumab-nave patients with recurrent EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma were randomized to receive rindopepimut or a control injection of keyhole limpet hemocyanin, each concurrent with bevacizumab. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) by central review with a one-sided significance of 0.2.Between May 2012 and 2014, 73 patients were randomized (36 rindopepimut, 37 control). Rindopepimut toxicity included transient, low-grade local reactions. As primary endpoint, was 28% (10/36) for rindopepimut compared with 16% (6/37) for control (P = 0.12, one-sided).

Eighty percent of rindopepimut-treated patients achieved robust anti-EGFRvIII titers (1:12,800), which were associated with prolonged survival (HR = 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.45; P < 0.0001).Our randomized trial supports the potential for targeted immunotherapy among patients with GBM, but the therapeutic benefit requires validation due to the small sample size and potential heterogeneity of bevacizumab response among recurrent patients with GBM.

The authors report local control and toxicity outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to spinal metastases from GI primary cancers.A retrospective single-center review was conducted of patients with spinal metastases from GI primary cancers treated with SRS from 2004 to 2017. Patient demographics and lesion characteristics were summarized using medians, interquartile ranges (IQRs), and proportions. Local failure (LF) was estimated using the cumulative incidence function adjusted for the competing risk of death and compared using Gray's test for equality. Multivariable analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for death as a competing risk, on a per-lesion basis. Patients were stratified in the Cox model to account for repeated measures for clustered outcomes. Median survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.A total of 74 patients with 114 spine lesions were included in our analysis. The median age of the cohort was 62 years (IQR 53-70 years). other (10%). The 1- and 2-year cumulative incidence rates of LF 24% CI 23%-42%), respectively. Univariable analysis that older age (p = 0.015), right-sided primary CRCs (p = 0.038), and single fraction equivalent dose (SFED; / = 10) < 20 Gy (p = 0.004) were associated with higher rates of LF. The 1-year cumulative incidence rates of LF for SFED < 20 Gy10 versus SFED 20 Gy10 were 35% and 7%, respectively. After controlling for gross tumor volume and prior radiation therapy to the lesion, SFED < 20 Gy10 remained independently associated with worse LF (hazard ratio 2.92, 95% CI 1.24-6.89, p = 0.014). Toxicities were minimal, with pain flare observed in 6 patients (8%) and 15 vertebral compression fractures (13%).Spinal metastases from GI primary cancers have high rates of LF with SRS at a lower dose. This study found that SRS dose is a significant predictor of failure and that prescribed SFED 20 Gy10 (biological equivalent dose 60 Gy10) is associated with superior local control.

We reviewed tumor control and toxicity outcomes of post-resection SRS for deep brain metastases based on whether or not the surgical corridor was targeted.We retrospectively reviewed patients who had resected brain metastases treated with SRS between 2007 and 2018 and included only 'deep' tumors (defined as located 1.0 cm from the pial surface prior to resection).In 66 deep brain metastases in 64 patients, the surgical corridor was targeted in 43 (65%). There were no statistical differences in the cumulative incidences of progression at 12-months for targeting vs. not targeting the corridor, respectively, for: overall local failure 2% (95% Confidence higher in those without the corridor targeted.Omitting the surgical corridor in post-operative SRS for resected brain metastases was not associated with statistically significant differences in corridor or cavity recurrence or adverse radiation effect. As seen in recent prospective trials of post-resection SRS, the dominant pattern of progression is within the resection cavity; omission of the corridor would yield a smaller SRS volume that could allow for dose escalation to potentially improve local cavity control.

We sought to characterize the use in the United States of postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), an evolving standard-of-care associated with reduced cognitive effects.With the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database from 2007 to 2015, we identified patients aged 18-65 years treated with resection of a brain metastasis followed by SRS or WBRT within 60 days of surgery. Logistic regression estimated associations between co-variables (treatment year, age, sex, geographic region, place of service, insurance type, disease histology, comorbidity score, and median area household income and educational attainment) and SRS receipt.Of 4,007 patients included, from 16.5% (2007-2008) to 56.8% (2014-2015). Patients residing in areas with a median household income or an educational attainment below 50th percentile were significantly less likely to receive SRS after controlling for treatment year and other demographic characteristics (p<0.01). Factors associated with higher odds of receiving SRS included younger age, female sex, melanoma histology, Western region location, hospital-based facility, and high-deductible health plan enrollment (p<0.05 for each).Postoperative SRS for brain metastases has increased from 2007 to 2015, with the majority of patients now receiving SRS over WBRT. Patients in areas of lower socioeconomic class were less likely to receive SRS, warranting further investigation of barriers to SRS adoption.

Despite the many therapeutic antibodies that are FDA-approved with known toxicity, only a limited number of antibody-dye conjugates have been introduced to the clinic. Thorough evaluation of the safety, stability, and pharmacokinetics of antibody conjugates in the clinical setting compared with their parental components could accelerate the clinical approval of antibodies as agents for molecular imaging. Here we investigate the safety and stability of a near-infrared fluorescent dye (IRDye800CW) conjugated panitumumab, an approved therapeutic antibody, and report on the product stability, pharmacokinetics, adverse events, and QTc interval changes in patients.Panitumumab-IRDye800CW was made under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions in a single batch on March 26, 2014, and then evaluated over 4.5years at 0, 3, and 6months, and then at 6-month intervals thereafter. We conducted early phase trials in head and neck, lung, pancreas, and brain cancers with panitumumab-IRDye800CW. Eighty-one patients scheduled to undergo standard-of-care surgery were infused with doses between 0.06 to 2.83mg/kg of antibody. Patient ECGs, blood samples, and adverse events were collected over 30-day post-infusion for analysis.Eighty-one patients underwent infusion of the study drug at a range of doses. Six patients (7.4%) experienced an adverse event that was considered potentially related to the drug. The most common event was a prolonged QTc interval which occurred in three patients (3.7%). Panitumumab-IRDye800CW had two OOS results at 42 and 54months while meeting all other stability testing criteria.Panitumumab-IRDye800CW was safe and stable to administer over a 54-month window with a low rate of adverse events (7.4%) which is consistent with the rate associated with panitumumab alone. This data supports re-purposing therapeutic antibodies as diagnostic imaging agents with limited preclinical toxicology studies.

Controversy remains regarding optimal disease management.To evaluate patterns of care and optimal clinical management of pediatric pineoblastoma.A total of 211 pediatric (age 0-17 yr) histologically confirmed pineoblastoma patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 were queried from the National Cancer Database. Wilcoxon rank-sum statistics and chi-squared analyses were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Univariable and multivariable Cox regressions were used to evaluate prognostic impact of covariates. Propensity-score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics.Older patients (age4 yr) experienced improved overall survival compared to younger patients (age<4 yr) (hazard ratio [HR]=0.41; 95% CI 0.25-0.66). Older patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.21; 95% CI 2.61-10.78) and those 95% CI 1.21-8.61) received radiotherapy more frequently. Radiotherapy was independently associated with improved survival in older (adjusted HR [aHR] = 0.31; 95% CI 0.12-0.87) but not younger (aHR=0.64; 95% CI 0.20-1.90) patients. The benefits of radiotherapy were more pronounced in patients receiving surgery than in those not receiving surgery (aHR [surgical patients] = 95% CI 0.22-0.97). Older patients experienced improved outcomes associated with aggressive resection (P=.041); extent of resection was not associated with survival in younger patients (P=.880).Aggressive tumor resection was associated with improved survival only in older pediatric patients. Radiotherapy was more effective in patients receiving surgery. Age-stratified approaches might allow for improved disease management of pediatric pineoblastoma.

Several reports suggest these reactions can precede improved treatment responses. We sought to identify if such association exists for intracranial disease control.We conducted a retrospective chart review of melanoma patients who underwent immunotherapy treatment following diagnosis of brain metastasis. The study cohort was then stratified into two groups based on their history of developing an IRAE that prompted discontinuation of that regimen. The primary outcome variable included intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analysis were used to evaluate survival and predictors of outcomes.Fifty-two patients met inclusion criteria, seventeen of whom experienced severe IRAEs that led to discontinuation of immunotherapy. Median intracranial PFS was 19.9 vs 10.5 months (p = 0.053) in patients who did and did not experience severe IRAEs prompting discontinuation, respectively. No additional outcome benefits were identified for systemic PFS or overall survival, mean (33.1 months and 27.6 months, respectively). Multivariable analysis identified BRAF mutation status as a negative prognosticator of brain progression (p = 0.013, HR = 3.90). Initial treatment with BRAF inhibitor was also a negative predictor of all-cause mortality (p = 0.015, HR = 10.73) CONCLUSION: Immune related adverse events may signify an underlying immunogenic response that has intracranial disease control benefits. Despite their associated side effects, immunotherapies continue to demonstrate promising outcomes as a first-line agent for melanoma with brain metastasis.

Data regarding the impact of extent of resection and post-operative adjuvant therapy on gliosarcoma outcomes are limited. Methods: Patients with histologically confirmed gliosarcoma diagnosed between 1999 and 2019 were identified. Clinical, molecular, and radiographic data were assembled based on historical records. Comparisons of categorical variables used Pearson's Chi-square and Fisher's exact test while continuous values were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Survival comparisons were assessed using Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox regressions. Results: Seventy-one gliosarcoma patients were identified. Secondary gliosarcoma was not associated with worse survival when compared to recurrent primary gliosarcoma (median survival 9.8 [3.8 to 21.0] months vs. 7.6 [1.0 to 35.7], p = 0.7493). On multivariable analysis, receipt of temozolomide (HR = 0.02, 95% CI 0.001-0.21) and achievement of gross total resection (GTR; HR = 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.77) were independently prognostic for improved progression-free survival (PFS) while only receipt of temozolomide was independently associated with extended overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.03, 95% CI 0.001-0.89). In patients receiving surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide, achievement of GTR was significantly associated with improved PFS (median 32.97 [7.1-79.6] months vs. 5.45 [1.8-26.3], p 56.73 29.1], p = 0.0252). Conclusion: Multimodal therapy is associated with improved survival in gliosarcoma. Even in patients receiving aggressive post-operative multimodal management, total surgical removal of macroscopic disease remains important for optimal outcomes.

However, use of operating microscope for supratentorial tumor varies by surgeon.To assess complication rates, readmissions, and costs associated with operative microscope use in supratentorial resections.A retrospective analysis was conducted using a national administrative database to identify patients with glioma or brain metastases who underwent supratentorial resection between 2007 and 2016. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess 30-day complications, readmissions and costs between patients who underwent resection with and without use of microscope.The cohort included 12058 glioma patients and 5433 metastasis patients. Rates of microscope use varied by state from 19.0% to 68.6%. Microscope use was associated with $5228.9 in additional costs of index hospitalization among glioma patients (p < 0.001), and $2824.0 among metastasis patients (p < 0.001). Rates of intraoperative cerebral edema were lower among the microscope cohort than among the non-microscope cohort (p < 0.027). Microscope use was associated with a slight reduction in 30-day rates of neurological complications (14.7% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.048), specifically in nonspecific cerebrovascular complications. There were no differences in rates of other complications, readmissions, or 30-day postoperative costs.Use of operative microscope for supratentorial resections varies by state and is associated with higher cost of surgery. Microscope use may be associated with lower rates of intraoperative cerebral edema and some cerebrovascular complications, but is not associated with significant differences in other complications, readmissions, or 30-day costs.

Prior database studies are of limited size and reported on patients who preceded the validation of temozolomide. Thus, we provide an updated population-based analysis of the treatment trends and outcomes since the standardization of GB adjuvant chemoradiation. Patients diagnosed with primary cerebellar and supratentorial GB were identified from the National Cancer Database spanning 2005-2015. Patients were characterized by demographics, extent of resection, and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation status. Cohorts were primarily and secondarily assessed for overall survival by tumor site and treatment history, respectively. A total of 655 patients with cerebellar GB were identified (0.6%). Cerebellar GB patients, compared to supratentorial GB were more likely to undergo a biopsy or resection (13.4% vs 9.3% and 16.0% vs p-value<0.001), likely to pursue adjuvant therapy (48.4% vs 52.7%, p-value<0.001). Overall median survivals were 9.3 and 9.4months, respectively. On multivariable analysis, gross total resection, radiation, and chemotherapy were found to be predictors of improved overall survival (HR 0.77, p=0.038; HR 0.67, p<0.001; and HR=0.77, p=0.030, respectively). While many management principles are currently shared between cerebellar and supratentorial GB, aggressive regimens appear less frequently prescribed. Survival continues to match supratentorial outcomes and may benefit from future, systemic guidance by distinguishing molecular features.

The LACE index, based on four hospitalization descriptors, stratifies patients by risk of 30-day post-discharge adverse events but has not been validated in a procedure-specific manner in neurosurgery. Our study sought to explore the utility of the LACE index in cranial neurosurgery population and to develop an enhanced model, LACE-Cranial.The Optum Clinformatics Database was used to identify cranial neurosurgery (2004-2017). Procedures were grouped as trauma/hematoma/ICP, open vascular, functional/pain, skull base, tumor, or endovascular. Adverse events were defined as post-discharge death/readmission. LACE-Cranial was developed using a logistic regression framework incorporating an expanded feature set in addition to the original LACE components.A total of 40,431 admissions were included. Predictions of 30-day readmissions was best for skull-base (AUC=0.636) and tumor (AUC=0.63) admissions but was generally poor. Predictive ability of 30-day mortality was best for functional/pain admissions (AUC=0.957) and poorest for trauma/hematoma/ICP admissions (AUC=0.613). Across procedure types except for functional/pain, a high-risk LACE score was associated with higher post-discharge bundled payment costs. Incorporating features identified to contribute independent predictive value, the LACE-Cranial model achieved procedure-specific 30-day mortality AUCs ranging from 0.904 to 0.98. Prediction of 30-day and 90-day readmissions was also improved, with tumor and skull base cases achieving 90-day readmission AUCs of 0.718 and 0.717, respectively.While the index demonstrates inconsistent classification performance, the enhanced LACE-Cranial model offers excellent prediction of short-term post-discharge mortality across procedure groups and significantly improved anticipation of short-term post-discharge readmissions.

Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as CTCAE Grade 3-5 acute or late CNS toxicity, including adverse radiation effect (ARE), the imaging correlate of radiation necrosis.From 2010 to 2015, 30 patients were enrolled. The median age was 66 years (range 51-86 years). The median target volume was 60 cm3 (range 14.7-137.3 cm3). DLT occurred in 2 patients: one for post-treatment cerebral edema and progressive disease at 3 weeks (Grade 4, Dose 40 Gy); another patient died 1.5 weeks following SRS from post-operative complications (Grade 5, Dose 40 Gy). Late grade 1-2 ARE occurred in 8 patients at a median of 7.6 months (range 3.2-12.6 months). No grade 3-5 ARE occurred. With a median follow-up of 13.8 months (range 1.7-64.4 months), the median survival times were: PFS 8.2 and 27.2 months (95%CI if late ARE occurred vs. 11.7 months (95%CI 8.9-17.6) for no ARE (p=0.08).The per-protocol MTD of 5-fraction with 5-mm margins with concurrent temozolomide was 40 Gy in 5 fractions. ARE was limited to grade 1-2 and did not statistically impact survival.

Patients were stratified into mapped and unmapped (conventional) groups, and subsequently propensity-matched based on demographics, clinical comorbidities, and surgical characteristics (i.e., use of stereotactic navigation, microscope, intratumoral chemotherapy). Outcomes and charges were compared between matched groups using bivariate analyses.A total of 14,037 patients were identified, of which 796 (6.0%) received functional mapping. Propensity-matching (1:1) resulted in 796 mapped patients and 796 propensity-matched controls. Thirty-day postoperative rates of new-onset seizures, cerebral edema, hemorrhage, and neurological deficits were significantly lower for the functional mapping group (all p < 0.05). Functional mapping was also associated with shorter hospital length of stay (p = .0144), lower 30-day rates of emergency department visits (p = .0001) and fewer reoperations (p = .0068). Total costs of initial admission were not significantly different between groups.Intraoperative functional mapping during glioma resection was associated with decreased complications, reoperations, emergency department visits, and shorter lengths of stay. Furthermore, total charges of mapped resections were not significantly different from those of conventional resections. These findings support the utility of functional mapping for resection of supratentorial primary malignant gliomas.

Postoperative cavity SRS is associated with a specific, under-recognized pattern of intracranial recurrence, herein termed nodular leptomeningeal disease (nLMD), which is distinct from classical leptomeningeal disease (cLMD). We hypothesized that there is poor consensus regarding the definition of LMD, and that a formal, self-guided training module will improve inter-rater reliability (IRR) and validity in diagnosing LMD.Twenty-two physicians at 16 institutions, including 15 physicians with central nervous system (CNS) expertise, completed a two-phase survey that included MRI imaging and treatment information for 30 patients. In the \"pre-training\" phase, physicians labeled cases using 3 patterns of recurrence commonly reported in prospective studies: local recurrence (LR), distant parenchymal recurrence (DR), and LMD. After a self-directed training module, participating physicians completed the \"post-training\" phase and relabeled the 30 cases using the 4 following labels: LR, DR, cLMD, nLMD.Inter-rater reliability specialists to training, IRR was lowest for LMD (K=0.33). After training, IRR increased across all recurrence subgroups and increased most for LMD (+67%). After training, 27% of cases initially labeled LR or DR were later recognized as nLMD.This study highlights the large degree of inconsistency among clinicians in recognizing nLMD. Our findings demonstrate that a brief self-guided training module distinguishing nLMD can significantly improve IRR across all patterns of recurrence, and particularly in nLMD. To optimize outcomes reporting, prospective trials in brain metastases should incorporate central imaging review and investigator training.

Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is known to regulate cell growth and survival in multiple cancers; however, the role of CK2 in MB is currently being studied. In this study, we verified the importance of CK2 in MB tumorigenesis and discovered that inhibition of CK2 using the small molecule inhibitor, CX-4945, can sensitize MB cells to a well-known and tolerated chemotherapeutic, temozolomide (TMZ). To study the role of CK2 in MB we modulated CK2 expression in multiple MB cells. Exogenous expression of CK2 enhanced cell growth and tumor growth in mice, while depletion or inhibition of CK2 expression decreased MB tumorigenesis. Treatment with CX-4945 reduced MB growth and increased apoptosis. We conducted a high-throughput screen where 4000 small molecule compounds were analyzed to identify compounds that increased the anti-tumorigenic properties of CX-4945. TMZ was found to work synergistically with CX-4945 to decrease cell survival and increase apoptosis in MB cells. O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity is directly correlated to TMZ sensitivity. We found that loss of CK2 activity reduced -catenin expression, a known MGMT regulator, which in turn led to a decrease in MGMT expression and an increased sensitivity to TMZ. Our findings show that CK2 is important for MB maintenance and that treatment with CX-4945 can sensitize MB cells to TMZ treatment.

In order to better understand the signaling pathways underlying glioblastoma invasion, we performed the first large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function screen specifically designed to identify genes that facilitate cell invasion. We tested 4,574 genes predicted to be involved in trafficking and motility. Using a transwell invasion assay, we discovered 33 genes essential for invasion. Of the 11 genes we selected for secondary testing using a wound healing assay, 6 demonstrated a significant decrease in migration. The strongest regulator of invasion was mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MAP4K4). Targeting of MAP4K4 with single guide RNAs or a MAP4K4 inhibitor reduced migration and invasion in vitro. This effect was consistent across three additional patient derived glioblastoma cell lines. Analysis of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in U138 cells with lack or inhibition of MAP4K4 demonstrated protein expression consistent with a non-invasive state. Importantly, MAP4K4 inhibition limited migration in a subset of human glioma organotypic slice cultures. Our results identify MAP4K4 as a novel potential therapeutic target to limit glioblastoma invasion.

This disease frequently requires surgical intervention through lumboperitoneal (LP) or ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting.To compare postoperative outcomes between LP and VP shunts, including failure and complication rates.A retrospective analysis was conducted using a national administrative database (MarketScan) to identify idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients who underwent LP or VP shunting from 2007 to 2014. Multivariate logistic and Cox regressions were performed to compare rates of shunt failure and time to shunt failure between LP and VP shunts while controlling for demographics and comorbidities.The analytic cohort included 1082 IIH patients, 347 of whom underwent LP shunt placement at index hospitalization and 735 of whom underwent VP shunt placement. Rates of shunt failure were similar among patients with LP and VP shunt (34.6% vs 31.7%; P=.382). Among patients who experienced shunt failure, the mean number of shunt failures was 2.11.6 and was similar between LP and VP cohorts. Ninety-day readmission rates, complication rates, and costs did not differ significantly between LP and VP shunts. Patients who experienced more than two shunt failures tended to have an earlier time to first shunt failure (hazard ratio 1.41; 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.85; P=.013).These findings suggest that LP and VP shunts may have comparable rates of shunt failure and complication. Regardless of shunt type, earlier time to first shunt failure may be associated with multiple shunt failures.

The management of indolent tumors such as meningiomas requires frequent MRs to monitor for interval growth. Given concern regarding GBCA deposition, we sought to determine if non-contrast MRs in patients with asymptomatic meningiomas were equivalent to GBCA-enhanced MRs in surveillance monitoring.This IRB-approved retrospective chart review included 106 MR sequences from 18 patients. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with asymptomatic meningiomas who received baseline contrast-enhanced and non-contrast axial MR imaging of the brain. Exclusion criteria included: 1) baseline or follow-up axial images were not available for review 2) baseline scan was obtained without contrast 3) diagnosis of meningioma was uncertain. Percent tumor growth was measured by comparing cross-sectional area at maximum tumor diameter from the earliest and most recent scans. For each patient, change in tumor size over time was compared using T1+contrast, T2, and T2 FLAIR sequences. These were compared to a qualitative consensus reading by a neurosurgeon and a neuroradiologist.Measured change of greater than 10% was taken to represent tumor growth. In 17 out of 18 patients, measurement of non-contrast studies (T2 and T2 FLAIR) matched consensus. For one patient, imaging on T2 suggested 11% growth while T2 FLAIR and overall consensus was stability.Our study provides evidence that non-contrasted MR images are equivalent to contrast-weighted MRs to follow change in tumor size over time in asymptomatic meningiomas.

Aggregated data on risks of Ommaya placement among thrombocytopenic patients is lacking. This study assesses complications, revision rates, and costs associated with Ommaya placement among patients with thrombocytopenia in a large population sample.Using a national administrative database, this retrospective study identifies a cohort of adult cancer patients who underwent Ommaya placement between 2007 and 2016. Preoperative thrombocytopenia was defined as diagnosis of secondary thrombocytopenia, bleeding event, procedure to control bleeding, or platelet transfusion, within 30 days prior to index admission. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess costs, 30-day complications, readmissions, and revisions among patients with and without preoperative thrombocytopenia.The analytic cohort included 1652 patients, of whom 29.3% met criteria for preoperative thrombocytopenia. In-hospital mortality rates were 7.7% among thrombocytopenic among non-thrombocytopenic patients (p < 0.001). Preoperative thrombocytopenia was associated with 14.5 times greater hazard of intracranial hemorrhage within 30 days following Ommaya placement, occurring in 25.6% vs. 2.0% of thrombocytopenic and non-thrombocytopenic patients, respectively (p < 0.014). Revision rates did not differ significantly between thrombocytopenic and non-thrombocytopenic patients. Thrombocytopenia was associated with longer length of stay (7.4 vs 13.9 days, p < 0.001) and additional $10,000 per patient in costs of index hospitalization (p < 0.001).This is the largest study to date documenting costs and complication rates of Ommaya placement in patients with and without thrombocytopenia.

Following SRS, local failure (LF) was defined as failure within or adjacent to the SRS target volume, while distant failure (DF) was defined as failure outside of the SRS target volume. Time to LF and DF was analyzed using competing risk analysis with death as a competing risk.Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of first SRS to the date of death or censored at the date of last follow-up using the Kaplan-Meier method.Twenty-one patients underwent SRS to 40 intracranial (n = 30) or spinal (n = 10) ependymoma lesions between 2007 and 2018, most commonly with 18 or 20 Gy in 1 fraction. Median follow-up for all patients after first SRS treatment was 54 months (range 2-157). The 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year rates of survival among patients with initial intracranial ependymoma were 86, 74, and 52%, respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidences of LF and spinal ependymoma patient experienced LF, DF, or death within 2 years of SRS. Three patients had adverse radiation effects.SRS is a viable treatment option for intracranial and spinal ependymoma with excellent local control and acceptable toxicity.

Post-operative SRS techniques are not standardized, and there is a concern for a different pattern of failure following post-operative SRS compared to WBRT. We aim to study the efficacy, toxicity, and failure pattern of post-operative SRS.We retrospectively reviewed outcomes of patients with resected BMs treated with post-operative SRS between 2007 and 2018. Overall survival (OS) and cumulative incidences of local failure (LF), overall distant leptomeningeal disease (cLMD)], and adverse radiation effect (ARE) were reported. Neurological death was determined for patients with leptomeningeal disease (LMD).A total of 442 patients with 501 resected BMs were treated over 475 total SRS courses. Median clinical follow-up and OS after SRS were 10.1 months [interquartile range (IQR) 3.6-20.7 months] and 13.9 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.8-15.2 months], respectively. At 12 months, event rates were CI 5%-10%) cLMD, nLMD). cLMD was associated shorter survival than nLMD (2.0 versus 11.2 months, p<0.01) and a higher proportion of neurological death (67% versus 41%, p=0.02). A total of 15% of patients ultimately received WBRT.We report the largest clinical experience of post-operative SRS for resected BMs, showing excellent local control and low toxicity. Intracranial failure was predominantly distant, with a rising incidence of LMD.

Here, we review technological advances that have enhanced what surgeons are capable of doing within and outside the traditional operating room.RECENT FINDINGS: Extent of surgical resection has improved with the use of MRI and fluorescent dyes intraoperatively. Neurological injury during brain tumor surgery has decreased with appropriate use of neurophysiological monitoring. New operative scopes have enhanced ability of surgeons to visualize tissues during dissection. Laser interstitial therapy and radiation treatment have made possible the treatment of previously considered non-operable brain tumors in addition to replacing or serving as adjunct to surgical treatment of brain tumors. Surgery remains an important pillar in treatment of most brain tumors. Ongoing technological advances have augmented extent of what is possible in this realm.

Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-resistant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common resistance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were resistant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired resistance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.

In a clinical study, we determined if therapeutic antibodies could be repurposed for intraoperative imaging during resection.Fluorescently labeled cetuximab-IRDye800 was systemically administered to three patients 2days prior to surgery. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging of tumor and histologically negative peri-tumoral tissue was performed intraoperatively and ex vivo. Fluorescence was measured as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), and tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) were calculated by MFIs of tumor and histologically uninvolved tissue.The mean TBR was significantly higher in tumor tissue of contrast-enhancing (CE) tumors on preoperative imaging (4.00.5) compared to non-CE (1.20.3; p=0.02). The TBR was higher at a 100mg dose than at 50mg (4.3 vs. 3.6). The smallest detectable tumor volume in a closed-field setting was 70mg with 50mg of dye and 10mg with 100mg. On sections of paraffin embedded tissues, fluorescence positively correlated with histological evidence of tumor. Sensitivity and specificity of tumor fluorescence for viable tumor detection was calculated and fluorescence was found to be highly sensitive (73.0% for 50mg dose, 98.2% for 100mg dose) and specific (66.3% for 50mg dose, 69.8% for 100mg dose) for viable tumor tissue in CE tumors while normal peri-tumoral tissue showed minimal fluorescence.This first-in-human study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of antibody based imaging for CE glioblastomas.

Group 3 medulloblastoma, the most aggressive molecular subtype, frequently disseminates through the leptomeningeal cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) spaces in the brain and spinal cord. The mechanism of dissemination through the CSF remains poorly understood, and the molecular pathways involved in medulloblastoma metastasis and self-renewal are largely unknown. Here we show that NOTCH1 signaling pathway regulates both the initiation of metastasis and the self-renewal of medulloblastoma. We identify a mechanism in which NOTCH1 activates BMI1 through the activation of TWIST1. NOTCH1 expression and activity are directly related to medulloblastoma metastasis and decreased survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. Finally, medulloblastoma-bearing mice intrathecally treated with anti-NRR1, a NOTCH1 blocking antibody, present lower frequency of spinal metastasis and higher survival rate. These findings identify NOTCH1 as a pivotal driver of Group 3 medulloblastoma metastasis and self-renewal, supporting the development of therapies targeting this pathway.

Materials and Methods In this prospective study, adults with high-grade gliomas were enrolled between July 2015 and July 2017. Each participant was administered intravenous ferumoxytol (5 mg/kg) and underwent 3.0-T MRI 24 hours later. Two sites in each tumor were selected for intraoperative sampling on the basis of the degree of ferumoxytol-induced signal change. Susceptibility and the relaxation rates R2* (1/T2*) and R2 (1/T2) were obtained by region-of-interest analysis by using the respective postprocessed maps. Each sample was stained with Prussian blue, CD68, CD163, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Pearson correlation and linear mixed models were performed to assess the relationship between imaging measurements and number of 400 magnification high-power fields with iron-containing macrophages. Results Ten adults (four male participants [mean age, 65 years 9 {standard deviation}; age range, 57-74 years] and six female participants [mean age, 53 years 12 years; age range, 32-65 years]; mean age of all participants, 58 years 12 [age range, 32-74 years]) with high-grade gliomas were included. Significant positive correlations were found between susceptibility, R2*, and R2' and the number of high-power fields with CD163-positive (r range, 0.64-0.71; P < .01) and CD68-positive (r range, 0.55-0.57; P value range, .01-.02) iron-containing macrophages. No significant correlation was found between R2 and CD163-positive (r = 0.33; P = .16) and CD68-positive (r = 0.24; P = .32) iron-containing macrophages. Similar significance results were obtained with linear mixed models. At histopathologic analysis, iron particles were found only in macrophages; none was found in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive tumor cells. Conclusion MRI measurements of susceptibility, R2*, and R2' (R2* - R2) obtained after ferumoxytol administration correlate with iron-containing macrophage concentration, and this shows their potential as quantitative imaging markers of macrophages in malignant gliomas.

A subset of patients, however, may die prior to the onset of symptoms. This study identifies clinical features that distinguish neurologically-asymptomatic NSCLC brain metastases patients that die prior to routine 3 month follow-up after SRS.Retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2017 identified 18 patients with neurologically-asymptomatic NSCLC brain metastases who died<3 months after SRS. Twenty-eight additional patients meeting criteria and surviving>6 months after SRS were identified. Clinical factors were examined to determine characteristics correlated with survival using cox proportional hazards and nominal logistic regression models. Logistic regression models using salient factors were trained with 10-fold cross-validation and compared to the graded prognostic assessment (GPA) and score index of radiosurgery (SIR) using the AUC from receiver operant characteristic curves.The median survival following SRS was 1.4 and 9.2 months for the <3 months and >6 months groups, respectively. Age, number of brain metastases, and Karnofsky performance status were associated with overall survival while gender and interval between primary cancer and first brain metastasis diagnoses were associated with <3 months and >6 months survival, respectively. Models using GPA and SIR performed poorly compared to preliminary metrics generated in this study for prognosis of both <3 months and >6 months survival.Physicians require data to provide high-value, cost-conscious health care. Clinical metrics can screen patients with asymptomatic NSCLC brain metastases likely to die prior to the standard screening interval and observation could be considered.

The widespread implementation of SRS for benign spinal tumors has been limited by lack of long-term data.To update our institutional experience of safety and efficacy outcomes after SRS for benign spinal tumors.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 120 patients with 149 benign spinal tumors (39 meningiomas, 26 neurofibromas, and 84 schwannomas) treated with SRS between 1999 and 2016, with follow-up magnetic resonance imaging available for review. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of local failure (LF), with death as a competing risk. Secondary endpoints included tumor shrinkage, symptom response, toxicity, and secondary malignancy.Median follow-up was 49 mo (interquartile range: 25-103 mo, range: 3-216 mo), including 61 courses with>5 yr and 24 courses with>10 yr of follow-up. We observed 9 LF for a cumulative incidence of LF of 2%, 5%, and 12% at 3, 5, and 10 yr, respectively. Excluding 10 tumors that were previously irradiated or that arose within a previously irradiated field, the 3-, 5-, and 10-yr cumulative incidence rates of LF were 1%, 2%, and 8%, respectively. At last follow-up, 35% of all lesions had decreased in size. With a total of 776 patient-years of follow-up, no SRS-related secondary malignancies were observed.Comparable to SRS for benign intracranial tumors, SRS provides longer term local control of benign spinal tumors and is a standard-of-care alternative to surgical resection.

Topical vancomycin has been an effective tool for reducing SSIs following routine neurosurgical procedures in the spine and following adult craniotomies. However, widespread adoption within the pediatric neurosurgical community has not yet occurred, and there are no studies to report on the safety and efficacy of this intervention. The authors present the first institution-wide study of topical vancomycin following open craniotomy in the pediatric population. METHODS In this retrospective study the authors reviewed all open craniotomies performed over a period from 05/2014 to 12/2016 for topical vancomycin use, SSIs, and clinical variables associated with SSI. Topical vancomycin was utilized as an infection prophylaxis and was applied as a liquid solution following replacement of a bone flap or after dural closure when no bone flap was reapplied. RESULTS Overall, 466 consecutive open craniotomies were completed between 05/2014 and 12/2016, of which 43% utilized topical vancomycin. There was a 1.5% SSI rate in the nontopical cohort versus 0% in the topical vancomycin cohort (p = 0.045). The number needed to treat was 66. There were no significant differences in risk factors for SSI between cohorts. There were no complications associated with topical vancomycin use. CONCLUSIONS Routine topical vancomycin administration during closure of open craniotomies can be a safe and effective tool for reducing SSIs in the pediatric neurosurgical population. View details Osimertinib tyrosine epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with T790M acquired resistance, and now approved in the first-line setting. However, data supporting the use of osimertinib in untreated brain metastases are limited, although it has established central nervous system (CNS) activity. Our study compares the clinical outcomes of patients experiencing progressing brain metastases treated with cranial irradiation and osimertinib with those treated with osimertinib alone.Forty patients who were treated with osimertinib at the Stanford Cancer Center from November 2015 to December 2016 were identified by searching an electronic medical record database. Eleven patients had progressing brain metastases and did not receive radiation (group A), 9 patients had progressing brain metastases and received radiation when starting osimertinib (group B), and 20 patients had stable brain metastases at the time of initiating osimertinib (group C). Patient and disease characteristics, radiographic responses, and survival outcomes were evaluated retrospectively for the three groups.The CNS response rate was 32.3%. Median time to treatment failure (TTF), overall progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 10.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-11.8), 8.8 months (95% CI, 6.2-12.1), and 16.2 months, respectively. Median TTF was 15.1 months for group A (95% CI, 1.7-28.5), 7.7 months for group B (95% CI, 0-15.5), and 10.7 months for group C (95% CI, 9.0-12.5). The median PFS was 8.8 months for group A (95% CI, 4.3-13.4), not reached for group B, and 8.4 months for group C (95% CI, 5.6-11.1). The median OS was not reached for group A and C, and was 16.2 months for group B. There was no apparent difference in TTF, PFS, or OS between the three groups.Receiving radiation prior to starting osimertinib for patients with progressing brain metastases did not prolong TTF, PFS, or OS in our series. To minimize the risks of radiation-related toxicity, delaying radiation could be considered for some patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with brain metastases who initially respond to osimertinib in the second-line setting.Osimertinib for the first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Although it appears to have central nervous system (CNS) activity, most clinical trials have excluded patients with untreated, progressing brain metastases. This study included patients with stable and progressing CNS metastases treated with osimertinib and found no apparent differences in median time to treatment failure, time to progression, and overall survival in patients who received osimertinib alone compared with those who received osimertinib and radiosurgery. This may support a clinician's decision to defer radiation for selected patients with untreated brain metastases who are candidates for osimertinib therapy.

We evaluated age, autograft usage, cranioplasty size, and cranioplasty timing on postoperative outcomes. We further analyzed associated costs. A subset analysis of adult cranioplasty patients with emergent indications, including stroke and trauma, was also performed.We identified 8,275 patients (mean 44.020.0 years, 45.2% male) consisting of 13.8% pediatric (<18 years), 76.0% adults (18-64 years), and 10.2% elderly adults (>65 years). Overall complication rate was 36.6%, mortality rate 0.5%, and 30-day readmission rate 12.0%. Elderly patients had the highest complication rate (p<0.0001). Overall, large cranioplasties (>5 cm) saw higher complication rates than small cranioplasties (5 cm, p=0.047). In those with emergent indications only(N=1,282), size did not influence complications-though large cranioplasties showed higher infection risk (p=0.02). Overall, autograft use did not affect outcomes, but was associated with higher complication risk-including infections-in the subset with only emergent indications (p<0.001, p=0.001). Late (>90 days) cranioplasty timing had higher complication rates in both the overall cohort and subset with emergent indications (p<0.001, p<0.001). Index costs of care were mainly driven by hospital payments in both the overall cohort and those with emergent indications.We found a high complication rate associated with cranioplasty in the U.S.A. Older age, large cranioplasties, and delayed cranioplasties increased complication risk overall. Among those with only emergent indications, complications were associated with a delayed time to cranioplasty and autograft usage.

Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at every follow-up visit after completion of radiosurgery. Changes from baseline for 9 predefined HRQOL measures (global quality of life, physical functioning, social functioning, emotional functioning, motor dysfunction, communication deficit, fatigue, insomnia, and future uncertainty) were calculated at every time point.With a median follow-up time of 10.4months (range, 0.4-52months), 139 total HRQOL questionnaires were completed by the 30 patients on trial. Compliance with HRQOL assessment was 76% at 12months. Communication deficit significantly worsened over time, with a decline of 1.7 points per month (P=.008). No significant changes over time were detected in the other 8 scales of our primary analysis, including global quality of life. Although 8 patients (27%) experienced adverse radiation effects (ARE) on this dose escalation trial, it was not associated with a statistically significant decline in any of the primary HRQOL scales. Disease progression was associated with communication deficit, with patients experiencing an average worsening of 13.9 points per month after progression compared with 0.7 points per month before progression (P=.01).On this 5-fraction dose escalation protocol for newly diagnosed GBM, overall HRQOL remained stable and appears similar to historical controls of 30 fractions of radiation therapy. Tumor recurrence was associated with worsening communication deficit, and ARE did not correlate with a decline in HRQOL.

Despite its success in spinal surgeries, topical vancomycin has not been extensively studied with respect to cranial neurosurgery.To evaluate the efficacy of intrawound topical vancomycin for prevention of SSIs following open craniotomies.We retrospectively analyzed a large series of 350 patients from 2011 to 2015 in a pre/postintervention study of use of topical vancomycin to reduce postoperative craniotomy infection rates. We had a preintervention control group of 225 patients and a postintervention group of 125 patients that received intrawound topical vancomycin.Our preintervention incidence of SSI was 2.2% and this was significantly reduced to 0% following introduction of topical vancomycin ( P < .5). An ad hoc cost analysis suggested a cost savings of $59 965 with the use of topical vancomycin for craniotomies.Our study found a significant reduction in SSI rates after introduction of topical vancomycin. Thus, this simple intervention should be considered in all open craniotomy patients as both infection prophylaxis and a potential cost saving intervention.

Successful use of vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors in systemic malignancy has increased the hope that immune therapies could improve survival in patients with brain tumors. Manipulating the immune system to fight malignancy has a long history of both modest breakthroughs and pitfalls that should be considered when applying the current immunotherapy approaches to patients with brain tumors. Therapeutic vaccine trials for GBM date back to the mid 1900s and have taken many forms; from irradiated tumor lysate to cell transfer therapies and peptide vaccines. These therapies were generally well tolerated without significant autoimmune toxicity, however also did not demonstrate significant clinical benefit. In contrast, the newer checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated durable benefit in some metastatic malignancies, accompanied by significant autoimmune toxicity. While this toxicity was not unexpected, it exceeded what was predicted from pre-clinical studies and in many ways was similar to the prior trials of immunostimulants. This review will discuss the history of these studies and demonstrate that the future use of immune therapy for brain tumors will likely need a personalized approach that balances autoimmune toxicity with the opportunity for significant survival benefit.

Similarly, the risk of local tumor recurrence following SRS is <5% after 18months. With improvements in systemic therapy, patients are living longer and are at risk for both late (defined as >18months after SRS) tumor recurrence and late ARE, which have not previously been well described. An IRB-approved, retrospective review identified patients treated with SRS who developed new MRI contrast enhancement >18months following SRS. ARE was defined as stabilization/shrinkage of the lesion over time or pathologic confirmation of necrosis, without tumor. Local failure (LF) was defined as continued enlargement of the lesion over time or pathologic confirmation of tumor. We identified 16 patients, with a median follow-up of 48.2months and median overall survival of 73.0 months, who had 19 metastases with late imaging changes occurring a median of 32.9months (range 18.5-63.2months) after SRS. Following SRS, 12 lesions had late ARE at a median of 33.2months and 7 lesions had late LF occurring a median of 23.6months. As patients with cancer live longer and as SRS is increasingly utilized for treatment of brain metastases, the incidence of these previously rare imaging changes is likely to increase. Clinicians should be aware of these late events, with ARE occurring up to 5.3years and local failure up to 3.8years following SRS in our cohort. View details Posterior complications such as pseudomeningocele, external cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and meningitis. Various dural substitutes have been employed to improve surgical outcomes.This study examined whether the collagen matrix dural substitute type correlated with the incidence of post-operative complications following posterior fossa decompression in adult patients with Chiari I malformations.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 81 adult patients who underwent an elective decompressive surgery for treatment of symptomatic Chiari I malformations, with duraplasty involving a dural substitute derived from either bovine or porcine collagen matrix. Demographics and treatment characteristics were correlated with surgical outcomes.A total of 81 patients were included in the study. Compared to bovine dural substitute, porcine dural substitute was associated with a significantly higher risk of pseudomeningocele occurrence (OR 5.78, 95% CI 1.65-27.15; P = .01) and a higher overall complication rate (OR 3.70, 95% CI 1.23-12.71; P = .03) by univariate analysis. There was no significant difference in the rate of meningitis, repeat operations, or overall complication rate between the two dural substitutes. In addition, estimated blood loss was a significant risk factor for meningitis (P = .03). Multivariate analyses again demonstrated that porcine dural substitute was associated with pseudomeningocele occurrence, though the association with higher overall complication rate did not reach significance.Dural substitutes generated from porcine collagen, compared to those from bovine collagen, were associated with a higher likelihood of pseudomeningocele development in adult patients undergoing Chiari I malformation duraplasty.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 3,589 cells in a cohort of four patients. We obtained cells from the tumor core as well as surrounding peripheral tissue. Our analysis revealed cellular variation in the tumor's genome and transcriptome. We were also able to identify infiltrating neoplastic cells in regions peripheral to the core lesions. Despite the existence of significant heterogeneity among neoplastic cells, we found that infiltrating GBM cells share a consistent gene signature between patients, suggesting a common mechanism of infiltration. Additionally, in investigating the immunological response to the tumors, we found transcriptionally distinct myeloid cell populations residing in the tumor core and the surrounding peritumoral space. Our data provide a detailed dissection of GBM cell types, revealing an abundance of information about tumor formation and migration.

Coarsened matching was applied to estimate the effects of surgical approach on complication rates, length of stay (LOS), costs, and likelihood of postoperative radiation.We found that LOS, readmission, and revision rates did not differ significantly between approaches. The overall complication rate was higher for endoscopy (47% compared to 39%, OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.53). Endoscopic approach was associated with greater risk of neurological complications (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11-1.55), diabetes insipidus (OR 1.65, rhinorrhea (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.07-3.13) compared to the microscopic approach. Although the total index payment was higher for patients receiving endoscopic resection ($32,959 compared to $29,977 for microscopic resection), there was no difference in long-term payments. Endoscopic surgery was associated with decreased likelihood of receiving post-resection stereotactic radiosurgery (OR 0.67, (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.93).Our results suggest that the transition from a microscopic to endoscopic approach to sellar lesions must be subject to careful evaluation. Although there are evident advantages to transsphenoidal endoscopy, our analysis suggests that the benefits of the endoscopic approach are yet to be materialized.

Standard therapy depends on patient age and performance status but principally involves surgical resection followed by a 6-wk course of radiation therapy given concurrently with temozolomide chemotherapy. Despite such treatment, prognosis remains poor, with a median survival of 16 mo. Challenges in achieving local control, maintaining quality of life, and limiting toxicity plague treatment strategies for this disease. Radiotherapy dose intensification through hypofractionation and stereotactic radiosurgery is a promising strategy that has been explored to meet these challenges. We review the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma.

Controversy remains as to which is superior. Previous studies consist of small cohort sizes. This topic has not been investigated using national administrative claims data which benefits from larger patient numbers.Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Disease version 9 (ICD-9) coding at inpatient visit was used to select for index surgical procedures corresponding to microsurgical or endoscopic excision of colloid cysts. Comorbidities, costs, and complications were collected.We identified a total of 483 patients. In all, 240 were from the microsurgical cohort and 243 were from the endoscopic cohort. The two groups displayed similar demographic and comorbidity profiles. Thirty-day post-operative complications were also similar between groups with the exception of seizures and thirty-day readmissions, both higher in the open surgical cohort. The seizure rates were 14.7 and 5.4% in the microsurgical and endoscopic cohorts, respectively (p=0.0011). The thirty-day readmission rates were 17.3 and 9.6% in the microsurgical and endoscopic cohorts, respectively (p=0.0149). Index admission costs and 90-day post discharge payments were higher in patients receiving microsurgical excision.An analysis of administrative claims data revealed few differences in surgical complications following colloid cyst excision via microsurgical and endoscopic approaches. Post-operative seizures and thirty-day readmissions were seen at higher frequency in patients who underwent microsurgical resection. Despite similar complication profiles, patients undergoing microsurgical excision experienced higher index admission costs and 90-day aggregated costs suggesting that complications may have been more severe in this group.

Use of a novel technique, magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermotherapy (MRgLITT), resulted in the complete obliteration of the lesion without adverse effects or evidence of tumor recurrence at follow-up. This case illustrates that MRgLITT may provide a viable alternative for patients with brain metastases refractory to radiosurgery or in deep locations, where both stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and surgical resection may be ineffective.

Malpositioning or multiple attempts at catheter placement may lead to complications such as hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or tissue injury. Traditional navigation systems to guide placement require head fixation, which can lead to additional risks of pin placement as well as inconvenience, particularly with regard to patient positioning. Here we report our experience using frameless, electromagnetic (EM) image-guidance as a fast and low risk method of ensuring accurate ventriculostomy catheter placement.51 consecutive patients with frameless, EM image-guided Ommaya or VPS placement from 2011 to 2015.We retrospectively reviewed patient charts and recorded case duration and patient post-operative outcomes.Twenty-four (24) patients received Ommayas and 27 received VPS. Average time of operative room set up was 48min. Average case duration was 35min for Ommaya cases and 61min for VPS cases. All catheters were placed with one pass. One patient required revision surgery for obstruction or misplacement. No clinically significant hemorrhages occurred postoperatively.Ventriculostomy with EM image-guidance is a safe and efficient way to ensure proper catheter placement and minimize patient complications.

However, these patients have been successfully treated with hypofractionated SRS over 2-5 days, though dose constraints have not yet been well defined. We reviewed the literature on optic tolerance to radiation and constructed a dose-response model for visual pathway tolerance to SRS delivered in 1-5 fractions. We analyzed optic nerve and chiasm dose-volume histogram (DVH) data from perioptic tumors, defined as those within 3mm of the optic nerves or chiasm, treated with SRS from 2000-2013 at our institution. Tumors with subsequent local progression were excluded from the primary analysis of vision outcome. A total of 262 evaluable cases (26 with malignant and 236 with benign tumors) with visual field and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Median patient follow-up was 37 months (range: 2-142 months). The median number of fractions was 3 (1 fraction n = 47, 2 fraction n = 28, 3 fraction n = 111, 4 fraction n = 10, and 5 fraction n = 66); doses were converted to 3-fraction equivalent doses with the linear quadratic model using / = 2Gy prior to modeling. Optic structure dose parameters the probit dose-response model was performed using DVH Evaluator software. The 68% CIs, corresponding to one standard deviation, were calculated using the profile likelihood method. Of the 262 analyzed, 2 (0.8%) patients experienced common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 4 vision loss in one eye, defined as vision of 20/200 or worse in the affected eye. One of these patients had received 2 previous courses of radiotherapy to the optic structures. Both cases were meningiomas treated with 25Gy in 5 fractions, with a 3-fraction equivalent optic nerve Dmax of 19.2 and 22.2Gy. Fitting these data to a probit dose-response model enabled risk estimates to be made for these previously unvalidated optic pathway constraints: the Dmax limits of 12Gy in 1 fraction from QUANTEC, 19.5Gy in 3 fractions from Timmerman 2008, and 25Gy in 5 fractions from AAPM Task Group 101 all had less than 1% risk. In 262 patients with perioptic tumors treated with SRS, we found a risk of optic complications of less than 1%. These data support previously unvalidated estimates as safe guidelines, which may in fact underestimate the tolerance of the optic structures, particularly in patients without prior radiation. Further investigation would refine the estimated normal tissue complication probability for SRS near the optic apparatus.

Here we review the literature on malignant gliomas treated with endovascular therapy. Endovascular therapy for malignant gliomas falls into one of three categories: (1) neoadjuvant embolization and devascularization; (2) direct intra-arterial drug delivery; and (3) disruption of the blood-brain barrier for improved intra-arterial drug delivery. There is a range of therapeutic benefits based on the endovascular intervention used. Challenges remain for those who aim to treat malignant gliomas with an endovascular approach. Specifically, embolization is difficult to accomplish in the small vessels that feed into malignant gliomas, and intra-arterial chemotherapy has yet to prove itself better than traditional intravenous chemotherapy. However, there exists promise in the therapeutic potential of intra-arterial chemotherapy paired with disruption of the blood-brain barrier at tumor-specific sites, and as such, continued research to optimize this approach is expected to yield benefit for patients with malignant gliomas.

A total of 262 evaluable cases (26 with malignant and 236 with benign tumors) with visual field and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Median patient follow-up was 37 months (range: 2-142 months). The median number of fractions was 3 (1 fraction n = 47, 2 fraction n = 28, 3 fraction n = 111, 4 fraction n = 10, and 5 fraction n = 66); doses were converted to 3-fraction equivalent doses with the linear quadratic model using / = 2Gy prior to modeling. Optic structure dose parameters the probit dose-response model was performed using DVH Evaluator software. The 68% CIs, corresponding to one standard deviation, were calculated using the profile likelihood method. Of the 262 analyzed, 2 (0.8%) patients experienced common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 4 vision loss in one eye, defined as vision of 20/200 or worse in the affected eye. One of these patients had received 2 previous courses of radiotherapy to the optic structures. Both cases were meningiomas treated with 25Gy in 5 fractions, with a 3-fraction equivalent optic nerve Dmax of 19.2 and 22.2Gy. Fitting these data to a probit dose-response model enabled risk estimates to be made for these previously unvalidated optic pathway constraints: the Dmax limits of 12Gy in 1 fraction from QUANTEC, 19.5Gy in 3 fractions from Timmerman 2008, and 25Gy in 5 fractions from AAPM Task Group 101 all had less than 1% risk. In 262 patients with perioptic tumors treated with SRS, we found a risk of optic complications of less than 1%. These data support previously unvalidated estimates as safe guidelines, which may in fact underestimate the tolerance of the optic structures, particularly in patients without prior radiation. Further investigation would refine the estimated normal tissue complication probability for SRS near the optic apparatus.

Because of their unique developmental origins and predicted functions, the distinction of microglia from other myeloid cells is critically important for understanding brain development and disease; better tools would greatly facilitate studies of microglia function in the developing, adult, and injured CNS. Here, we identify transmembrane protein 119 (Tmem119), a cell-surface protein of unknown function, as a highly expressed microglia-specific marker in both mouse and human. We developed monoclonal antibodies to its intracellular and extracellular domains that enable the immunostaining of microglia in histological sections in healthy and diseased brains, as well as isolation of pure nonactivated microglia by FACS. Using our antibodies, we provide, to our knowledge, the first RNAseq profiles of highly pure mouse microglia during development and after an immune challenge. We used these to demonstrate that mouse microglia mature by the second postnatal week and to predict novel microglial functions. Together, we anticipate these resources will be valuable for the future study and understanding of microglia in health and disease.

Here, we report the development of an immunopanning method to acutely purify astrocytes from fetal, juvenile, and adult human brains and to maintain these cells in serum-free cultures. We found that human astrocytes have abilities similar to those of murine astrocytes in promoting neuronal survival, inducing functional synapse formation, andengulfing synaptosomes. In contrast to existing observations in mice, we found that mature human astrocytes respond robustly to glutamate. Next, we performed RNA sequencing of healthy human astrocytes along with astrocytes from epileptic and tumor foci and compared these to human neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells (available at http://www.brainrnaseq.org). With these profiles, we identified novel human-specific astrocyte genes and discovered a transcriptome-wide transformation between astrocyte precursor cells and mature post-mitotic astrocytes. These data represent some of the first cell-type-specific molecular profiles of the healthy and diseased human brain.

Despite advances in surgery and chemoradiation, the survival of afflicted patients has not improved significantly in the past three decades. Immunotherapy has been heralded as a promising approach in treatment of various cancers; however, the immune privileged environment of the brain usually curbs the optimal expected response in central nervous system malignancies. In addition, GBM cells create an immunosuppressive microenvironment and employ various methods to escape immune surveillance. The purpose of this review is to highlight the strategies by which GBM cells evade the host immune system. Further understanding of these strategies and the biology of this tumor will pave the way for developing novel immunotherapeutic approaches for treatment of GBM.

Current Procedural Terminology coding at inpatient visit was used to select for meningioma resection procedure. Comorbidities and complications were obtained by use of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or Current Procedural Terminology coding. Associations between complications and demographic and clinical factors were evaluated with logistic regression.We identified a total of 2216 patients. Approximately 41% developed 1 or more perioperative complications. Approximately 15% were readmitted within 30 days of their procedure. The most frequent complications that occurred in our cohort were new postoperative seizures (11.8%), and general neurologic complications occurred in 4.4% and 16.1% of patients, respectively. Nearly 55% of elderly patients ( 70 years) developed 1 or more perioperative complication (vs. 39% of nonelderly patients). After we adjusted for comorbidities, elderly status and male sex were found to be significantly associated with increased odds for a variety of complications.In this study, we report complication rates in patients undergoing resection for meningioma. Because of the longitudinal nature of the MarketScan database, we were able to capture a wide array of specific postoperative complications associated with meningioma resection procedures. Care should be taken in the selection of candidates for meningioma resection.

(18)F FPPRGD2 uptake was measured semiquantitatively in the form of maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and uptake volumes before and after treatment with bevacizumab. Vital signs and laboratory results were collected before, during, and after the examinations. A nonparametric version of multivariate analysis of variance was used to assess safety outcome measures simultaneously across time points. A paired two-sample t test was performed to compare SUVmax. Results A total of 17 participants (eight men, nine women; age range, 25-65 years) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed within 3 weeks, prior to the start of bevacizumab therapy. In eight of the 17 patients (47%), (18)F FPPRGD2 PET/CT was repeated 1 week after the bevacizumab therapy; six patients (35%) underwent (18)F FPPRGD2 PET/CT a third time 6 weeks after starting bevacizumab therapy. There were no changes in vital signs, electrocardiographic findings, or laboratory values that qualified as adverse events. One patient (6%) had recurrent GBM identified only on (18)F FPPRGD2 PET images, and subsequent MR images enabled confirmation of recurrence. Of the 17 patients, 14 (82%) had recurrent GBM identified on (18)F FPPRGD2 PET and brain MR images, while (18)F FDG PET enabled identification of recurrence in 13 (76%) patients. Two patients (12%) had no recurrent GBM. Conclusion (18)F FPPRGD2 is a safe PET radiopharmaceutical that has increased uptake in GBM lesions.

Cox regression analyzed factors predictive for OS.Patients had a median of 2 metastases (range, 1-14) treated per course, with a median of 2 courses (range, 2-14) of SRS per patient. With a median follow-up after first SRS of 15months (range, 3-98months), the median OS from the time of the first and second course of SRS was 18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15-24) and 11months On multivariate analysis, histology, graded prognostic assessment score, aggregate tumor volume (but not number of metastases), and performance status correlated with OS. The 1-year cumulative incidence, with death as a competing risk, of local failure was 5% (95% CI 4-8%). Eighteen (24%) of 75 deaths were from neurologic causes. Nineteen patients (20%) eventually received WBRT. Adverse radiation events developed in 2% of SRS sites.Multiple courses of SRS, deferring WBRT, for distant brain metastases after initial SRS, seem to be a safe and effective approach. The graded prognostic assessment score, updated at each course, and aggregate tumor volume may help select patients in whom the deferral of WBRT might be most beneficial.

Previous research suggests that casein kinase 2 (CK2) may be a promising therapeutic target for GBMs. CK2 has enhanced expression or activity in numerous cancers, including GBM, and it has been demonstrated that inhibitors of CK2 regressed tumor growth in GBM xenograft mouse models. Our studies demonstrate that the CK2 subunit, CK2, is overexpressed in and has an important role in regulating brain tumor-initiating cells (BTIC) in GBM. Initial studies showed that two GBM cell lines (U87-MG and U138) transduced with CK2 had proliferation CK using siRNA or small-molecule inhibitors (TBBz, CX-4945) reduced cell growth, decreased tumor size, and increased survival rates in GBM xenograft mouse models. We also verified that inhibition of CK2 decreased the activity of a well-known GBM-initiating cell regulator, -catenin. Loss of CK2 decreased two -catenin-regulated genes that are involved in GBM-initiating cell growth, OCT4 and NANOG. To determine the importance of CK2 in GBM stem cell maintenance, we reduced CK2 activity in primary GBM samples and tumor spheres derived from GBM patients. We discovered that loss of CK2 activity reduced the sphere-forming capacity of BTIC and decreased numerous GBM stem cell markers, including CD133, CD90, CD49f and A2B5. Our study suggests that CK2 is involved in GBM tumorigenesis by maintaining BTIC through the regulation of -catenin.Oncogene advance online publication, 22 September 2014; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.299.

Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach to GBM therapy as the idea the human CNS is immunoprivileged is being challenged. Early clinical studies of vaccine-based approaches have been encouraging, but further investigation is required before these therapies become clinically meaningful. A key challenge in immunotherapy involves identification of target antigens that are specific and sensitive for GBM. Here we discuss tumor-associated antigens that have been targeted for GBM therapy, strategies for discovery of novel antigens, and the theory of epitope spreading as it applies to GBM immunotherapy.

Traditional treatments, including radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, are not curative, making it imperative to find more effective treatments for this lethal disease. -Glutamyl transferase (GGT) is a family of enzymes that was shown to control crucial redox-sensitive functions and to regulate the balance between proliferation and apoptosis. GGT7 is a novel GGT family member that is highly expressed in brain and was previously shown to have decreased expression in gliomas. Since other members of the GGT family were found to be altered in a variety of cancers, we hypothesized that GGT7 could regulate GBM growth and formation.To determine if GGT7 is involved in GBM tumorigenesis, we modulated GGT7 expression in two GBM cell lines (U87-MG and U138) and monitored changes in tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo.We demonstrated for the first time that GBM patients with low GGT7 expression had a worse prognosis and that 87% (7/8) of primary GBM tissue samples showed a 2-fold decrease in GGT7 expression compared to normal brain samples. Exogenous expression of GGT7 resulted in a 2- to 3-fold reduction in proliferation and anchorage-independent growth under minimal growth conditions (1% serum). Decreasing GGT7 expression using either short interfering RNA or short hairpin RNA consistently increased proliferation 1.5- to 2-fold. In addition, intracranial injections of U87-MG cells with reduced GGT7 expression increased tumor growth in mice approximately 2-fold, and decreased mouse survival. To elucidate the mechanism by which GGT7 regulates GBM growth, we analyzed reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in GBM cells with modulated GGT7 expression. We found that enhanced GGT7 expression reduced ROS levels by 11-33%.Our study demonstrates that GGT7 is a novel player in GBM growth and that GGT7 can play a critical role in tumorigenesis by regulating anti-oxidative damage. Loss of GGT7 may increase the cellular ROS levels, inducing GBM occurrence and growth. Our findings suggest that GGT7 can be a promising biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for GBM.

They investigate various embolic materials, types of meningiomas amenable to embolization, imaging techniques, and potential imaging biomarkers that could aid in the delivery of embolic materials. They also analyze perfusion status, complications, and new technical aspects of endovascular preoperative embolization of meningiomas. A literature search was performed in PubMed using the terms \"meningioma\" and \"embolization\" to investigate recent therapeutic options involving embolization in the treatment of meningioma. The authors looked at various cohorts, complications, materials, and timings of meningioma treatment. Liquid embolic materials are preferable to particle agents because particle embolization carries a higher risk of hemorrhage. Liquid agents maximize the effect of devascularization because of deeper penetration into the trunk and distal tumor vessels. The 3 main imaging techniques, MRI, CT, and angiography, can all be used in a complementary fashion to aid in analyzing and treating meningiomas. Intraarterial perfusion MRI and a new imaging modality for identifying biomarkers, susceptibility-weighted principles of echo shifting with a train of observations (SW-PRESTO), can relay information about perfusion status and degrees of ischemia in embolized meningiomas, and they could be very useful in the realm of therapeutics with embolic material delivery. Direct puncture is yet another therapeutic technique that would allow for more accurate embolization and less blood loss during resection.

Symptoms began to resolve with supportive care over 48hours and had almost fully resolved within one week.This is the first known report of a patient with an autologous fat graft entering the subarachnoid space, intraparenchymal space, and ventricles following fat graft and lumbar drainage.This case highlights the importance of monitoring for complications of lumbar drain placement.

Although radiation has been described to control these tumors, it can leave the adolescent with long-lasting sequelae. Herein, we describe an alternative treatment strategy based on a combined subtemporal-transfacial surgical approach that permits the successful management of advanced stage JNAs by divorcing the intracranial vascular supply to these massive lesions.Four male patients were identified with Andrew's Stage IVB JNAs.All patients were treated by surgical resection using a combined subtemporal-transfacial surgical approach.Parameters assessed included tumor extent, number and types of surgical procedures, extent of resections, complications, and recurrence rate.Near-total tumor resections were achieved in all patients. No cerebrospinal fluid leak or cranial neuropathies were noted. All but one patient had local recurrences, and these could be managed with repetitive endoscopic debridement. No patient required adjuvant radiation treatment to control advanced disease.With the use of modern skull base surgical techniques, coordinated interdisciplinary care, and safe, near-total removal of the tumor mass, adolescent males with advanced JNAs may be spared the long-term morbidities associated with using radiation to treat these benign but aggressive lesions.

We compared nationwide complication rates and payments, independent of tumor characteristics, for these two strategies. Methods We identified 346 and 130 patients who underwent RS and TL approaches, respectively, for AN resection in the 2010-2012 MarketScan database, which characterizes primarily privately-insured patients from multiple institutions nationwide. Results Although we found no difference in 30-day general neurological or neurosurgical complication rates, in TL procedures there was a decreased risk for postoperative cranial nerve (CN) VII 2.3%, CI 0.08-0.86). Overall, there was no difference in surgical repair rates of CSF leak; however, intraoperative fat grafting was significantly higher in TL approaches (19.8% vs 60.2%, CI 3.95-9.43). In patients receiving grafts, there was a trend towards a higher repair rate after RS approach, while in those without grafts, there was a trend towards a higher repair rate after TL approach. Median total payments were $16,856 higher after RS approaches ($67,774 vs $50,918, p < 0.0001), without differences in physician or 90-day postoperative payments. Conclusions Using a nationwide longitudinal database, we observed that the TL, compared to RS, approach for AN resection experienced lower risks of CN VII injury, dysphagia, and dysrhythmia. There was no significant difference in CSF leak repair rates. The payments for RS procedures exceed payments for TL procedures by approximately $17,000. Data from additional years and non-private sources will further clarify these trends.

A dorsolateral funiculotomy was used to disrupt the dorsolateral funiculus and rubrospinal tract. Animals were then injected with either the scaffold polymer or scaffold polymer with BDNF. Postoperatively, motor functions were assessed with single pellet reach to grasp task, stair case reaching task and cylinder task. Histological study was also performed to look at extent of glial scar and axonal growth.Animals received BDNF containing polymer had an increased recovery rate of fine motor function of forelimb, as assessed by stair case reaching task and single pellet reach to grasp task compared with control animals that received the polymer only. There is no significant difference in the glial scar formation. BDNF treated animals also had increased axon growth including increase in the number and length of the rubrospinal tract axons.BDNF delivered via a scaffold polymer results in increased recovery rate in forelimb motor function in an experimental model of spinal cord injury, possibly through a promotion of growth of axons of the rubrospinal tract.

Glioblastoma tumors frequently express EGFRvIII, an EGFR variant that arises via gene rearrangement and amplification. However, expression of EGFRvIII is restricted despite the prevalence of the alteration. Here we show that EGFRvIII is highly co-expressed with CD133 and that EGFRvIII+/CD133+ defines the population of cancer stem cells with the highest degree of self-renewal and tumor initiating ability. EGFRvIII+ cells are associated with other stem/progenitor markers while markers of differentiation are found in EGFRvIII- cells. EGFRvIII expression is lost in standard cell culture but its expression is maintained in tumor sphere culture, and cultured cells also retain the EGFRvIII+/CD133+ co-expression and self-renewal and tumor initiating abilities. Elimination of the EGFRvIII+/CD133+ population using a bispecific antibody reduced tumorigenicity of implanted tumor cells better than any reagent directed against a single epitope. This work demonstrates that a mutated oncogene can have CSC specific expression and be used to specifically target this population.

The highly infiltrative and invasive nature of GBM requires that alternative treatments for this disease be widespread and targeted to tumor cells. Immunotherapy in the form of tumor vaccines has the potential to meet this need. Vaccines against GBM hold the promise of triggering specific and systemic antitumor immune responses that may be the key to eradicating this unrelenting cancer. In this review, we will discuss past and present clinical trials of various GBM vaccines and their potential impact on the future care of GBM patients. There have been many promising phase I and phase II GBM vaccine studies that have led to ongoing and upcoming phase III trials. If the results of these randomized trials show a survival benefit, immunotherapy will become a standard part of the treatment of this devastating disease.

The mechanism by which CK2 expression and activity leads to tumorigenesis in glioblastoma (GBM), a stage IV primary brain tumor, is being studied. Recent studies demonstrate that CK2 plays an important role in GBM formation and growth through the inhibition of tumor suppressors and activation of oncogenes. In addition, intriguing new reports indicate that CK2 may regulate GBM formation in a novel manner; CK2 may play a critical role in cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance. Since glial CSCs have the ability to self-renew and initiate tumor growth, new treatments which target these CSCs are needed to treat this fatal disease. Inhibition of CK2 is potentially a novel method to inhibit GBM growth and reoccurrence by targeting the glial CSCs. A new, orally available, selective CK2 inhibitor, CX-4945 has had promising results when tested in cancer cell lines, in vivo xenograft models, and human clinical trials. The development of CK2 targeted inhibitors, starting with CX-4945, may lead to a new class of more effective cancer therapies.

The cumulative incidence rates, with death as a competing risk, of LMD, local failure (LF), and distant brain parenchymal failure (DF) were estimated. Variables associated with LMD were including LF, DF, posterior fossa location, resection type (en-bloc vs and histology (lung, colon, breast, melanoma, gynecologic, other).With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 1-157 months), median overall survival was 17 months. Twenty-one of 165 patients (13%) developed LMD at a median of 5 months (range, 2-33 months) following SRS. The 1-year cumulative incidence rates, with death as a competing risk, were 10% (95% confidence interval [CI], LMD. univariate analysis, only breast cancer histology (hazard ratio, 2.96) was associated with an increased risk of LMD. The 1-year cumulative incidence of LMD was 24% (95% CI, 9%-41%) for breast CI, 5%-14%) for non-breast histology (P=.004).In patients treated with SRS targeting the postoperative cavity following resection, those with breast cancer histology were at higher risk of LMD. It is unknown whether the inclusion of whole-brain irradiation or novel strategies such as preresection SRS would improve this risk or if the rate of LMD is inherently higher with breast histology.

Average survival is approximately 1 year, but individual survival is heterogeneous. Using a single institutional experience, we have previously identified preoperative factors associated with survival and devised a prognostic scoring system based on these factors. The aims of the present study are to validate these preoperative factors and verify the efficacy of this scoring system using a multi-institutional cohort. Of the 334 patients in this study from three different institutions, the preoperative factors found to be negatively associated with survival in a Cox analysis were age >60 years (p<0.0001), Karnofsky Performance Scale score 80 (p=0.03), motor deficit (p=0.02), language deficit (p=0.04), and periventricular tumor location (p=0.04). Patients possessing 0-1, 2, 3, and 4-5 of these variables were assigned a preoperative grade of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Patients with a preoperative grade of 1, 2, 3, and 4 had a median survival of 17.9, 12.3, 10, and 7.5 months, respectively. Survival of each of these grades was statistically significant (p<0.05) in log-rank analysis. This grading system, based only on preoperative variables, may provide patients and physicians with prognostic information that may guide medical and surgical therapy before any intervention is pursued.

Prior studies have reported incidences of multiple lesions at the time of diagnosis ranging from 0.5 to 20 %. Multiple lesions can be further categorized as multifocal (multiple areas involved, but with a clear path of spread from one lesion to another) or multicentric (multiple lesions, no clear path of spread). In this retrospective study, we reviewed our experience with GBM and found the incidence of multiple lesions at time of diagnosis was 35 %, much higher than previously suggested in the literature. Patients with single lesions had an improved overall survival when compared to patients with multiple lesions (18 vs. 10 months). Patients with multicentric lesions fared the worst, with average survival of 3 months. However, the difference between single and multiple lesions (multifocal or multicentric) was no longer significant when taking into consideration age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS) and extent of resection by multivariate analysis. Age, KPS, gross total resection, and MGMT status were independent predictors of outcome. Multiple lesions did not independently confer a worse outcome, but were associated with lower KPS scores and inability to perform gross total resection. These findings suggest that single, multiple and multicentric imaging exams represent a spectrum of presentations of a single disease. The rate of multiple lesions reported here may be the result of improved imaging technology, suggesting that incidence of multiple lesions will continue to increase as imaging technology advances.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO), an inflammatory marker, was examined as a potential marker of vasospasm in patients with SAH. Daily serum samples from patients with aneurysmal SAH were assayed for MPO, and transcranial Doppler (TCDs) and neurological exams were assessed to determine vasospasm. Suspected vasospasm was confirmed by angiography. Peak MPO levels were then compared with timing of onset of vasospasm, based on clinical exams, TCDs and cerebral angiography. Patients with vasospasm had a mean MPO level of 115.5ng/ml, compared to 59.4ng/ml in those without vasospasm, 42.0ng/ml in those with unruptured aneurysms, and 4.3ng/ml in normal controls. In patients who experienced vasospasm, MPO was elevated above the threshold on the day of, or at any point prior to, vasospasm in 10 of 15 events (66.7%), and on the day of, or within 2days prior to, vasospasm in 8 of 15 events (53.3%). Elevated serum MPO correlates with clinically evident vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH. The potential utility of MPO as a marker of vasospasm is discussed.

Radiation therapy is the only treatment with proven effect and novel therapies are needed. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is the most common variant of the epidermal growth factor receptor and is expressed in many tumor types but is rarely found in normal tissue. A peptide vaccine targeting EGFRvIII is currently undergoing investigation in phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), the tumor in which this variant receptor was first discovered. In this study, we evaluated EGFRvIII expression in pediatric DIPG samples using immunohistochemistry with a double affinity purified antibody raised against the EGFRvIII peptide. Staining of pediatric DIPG histological samples revealed expression in 4 of 9 cases and the pattern of staining was consistent with what has been seen in EGFRvIII transfected cells as well as GBMs from adult trials. In addition, analysis of tumor samples collected immediately post mortem and of DIPG cells in culture by RT-PCR, western blot analysis, and flow cytometry confirmed EGFRvIII expression. We were therefore able to detect EGFRvIII expression in 6 of 11 DIPG cases. These data suggest that EGFRvIII warrants investigation as a target for these deadly pediatric tumors.

Few reports have identified the existence of arachnoid calcifications and intrathecal cysts causing progressive myelopathy. The literature regarding each of these pathologies is limited to case reports. Their clinical significance is not well studied, although known to cause neurologic sequelae.An 81-year-old female clinically presents with rapidly progressive myelopathy. magnetic resonance imaging identified multiple compressive thoracic intrathecal Surgical exploration and decompression calcified plaques within the arachnoid. Histopathologic examination revealed fibrocalcific tissue undergoing ossification with bone marrow elements.Due to progressive myelopathy, the thoracic cysts were decompressed and calcified plaques once identified intra-operatively.On last examination, the patient's neurologic status had not improved, but had stabilized. The rate of neurologic improvement from excision and decompression is variable, but it may still be warranted in the face of progressive neurologic deficits.

Analysis of patient tumor and matched adjacent normal (nontumor) tissue revealed that CD47 is overexpressed on cancer cells. CD47 mRNA expression levels correlated with a decreased probability of survival for multiple types of cancer. CD47 is a ligand for SIRP, a protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. In vitro, blockade of CD47 signaling using targeted monoclonal antibodies enabled macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells that were otherwise protected. Administration of anti-CD47 antibodies inhibited tumor growth in orthotopic immunodeficient mouse xenotransplantation models established with patient tumor cells and increased the survival of the mice over time. Anti-CD47 antibody therapy initiated on larger tumors inhibited tumor growth and prevented or treated metastasis, but initiation of the therapy on smaller tumors was potentially curative. The safety and efficacy of targeting CD47 was further tested and validated in immune competent hosts using an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model. These results suggest all human solid tumor cells require CD47 expression to suppress phagocytic innate immune surveillance and elimination. These data, taken together with similar findings with other human neoplasms, show that CD47 is a commonly expressed molecule on all cancers, its function to block phagocytosis is known, and blockade of its function leads to tumor cell phagocytosis and elimination. CD47 is therefore a validated target for cancer therapies.

The EGF receptor is often amplified in GBM and provides a potential therapeutic target. However, targeting the normal receptor is complicated by its nearly ubiquitous and high level of expression in certain tissues. A naturally occurring deletion mutant of the EGF receptor, EGFRvIII, is a constitutively active variant originally identified in a high percentage of brain cancer cases, and more importantly is rarely found in normal tissue. A peptide vaccine, rindopepimut (CDX-110, Celldex Therapeutics), is directed against the novel exon 1-8 junction produced by the EGFRvIII deletion, and it has shown high efficacy in preclinical models. Recent Phase II clinical trials in patients with newly diagnosed GBM have shown EGFRvIII-specific immune responses and significantly increased time to progression and overall survival in those receiving vaccine therapy, as compared with published results for standard of care. Rindopepimut therefore represents a very promising therapy for patients with GBM.

In the present study, we report on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available published data on the radiosurgical management of glomus jugulare tumors.To identify eligible studies, systematic searches of all glomus jugulare tumors treated with radiosurgery were conducted in major scientific publication databases. The data search yielded 19 studies, which were included in the meta-analysis. The data from 335 glomus jugulare patients were extracted. The fixed effects pooled proportions were calculated from the data when Cochrane's statistic was statistically insignificant and the inconsistency among studies was <25%. Bias was assessed using the Egger funnel plot test.Across all studies, 97% of patients achieved tumor control, and 95% of patients achieved clinical control. Eight studies reported a mean or median follow-up time of >36 months. In these studies, 95% of patients achieved clinical control and 96% achieved tumor control. The gamma knife, linear accelerator, and CyberKnife technologies all exhibited high rates of tumor and clinical control.The present study reports the results of a meta-analysis for the radiosurgical management of glomus jugulare. Because of its high effectiveness, we suggest considering radiosurgery for the primary management of glomus jugulare tumors.

Our understanding of this devastating cancer is limited by a dearth of available tissue for study and by the lack of a faithful animal model. Intriguingly, DIPGs are restricted to the ventral pons and occur during a narrow window of middle childhood, suggesting dysregulation of a postnatal neurodevelopmental process. Here, we report the identification of a previously undescribed population of immunophenotypic neural precursor cells in the human and murine brainstem whose temporal and spatial distributions correlate closely with the incidence of DIPG and highlight a candidate cell of origin. Using early postmortem DIPG tumor tissue, we have established in vitro and xenograft models and find that the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway implicated in many developmental and oncogenic processes is active in DIPG tumor cells. Modulation of Hh pathway activity has functional consequences for DIPG self-renewal capacity in neurosphere culture. The Hh pathway also appears to be active in normal ventral pontine precursor-like cells of the mouse, and unregulated pathway activity results in hypertrophy of the ventral pons. Together, these findings provide a foundation for understanding the cellular and molecular origins of DIPG, and suggest that the Hh pathway represents a potential therapeutic target in this devastating pediatric tumor.

It results from the in frame deletion of exons 2-7 and the generation of a novel glycine residue at the junction of exons 1 and 8. This novel juxtaposition of amino acids within the extra-cellular domain of the EGF receptor creates a tumor specific and immunogenic epitope. EGFRvIII expression has been seen in many tumor types including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), breast adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer, but has been rarely observed in normal tissue. Because this variant is tumor specific and highly immunogenic, it can be used for both a diagnostic marker as well as a target for immunotherapy. Unfortunately many of the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against EGFRvIII have cross reactivity to wild type EGFR or other non-specific proteins. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody to EGFRvIII is not readily available to the scientific community.In this study, we have developed a recombinant antibody that is specific for EGFRvIII, has little cross reactivity for the wild type receptor, and which can be easily produced. We initially designed a recombinant antibody with two anti-EGFRvIII single chain Fv's linked together and a human IgG1 Fc component. To enhance the specificity of this antibody for EGFRvIII, we mutated tyrosine H59 of the CDRH2 domain and tyrosine H105 of the CDRH3 domain to phenylalanine for both the anti-EGFRvIII sequence inserts. This mutated recombinant antibody, called RAb(DMvIII), specifically detects EGFRvIII expression in EGFRvIII expressing cell lines as well as in EGFRvIII expressing GBM primary tissue by western blot, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) and FACS analysis. It does not recognize wild type EGFR in any of these assays. The affinity of this antibody for EGFRvIII peptide is 1.7 10 M as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).This recombinant antibody thus holds great potential to be used as a research reagent and diagnostic tool in research laboratories and clinics because of its high quality, easy viability and unique versatility. This antibody is also a strong candidate to be investigated for further in vivo therapeutic studies.

EGF receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is the most common variant of the EGF receptor and has been detected in a large percentage of patients with glioblastoma multiforme but not in normal brain. Therapies targeting EGFRvIII are currently being investigated in clinical and preclinical trials.A 14-year-old girl who presented with headaches was found to have a pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation. We review the histopathological properties that led to the diagnosis of this tumor. EGF receptor gene amplification and EGFRvIII expression have not been analyzed in pineal tumors. We investigated EGF receptor gene status and EGFRvIII expression in this patient's tumor.Tumor tissue was obtained and analyzed with flow cytometry, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis. EGFRvIII was detected by all 3 methods. The tumor was further analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, which did not reveal EGF receptor gene amplification.This is the first report of EGFRvIII expression in a pineal tumor. It is interesting that this variant is detected in the absence of EGF receptor gene amplification. A larger study evaluating the presence of EGFRvIII in pineal tumors is needed.

Novel therapies are needed, and immunotherapy has emerged with great promise. The diffuse infiltration of malignant gliomas is a major challenge to effective treatment; immunotherapy has the advantage of accessing the entire brain with specificity for tumor cells. Therapeutic immune approaches include cytokine therapy, passive immunotherapy, and active immunotherapy. Cytokine therapy involves the administration of immunomodulatory cytokines to activate the immune system. Active immunotherapy is the generation or augmentation of an immune response, typically by vaccination against tumor antigens. Passive immunotherapy connotes either adoptive therapy, in which tumor-specific immune cells are expanded ex vivo and reintroduced into the patient, or passive antibody-mediated therapy. In this article, the authors discuss the preclinical and clinical studies that have used passive antibody-mediated immunotherapy, otherwise known as serotherapy, for the treatment of malignant gliomas.

It is commonly expressed in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), where it was initially identified. This constitutively active mutant receptor leads to unregulated growth, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis in cells that express it. EGFRvIII results from an in-frame deletion of exons 2 to 7 resulting in the fusion of exon 1 to exon 8 of the EGF receptor gene creating a novel glycine at the junction in the extracellular amino terminal domain. The juxtaposition of ordinarily distant amino acids in combination with the glycine that forms at the junction leads to a novel tumor-specific epitope that would make an ideal tumor-specific target. A peptide derived from the EGFRvIII junction can be used as a vaccine to prevent or induce the regression of tumors. This peptide vaccine has now proceeded to phase 1 and 2 clinical trials where it has been highly successful and is now undergoing investigation in a larger human clinical trial for patients who have newly diagnosed GBM. In this article, the authors discuss the preclinical data that led to the human trials and the exciting preliminary data from the clinical trials.

These studies demonstrate that radiosurgery results in similar glomus jugulare tumor control and a superior morbidity profile compared with surgical treatment. In addition, patients treated with radiosurgery usually remain stable clinically or improve. Given the indolent nature of these tumors, however, more follow-up is required to ensure that the immediate benefits are lasting. These preliminary reports demonstrate that the use of radiosurgery as a primary treatment for glomus jugulare should be extended to encompass more of the patients who are currently assigned to microsurgical treatment.

Sixty-two patients with 145 brain metastases of renal cell carcinoma or melanoma were identified.The median follow-up period was 10.5 months. Forty-four patients had malignant melanoma, and 18 patients had renal cell carcinoma. The median age was 57 years, and patients were classified as recursive partitioning analysis Class 1 (6 patients), 2 (52 patients) or 3 (4 patients). Thirty-three patients had been treated systemically with either chemotherapy or immunotherapy, and 33 patients were taking corticosteroids at the time of treatment. The mean tumor volume was 1.47 mL (range, 0.02-35.7 mL), and the mean prescribed dose was 20 Gy (range, 14-24 Gy). The median survival after SRS was 8.3 months. Actuarial survival at 6 and 12 months was 57 and 37%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, Karnofsky Performance Scale score (P < 0.01) and previous immunotherapy/clinical trial (P = 0.01) significantly affected overall survival. One-year intracranial progression-free survival was 38%, and local control was 87%. Intracranial control was impacted by whole-brain radiotherapy (P = 0.01), previous chemotherapy (P = 0.01), and control of the primary at the time of SRS (P = 0.02). Surgical resection had no effect on intracranial or local control. Radiographic evidence of radiation necrosis developed in 4 patients (6%).CyberKnife radiosurgery provided excellent local control with acceptable toxicity in patients with melanoma or renal cell brain metastases. Initial SRS alone appeared to be a reasonable option, as survival was dictated by systemic disease.

There is currently no established set of guidelines for this scenario. The objective of this study was to determine the risks and standard of practice for patients with VPSs undergoing abdominal surgery.A retrospective review of the charts of patients with VPSs who underwent abdominal or urologic surgery at the Stanford University Medical Center between 1995 and 2003 was performed. Data regarding type of abdominal surgery, level of contamination, choice of antibiotic therapy, perioperative management of the VPS, and outcomes were obtained.Twenty-six patient charts were reviewed, for a total of 39 operations (5 urologic, 23 upper gastrointestinal, and 11 lower gastrointestinal). Of these, 3 were clean, 34 were clean-contaminated, and 2 were dirty operations. Seven cases were laparoscopic, whereas 32 were open. Thirty-four cases required opening the bowel or urologic system. No patient had preoperative shunt externalization. All except one patient received pre- and postoperative antibiotics, but the duration and type of antibiotics were widely variable. The remaining patient had an inguinal hernia repair and received only one preoperative dose of cephalexin. Purulent fluid was found in 2 cases. One VPS found lying in purulent material next to an anastomotic leak was externalized and subsequently revised. However, in another patient, a VPS found lying next to a purulent jejunal tear was not externalized. This patient returned 2 months later with a VPS malfunction. In the remaining 35 cases, no VPS infection or malfunction was noted over 2 to 10 years of follow-up.The data suggest that there is minimal risk for VPS malfunction or infection among patients undergoing routine clean and clean-contaminated abdominal and urologic surgeries. Patients with VPSs undergoing these operations do not need externalization of their shunt. None of the patients in this study had a contaminated procedure. For dirty procedures, surgeons should opt to externalize the shunt. Future studies will aim to better standardize the perioperative management of VPSs during abdominal surgery.

Currently, there are four US FDA-approved drugs and several more in Phase III studies that target the EGFR. These drugs, while resulting in some dramatic remissions, have not resulted in strong nor consistent improvements in survival. EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII) is the most common variant of the EGFR and is present in many different cancer types but not in normal tissue. It results from the fusion of exon 1 to exon 8 of the EGFR gene, which results in a novel glycine at the junction. This mutant receptor is constitutively active in these tumors and can lead directly to cancer phenotypes due to its oncogenic properties. EGFRvIII is an attractive target antigen for cancer immunotherapy because it is not expressed in normal tissue and because cells producing EGFRvIII have an enhanced capacity for dysregulated growth, survival, invasion and angiogenesis. In this review, we will discuss preclinical and clinical data from studies using EGFRvIII as the target antigen for immunotherapy, with a focus on the potential for greatly improved survival for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme.

A review of the literature reveals controversy over the safety of lumbar laminectomy in the elderly and disagreement over estimates of risks in this population.Outcome measures were abstracted from the National Inpatient Sample. Multivariate analysis was performed to analyze the effect of patient and hospital characteristics on outcome measures.A total of 471,215 patients underwent lumbar laminectomy without fusion for lumbar stenosis from 1993 to 2002. The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.17%, and the complication rate was 12.17%. Postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma (5.2%) and nonspecific renal complications (2.8%) were the most common complications. Complication and mortality rates increased with age and comorbidities with an 18.9% complication rate and 1.4% mortality rate in patients over the age of 85 with 3 or more comorbidities, 14.7% complication rate and 0.22% mortality rate in patients over 85 with no comorbidities, and only a 6% complication rate and 0.05% mortality rate in patient between 18 and 44 with no comorbidities. Multivariate analysis revealed increased odds of mortality with increasing number of comorbidities and complications in the greater than 85 year age group. Increasing age, number of comorbidities, complication rate, and female sex also increased the odds of discharge to institution other than home.Elderly patients with comorbidities are at a higher risk for complications and adverse outcome after lumbar spine surgery. The effects of age and comorbidities on patient outcomes have been quantified. This information is critical in counseling elderly patients about the risk of surgery in their age group.

Following SRS, 4 patients had complete pain relief, 2 had minimal pain relief with some decrease in the intensity of their pain, and 1 patient experienced no pain relief. Pain relief was reported within 1 week of SRS in 4 patients and at 4 months in 2 patients. After a median follow-up of 28 months, pain did not recur in any of the 4 patients who had reported complete pain relief. Complications after SRS included bothersome numbness in 3 patients and significant dysesthesias in 1 patient.The authors have previously reported a 90% rate of excellent pain relief in patients with classic TN treated with CyberKnife SRS. Compared with patients with classic TN, patients with atypical TN have a lower rate of pain relief. Nevertheless, the nearly 60% rate of success after SRS achieved in this study is still comparable to or better than results achieved with any other treatment modality for atypical TN.

The authors used CyberKnife radiosurgery to denervate affected facet joints with the goal of obtaining a less invasive yet more thorough and durable antinociceptive rhizotomy.Patients with refractory low-back pain, in whom symptoms are temporarily resolved by facet joint injections, were eligible. The patients were required to exhibit positron emission tomography-positive findings at the affected levels. Radiosurgical rhizotomy, targeting the facet joint, was performed in a single session with a marginal prescription dose of 40 Gy and a maximal dose of 60 Gy.Seven facet joints in 5 patients with presumptive facetogenic back pain underwent CyberKnife lesioning. The median follow-up was 9.8 months (range 3-16 months). The mean planning target volume was 1.7 cm(3) (range 0.9-2.7 cm(3)). A dose of 40 Gy was prescribed to a mean isodose line of 79% (range 75-80%). Within 1 month of radiosurgery, improvement in pain was observed in 3 of the 5 patients with durable responses at 16, 12, and 6 months, respectively, of follow-up. Two patients, after 12 and 3 months of follow-up, have neither improved nor worsened. No patient has experienced acute or late-onset toxicity.These preliminary results suggest that CyberKnife radiosurgery could be a safe, effective, and non-invasive alternative to radiofrequency ablation for managing facetogenic back pain. No patient suffered recurrent symptoms after radiosurgery. It is not yet known whether pain relief due to such lesions will be more durable than that produced by alternative procedures. A larger series of patients with long-term follow-up is ongoing.

They can be associated with the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (Jacobsen nerve) or the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (Arnold nerve) and are also referred to as chemodectomas or nonchromaffin paragangliomas. Optimal treatment of these histologically benign tumors remains controversial. Surgery remains the treatment of choice, but can carry high morbidity rates. External-beam radiation was originally used for subtotal resections and in patients who were poor surgical candidates; however, radiosurgery has recently been introduced as an effective and safe treatment option for patients with these tumors. In this article the authors discuss the history of radiation therapy for glomus jugulare tumors, focusing on recent radiosurgical results.

We present a 57-year-old woman with carotid and vertebral rete mirabile who presented with an acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The majority of patients present with subarachnoid hemorrhage or ischemic stroke. This is the first case of a non-Asian patient presenting with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. In this case report, we describe the clinical and angiographic features of this unusual entity.

Because vasospasm also is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who survive the initial bleeding episode, it is imperative not only to diagnose the condition but also to predict which patients are likely to become symptomatic. The exact pathophysiology of vasospasm is complex and incompletely elucidated. Early recognition of vasospasm is essential because the timely use of several therapeutic interventions can counteract this disease and prevent the occurrence of DIND. However, the prompt implementation of these therapies depends on the ability to predict impending vasospasm or to diagnose it at its early stages. A number of techniques have been developed during the past several decades to evaluate cerebral perfusion, including and perfusion computed tomography. In this article, the authors provide a general overview of the currently available perfusion imaging techniques and their applications in treating vasospasm after a patient has suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The use of cerebral perfusion imaging techniques for the early detection of vasospasm is becoming more common and may provide opportunities for early therapeutic intervention to counteract vasospasm in its earliest stages and prevent the occurrence of DINDs.

In vitro, SP-A binds influenza A virus (IAV), neutralizes infectivity, and enhances uptake by macrophages. SP-D also binds and neutralizes certain strains of IAV. To determine if SP-A has a role in protecting the intact animal against IAV infection, we inoculated gene-targeted SP-A-deficient mice (-/-) and littermate controls (+/+) with either saline or increasing doses of an IAV strain that binds SP-A but not SP-D. IAV was more virulent in SP-A-/- compared with +/+ mice, with a significantly lower mean lethal dose (LD(50)) and significantly greater weight loss during infection. SP-A-/- mice also had increased airway epithelial injury and more alveolar cellular infiltrates than +/+ mice. On Day 2, SP-A-/- mice had more neutrophils and higher MIP-2 levels in the lung than +/+ mice. We conclude the altered host response and increased susceptibility to X-79Delta167 infection in SP-A-/- mice reflects a protective role for SP-A in regulating the host response to IAV. Because the recovery of virus from lung homogenates on Days 2 and 6 after inoculation was comparable in -/- and +/+ mice, we speculate SP-A reduces IAV virulence independently of direct viral neutralization.

To test the hypothesis that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mediates alveolar macrophage proliferation and activation and the type II cell hypertrophy seen in SP-D null mice, we bred SP-D and GM-CSF gene-targeted mice to obtain littermate double null, single null, and wild-type mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage levels of phospholipid, protein, SP-D, SP-A, and GM-CSF were measured from 1 to 4 mo. There was an approximately additive accumulation of phospholipid, total protein, and SP-A at each time point. Microscopy showed normal macrophage number and morphology in GM-CSF null mice, numerous giant foamy macrophages and hypertrophic type II cells in SP-D null mice, and large but not foamy macrophages and mostly normal type II cells in double null mice. These results suggest that the mechanisms underlying the alveolar surfactant accumulation in the SP-D-deficient and GM-CSF-deficient mice are different and that GM-CSF mediates some of the macrophage and type II cell changes seen in SP-D null mice.
