H1N1, or swine flu as it is sometimes called because it used to only affect pigs, affects the lungs and the stomach whereas seasonal flu does not. It is contagious and is spread easily between humans (Public Health Agency of Canada). ANTIVIRAL Medications to Treat H1N1 There are currently two western medications, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza),that are believed to decrease the severity of the symptoms or shorten the duration the illness but there is concern that overuse of the antiviral medications may make the virus mutate and become resistant to these medications. H1N1 Flu Shot The H1N1 flu shot is one conventional choice to prevent getting the H1N1 virus and is considered 80% effective. Not everyone is comfortable getting the H1N1 vaccine due to concerns that it has not been tested adequately and about a potentially serious neurological disorder called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome that afflicted approximately 500 people in the 1970s swine flu vaccination period. Essential Oils and Illness Universities and hospitals all over the world are proving that pure essential oils can treat and prevent a number of human illnesses. There are several essential oils that have antiviral and antibacterial properties that can boost the immune system and help to keep people healthy. For example, the University of Manchester England did research in 2004 on essential oils and MRSA and they found three essential oils that destroyed MRSA. Wythenshaw Hospital Burns Unit in Manchester England diffuse essential oil on the wards, where tests have proven that the oils diminished airborne bacteria by 90%. Essential Oils to Boost the Immune System Essential oils such as [Black Spruce and [Thyme essential oil](https://57aromas.com/product/thyme-white/) help to boost the immune system, helping the body to use its natural ability to fight off viruses. For maximum effect diffuse these essential oils daily for 20 to 30 minutes twice a day, in the office or place of work.
