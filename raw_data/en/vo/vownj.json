CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2015 III EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017 III It's been a busy summer for AAEP. In between convention preparations, AVMA/AAEP economic survey results com-pilation and our summer board meeting, we hosted more than 460 of our colleagues at one or more CE meetings: 360\u00b0 Hind Suspensory and Stifle, Focus on Colic, Focus on Dentistry and the triennial Equine Colic Research Symposium. Offering compelling CE to members is a hallmark of our association but just one of our priorities. Our strategic plan also calls for us to enhance membership value. I believe each of us largely feels that AAEP is a great value in itself, but one way we're enhancing that value is through the rollout of our new alliance with Vetcove. More than 300 practices have already signed up for the AAEP Inner Circle on Vetcove and are realizing efficiency and cost savings in their practice inventory as well as excellent value in the comparative drug buying system provided. The other economic value that AAEP provides is the Veterinary Club, a group purchasing consortium that is saving members considerable money on goods and services. At the July Focus meetings, more than 40 attendees signed up for the Veterinary Club on-site after seeing the potential savings for their practice. Take a look at these cost-saving benefits and see if they are a good fit for your practice by clicking the \"My Member Profile/Benefits\" button on the AAEP homepage.A number of national and industry concerns have come before your association this summer, with equine welfare front and center. As you know, AAEP has had a leadership role for many years in the attempt to eliminate soring of the Tennessee Walking Horse in the so-called \"Big Lick\" competitions. That effort began 47 years ago with passage of the Horse Protection Act and has been fortified in recent years by the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act. Unfortunately, that legislation has not moved, and attempts to move forward by regulation have been halted by administrative process. Many members are involved in this effort and hopefully a reasoned approach will prevail.The care and management of carriage horses working in urban environments has garnered headlines and is a topic that's been discussed by your Welfare and Public Policy Advisory Council. The increasing concern for the horses that roam public and tribal lands in the West also has hit the news. As a result, the AAEP will conduct an equine welfare planning session with its Welfare and Public Policy Advisory Council early next year to ensure our priorities are aligned on the many issues we face so that we may devote the proper manpower and resources to help the horse. If you have followed the Horse Racing Integrity Act discussions this spring, you know that AAEP has been working with all parties involved to attempt to assure the best interest of the racehorse is represented. The new version of the bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives contains a provision to eliminate the use of furosemide on race day for the management of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. That measure directly conflicts with AAEP's longstanding policy on the use of furosemide. As you will remember, AAEP Foundation has dedicated considerable funding towards research on EIPH and the development of alternative approaches so that the horse that suffers significant hemorrhage can be treated. As a result, the Racing Committee recommended that the board move our position on this bill from one of \"monitor\" to one of \"oppose.\" We continue to work with all parties to seek a solution to the many issues involved in this bill and to move forward in the best management of the racehorse. As summer turns to fall, we hope you are making plans to join us in San Antonio in November to take advantage of the exceptional program our convention program chair Dr. Margo Macpherson and the Educational Programs Committee has in store for us. Come learn, visit, party and attend the greatest equine veterinary convention on the planet. See you there. From the President's Desk: Aligning our equine welfare priorities Dr. Reynolds Cowles By R. Reynolds Cowles, Jr., DVM The adverse effects of soring practices can lead to severe lameness.IV EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017 Delegate Corner: Telemedicine, regenerative medicine resolutions approved by A VMA House of Delegates By Stuart Brown II, DVM The AVMA House of Delegates (HoD) convened for its summer session July 21-22 in Indianapolis, Ind., in conjunction with the AVMA annual convention. Dr. Cynthia MacKenzie and I represented the AAEP at this session, during which two bylaw amendments and eight resolutions concerning issues in veterinary medicine were considered. Two resolutions of particular note to those of us in equine practice addressed the ever-increasing interest in the area of telemedicine along with regenerative medicine. The HoD passed a resolution to adopt the proposed Policy on Telemedicine that seeks to support the existence of the valid veterinary-client relationship (VCPR) in treatment and care of animal patients while acknowledging the advancement of this area of technology and the potential need for evidence-based research on the impact telemedi-cine may have on access to patient care and safety. The HoD also passed a resolution to adopt the proposed Policy on Therapeutic Use of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine. With continued advancements in this area of interest to equine veterinary medicine coupled with the emerging number of providers of these products used in patient care, this resolution highlights the need of practi-tioners to carefully examine the resources for these products in the marketplace available to veterinarians in compliance with FDA guidelines for autologous type I and II cells, minimal manipulation and the homologous versus non-homologous use of the cell products. These regenera-tive protocols were recommended to be evidence-based with standardized processes in place by providers, in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices from FDA, to ensure safety and sterility of products to highlight concerns of potential liability. As always, the AAEP was well represented in the HoD and among the leadership positions throughout the AVMA's numerous councils and committees, helping guide the AVMA in development of its policy decisions. These volunteer leaders provide the critical insights necessary for our viewpoints in equine practice to be advanced. To that point, this year's session marked the conclusion of service after 10 years for my esteemed colleague and your AAEP delegate, Dr. Cynthia MacKenzie. Dr. MacKenzie has been an inspiring example of servant leadership and advocacy for the AAEP over this time with her dedication to numerous efforts while in the HoD. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge our appreciation for her tremendous work and sacrifice during her tenure on behalf of all of us as members of the AAEP.Congratulations are also due to three of our members who were honored during the AVMA convention with industry awards for their contributions to veterinary medicine: Dr. Andrew Clark, AVMA XII International Veterinary Congress Prize; Dr. Richard Award; and Dr. Bruce Kaplan, AVMA Meritorious Service Award. At the next HoD session in winter 2018, Dr. John De Jong will begin his service as AVMA President-Elect and Dr. Rebecca Stinson-Dixon will join me as your new alternate delegate representing the AAEP in the HoD. Dr. Stinson-Dixon is well known to many of you for her active roles on several AAEP committees and as the past AVMA vice president, and I look forward to working with her on behalf of the AAEP membership. Feel free to reach out to us at any time if you have questions or concerns we might address. You can reach us at sbrown@hagyard.com and rdixon@berry.edu. As always, we appreciate the opportu-nity to represent you, our distinguished colleagues, on behalf of the AAEP.

EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017 IX \"The best meeting I've ever attended,\" is how one practitioner summed up the AAEP's 360\u00b0 Diagnosing, Imaging and Treating the Hind Suspensory and Stifle at Colorado State University in July. \"The depth of the program, quality and approachability of the instruc-tors made it a very intensive learning experience. The chance to practice both imaging and diagnostic techniques was unique.\" The sold-out 360\u00b0 meeting, which provided a hands-on, immersive experience for 20 practitioners, kicked off the AAEP's summer slate of CE meetings. Days later, 294 veterinarians converged on Lexington, Ky., for the latest evidence-based diagnostics and treatments concerning oral pathologies and gut health at the jointly held Focus on Colic and Focus on Dentistry meetings. Meanwhile, 33 students joined their DVM colleagues in Lexington for Focus on Students, which offered interactive labs and networking opportunities. Immediately following the Focus meetings, the triennial International Equine Colic Research Symposium, hosted this year by the AAEP Foundation, brought together 119 researchers, practitioners, residents and graduate students to exchange new information and stimulate new collaborations and research projects on the subject. Details about next summer's 360\u00b0 and Focus meetings will be available later this year at aaep.org/meetings.

Touch Point: Don't overlook young horse owners for practice growth Young horse owners (18-40 years) may present an overlooked opportunity for veterinarians seeking to grow their practices, according to AAEP market research. Not only do these young owners provide the most long-term opportunity for business, but their above-average involve-ment in the horse industry adds to their prospective customer value. Compared with older horse owners, those aged 18-40 are more involved in the horse industry and their horses see an equine veterinarian more frequently. These owners also put as much as or more emphasis on relationship-oriented attributes as they do on their veterinarian's knowledge and experience. Demonstrating compassion, taking time with the horse, explaining diagnoses and having a pleasant demeanor are characteristics that the younger owner places a higher importance on than older owners. With lower incomes than older owners, the 18-40 segment is the most cost-sensitive but also the most likely to increase their already frequent usage of veterinarians. Young owners are the most likely to expect to increase their usage of veterinarian services over the next few years (8% vs. 5% for those aged 41+), pointing to stricter regulations at horse shows and plans to do more preventive care and breeding in the future.

A population of 204 atrial brillation cases were compared to unaffected controls selected randomly from a group ofracing peers competing within the 6 months prior to the casebeing admitted, giving a population of 1221 horses forheritability analysis. overall heritability for atrial brillation was 0.30 ( /C60.04) on the underlying scale and 0.14 on the observed scale. Similar values were obtained when malehorses were assessed. Lower values of 0.24 ( /C60.09) on the underlying scale and 0.09 on the observed scale were found inthe female population. The overall heritability in pacers was0.32 (/C60.05) on the underlying scale and 0.15 on the observed scale. Within the pacer group, the heritability values in maleswere again higher than in females. The low numbers of trottersin the study precluded estimates being given for this group. A small number of sires were found to have contributed signi cantly to disease incidence over time. Five stallions in particular had six or more offspring in the affected populationand were themselves relatively closely related. Atrialbrillation is moderately heritable in Standardbreds, with greater heritability in males and pacing horses. Toxoplasmosis In this case -control study, K. James and colleagues in the USA evaluated possible associations between Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence and clinical signs of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) in horses. Toxoplasmosis is not commonly considered a clinical disease of equines, although previous seroprevalence studieshave reported differing background rates of T. gondii infection in horses globally. In this study, 720 Californian horses withneurological signs compatible with EPM were compared tohealthy, non-neurologic horses for the presence of T. gondii antibodies (using indirect fluorescent antibody tests). T. gondii seroprevalence among cases and controls was determined at standard serum cut-offs: 40, 80, 160, 320 and 640. At a T. gondii titre cut-off of 320, horses with clinical signs compatible with EPM had 3.55 times the odds of a seropositive test compared to those without clinical signs when adjusted for covariates. When restricted to the autumn season and at the same titre cut-off, an EPM suspect horse had 6.4 times the odds of testing seropositive to T. gondii , compared to non-neurologic horses. The associationbetween high T. gondii titres and clinical signs compatible with EPM is potentially re flective of toxoplasmosis in equines. The authors suggest that serological testing of cerebrospinalfluid and isolation of T. gondii in EPM suspect cases should be considered and that future studies investigating therelationship between T. gondii and EPM are warranted. Detection of pneumothorax In this prospective, experimental study Jessica Partlow andcolleagues compared the results of thoracic ultrasonographyand radiography for the detection of induced small volumepneumothorax.Small volume pneumothorax can be challenging to diagnose in horses. Standing thoracic radiography is currently the standard method for diagnosis. The authors hypothesised that thoracic ultrasonography would be more sensitive and aimed to describe a thoracic ultrasound method for detection of small volume pneumothorax in horses, comparing results of radiography and ultrasound in a sample of horses with induced small volume pneumothorax. Six mature healthy horses were recruited. Five 50 mL air boluses were sequentially introduced via a teat cannula into the pleural space of each horse. Lateral thoracic radiographs and standardised ultrasound (2D and M-mode) examinations of both hemithoraces were performed following administration of each 50 mL air bolus. Four independent investigators who were unaware of treatment status analysed radiographs and ultrasound images/videos for detection of pneumothorax. Sensitivity, speci city, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and agreement among investigators (Kappa test, j) were calculated for radiography, 2D and M-mode ultrasound. Comparisons were made using a chi-squared exact test with signi cance set at P <0.05. Two- dimensional (84%) and M-mode (80%) ultrasound were more sensitive than radiography for pneumothorax detection (P=0.02 and P =0.04, respectively). Speci city and positive predictive values were similar for all three imaging modalities (P=1). Agreement between investigators for pneumothorax detection was excellent for 2D ultrasound ( j=1), very good for M-mode ultrasound ( j=0.87), and good for radiography (j=0.79). Findings from this study supported the use of thoracic ultrasonography as a diagnostic method for detecting pneumothorax in horses. Septic arthritis of the coxofemoral joint In this retrospective clinical study Francina Barcel /C19o Oliver and colleagues in the UK and Australia described the clinical signs, surgical treatment and outcome of septic arthritis of the coxofemoral joint in 12 foals. Lameness was localised to the coxofemoral joint based on physical examination. Sepsis was con rmed by cytological analysis of synovial fluid obtained under ultrasonographic guidance, during general anaesthesia or standing sedation. Intra-articular analgesia was used as an additional diagnostic modality in two foals. Surgical lavage of the affected joint was performed via arthroscopy or needle lavage. Seven foals underwent repeated lavage. Synovial fluid contained 4.4 to 173 9109/L white blood cells (WBCs), and 38 -63 g/L total protein. Cultures were positive in 10/12 spp. Ten foals were discharged from hospital (83%): one was subjected to euthanasia 15 days later due to chronic intestinal salmonellosis and renal failure, and nine foals survived with no residual lameness detected 1 year after hospital discharge. The authors concluded that a combination of arthroscopic lavage and the use of systemic and local antimicrobials is an effective treatment for sepsis of the coxofermoral joint. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd470 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION SEPTEMBER 2017Injectable omeprazole for horses This two-part study by Ben Sykes and colleagues in Australiainvestigated the pharmacodynamics of long-actinginjectable omeprazole (LA-OMEP) and its ef cacy in a pilot clinical trial. Six Thoroughbred horses on a hay-only diet were tted with percutaneous gastrotomy tubes for continuous measurementof intragastric pH via an indwelling pH probe. A single 2 gintramuscular dose of LA-OMEP was administered on Day 1.Measurement of pH at two different locations within thestomach was recorded over 23 h each day for 8 days. Goodrates of ulcer healing are anticipated when intragastric pH isgreater than 4 for at least 66% of the time. The intragastric pHwas above 4 for 66% of the time in all horses for the rst 4 days and in the majority of horses (4/6) for 7 days, comparingfavourably to oral omeprazole under similar conditions. For the pilot clinical trial, 26 horses with squamous or glandular ulceration on gastroscopic examination received a2 g dose of LA-OMEP on Day 0 and Day 7. Repeatgastroscopy was performed 2 weeks later. Lesion healing(grade 0) was observed in all 22 cases of squamousulceration and 75% of the nine horses with glandularulceration. Improvement in lesion severity by at least onegrade was observed in all horses in the study. One horsedeveloped a swelling at the site of injection that resolvedwithout treatment. No other adverse effects were observed. Intramuscular omeprazole results in good acid suppression over a 7-day period and high rates of treatment success inclinical cases, without signi cant adverse effects and avoiding any issues of bioavailability associated with the oralform of omeprazole. Antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics In this study D. Adler and colleagues in Denmark investigatedthe antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine, lidocaine andmepivacaine against anaesthetic injections are performed by equine practitioners as part of lameness investigations.Through this process, bacteria can enter the tissuesperforated by the needle and may cause local infections atthe injection site. This in vitro study investigated whether localanaesthetics at concentrations available in commerciallyavailable solutions could inhibit growth and/or kill bacteriathat could be inoculated into the synovial space or softtissues during injection. The activity of localanaesthetics bupivacaine, lidocaine and mepivacaine bactericidal concentrations (MICs and MBCs) were determined by the broth microdilution method. Clinically applied concentrations of bupivacaine, lidocaine, and mepivacaine inhibited visual growth of 93, 93 and 80% of isolates tested, respectively. For the majority (80%) of the inhibited isolates, the concentrations were also bactericidal. The tested local anaesthetics possessed antimicrobial activity against equine pathogens at concentrations that are routinely applied in clinical cases; however, this antimicrobial activity should not discourage antiseptic preparation prior to local anaesthetic injections.Effects of long distance transportation This study by Barbara Padalino and colleagues in Australiaand Italy evaluated the immunological, clinical,haematological and oxidative responses to long distancetransportation in horses. Horses are transported frequently, often over long distances. Transportation may represent a physiological stressor withconsequential health and welfare implications. This study reportsthe effects of a long distance journey on immunological, clinical,haematological, in flammatory and oxidative parameters in an Experimental Group (EG) of ten horses, comparing them with six horses of similar age and breed used as a nontransported Control Group (CG). Clinical examination and blood sampling were performed twice on all horses: immediately after unloading for the EG, and at rest on the same day for the CG (Day 1); at rest on the same day one week later for both groups (Day 7). On Day 1 EG horses showed increased heart and respiratory rates, rectal temperature, capillary re lling time, neutrophil numbers, serum albumin, plasma total antioxidant status, and a lower rate of mitogen induced proliferation of lymphocytes, in comparison with CG. On Day 7 only an increase in total serum protein and serum globulins was seen in the EG. No difference in serum cortisol concentration was found. Long distance transportation induced an acute phase response impairing the cell-mediated immune response. Clinical examinations, including assessing CRT and body weight loss, and the monitoring of redox balance may be useful in evaluating the impact of extensive transport events on horses. A better understanding of the link between transportation stress, the immune system and the acute phase response is likely to inform strategies for enhancing the welfare of transported horses. S.

Ruzickova*, P. Trencart and Summary In this article, 3 cases of an infrequent complication of lowerlimb trauma that presented as a cellulitis and deterioratingcomfort a few days after lower limb laceration are described.All 3 horses sloughed the hoof capsule 10 days after initialtrauma to that particular limb. Development of subsequentcellulitis/lymphangitis contributed to deterioration of distallimb perfusion. The exact pathophysiological mechanismsremain unknown but clinicians should be aware of thisunusual but major complication following limb trauma. Introduction The equine hoof capsule, encompassing the wall, sole, heelsand frog, is an epidermal tissue attached to the distalphalanx by a highly organised intermeshed network ofprimary and secondary lamellae. The lamellar blood supplyarises from the lateral and medial digital arteries (K \u20aconig and Liebich 2014) and they also furnish branches to the hoofcartilages, coronary band, digital cushion and end in theterminal arch and solar surface vessels. Partial traumatic avulsions of the hoof wall are common and if synovial structures are not involved usually have agood prognosis for regrowth of a functional hoof (Janiceket al. 2005). Complete loss of the hoof capsule due to trauma, on the other hand, has a poor prognosis for return tonormal function. There are few case reports of completetraumatic hoof capsule loss in the veterinary literature in thelast 50 years and all involve single cases (Jackson 1969;Stanek and Brkic 1981; de Gresti et al. 2008). Although prolonged inadequate perfusion of the distal limb has brie fly been mentioned as a cause of hoof capsule slough (Floyd and Mansmann 2007), we were unable to nd any detailed descriptions addressing this condition in the English veterinary literature. The case series reported herein is novel as it provides the rst detailed clinical description of 3 horses that sloughed the hoof capsule subsequent to trauma of that particular limb. Case selection Medical records of all horses examined at our institutionbetween 2000 and 2013 were searched. Horses thatsuffered from spontaneous hoof capsule loss following anipsilateral distal limb laceration were included in the study.Horses with laminitis or traumatic avulsion of the hoofcapsule were excluded. A total of 3 horses met theinclusion criteria.Case 1 A 2-year-old Friesian lly was referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at the University of Montreal having falleninto a deep ditch where she remained trapped, despitestruggling to free herself, until rescued. The owner andreferring veterinarian did not observe any haemorrhageindicative of vessel trauma. On presentation, a 3/5 lameness(AAEP lameness scale [Anon 1991]) was present in the lefthindlimb. Skin lacerations and exposed bone were present atthe dorsomedial aspect of the metatarsus and lateral aspectof of the left hindlimb ( Fig 1a ). Clinical examination of the wound by digital palpation while wearingsterile gloves and gentle probing with a sterile long thinmetal probe revealed a communication with themetatarsophalangeal joint .A simple fracture of the distal MtII was diagnosed on radiographic examination. Arthrocentesisof the metatarsophalangeal joint was performed. Thesynovial fluid total protein was 46 910 9/l coli was synovial fluid and was sensitive to enro floxacin, chloramphenicol and The wounds wounds anaesthesia. Amikacin (Amyglide-V)1(500 mg) was injected intra-articularly at the end of the surgical procedure. The mare developed an expanding cellulitis in the left hindlimb on Day 6 post-operatively. Broad spectrum intravenous [Penicillin bwt i.v. q. 24 h) were administered for the rst 12 days but therapy was changed to oral enro floxacin4(7.5 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h) based on sensitivity testing. Enro floxacin4 was administered for 6 days. Regional limb perfusions(1 g amikacin) 1were also performed in the saphenous vein on Days 3, 5, 7 and 9 post-operatively .No problems were identi ed in the perfused vein apart from minor swelling. Phenylbutazone5(2.2 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h) was administered during the entire hospitalisation period(23 days). Throughout hospitalisation the mare exhibited only minor discomfort on the affected limb. Unexpectedly, on the 10th day after admission, the hoof capsule sloughed. Necrotic dermal lamellae and the ). Standing surgical debridement of the necrotic lamellar tissue and daily bandage changes were performed. The mare developed an episode of mild colic that resolved with medical therapy (water and mineral oil administered by \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd472 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER On Day 21 there was complete lackof dermal lamellae at the Follow-up radiographic aspect of MtIII ofthe left hindlimb on Day 22. On the 23rd day the lly was subjected to euthanasia on humane grounds because ofdevelopment of contralateral limb laminitis and deteriorationof comfort. Case 2 A 4-year-old Quarter Horse gelding suffered from atraumatic laceration to the plantaromedial aspect of thepastern of the right hindlimb 10 days prior to presentation.The horse was treated conservatively at the farm with NSAIDs(phenylbutazone 52.2 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h) for an unspeci period of time, antimicrobials (Trimethoprim sulfadiazine [Uniprim]630 mg/kg bwt per os q. and topical antimicrobial cream (nitrofurazone) and with dailyhydrotherapy since the initial injury.On Day 9, after the injury, the owner noticed a discharge from the coronary band and progressive deterioration of the lameness. On admission, the horse sloughed its hoof capsule (Figs 2a,b ). Necrosis of the lamellae at heels, frog and toe was present. The tip of the distal phalanx was completely exposed ( Fig 2a ). An ultrasonographic examination of the distal limb revealed a synovitis of the digital flexor tendon sheath and a laceration of the ligament. Synoviocentesis of the digital flexor tendon sheath and analysis of the synovial fluid revealed a total protein of the medial and lateral plantar digital vein) was performed and demonstrated a lack of perfusion at the distomedial portionof the distal phalanx and acepromazine (Atravet)8(0.01 mg/kg bwt i.m. q. 8 h) a) b) c) d) Fig 1: a) Wound at the dorsomedial aspect of the left hind metatarsus in Case 1 on admission. b) and c) Hoof slough at Day 10 after initial injury.

Footbaths to aid debridement of necrotictissue and a change of support bandage were performeddaily. The foot was placed in a container lled with a warm solution of 0.025% sodium hypochlorite for periods of 20 min.On Day 9 post hoof capsule loss a sequestrum (3 93 cm) was removed from the dorso-distal solar margin of the distalphalanx ( Fig 2d ). An acceleration of growth of granulation tissue was observed thereafter. A total of 17 days after the hoof capsule loss, the distal phalanx was covered by a healthy bed of granulation tissue. The contralateral limb was cooled by application of crushed ice in an attempt to prevent support limb laminitis during this period. The owner requested euthanasia on Day 26 because of nancial constraints and a poor prognosis for a sporting career. Case 3 A 12-year-old Quarter Horse mare was referred because of asuspicion of septic arthritis. The mare had been found 10 dayspreviously in a paddock with multiple trauma to the lower righthindlimb. At the farm, the wound was managed by clippingthe hair, cleaning and a sterile intra-articular injection of salineinto the proximal interphalangeal joint to verify communication with the joint. Amikacin (Amyglide-V) 1(500 mg) was injected into the proximal interphalangeal joint on the day of injury. A second intra-articular injection was performed later, but the exact time was not noted in the record. Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (phenylbutazone52.2 mg/kg i.m. q. 12 h) were administered for an unspeci ed period. Clinical examination on admission to our hospital revealed a stula at the dorsolateral aspect of the coronary band with a malodorous, foamy, haemorrhagic fluid emanating from it and a cold hoof capsule. The horse did not exhibit signs of pain on application of hoof testers. The mare was 4/5 lame at a walk (AAEP lameness grade [Anon 1991]). Radiography revealed a radiolucent line between the hoof capsule and distal phalanx and sinking and rotation of the distal phalanx on both lateromedial and dorsoproximal- plantarodistal 60 \u00b0oblique projections.

The hoofcapsule sloughed spontaneously during euthanasia. Discussion Novel information is provided on equine hoof capsule lossfollowing distal limb lacerations. This unusual but majorcomplication resulted in hoof slough 10 days after the originaltrauma in all 3 cases. Lacerations of the distal limb are very common in horses and are frequently accompanied by partial or totalseverance of arteries or veins. It is known that collateralvessels develop following injury in the majority of cases and isreported to occur at 2 -4 weeks (Keen et al. 2008). In the 3 cases reported herein, there was no history of blood loss,which may indicate that it occurred prior to the horse beingobserved for the rst time or that no vessel rupture occurred. Alternatively, it is possible that the traumatic event causedunidenti ed vascular injury and thrombosis, without vessel severance, leading to ischaemia in the distal limb. Other factors, in addition to a vascular ischaemia, may have contributed to the hoof capsule loss. Two of the horseshad a very substantial cellulitis on presentation and the thirdhorse (Case 1) progressively developed cellulitis, despiteadministration of antibiotics. The associated in flammation and oedema in the distal limb could lead to a progressive hoofcompartment syndrome and ischaemia of the dermallamellae in already vascularly compromised tissueprecipitating cell necrosis and hoof slough. The extensive cellulitis in the pastern region in the cases herein precluded an accurate coronary band assessment i.e.concavity that occurs at this site when the third phalanx'sinks '(Cripps and Eustace 1999). We speculate that there could be similarities in the pathophysiology of the hoof capsule slough and prodromal phase of laminitis (Baxter and Morrison 2008; Percival et al.2011). In early laminitis ischaemia leads to swelling of the endothelial cells, haemoconcentration, capillary congestion and obstruction of small vessels with leucocytes. There is a build-up of extravascular pressure aggravating the compartment pressure (Adam and Southwood 2007). Widespread distal limb thrombosis and associated laminitis have been reported as a complication of lower limb cellulitis in a horse with photosensitivity and bacterial infection (Hanson 2008). However, lymphangitis/cellulitis also frequently occurs in equine lower limbs without hoof capsule loss (Fjordbakk et al. 2008), suggesting that other factors such as reactive vasoconstriction or hypercoaguability, in addition to inflammation and infection, may probably be required to induce spontaneous hoof capsule loss. Septicaemia and a hypercoagulable condition have already been reported to cause acute thrombosis of distal limb arteries and hoof slough in young foals (Brianceau and Divers 2001). One horse in the current series was evaluated for vascular compromise by digital vein venography (Redden 2001a,b). Digital arteriography has also been described in horses but requires general anaesthesia (Rosenstein et al. 2000; Walker et al. 2017). In man, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is the diagnostic entity of choice for identi cation of a reduction of blood flow to the distal limb after a traumatic event, e.g. gun shot (Gakhal and Sartip 2009). Scintigraphy also allows quanti cation of vascular flow but does not permit visualisation of single vessels and would not be a practical clinical approach for assessment of limb lacerations (Bell et al. 1995). In human patients with diabetic foot ulcers, distal ankle and toe pressure as well as colour duplex ultrasonography are valuable tools to determine the degree of ischaemia (Falanga 2005). In horses, Doppler ultrasonography also permits the detection of altered digital blood flow (Aguirre et al. 2013). As acepromazine improves digital perfusion and lamellar blood flow (Baxter and Morrison 2008), its administration early after equine limb trauma could be considered for thispurpose. In cases of post-traumatic thrombosis in man,heparin or dalteparin in combination with aspirin is employedto minimise further thrombus propagation (Percival et al. 2011). Horses were treated orally with enro floxacin 4as oral administration of a broad spectrum antimicrobial with activity against Gram-negative bacteria was desired. One 2-year-old horse had bilateral thrombophlebitis of the jugular veins precluding i.v. antimicrobial therapy and synovial culture revealed presence of E. coli sensitive to enro floxacin4. Risk of cartilage toxicity has been previously reported for enro floxacin4(Bertone et al. 2000) but was judged to be minimal in a horse of 2 years old. Measurement of perilesional transcutaneous oxygen tension has been reported to be important for prognosis in human patients with diabetic ulcers (Fife et al. 2002) and could be considered for evaluation of future cases of equine limb ischaemia. In patients where infection is accompanied by ischaemia and atherosclerosis, vessels may be treated by vascular bypass or angioplasty (Lipsky et al. 2012) but this has not been attempted in equine patients. Euthanasia was elected in all the cases herein. However, it is possible to treat cases of hoof slough, but the nal outcome, following prolonged costly treatment and time investment, is a deformed hoof (de Gresti et al. 2008). The horn of the wall grows from the stratum germinativum of the coronary corium at an average rate of 6 -10 mm per month Fig 3: Lateromedial stulograph with contrast medium which demonstrates complete detachment of the hoof capsule from thedistal phalanx. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd475 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017(Reilly et al. 1998). Complete regrowth of the new horn capsule may take up to 9 months (Jackson 1969; Stanek andBrkic 1981; de Gresti et al. 2008). Daily bandage changes have been recommended (Fessler 1989) following hoof capsule slough. Foot castsprotect the distal phalanx and are more economical as theyreduce the number of bandage changes (Janicek et al. 2005). Amputation of the distal limb could be considered asa salvage procedure for selected candidates: horses havesuccessfully undergone amputation following severe traumato the distal limb with mean survival times reported from 24 to41 months (Crawley et al. 1989; Kelmer et al. 2004; Vlahos and Redden 2005). One limitation of the study herein is the small number of horses and retrospective collection of data. A prospective study of distal limb lacerations could shed additional light on the early events contributing to the catastrophic spontaneous hoof loss. Management of horses with limb trauma should include assessment of lower limb perfusion by palpation to detect temperature changes in the lower limb and hoof, regular evaluation of the coronary band conformation, radiographic assessment of the limb and aggressive treatment of cellulitis (broad spectrum antibiotics, anti-in flammatory agents). In conclusion, this case series describes a previously unreported catastrophic complication of spontaneous hoof capsule loss following equine distal limb lacerations. An awareness of this rare complication will help veterinariansidentify and perhaps potentially prevent these events in the future.

J. Ahern and A. W. van Eps* School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, Queensland, Australia. *Corresponding author email: a.vaneps@uq.edu.au This edition of EVE contains a case series of three horses with spontaneous hoof capsule loss (Ruzickova et al. 2017). These horses had a history of traumatic injury to the distal aspect ofa hindlimb with subsequent hoof capsule loss occurring10 days after the initial injury. As the authors of this case seriesstate, this condition is poorly described and not wellunderstood in horses; however, there are many similarities inthese three cases to acute limb ischaemia (ALI), which is wellreported in man (Braun and Lin 2015; Lurie et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016). In man, ALI is most commonly caused by primary thrombosis (often iatrogenic) or trauma (mostly fractures,dislocations or blunt injuries due to road traf c accidents). Fractures or dislocations can cause secondary arterialthrombosis: stretch of the artery can cause an intimal tearwhile the tunica media and tunica adventitia layers remain intact because they contain elastin and can stretch. As a result, the underlying thrombogenic collagen is exposed and a thrombus forms at the site. When this affects both the medial and lateral vascular supply to the distal limb of a horse, such as can occur during traumatic disruption of the suspensory apparatus (TDSA) or severe laceration with or without infection (as reported in this case series), then a situation of ALI can occur. In man, the most sensitive tissues to ischaemia (in descending order) are nerves, muscle, skin and bone, hence the early clinical signs in human patients are pain and/or numbness of the affected extremity. Besides pain, which is often already present, the rst clinical manifestation of distal limb ischaemia in the horse may be lamellar separation and sloughing of the hoof (as seen in the case series), with the clinical effects of nerve, skin and bone ischaemia likely to appear more slowly and be initially less apparent. Ischaemia is recognised as a cause of sloughing of the nails of the ngers or toes in man (onycholysis) (Cabanillas et al. 2011); however, the phenomenon receives little attention in the literature, probably due to its relative lack of clinical importance. In the horse digit, the distal phalanx is suspended within the hoof capsule by the lamellae: it is this specialised epidermal tissue that must be damaged both globally and severely enough in order for the hoof to detach circumferentially and slough. The epidermal and dermallamellae fold and interdigitate to form a large surface area of attachment in each foot that results in a normally very strong bond between hoof and bone, able to withstand the incredible forces associated with locomotion at the gallop. Aside from hoof growth, which occurs almost exclusively at the coronary band and sole dermis, the function of the extensive digital blood supply is to provide nutrients for the cells of the lamellar epidermis whose primary responsibility is to maintain this attachment. The epidermal basal cells (EBCs), located at the junction between lamellar epidermis and dermis, are at the coal face of the attachment and arehighly metabolically active. These EBCs, however, do not have a direct blood supply and rely on diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from the lamellar dermis and because there is no means for storage of glycogen locally the EBCs rely on a constant glucose supply via incoming blood: in fact the relative extraction of glucose from the arterial blood of the digit exceeds that of the head in the horse (Pollitt 2016). In order to maintain constant nutrient supply to the lamellarepidermis, components of the vasculature must also overcome potential mechanical compression associated with their course between rigid hoof wall and bone, and between lamellar and sublamellar structures that come under tension during load. Despite this, the very fact that ischaemic sloughing of the hoof is an uncommon occurrence highlights that the lamellar vascular supply is protected and well regulated. The terminal arch of the medial and lateral digital arteries is housed within the bone of the distal phalanx and, like the circle of Willis at the base of the brain, it ensures redundancy in arterial supply to the lamellae if either the lateral or medial digital arterial supply to the foot is lost. This redundancy is supported by other anastomoses including the circum flex arteries proximal to and within the hoof capsule. Therefore, disruption proximal to or affecting both medial and lateral digital arteries is required to cause arterial ischaemia of the foot. The rich lamellar capillary network is drained via lamellar veins into an extensive sublamellar venous plexus, but with the distal limb devoid of muscle, the mechanical effect of cyclic loading of the foot is the only aid to venous return. It follows that venous return could become compromised in cases with severe distal limb swelling and also further compromised if there is limb pain suf cient to cause reduced cyclic loading of the limb: both features are reported in the case series in this issue. Similarly, there is evidence suggesting that reduced cyclic limb loading may lead to supporting limb laminitis by compromising lamellar perfusion (Medina-Torres et al. 2014). As the authors of this case series point out (Ruzickova et al. 2017), the severity of the swelling and in flammation, if extended distally into the hoof capsule, may have been suf cient to impair lamellar capillary perfusion (compartment syndrome), or other factors such as septic arterial thromboembolism could also havecontributed to ischaemia in the reported cases, besides purely traumatic vascular damage. In horses with circumferential distal limb wounds, vascular stretching (e.g. TDSA cases) or severe limb cellulitis (where there is a risk of compartment syndrome), consideration of vascular perfusion should be included early in clinical decision making. Because the early clinical signs of poor vascular perfusion evident in man (pain and numbness) are extremely dif cult to assess in horses, contrast arteriography using either radiography or computed tomography should be considered initially, although these procedures will often \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd478 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017require general anaesthesia to perform. Scintigraphicevaluation, which can be easily performed under sedationwithout general anaesthesia and readily evaluates vascularintegrity (vascular phase), can be very useful in these cases.The authors of this commentary have effectively and reliablyused this modality as a determinant of vascular integrity inclinical cases (see Fig 1 ). As the authors of the case series state, these diagnostics are not likely to be applicable in themajority of limb injury cases; however, in cases where there isa query over vascular integrity in the period between injuryand before hoof wall loss (approximately 10 days post injurybased on this case series) then scintigraphy can be a veryuseful modality that can greatly in fluence clinical decision making. Treatment of ALI in man is quite effective but when delayed longer than 6 -12 h can result in permanent disability, amputation and/or death. Treatments are generally aimed at restoring blood supply to the ischaemic segment using either surgical interventions (vascular grafts, thrombectomy) or (tissue plasminogen activator or anti-clot medications, such as Plavix). One author (B.A.) has successfully used tissue plasminogen activator to re-establish vessel patency in a unilaterally affected plantar metatarsal artery. The key factor with all treatment options is that they are most effective when applied early in the process of ALI; however, intervening during this timeframe is an extremely difcult, if not impossible, task in most cases of equine ALI and we are often left with treating substantially later or simply evaluating if there is any vascular perfusion left at all. In man, the diagnosis of ALI is based on paralysis (inability to wiggle ngers or toes) and anaesthesia (loss of light touch) but aside from these symptoms, signs of acute ischaemia are nonspeci c or are inconsistent. In horses, it is not possible to determine paralysis in distal limb injury due to the absence of muscle. Similarly, in horses with traumatic wounds, thedetermination of subtle regional anaesthesia to the degree that is possible in man is not realistic. As such, in cases of traumatic injury such as these three reported cases or cases of TDSA especially in racehorses (which are a similar type of hyperextension [quasi luxation] of the fetlock joint as occurs in human knee luxations) there is likely to be trauma to the vascular wall of the arterial supply to the distal limb. To cause ALI similar to that in man, all the vessels supplying the distal limb of the horse would appear to have to be affected as unilateral vascular transection that is relatively common does not result in spontaneous hoof wall loss. It is interesting to note that in this series of 3, 2 had trauma at the level of the pastern or 'lower limb 'and one was an almost circumferential injury of the distal metatarsus (Ruzickova et al. 2017). At these levels, the important vascular supply to the distal limb is relatively exposed to trauma and this may be an important factor for equine veterinarians to consider when evaluating lacerations of the distal limb in horses as a potential risk factor for spontaneous hoof wall loss. The cellulitis/lymphangitis that was seen in this case series may have simply represented a clinical progression/consequence of ALI in these cases, rather than a contributing factor to the hoof wall loss. This is supported by the numerous cases of severe cellulitis that occur in routine equine practice that do not result in hoof wall loss. This case series highlights the infrequent but major complication of spontaneous hoof wall loss that can occursecondarily to lower limb trauma in horses. Veterinarians should pay close attention to assessment of vascular integrity and consider early treatment if the timeframe of injury to presentation allows. Alternatively, in cases where assessment of vascular integrity is the objective (early treatment window passed) consider the use of scintigraphy/contrast arteriography to determine vessel patency to allow for accurate treatment decisions and case prognostication.

Case Report Anastomosis of the medial digital artery in a mare followingtraumatic laceration C. M. Isgren* and P. I. Milner Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital, School of Veterinary Science, University of Liverpool, Neston, UK; and Department of Musculoskeletal Biology, Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of blood loss froma laceration of the medial digital artery sustained in the eld. The mare was initially managed conservatively by pressure bandaging but the bleeding did not stop. After a bloodtransfusion the mare underwent arterial repair under general anaesthesia and was initially managed in a cast post operatively. Doppler ultrasonography 4 days post operatively conrmed effective blood flow distal to the arterial anastomosis and the mare was discharged from the hospital. At 6 months follow-up the owner reported that the mare was sound at the trot with an excellent cosmetic outcome of the surgical site. Case history A 7-year-old Warmblood showjumping mare (536 kg) waspresented to the Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital, Universityof Liverpool for assessment of acute blood loss associatedwith a full thickness laceration of the medial aspect of the lefthind metatarsophalangeal region. The mare had been foundcollapsed in a eld with marked blood loss evident. Prior to referral the mare had received resuscitation fluids including hypertonic saline 7.2% and crystalloid fluids and a pressure bandage placed over the site of the laceration. Clinical ndings Physical examination revealed the mare to be quiet but alertwith a heart rate of 60 beats/min, packed cell volume 24%and total protein 32 g/l. Evaluation of the wound followingremoval of the dressing revealed a continuous flow of arterial blood through the laceration. Procaine penicillin (Depocillin 300 and a dressing, consisting of a nonadhesive, absorbent primary layer (Allevyn 10 910 cm)3and 3 conforming layers (cotton wool roll,4Knitx1 094m5) was applied over the distal limb. At this point, the blood loss was controlled and the mare was admitted for overnight monitoring. The mare remained comfortable overnight with no signi cant further blood loss. However, on removal of the dressing, blood loss through the wound returned and surgical stabilisation of the damaged vessel was recommended. Anaesthesia was induced using ketamine hydrochloride (Narketan 10, 100 mg/ ml solution for injection)62.2 mare was intubated with an endotracheal tube (size 30 mm) and a suitable plane of anaesthesia maintained using iso flurane. A total of 2 l whole blood was administered during anaesthesia. An Esmarch bandage was placed in tourniquet fashion in the proximal metatarsal region of the left hindlimb. Following aseptic preparation of the distal limb, the 3 cm horizontal laceration over the medial aspect of the medial proximal sesamoid bone was converted into a Z-shaped incision to identify the proximal and distal margins of the lacerated medial digital artery. The free ends were dissected free from the surrounding loose connective tissue and the proximal portion of the artery tourniqueted using a Penrose drain. Stay sutures were placed at the dorsal and plantar margins of the proximal and distal portions of the lacerated vessels using 0.7 M (6-0 USP) polyglactin 910 and a 14 gauge catheter (Intra flon 2, 36 mm)11placed into the distal portion to maintain patency ( Fig 1a ) after removal of any visual thrombi. Following withdrawal of the catheter in the distal portion, sutures were placed through the wall of the tunica media and intima in a simple continuous pattern, interrupted at 180 \u00b0, starting with the axial (far) part of the vessel and continuing to close the abaxial (near) half (Fig 1b ). Patency of the veri ed through of 0.9% saline. The outermost layer, the tunica adventitia, was closed separately in a continuous pattern using 0.7 M polyglactin 910, similarly interrupted at 180\u00b0. Subcutaneous tissues were debrided and closed using 3 M polyglactin 910 in a simple continuous pattern followed by an intradermal layer using 3.5 M polyglycolic acid and skin using 4 M polypropylene. The mare was recovered from anaesthesia in a distal limb cast which was removed 48 h post operatively and replaced with a distal limb bandage. After a further 48 h, Doppler ultrasound examination of themedial digital artery was performed which con rmed effective flow through the vessel distal to the repair ( Fig 2 ). The horse remained on systemic antimicrobials until discharge from the clinic, 5 days after initial admission. Once discharged from the hospital the horse was managed with regular dressing changes until suture removal. There was mild discharge from the surgical site at the time of suture removal. At 6 months follow-up after surgery the mare has remained sound and the owner reports an excellent cosmetic result of the surgical site. Further ultrasonographic evaluation to \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd481 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / SEPTEMBER 2017reassess vascular flow at the anastomosis site was not possible in this case due to the noncompliance of the owner (marenow turned away in foal). Discussion Traumatic injuries to the horse are common, particularlyconcerning the distal limb (Owen et al. 2012). Lacerations involving neurovascular structures can result in signi cant loss of circulating volume and/or loss of function of the regions supplied by these structures (Stashak and Theoret 2013). In the distal limb, traumatic lacerations of neurovascular structures are often managed by local pressure bandaging, debridementand ligation. Vascular thrombosis and severe nerve damage following traumatic or iatrogenic injury can lead to subsequent tissue loss through ischaemic necrosis (Turner 1985). Vessel occlusion and ligation can be associated with haemodynamic disturbances, ranging from transient oedema to tissue ischaemia and necrosis (Nazzal et al. 1994). In the equine distal limb, arterial occlusion may result in catastrophic loss of the hoof and associated structures. Restoration of vascular supply would therefore negate this complication. Arterial supply to the equine foot has symmetrical medial and lateral branches of the digital arteries distal to the fetlock joint. At this distal location the fore- and hindlimb supply are identical (Dyce et al. 2002). The rst set of dorsal branches arise at the level of the rst phalanx with the palmar (or plantar) branches continuing distally. Branches to the digital cushion arise at the level of the proximal interphalangeal joint and pass axially to the hoof cartilages. A second set of dorsal branches arises at the level of the second phalanx which also helps supply the dermis of the hoof (Dyce et al. 2002). The terminal palmar (or plantar) branches anastomose to form a terminal arch within the third phalanx and it is this arch which provides collateral circulation within the hoof. It is unknown if the collateral circulation could sustain a complete arterial occlusion at a more proximal location, such as the level of the proximal sesamoid bones, as occurred in this case report. Repair of blood vessels should result in a return of function, as demonstrated in this case by Doppler ultrasound and removes the reliance on collateral circulation to compensate for loss of blood supply. Primary anastomosis of vascular structures, such as the medial digital artery, should therefore be considered a viable option in equine cases where laceration of a main vessel occurs. Trauma involvingvascular structures in the extremities is also a common injury in human emergency medicine where repair rather than ligation or compression is commonly the treatment of choice in the absence of a more urgent injury demanding a) b) Fig 1: Intraoperative images.

In man, arterial lacerations can be repaired successfully up to 36 h after injury(Gelberman et al. 1982) with those arising from blunt trauma ideally repaired in less than 12 h (Sturm et al. 1980). Arterial forearm injury in man treated by arterial repair has a patency of 85.7% at 6 months post operatively (Lee et al. 1985) with less wound complications reported when the artery is repaired rather than ligated (6 vs. 36%). During arterial anastomosis, it is recommended that the outermost layer of the artery, the tunica adventitia, is dissected away from the cut end of vessels to avoid inadvertent infolding of the adventitia into the lumen of the anastomosis (Philips and Aronson 2012). Inclusion of the adventitia would reduce luminal diameter and obstruct blood flow and possibly lead to thrombus formation (Sackman 2002). In the current case, the fragile tunica adventitia had already been separated from the innermost 2 layers, possibly due to the traumatic nature of the laceration and hence this layer was closed in a separate layer for added protection of the anastomosis. The risk of systemic anticoagulant medication must be carefully considered before administration and was not implemented in this horse due to the marked blood loss. The most commonly used anticoagulant medication used in human medicine is aspirin. Recommended doses of aspirin include 5 mg/kg bwt every 48 h to 100 mg/kg bwt every 24 h (Plumb 2005) since aspirin has been shown to have an antithrombotic effect in the horse at doses from 4 mg/kg bwt (Cambridgeet al. 1991). The prolonged effect of aspirin on platelet function has been documented despite a very short plasma half-life due to its irreversible action on platelet cyclooxygenase and is therefore recommended at 48 h interval administration (Cambridge et al. 1991). Other recommendations to prevent thrombus formation include intraluminal flushing of the 2% lidocaine, heparin or 0.9% saline (Philips and Aronson 2012). The latter intervention was used in the current case to prevent thrombus formation at the anastomosis site. Mono lament suture such as polypropylene is recommended for arterial suturing due to its greater strength, durability and decreased tissue reactivity. Despite this, a braided multi lament suture is often chosen over a mono lament suture because of its excellent knot holding and better handling properties (Rutherford 2005). Polyglactin 910, a multi lament suture, was used in the case described currently for these reasons listed above. Previous reports of successful experimental microvascular surgery in horses have been published (Turner 1985) and canine models of arteriovenous injury have been used to study haemodynamic perturbation following repair (Nazzal et al. 1994). To the authors 'knowledge there are no reports describing successful repair of a major digital vessel in aclinical case and little detail is available regarding arterialrepair technique in standard equine surgical textbooks. Thiscase report details the successful arterial anastomosis andreturn of haemodynamic function following completelaceration of the medial digital artery in a horse. The authorspropose that arterial repair, rather than ligation, should beconsidered whenever possible and particularly in traumaticlacerations with clean arterial margins thus suitable for repair.

Radiographicand ultrasonographic images were interpreted as being anatypically located lipoma. Its position and character havesome similarities to lipoma arborescens, which is reported tooccur in and around human joints and tendon sheaths.Surgical removal is considered to be the treatment of choice. Introduction Pedunculated mesenteric lipomas occur in the abdomen ofolder horses, and are usually only detected at post mortem examinations or when they cause a strangulating intestinalobstruction (Edwards and Proudman 1994; Freeman andSchaeffer 2001; Garcia-Seco et al. 2005). In 2002, Hammer et al. described a lipoma in a 2-year-old Quarter Horse that had arisen from the sheath of the common digital extensor tendon at the level of the carpus. The tumour was thought to be associated with a traumatic injury that the gelding sustained one year earlier. Histologically, the mass consisted of vascularised adipose tissue and collagen bundles but was otherwise unremarkable. While there have been sporadic reports of lipomas occurring externally in horses, they have not been typically associated with the synovial lining of tendon sheaths or joints (Blackwell 1972; Bristol and Fubini 1984; Baker and Kreeger al. 1993; Hamir et al. 1994; Carson Dunkerley et al. 1997). This report describes the putative, spontaneous occurrence of an intrathecal lipoma of the long digitalextensor tendon sheath in a Thoroughbred lly. Case history A 5-month-old female Thoroughbred was presented forassessment of a rm, soft tissue mass on the dorsal aspect of the right tarsus ( Fig 1 ). The lly was not lame and there did not appear to be any restriction of joint motion. The swellinghad been present for approximately 4 months and had slowlygrown in size to 7 910 cm. There was a granulating wound over the dorsal and medial aspect of the swelling which wasrelated to a previous biopsy attempt in the eld. The swelling had previously been injected with corticosteroids but remained unchanged. Fluid could not be aspirated from the swelling and there was no associated effusion of the tarsocrural joint.Imaging Radiographic examination of the right tarsus revealed alarge, approximately 9 cm long mass dorsal to the tarsocruraljoint and trochlear ridges of the talus ( Fig 2 ). The mass was of mixed fat and soft tissue opacity. The lesser opacity of the fatenabled visualisation of a thin dorsal soft tissue capsule andmultiple, irregular but subtle soft tissue opacities coursingthroughout the centre of the mass. A small (2 cm long) softtissue defect was seen at the distal dorsomedial margin ofthe mass, consistent with the location of the granulatingexternal wound from the previous biopsy. There was noradiographic evidence of tarsocrural effusion and the massdid not communicate with the joint on a positive contrastarthrogram study. Linear soft tissue opacities consistent withat least one of the extensor tendons could be seen passingdistally into the central region of the mass. The adjacentosseous structures were unremarkable. The mass was ultrasonographically heterogeneous and had a thin, well-de ned hyperechoic capsular margin dorsally ( Fig 3 ). The deeper margins of the mass were less distinct. The adjacent long and lateral digital extensor tendons were unremarkable despite their close proximity tothe mass. There was at least one small pocket of echogenic fluid within the mass. Differential diagnoses at this stage included an atypically located lipoma, granuloma or organising haematoma. The former was thought to be most likely given the mixed fat/soft tissue opacity on the radiographic study. Surgical ndings With the horse anaesthetised and positioned in dorsalrecumbency and with the affected limb suspended inextension, a 15 cm curvilinear skin incision was made overthe dorsal aspect of the swelling. An encapsulated mass(Fig 4 ) was exposed using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection. The tumour was intimately associated with thesynovial lining of the sheath of the long digital extensortendon and this made it dif cult to de ne the anatomic limits of the tendon sheath accurately. An incision into the tumour revealed a white fat-like tissue mass that seemed to have its origins within the tendon sheath ( Figs 5 and 6). The tumour was isolated using blunt dissection and careful efforts were made to ensure as much abnormal tissue as possible was removed. A defect that was created in the tendon sheath was repaired using USP 2/0 poly-p-diaxanone (MonoPlus) 1 placed in a horizontal mattress pattern. The subcutaneoustissues were apposed and dead space eliminated by placing \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd484 2/0 poly-p-diaxanone (MonoPlus)1in a simple continuous pattern. The skin incision was closed with USP 2/0 nylon (Dalon)1placed in a vertical mattress pattern and was supported with a stent dressing.

Histopathology The submitted tissue samples were grossly white to yellow incolour, were of fatty consistency and surrounded by a thickbrous capsule. Microscopic examination of haematoxylin and eosin stained sections showed a tumour composed ofmature adipocytes and in ltrated by numerous, mostly ne brous bands ( Fig 7 ). There were a few small intratumoral lymphocytic and plasmacytic aggregates. The overallappearance was consistent with a diagnosis of lipoma. Discussion In a 1975 abattoir survey of tumours in horses, it was reportedthat 11% (143) of 1308 horses had tumours of various types,and 20 of these were abdominal or mesenteric lipomas(Cotchin and Baker-Smith 1975). While this apparent over-representation of abdominal lipomas would not be a surpriseto most equine surgeons, it is indicative of the fact that mostlipomas in horses occur in older animals that are more likely tobe found in an abattoir survey. It is noteworthy that the tumourin this lly occurred at a very young age, and that this could lead to speculation that it originated from embryonic fat tissuesuch as a lipoblastoma, which subsequently differentiated intoa growth that more closely resembled a lipoma. A moreaccurate diagnosis can be made by looking forrearrangements in chromosome 8q13, which are said to occurin 90% lipoblastomas, using in cells or S100protein in adipocytes (Cof n and Alaggio 2012). In our case, immunohistochemical analysis revealed (1:300 dilution) or S100 protein (1:5000 dilution). Other reports in the veterinary literature have documented lipomas in horses of various ages and in lesscommon locations including the pericardium (Baker andKreeger 1987; Hamir et al. 1994), the and and intramuscular the nuchal ligament (Carson Dunkerley et al. 1997). However, to the authors 'knowledge, there has only been one other report of a lipoma in a horse arising from a tendon sheath (Hammer et al. 2002). In that report, ultrasonography was used to delineate the mass and ascertain its relationship to surrounding structures, but the authors did not consider the appearance as typical of a lipoma. In our case, the radiographic and ultrasonographic appearance were thought to be suggestive of a lipoma. In man, lipoma arborescens (LA) is described as a rare, benign lesion consisting of a subsynovial villous proliferation of mature fat cells, most commonly reported to occur in and around joints, and there are also sporadic reports of LA occurring in tendon sheaths (Senocak et al. 2007; Babar et al. 2008; Kamaci et al. 2014). Primary LA is thought to be idiopathic and to occur in younger patients, while a secondary type is more likely to be associated with an underlying chronic irritation or in flammatory process (Sanamandra and Ong 2014). In man, the typical ultrasonographic appearance is one of multiple nger-like globular and villous hyperechoic fronds that extend from the base of the mass -hence the term arborescens or tree-like appearance (Learch and Braaton 2000) -and in radiographs there is usually a characteristic lucency typical of internal fat content (Babar et al. 2008). These were not features seen in the current case where the tumour appeared as a solitary, encapsulated mass that originated from the lining of the extensor sheath over the tarsus. There is a feeling amongst veterinary pathologists that the well-differentiated cellular component of lipomas in animals often makes it dif cult to call them true neoplasms, and the term nodular hyperplasia or adipose tissue consistent with lipoma might be more appropriate (Robbins 1974; Stannard and Pulley 1978). Similarly in man, there is some conjecture about the exact nature of the tissue and the term nonspeci c synovial fatty proliferation has been used (Sanamandra and Ong 2014). As in man, surgical removal by way of careful synovectomy is the current treatment of choice. Authors 'declaration of interest No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Santinelli*, F. Beccati, F. Passamonti septic tenosynovitis; fever Summary This case report describes the history, clinical and diagnosticndings, treatment and outcome of a 3-year-old Thoroughbred gelding. The horse was examined for chronic weight loss,intermittent fever of 4 months 'duration and acute lameness of 2 weeks 'duration, and was nally diagnosed with septic tendonitis of the deep digital flexor tendon and ssp. zooepidemicus . Investigation of the lower respiratory also allowed isolation of S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus . Although surgical treatment was recommended, because of the severity of the lesion and the guarded prognosis for a return to full athletic function, the owner declined surgery. The horse was therefore treated aggressively with antimicrobials using systemic, local and regional approaches, and with anti- inflammatory drugs. At 20 months after discharge, the horse was able to race, and he is now in full work with 20 races nished successfully. Introduction Deep digital flexor tendonitis in horses is generally related to excessive strain on the tendon, which can induceinflammation or structural damage (Goodrich 2011). Injuries occur most commonly in the fetlock or pastern regions, withinthe digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) or within the hoof capsule. Injuries in the metacarpal or metatarsal regions andin the carpus or tarsus are less common (Dyson 2010). Septictendonitis is extremely rare, in contrast with septictenosynovitis, which is frequently described in the literature(Honnas et al. 1991; Schneider et al. 1992; Wereszka et al. 2007; Caron 2011). To the authors 'knowledge, only one report describes a case of synovial sepsis and suspected tendon infectionsecondary to peritonitis (Archer et al. 2004) and few cases of primary septic tendonitis were reported by Kidd et al. (2002). The current case report describes the clinical and diagnostic investigation and the long-term follow-up of ahorse referred for chronic weight loss and intermittent fever.The horse was diagnosed with septic tendonitis of the deepdigital flexor tendon (DDFT) gelding was presented forintermittent fever (up to 40 \u00b0C), chronic weight loss of 4 months ' duration and left hindlimb swelling associated with acutelameness of 2 weeks 'duration. The horse had been treated with cefquinome, gentamicin, phenylbutazone and imidocarb diproprionate by the referring veterinary surgeon for intermittent periods because of suspected bronchopneumonia. The treatment had resulted in intermittent periods of remission of the fever. Clinical ndings Upon presentation, the horse was bright and alert with a poorbody condition (BCS 2/5) (Wright et al. 1998), heart and respiratory rates of 40 beats/min and 12 breaths/minrespectively, and rectal temperature of 37.8 \u00b0C. The horse showed mild kyphosis and severe atrophy of the muscles ofthe neck, the back and the left side of the croup; he had atendency to maintain the left hindlimb protracted to avoidweightbearing. The distal part of the left hindlimb showeddiffuse swelling with severe distension of the DFTS and someexcoriations on the plantar aspect at the level of the pasternand fetlock; there were many rings in the proximal part of thehoof beginning at the level of the coronary band ( Fig 1 ). The diffusely swollen area of the left hindlimb, primarily at the level of the fetlock, was hot and painful on palpation. The horse showed severe lameness of the left hindlimb at walk in a straight line (American Association of Equine Practitioners grade 4/5 ) with marked reduction of the caudal phase of the stride. Fig 1: Diffusely swollen area of the left hindlimb at the level of the fetlock: note the distension of the digital flexor tendon sheath with scratches on the plantar aspect of the region. Many rings arevisible on the dorsal part of the hoof wall (arrows). \u00a92015 EVJ VETERINARY EDUCATION oblique views) of the metatarsophalangeal joint was carried out, including the distal metatarsus and pastern of the left hindlimb (Butler et al. 2008; Weaver and Barakzai 2010). Radiography showed soft tissue swelling and increased radiopacity of the soft tissue in the fetlock region; no other abnormalities were detected. Ultrasound examination An ultrasonographic machine equipped with a 7.5 -12 MHz linear transducer was used to examine the plantarmetatarsal, fetlock and pastern regions via et al. 2012; Carnicer et al. 2013). A well-de ned circular hypoechogenic/anechogenic area in the core of the DDFTwas visualised ultrasonographically, which extended from10 cm distal to the point of the hock ( Fig 2 ) to the pastern (Zone 2B to 3C). At the level of the fetlock canal (Zone 3C),the hypoechogenic area extended through the dorsal andplantar borders of the DDFT ( Fig 3 ), which was also severely changed in shape and size with irregular margins. Severe effusion of the DFTS (Zone 3C) with an abnormal amount of echogenic synovial fluid and severe thickening of the proximal and distal synovial plica and vincula were detected. The effusion was so severe as to change the normal shape of the super cial digital flexor tendon, which was considered of normal echogenicity ( Fig 4 ). At the level of the pastern (Zone P1A-P1B), the hypoechogenic area extended through the medial lobe of the DDFT, which was also greatly increased in thickness ( Fig 5 ). Severe thickening of the skin and subcutaneous tissues was observed. On the basis of the history, clinical examination and ultrasonographic ndings 1 2 Fig 2: Transverse ultrasonographic image obtained at the plantar aspect of the proximal metatarsus: the image was obtained witha 7.5 MHz linear probe.

Note the change of the normal shape of thesuper cial digital AE / SEPTEMBER 2017(Beccati et al. 2015), a tentative diagnosis of a septic lesion of the DDFT and septic tenosynovitis of the DFTS of the lefthindlimb was made. Further examinations Further examinations were used to investigate the respiratoryand abdominal systems because the horse had beenpresented with a history of chronic weight loss, intermittentfever and mild respiratory clinical signs. A complete bloodcount revealed a mild leucocytosis (11.9 910 9/l; reference 5.0 / l). and Anaplasma phagocytophilum were negative. Thoracic ultrasound showed a mild increase in the amount of pleural fluid and a moderate amount of comet tail artefacts throughout the cranial lung elds. Thoracic radiography, gastroscopy, rectal examination and abdominocentesis revealed no abnormalities. On the basis of the thoracic ultrasound ndings and anamnesis, a transtracheal wash was performed. The fluid collected from the tracheal wash appeared cloudy, with the presence of mucus and no signs of blood. Cytology revealed and 4% lymphocytes (rr 5 -10%). Signs of cell degeneration, such as karyolysis and cytoplasmatic vacuolization, were found in most neutrophilis together with presence of both intracellular and extracellular bacterial cocci. S. zooepidemicus was isolated from the bacteriological culture. Transcutaneousabdominal ultrasonography revealed mild splenomegaly and reduction in the size of the liver (hepatic hypotrophy). Ultrasound-guided intralesional sampling of the DDFT and of the synovial fluid of the DFTS was performed and thesamples were sent for bacterial culture. The cytological appearance was characterised by an increased white blood cell count (26.3 910 9/ll; rr <0.59106/l), of which 84% were neutrophilis with signs of degeneration and high protein concentration (53 g/l; rr 9.0 -30 g/l). Bacteriological cultures of both samples were positive and S. zooepidemicus was isolated. This con rmed the diagnosis of a septic lesion of the DDFT and septic tenosynovitis of the DFTS of the left hindlimb. Treatment Surgical drainage of the DFTS was recommended to theowner who declined because of the severity of the lesionand the guarded prognosis for return to full athletic function.Based on the results of sensitivity tests, the horse was startedon systemic antimicrobial treatment with cefquinome(Cobactan 4.5%) 11 mg/kg bwt i.v. every 24 h for 10 days, and local treatment with ultrasound-guided intralesional andintrathecal injection (ceftriaxone 1 g)3for 5 days. This was followed by regional limb perfusion with 2 g of ceftriaxone3for another 5 days. After this, samples were obtained from the DDFT and DFTS, and bacteriological culture of both samples was negative. Anti-in flammatory therapy with phenylbutazone (Bute 2.2 mg/kg bwt orally h)4was performed until discharge. A modi ed Robert-Jones bandage was applied to the distal limb during hospitalisation. The prognosis was considered good for survival, but guarded for a return to competition because of the risk of adhesions in the DFTS and persistent lameness. Outcome The horse was discharged after 19 days of hospitalisationshowing a mild improvement in the degree of lameness(American Association of Equine Practitioners grade 2 -3/5). Ultrasonographic examination repeated before dischargerevealed no further progression of oral paste)52.2 mg/kg bwt orally every 24 h were continued for 15 days after discharge. It was recommended to maintain the horse on box rest for 1 month with a reverse shoe with heel support to reduce tension on the DDFT, and to manage the pain. After this period, the horse was con ned in a small paddock for 7 months. About 10 months after discharge, the horse was still lightly lame but able to work and train and, 17 months after initial presentation, the horse was reintroduced to racing. The gelding has now raced 20 times, earning 9282.00 Euros, and is still in training. Discussion Septic infections of the tendons are rarely observed in horses.Intratendinous infections generally occur secondary to apenetrating wound or foreign body involving the tendon itself(Wereszka et al. 2007; Goodrich 2011; Pilati et al. 2015). In the literature, DDFT tendonitis is described as a result of strain injuries related to age and exercise or subsequent to direct trauma (Dyson 2010). To the authors 'knowledge, only one case of septic tenosynovitis of the tarsal sheath and suspected sepsis of the lateral digital flexor tendon ** Fig 5: Transverse ultrasonographic image obtained at the level of the pastern. The hypoechogenic area involves the medial lobe ofthe deep digital flexor tendon (arrow), which appears greatly increased in thickness. Note the effusion of the digital flexor tendon / to bacterial peritonitis has been reported in anArab gelding (Archer et al. 2004). A case of septic infection of the DDFT following bacterial peritonitis was observed someyears ago in our Veterinary Teaching Hospital .(M. Pepe, personal communication). The 5 cases of primary tendoninfection described by Kidd et al. (2002) were characterised by acute onset, severe lameness, pain on palpation of thelimb and very rapid progression of ultrasonographic lesions. Itwas reported that 4 of the 5 affected horses had competedon the day prior to the onset of lameness, suggesting that anaseptic traumatic tendon core lesion may subsequently havebecome infected. O'Sullivan et al. (2015) described a case of septic infraspinatus and intertubercolar bursitis suspected to besecondary to from anipsilateral subsolar abscess in a Standardbred racehorse. In the case reported here, the reason for presentation was intermittent fever and chronic weight loss, and thepatient had been treated for a respiratory disease by thereferring veterinary surgeon. In this case report, it is interesting to note that S. zooepidemicus was isolated from culture of the transtracheal wash, from the lesion of the DDFT and from thesynovial fluid of the DFTS, and all isolates showed the same results on sensitivity testing. This aerobic organism is a mucosalcommensal that produces disease opportunisticallyin situations of virus infection, heat stress or tissue injury (Sellon2007). It is the pyogen isolated most frequently from equinejoints, lymph nodes, nasal cavities and lungs (Timoney 2004)but its isolation from a tendon has never been reported. Inthe previous reported cases (Kidd et al. 2002), a coagulase- positive Staphylococcus was isolated in 3 of 5 cases, a Proteus sp. in one, and no bacteria were isolated in one case. From the sample obtained from the intertubercularbursa (O 'Sullivan et al. 2015) a Staphylococcus intermedius was cultured and in the case described by Archer et al. (2004) no bacteria were cultured. In mature horses, bacteria may colonise a tendon sheath or joint before the immune system can kill the organisms (Honnas et al. 1991; Schneider et al. 1992); however, haematogenous spread as a cause of septic arthritis/tenosynovitis is rare (Schneider et al. 1992). In our case, the exact aetiopathogenesis of the tendon lesion is unknown, but on the basis of the anamnesis, and theclinical and laboratory ndings, we suspect haematogenous spread of bacteria from the pulmonary area. Theultrasonographic ndings from the thorax may be consistent with the later stages of pleuropneumonia. It could behypothesised that septic thrombi, associated withpleuropneumonia, metastasised and were entrapped themicrocirculation of the tendon or of the DFTS, producinginfection; however, it is dif cult to demonstrate this theory. It has been reported that, in septic tenosynovitis, the aetiologyof the infection is signi cantly associated with the type of bacteria identi ed by culture (Schneider et al. 1992). Horses that develop an infection secondary to a penetrating wound frequently provide cultures of more than one organism (Schneider et al. 1992; Meijer et al. 2000; Taylor et al. 2010). In this case, only one bacterial species was isolated from the DDFT and DFTS, and this supports our hypothesis of haematogenous spread of the infection, hypothesis supported by the 4-month history of respiratory disease vs. the2-week lameness history.Unlike the previously described cases (Kidd et al. 2002), in the present report the concurrent presence of septic tenosynovitis of the DFTS was noted: is not possible to exclude that the tendon infection was secondary to septic DFTS tenosynovitis but, in the authors 'opinion, the DFTS infection was considered to be secondary to the septic tendonitis. Infection of the super cial digital flexor tendon and DDFT secondary to chronic DFTS sepsis and infection of the DDFT secondary to tarsal sheath sepsis have been recognised (Kidd et al. 2002, 2004), but they did not result in central anechoic core lesions as described in this case. If the infection had been the result of extension from adjacent tissues, we would expect the tendon lesion to begin on the periphery, as described in cases of tendon rupture secondary to tendon sheath sepsis (Kidd et al. 2004), and not to develop as a centrally located lesion. Septic tenosynovitis represents a serious, performance- limiting and often life-threatening condition in horses. Treatment of septic tenosynovitis is frequently described in literature. Such cases require early and aggressive management consisting of antimicrobial therapy, drainage/ debridement and supportive care/pain management (Caron 2011). Septic tendonitis is refractory to treatment and only few reported cases were treated successfully by a combination of drainage and antimicrobial therapy (Schneider et al. 1992; Kidd et al. 2002). In the case presented here, surgical drainage of the DFTS was discussedwith the owner, but because of the severity of the lesion, skininfection and the guarded prognosis for a return to fullathletic function, the owner declined surgery. However, thehorse was subjected to aggressive systemic and localantimicrobial therapy with a positive clinical response shownby improvement of the lameness a few days after treatment.In this case, a combination of systemic and localantimicrobial therapy, performed by ultrasound-guidedinjection, and supported by an adequate painmanagement, allowed the horse to return to full athleticactivity. The excellent response to the medical treatmentdespite the severity of the lesion surprised the authors andsuggests that an aggressive medical approach can producegood results in cases of septic tendon and sheath lesions. Inthe authors 'opinion, collection of consecutive samples from the tendon and the sheath during the time of the medicaltreatment represents a useful aid to monitoring the evolutionof the infection. More cases are required to investigate theexact aetiology of tendon infection in the absence ofevidence of a penetrating wound, and to establish theoptimal therapy to guarantee a good long-term prognosis,not only for survival but also for athletic function.

For more information about equine joint health and treatment body vibration affects the cross-sectional area andsymmetry of the m. multi dusof the thoracolumbar spine in the horse B. T. Halsberghe*, P. Gordon-Rossand R. Peterson Peninsula Equine Medical Center, Menlo Park; andWestern University of Health Sciences College of Veterinary Medicine, muscles Summary Whole body vibration (WBV) has been used as an adjunctivetherapy to improve the strength and size of paraspinalmuscles as well as postural control in people with lower backpain. It has been proposed that activation of the m. multi dus plays a key role. As the function and anatomy of the m. multi dus in the horse is comparable to that in man, the authors investigated whether WBV might also be a valuable physiotherapeutic modality in horses. The effects of WBV on the cross-sectional area (CSA) and left to right symmetry of the m. multi dus at various locations of the thoracolumbar spine of the horse was evaluated in a single-subject quasi- experimental time-series design with repeated measure. Nine horses were subject to WBV, 30 min, twice daily, 5 days a week, for 60 days in addition to their regular exercise routine. The CSA of the left and right m. multi dus was measured ultrasonographically at four levels (T15 -T16, thoracolumbar spine at Days /C030, 0, 30 and 60 of the study. Changes in the CSA and CSA symmetry (left to right) of the m. multi dus were analysed using nonparametric, repeated measures, comparison of meanranks with post-hoc analysis as necessary. A signi cant increase (P <0.05) in m. multi dus CSA was found at all spinal levels after 30 and 60 days of WBV and a statistically signi cant improvement in m. multi dus symmetry (becoming more symmetrical) was found after 60 days of WBV,indicating that WBV may be a valuable alternative todynamic mobilisation exercises when an increase in size andimprovement in left to right symmetry of the m. multi dus is sought. Introduction Dynamic mobilisation exercises in horses, targetingpreparative activation and strengthening of the m. multi dus and other core muscles, can increase cross-sectional area (CSA) and improve symmetry of m. multi dus (Stubbs et al. 2011). Based on these results and research in man on the role of the m. multi dus in spine stability (Freeman et al. 2010), Stubbs et al. (2011) suggest that these exercises might be potentially bene cial in improving or restoring spinal function and stability leading to reduced back pain; however, these exercises are labour intensive, time-consuming and require some practice to ensure they are performed correctly. Whole body vibration (WBV), by contrast, is an alternative method of neuromuscular training that exposes the wholebody to vertical mechanical sinusoidal oscillations in a controlled manner by the selection of preset intensities, amplitudes and frequencies. Research in man indicates that WBV is capable of increasing muscle activity (Mar /C19net al. 2015), muscle strength (Machado et al. 2009; Osawa and Oguma 2013), inducing muscle hypertrophy (Gilsanz et al. 2006), improving postural balance and reducing chronic back pain (del Pozo-Cruz et al. 2011). The aim of this study was to conduct a preliminary exploration of the effects of WBV on the m. multi dus. The authors hypothesised that daily WBV over a 60 -day period will result in an overall increase CSA and improved symmetry (left to right) of the m. multi dusin the horse. Materials and methods Study design The study was a single-subject quasi-experimental time-seriesdesign with repeated measure. Attribute independentvariables included breed, age, gender, primary use, exerciselevel and AAEP lameness score; the active independentvariable was WBV treatment. Of the nine participants, ve (B1, B2, B3, B4 and B5; Table 1 ) were selected to assess the stability of the CSA of the m. multi dusprior to WBV treatment (from Days /C030 to 0). All participants received WBV treatment from Days 0 to 60 and the dependent variable consisted of m. multi dus CSA measurements taken at Days 0, 30 and 60. All inferential statistics were evaluated within subject differences. Participants Of the theoretical population horses with clinical signs forback pain and associated lameness, nine horses (age10.2/C64.2 years) ( Table 1 ) were selected via convenience sampling from an accessible population of 1651 horsesowned by clients of Peninsula Equine Medical Center, MenloPark, California. Inclusion criteria were as follows: a gradablelameness before the start of the study not exceeding alameness score of 4/5 on an AAEP scale (Stashak 2002), aprevious lameness history indicative of a chronic or recurringlameness issue, no treatments or any other therapies withinthe last 6 months prior and during the study and signedinformed client consent form before the start of the study. Allhorses (n =9) were required to be housed in a stall (4 94m ) with daily turnout in a small paddock (8 916 m) and exercised 6 days a week. A speci c type and duration of \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd493 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017exercise, as well as diet was not a prerequisite, but forparticipation in the study, rider, exercise regime and diet forthat individual horse were required to remain the same from3 months prior to the start of WBV throughout the 2 months ' duration of the study. Lameness assessment Horses were examined by a veterinarian (primary author)experienced in lameness diagnosis and ultrasound imaging.All horses demonstrated lameness, ranging from grades 1 -4 on the AAEP lameness scale (Stashak 2002), before the start of WBV treatment ( Table 1 ). Back pathology was present in six of the nine horses. Horse (A1) had grade 2 kissing spines (overriding dorsal spinous processes); three horses (B2, B3 and B5) had grade 1 kissing spines and the other two horses (B1 and B4) had grade 3 kissing spines, as well as thoracolumbar facet joint arthritis. Whole body vibration and exercise All horses (n =9) underwent WBV 5 days a week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday), twice daily(morning and afternoon) for 30 min at a frequency of 40 Hz,amplitude of 0.8 mm and an acceleration of 4.9 m/s 2(0.5 g) for a total of 60 days using a mobile linear (vertical) type vibrating platform (Vita floor VM0)1, producing an indirect vertical sinusoidal vibration applied to the feet. This was added to their normal exercise routine. The regimen of WBV and m. multi dusCSA measurement is shown in Figure 1 . Ultrasound image capture of the m. multi dus Procedures for ultrasound image capture of the m. multi dus have been previously described (Stubbs et al. 2011). All ultrasonography and image capture was performed by the primary author with the horse restrained in cross ties and light sedation (5 mg detomidine [Dormosedan]2i.v.). After standard skin preparation, ultrasound images (ToshibaViamo)3were captured at the levels of T15 -T16, T16 -T17, T18 - L1 and L1 curvilinear probe (Toshiba Viamo probe 6C1, convex, T4.0 Hz)3, the spinous process, articular processes, mammillary process and lateral fascial border between them. multi dusand m. erector spinae was clearly visible ( Fig 2 ). The anatomical positions of the articular facet joints were con rmed each time ultrasonographically, by rst distinguishing the last (18th) rib, which is convex, from the transverse process of the rst lumbar vertebrae, which is flat. Subsequently, the T18 -L1 articular facet joint was visualised in between the last rib and transverse process of the rst lumbar vertebrae. The T18 -L1 facet joint was then used as the landmark to count cranially or caudally to identify the other articular facet joints L1 -L2, T16 -T17 and T15 -T16, respectively. The primary author selected a single image at the level of the articular facet joints instead of between articular facet joints, as described by Stubbs et al. (2011), because he felt that landmarks at the level of the articular facet joints were easier and more reliably imaged. The reliability m. multi dus CSA measurement was quanti ed by calculating the standard error of measurement (SEM). The total combined SEM of ultrasonographic image capture and the measurement of the CSA via imaging processing software (ImageJ) 4ranged from 0.012 to 0.014. Complete validation information is available in Supplementary Item 1 . Cross-sectional area measurement The procedure for the measurement of the CSA of them. multi dus has been previously described (Stubbs et al. 2010). The m. multi dus CSA measurements were completed by the primary author in a nonblinded, random order and all images were measured ve times. The average of the ve measures was used for all statistical analysis.

Results Mean and standard deviation (s.d.) for all m. multi dus CSA measurements are available in Supplementary Item 2 . One horse (B3) was sold and as such lost for the Day 60m. multi dus CSA assessment follow-up. Due to poorer image quality in some horses (A1, A2, A3 and A4) related to thethickness of the skin and fat, not all borders of them. multi dus were easily identi able on ultrasound images at some levels (T16 -T17 and L1 -L2) and as such were not further analysed in those four horses. M. multi dusCSA stability prior to WBV The stability assessment data (Days /C030 and 0) are repeated measures and not normally distributed; thus, a WilcoxonSigned Ranks test with listwise exclusion was performed to determine if there were differences among the mean ranks (means) of the CSA of the m. multi dusat each spinal region. The grouping provided two values (left and right) for each participant (n =5) at each spinal region; thus 10 paired values for analysis (n =10) at each spinal region. No statistical difference was found (P <0.05) for each spinal region when contrasting Days /C030 and 0. A Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test with listwise exclusion was performed to determine if there were differences among the mean ranks (means) of the CSA mean symmetry score of the multi dus muscle of each participant. The grouping provided 4 values (T15 -T16, T16 -T17, T18-L1 and L1 -L2) for each participant (P =5); thus 20 paired values for analysis (n =20). No statistical difference was found (P<0.05) when contrasting Days /C030 and 0. Thus there was no change in m. multi dus CSA or CSA symmetry ratio without WBV treatment. M. multi dusCSA with WBV For all analyses of m. multi dus CSA, data were grouped by spinal region. The grouping provided two values (left and right) for each participant (n =9) at each spinal region; thus, a potential for 18 paired values for analysis (n =18) at each spinal region. The n is provided for each analysis and those that are different than 18 are the result of missing data. The data are three repeated measures (Days 0, 30 and 60) and not normally distributed; thus a Freidman test with listwise exclusion was performed to determine if there were differences in mean ranks (means) of m. multi dus CSA at Days 0, 30 and 60 of WBV at each spinal region. A statistical difference was found at spinal region T15 =8)= 13.00, (P <0.01). This indicates that there was a difference among the three mean ranks (means) at Days 0, 30 and 60 at each of the spinal regions. The three orthogonal contrasts were performed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test with listwise exclusion. To hold the experiment wise type 1 error to less than 0.05, Bonferroni correction (comparison-wise alpha = 0.01) was used. The contrast between Days 0 and 30 at T15 - T16 (n =18, z (P <0.01, r=/C00.79) were found to be statistically signi cant at each spinal region. The contrast between Days 30 and 60 at T15 - T16 (n =16, z (P <0.01, r=/C00.89) were found to be statistically signi cant at each spinal region. The contrast between Days 0 and 60 at T15 -T16 (n=16, z (P <0.01, r=/C00.89) were found to be statistically signi cant at each spinal region. Additionally, the r effect size for each is greaterthan the absolute value of 0.75. Although there is minimal tono information regarding effect size in the literature in thiseld, the r effect size is considered much larger than typical in many other elds (Cohen 1988; Nakagawa and Cuthill 2007); thus the authors feel this is a clinically relevant increase inm. multi dus CSA. In all cases, the statistically signi cant contrasts indicated that as the duration of WBV increased the Fig 2: The ultrasound image is of the left and right m. multi dus at the level of the T15 -T16 articular facet joints and is representative of the images collected for the study. Theultrasonographic landmarks (dorsal spinous process, articularprocesses, mammillary process and lateral fascial border) / SEPTEMBER 2017CSA of the m. multi dus increased and this is biologically relevant ( Table 2 ). M. multi dusCSA symmetry with WBV For all analyses of m. multi dus CSA symmetry, data were grouped by participant. The grouping provided four values(T15 -T16, T16 -T17, T18 -L1 and L1 -L2) for each participant (n=9); thus 36 paired values for analysis (n =36). The n is provided for each analysis and those that are different than 36 are the result of missing data. The data are three repeated measures (Days 0, 30 and 60) and not normally distributed; thus a Freidman test with listwise exclusion was performed to determine if there were differences in mean ranks (means) of the symmetry score of the m. multi dus CSA at Days 0, 30 and 60 of WBV. A statistical difference was found ( X 2(2, n =24) =6.083, P=0.05). This indicates that there was a difference among the three mean ranks (means) for Days 0, 30 and 60. Thethree orthogonal contrasts were performed using a Wilcoxonsigned rank test with listwise exclusion. To hold theexperiment-wise type 1 error to less than 0.05, Bonferronicorrection (comparison-wise alpha =0.013) was used. The contrast between Days 0 and 60 (n =24, z =/C02.657, (P <0.01, r=/C00.54)) s found to be statistically signi cant, whereas contrast between Days 0 and 30 and Days 30 and 60 was not statistically signi cant. The r effect size is greater than the absolute value of 0.54 and this is considered larger than typical in many other elds (Cohen 1988; Nakagawa and Cuthill 2007); thus the authors feel this is a clinically relevant improvement in left to right symmetry of the m. multi dus CSA. The statistically signi cant contrast indicates that as the duration of WBV increased the symmetry score in the CSA ofthe m. multi dus decreases, meaning that the CSA of the m. multi dus from left and right became more symmetrical and this is biologically relevant ( Table 3 ). Discussion This study shows that WBV is capable of increasing the total(left and right) CSA at each spinal level in the horse(Table 2 ,Figs 3 and 4), an indicator of m. multi dus hypertrophy. Furthermore, an improvement in m. multi dus symmetry takes place over the 60 days of WBV, seen by the CSA symmetry ratio moving towards zero ( Table 3 ). The ability of WBV to increase CSA of the paraspinalmusculature (Gilsanz et al. 2006), as well as minimise m. multi dus atrophy during bed rest induced deconditioning (Belav /C19yet al. 2008) has previously been described in man, but to the best of the authors ' knowledge, has never been investigated in the horse. No signi cant change in m. multi dus CSA was seen over time without WBV treatment, indicating that the horse 's current environment, diet and exercise programme had no signi cant impact on the m. multi dus size over time. In contrast, addition of WBV to each horse individual exercise programme was able to induce hypertrophy of the m. multi dus in as early as 30 days and m. multi dus hypertrophy continued during the second 30 days of WBV. The muscle response to training will depend on the primary function of the muscle and whether or not the training stimulus is appropriate for that particular muscle function and composition. In horses, the m. multi dus is comprised of approximately equal muscle bre type (MFT -I) (slow twitch) and MFT-II (fast twitch) bres indicating a dual postural and locomotor role (Hyyti \u20acainen et al. 2014). The functional anatomy of the m. multi dusis comparable to that in man comprising a series of overlapping fascicles running caudo-laterally, spanning one to ve intervertebral joints. There are super cial and deep fascicles with the super cial fascicles being longer (Stubbs et al. 2006). In man, it appears that dynamic static resistance training (an exercise combining movement with a static holding pattern) is most effective in increasing CSA of the multi dus muscle (Danneels et al. 2001). This can be explained by the recruitment of a larger number of motor units, including both the low threshold motor units (MFT-I) and high threshold motor units (MFT-II) (Goldspink and Harridge 2002). In horses, the same principle regarding motor unit recruitment is true. It is, alarger number of motor units will be recruited as intensity, duration and speed of exercise increases (Rivero and Piercy 2008). Horses standing quietly on a WBV platform perform, strictly speaking, a static rather than a dynamic static exercise such as dynamic mobilisation exercises described by Stubbs et al. (2011). However, WBV on itself appears to be similar to a dynamic static exercise. This seems to be con rmed by at least one research paper, showing that WBV training was superior to a low intensity resistance training in improving static and dynamic muscle strength in man (Verschueren et al. 2004). This idea is further supported by research ndings in mice and rats using similar type WBV platforms as used in this study that show that WBV is able to induce both changes in MFT-I and MFT-II bres (Xie et al. 2008; Lochy /C19nski et al. 2013), indicative for high muscle activation as seen with dynamic static exercises and resistance training. This highTABLE 2: Mean and standard deviation (s.d.) for cross-sectional area (CSA) of m. multi dus muscle at four spinal levels at Days 0, 30 and 60 of whole body vibration treatment Spinal regionDay 0 CSA (n=9)Day are statistically signi cantly different (P <0.01). TABLE 3: Mean, minimum, maximum and standard deviation (s.d.) of symmetry score for cross-sectional area (CSA) ofm. multi dusmuscle at Days 0, 30 and 60 of whole body vibration treatment Days of treatmentSymmetry score (n =9) Minimum Maximum Mean s.d. Day 0 26.29 6.39* / 496muscle activation by WBV seems to be frequencydependent, with maximum activation of MFT-I bres occurring at lower frequencies than for MFT-II bres (Lochy /C19nski et al. 2013). We assumed that a 60 -day WBV protocol would be long enough for a muscle change to occur. This was based on thefact that in man 8 -10 week WBV protocols are able to improve muscle CSA (Belav /C19yet al. 2008; Machado et al. 2009) and in mice as little as 6 weeks (Xie et al. 2008). Whole body vibration training has been reported as being similar to resistance training (Bosco et al. 1998), with protein synthesis, a precursor for muscle hypertrophy, occurring after one resistance training session and changes in muscle size occurring after 4 -6 weeks of resistance training (Gabriel et al. 2006). In horses speci cally, signi cant muscle hypertrophy has been observed after a 2 -month progressive training programme in unconditioned horses and changes in muscle bre composition was noticed after short-term (3 weeks) speci c training protocols in pretrained horses (Rivero et al. 2007). The increase in the m. multi dus CSA seen after only 30 days is relatively fast. This could be related to theimmediate increase in muscle CSA seen post-exercise, which is well established in man and further supported by a more recent study in horses showing that a transient exercise- induced increase in back dimensions takes place (Greve et al. 2015). Although the mechanism of action responsible for a post exercise-induced increase in muscle CSA is not clear, one possible explanation is that the initial increase in muscle CSA is related to an increase in muscle fluid content rather than true hypertrophy secondary to increase in size and/or numbers of the contractile proteins (actin and myosin). This is supported by research in man, showing that an increase in muscle CSA is seen post-exercise secondary to extravascular fluid accumulation linked to muscle activity and perfusion (Nygren and Kaijser 2002). However, it is possible that the increase in CSA is related to a true muscle hypertrophy. A change in muscle bre composition is readily seen after 3 weeks of speci c training in pretrained horses (Rivero et al. 2007); the horses used in this study were pretrained and thus are likely to have been able todemonstrate a change in muscle bre composition. Alteration in bre size is easier achieved than a transformation (shift) from one muscle bre type to B2 Horse B3 Horse B4 Horse B5m. multifidus CSA(cm2) Spinal region Fig 3: The bar graphs display the m. multi dus CSA (cm2) of each participant at each individual spinal regions for each of the three assessment periods (Days 0, 30 and 60). Each bar represents the average cross-sectional areas of left and right m. multi dus (mean /C6s.d.) at four thoracolumbar levels in nine horses on Days 0, 30 and 60 of whole body vibration (WBV) treatment. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd497 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017meaning that whenever a shift in bre type is seen, it is most likely proceeded by hypertrophy. This would tend to supportthe assertion that the changes noted in this study werepredominantly due to muscle hypertrophy. Furthermore, wechose a high volume (two sets of 30 min twice daily), lowintensity (0.5 g) WBV protocol, based on research in man.Researchers have speculated that longer duration ofvibration may be necessary to elicit WBV effects on theneuromuscular systems (Osawa and Oguma 2013) and thatlow-load high volume resistance exercise is more effective atinducing acute muscle anabolism than high-load low volumeresistance exercise due to full motor unit activation (Burdet al. 2010). Therefore, the combination of high volume WBV and the ability of WBV to increase recruitment of motor unitsis another explanation for the relatively fast increase in CSAseen in this study. Although a trend was noted from Days 0 to 30 and Days 30 to 60, a statistically signi cant difference in left and right muscle symmetry was not seen until 60 days of WBVtreatment ( Table 3 ). The reason for this is unclear. In man, transmissibility is in fluenced by posture (Rubin et al. 2003). As such, it is possible that because horses were allowed to stand in their preferred posture, resting a particular leg, that transmissibility was likely less uniform; thus affected one side (left or right m. multi dus) to a greater degree. The use of a stall unit with tilting platform might yield better outcome in that respect as it forces the horse to reposition itself at speci c time intervals. Nevertheless, a signi cant improvement in muscle symmetry occurred and this improvement has been postulated to be a sign that the muscle is returning to a more normal physiological state (Stubbs et al. 2011). The limitations of this study are the relative small sample size, a nonstandardised exercise programme and the fact that the CSA measurements were performed nonblinded. Nevertheless, we can conclude that WBV appears to be a viable alternative to dynamic mobilisation exercises to increase CSA and improve symmetry of m. multi dus. Further research will need to be performed to determine whether or not this increase in m. multi dus CSA has the potential to reduce back pain through improvement of the spinal function and stability.

Part 3: Emergency care ofspeci c fractures I. M. Wright Newmarket Equine Hospital, racecourse; of rst aid of appendicular fractures in the horse, the literature is inconsistent and in some cases wrongor misleading. This in large part is due to misunderstanding offracture mechanics and this paper aims to give acontemporary review of the subject. It is particularly relevantfor fractures that occur on the racecourse or in horses intraining which, due to their aetiopathogenesis, havesubstantial site and con guration commonality. However, the techniques discussed are frequently also applicable to non-racing injuries. Clinical features are important in assessinghorses on the racecourse when imaging techniques arelimited. This paper highlights these in order to guide decisionmaking. Forelimb fractures Fractures of the distal phalanx Fractures of the distal phalanx are an uncommon racing ortraining injury in the UK but may present in the hours thatfollow with lameness of increasing severity. They appear tobe more common in the USA (Rabuffo and Ross 2002).Clinical signs (increased arterial pulse amplitude etc.)commonly raise the foot as a focus of suspicion. Distension ofthe distal interphalangeal joint usually accompanies articularfractures. The hoof capsule prevents marked displacementand there is little to be achieved by application of additionaltemporary support. Frequently, these do not have thecommon impact type con gurations of other distal phalangeal fractures. Most con gurations are thought to be reduced by limb loading; this is not readily achieved but isenhanced by provision of adequate analgesia. Fractures of the navicular bone Although the incidence of fractures appears low, in theauthor 's experience fractures of the hindlimb navicular bones in horses in training and racing appear to exceed theirforelimb counterparts. Lameness usually is acute in onset andsevere in intensity. Localising signs commonly and rapidly arereferable to the foot. Palpable distension of the distalinterphalangeal joint, sometimes accompanied by ill-de ned soft tissue swelling in the angle between the palmar/plantar surface of the middle phalanx and collateral cartilage may be detected. Additionally, swelling may develop over the deep digital flexor tendon as it emerges between the heel bulbs with resentment of digital pressure on the tendon. Transverse/horizontal fractures can result in markedly reduced palmar/plantar support to the distal interphalangeal joint and consequential subluxation. Such fractures usually will displacemarkedly. With fractures of the sloping margins (wings), localising signs may be sided. In the acute phase, most horses make toe only foot ground contact and should be supported in this position for transport and further evaluation. However, if the animal loads the limb with flat foot ground contact then it should be supported in this position as such horses may resent enforced distal joint flexion and will be encumbered in movement by xing the limb in this position. Fractures of the middle phalanx Fractures of the middle phalanx occasionally occur in horsesin training and racing but have been considered as rareracetrack injuries (Hill 2003a). Parasagittal, distal condylar,comminuted and fractures latter appear commonest andmay be uniaxial or biaxial. Both usually displace and biaxialfractures generally are accompanied by palmar/plantarsubluxation of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Emergencysupport of such is critical to avoid trauma to the palmar/plantar digital neurovascular bundles and catastrophicsequelae. Affected animals are commonly non- or minimally weightbearing and instability in the region of the proximalinterphalangeal joint may be clinically apparent. Soft tissueswelling generally is rapid in appearance. Limbs with, orsuspected to be with, fractures of the palmar/plantarprocesses of the middle phalanx should receive acutetemporary immobilisation of the metacarpophalangeal/metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints in a flexed position. A palmar/plantar board splint is ideal but goodreduction also can be obtained with a Leg Saver Splint 1.I n the absence of these and/or in situations of reduced diagnostic con dence a dorsal splint would also be appropriate. It is likely that parasagittal and comminuted fractures of the middle phalanx are best immobilised with techniques similar to those used for the proximal phalanx. Fractures of the proximal phalanx Sagittal and parasagittal fractures of the proximal phalanxhistorically were the most common racing and traininglongbone fracture in Europe. However, in the last 10 years,their incidence has been superseded by fractures of themetacarpal condyles (Jacklin and Wright 2012). Horses with complete and comminuted fractures usually are unable to continue to gallop. Jockeys riding horses thatsuffer comminuted fractures of the proximal phalanx areaware immediately of a severe injury. Some are audible as a \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd500 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017loud crack and the horse will try to pull up. Prompt assistanceby the jockey at this time is thought to be a major factor inlimiting the severity of comminution, degree of displacementand consequently the articular and soft tissue insults thatfollow. Horses are severely, i.e. non- or minimallyweightbearing, lame and sometimes will fall. Proximal phalangeal fractures can occur in both fore- and hindlimbs. They are most common in the forelimbs andwhile sagittal and parasagittal fractures may occur in training and racing, comminuted fractures ofthe hindlimb proximal phalanges are rare training and racinginjuries (Smith and Wright 2014). Distension of the metacarpophalangeal joint by haemorrhage quickly follows, its severity and tension roughlyproportional to the degree of articular damage. Unstablecomminuted fractures may exhibit visible shortening of thepastern, instability frequently is evident and they generally arereadily palpable. Circumferential pitting swelling due tohaemorrhage ensues. Fractures that extend into the proximalinterphalangeal joint will usually produce palpable distensionof the same. Non- or minimally displaced fractures can be equally lame. Swelling, including distension of the metacarpophalangealjoint, is less dramatic. In the acute phase, horses usually exhibitpain on rm digital (thumb) pressure dorsoproximally between the extensor branches of the suspensory ligament. The initial presentation of fractures of the palmar processes of the proximal phalanx is similar to that of parasagittalfractures. However, pain is usually elicited directly over theaffected palmar process(es). Twisting the proximal phalanx onthe third metacarpal bone also may be resented but otherproximal phalangeal fractures will react similarly. Since the principal distracting forces associated with sagittal and parasagittal fractures of the proximal phalanxappear to be mediolateral, appropriate techniques fortemporary immobilisation include Jones laterally splinted Jones bandage, acompression or cast ( Fig 1 ). Mediolateral stability is enhanced by flat (solar) foot ground contact and, whenever possible this should be prioritised. A Robert Jones bandage is suf cient for incomplete fractures while complete fractures may bene t from the additional mediolateral or circumferential support offered by the othertechniques. Incomplete fractures that extend from thesagittal groove of the proximal phalanx into the middiaphysis before coursing laterally should be managed ascomplete fractures since propagation (at least from theappearance on acute phase radiographs) to the lateralcortex is common. Load on, and displacement of, fractures of the palmar processes are diminished by flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint. Optimal emergency support is provided by a Kimzey Leg Saver Splint 1or dorsal splint. Most animals with comminuted fractures of the proximal phalanx will bear little weight on the limb. Con dent determination of principal distracting forces commonly is not possible and circumferential support with a compression boot, bandage cast or cast is recommended. If there is evidence of dorsopalmar instability, then flexion of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints is appropriate. This can be achieved by incorporation of adorsal splint into the bandage cast or cast together with a heel wedge to provide mediolateral stability.Fractures of the distal condyles of the third metacarpal bone Fractures of the metacarpal condyles are the most commontraining and racing longbone fractures worldwide, andfractures of the lateral condyle are the single most commonsite (Jacklin and Wright 2012). If complete, these disarm thelateral collateral ligament of the metacarpophalangeal jointleading potentially to luxation and creation of an openfracture. Fractures of the metacarpal condyles that do notresult in metacarpophalangeal luxation exhibit a widevariation in clinical compromise, which is not necessarilyproportional to the severity of the injury. Some will be unableto continue to gallop, others will complete the race andexhibit lameness on pulling up while other horses will berecognised only later during or after cooling off. Fractures ofthe metacarpal condyles can occur bilaterally althoughlameness and clinical signs may dominate, at least initially, inone limb. Careful clinical evaluation is an important guide to fracture location and con guration. Most fractures of the metacarpal condyles result in early distension, due tohaemorrhage, of the metacarpophalangeal joint. In theacute phase, incomplete fractures may exhibit little else.Pitting swelling (haemorrhage) in the distal lateralmetacarpus usually accompanies complete fractures of thelateral condyle ( Fig 2 ). Firm digital (thumb) pressure at this site commonly is resented. Signs of pain on digital pressure furtherproximally in the metacarpal diaphysis is a sign ofconsiderable concern as a warning of the potential presenceof a proximally propagating fracture. These are mostcommon medially. There may or may not be visible orpalpable evidence of soft tissue swelling (haemorrhage;Fig 2 ). Such cases demand careful radiological scrutiny of the whole metacarpal diaphysis particularly if a cortical exit pointfor the fracture cannot con dently be determined. The principal distracting forces are lateromedial ( Fig 3 ). Additionally, complete fractures frequently rotate (with dorsal a) b) Fig 1: Sagittal fracture of the proximal phalanx (a) diagrammatic representation of principal distracting forces; (b) actionby a Robert Jones bandage. \u00a92016 EQUINE / AE 2017displacement of the proximal portion of the fracture)presumably due to traction from the lateral collateral andcollateral sesamoidean ligaments when themetacarpophalangeal joint is flexed. Such fractures are reduced, both in temporary immobilisation and at surgery, byextension of the metacarpophalangeal joint ( Fig 4 ). It is important therefore that fractures of the metacarpalcondyles are immobilised with the metacarpophalangeal joint in an extended (weight bearing) position. Use of temporary immobilisation techniques that include flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint are contraindicated. Incomplete fractures that are restricted to the epiphysis and metaphysis are likely to require little more than the circumferential pressure of a Robert Jones bandage that a) b) c) Fig 2: Fractures of the metacarpal/metatarsal condyles; closed arrows =joint distension, open arrows =soft tissue swelling; (a) fracture of the lateral condyle of a third metacarpal bone with subtle soft tissue swelling extending laterally proximal to the distendedmetacarpophalangeal joint; (b) fracture of the lateral condyle of a third metatarsal bone with pronounced soft tissue swelling extendinglaterally to the junction of the middle and distal one-thirds of the diaphysis; (c) soft tissue swelling in the middle third of the diaphysis ofa third metacarpal bone associated with a propagating fracture of the medial condyle. a) b) c) Fig 3: Fracture of the lateral condyle of a third metacarpal bone; (a) dorsopalmar radiograph depicting proximal and lateraldisplacement; (b) diagrammatic representation of distracting forces; (c) counter action of distracting forces by a splinted Robert Jonesbandage. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd502 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017extends from the bearing surface to the proximalmetacarpus. Complete fractures should be consideredpotentially unstable (whether or not this is clinically evident)and mediolateral distracting forces resisted by application ofmedial and lateral splints to a Robert Jones bandage, use ofa compression boot, bandage cast or cast. All should betted with the metacarpophalangeal joint in an extended position with flat foot ground contact. Although af flicted animals usually will resist limb loading at this time, with judicious sedation and analgesia, the limb generally can be placed in a suitable position, if necessary in a slightly protracted location, i.e. in advance of the loaded contralateral limb. Firm but gentle hand pressure from an assistant onto the dorsal carpus and/or cranial antebrachium at this time will commonly steady the limb even if some degree of lifting and placing activity has continued ( Fig 5 ). All fractures of the medial condyle of the third metacarpal bone and any lateral fractures in which there are clinical and/or radiological concerns regarding the potential for proximal propagation of the fracture into the metacarpal diaphysis require circumferential temporary immobilisation and/or medial and lateral splints to the level of the distal row of carpal bones ( Fig 6 ). Fractures of the metacarpal condyles also may be involved in complex racing and training injuries. In a USA study of Thoroughbreds in 1991, multiple sites of injury were recorded in 27% (22/83) of fatal musculoskeletal injuries sustained in racing and 29% (23/79) while in training (Estberg a) d) b)c) Fig 4: Post mortem dissections of complete fractures of the lateral condyle of the third metacarpal bone in two horses after removal of the extensor tendons and dorsal joint capsules demonstrating the joints in extension (a and c) and flexion (b and d) in a left (a and b) and a right (c and d) forelimb. Fractures are reduced in extension while flexion results in abaxial and rotational displacement. Fig 5: Position the majority of horses with distal forelimb fractures will tolerate for application of temporary immobilisation/support. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd503 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017et al. 1998). The most common combination involving the metacarpal condyles is for fracture to occur in conjunctionwith breakdown of the suspensory apparatus, usually due tobiaxial fracture or dehiscence of the proximal sesamoidbones. The priority in these circumstances is preservation ofthe distal limb vasculature and therefore immobilisation inflexion is necessary. Affected animals usually will make little effort to load the limb. The support of choice is a dorsal splintapplied with breglass casting material to increase mediolateral stability. This is aided further by a heel wedge tomaximise foot ground contact. However, in moving the horsefrom the racetrack to an onsite clinical facility, use of a legsaver brace is appropriate. Fractures of the forelimb proximal sesamoid bones Fractures of proximal sesamoid bones in the forelimb are themost common catastrophic (resulting in death) injury intraining and racing in the USA (Johnson et al. 1994) where most races are on dirt tracks. They are less common in the UK(Parkin et al. 2004) where an increased risk in flat racing on all weather surfaces has been identi ed (Parkin et al. 2004; Kristofferson et al. 2010). Biaxial mid body fractures of the proximal sesamoid bones disrupt entirely thesuspensory apparatus and thus palmar support of themetacarpophalangeal joint. In addition to stretching andtearing of the palmar vessels and nerves, this results inmarked displacement of sharp fracture fragments that canlacerate the neurovascular bundle. Emergency support ofthe distal limb in a flexed position is therefore critical to maintaining viability ( Figs 7 and 8). Arthrodesis of the metacarpophalangeal joint is the only treatment option available to af flicted horses and requires substantial nancial commitment from owners. Similar flexed support is appropriate, although less critical, for uniaxial fractures and should be applied if, following clinical examination, this is the principal differential ( Fig 9 ).Dorsal splints, Leg Saver Splints 1or board splints all are appropriate for removal from the racetrack to the onsite clinical facility and for onward transport to a referral hospital. Luxation of the metacarpophalangeal joint Luxation or subluxation of distal metacarpal condylesand/or palmar process of the proximal phalanx.

Open luxations arecatastrophic, carry a poor prospect for survival and the largemajority justify immediate humane destruction. If an animal isof suf cient value to justify perseverance then the exposed tissues should be cleansed before the joint is reduced. Optimal temporary support is provided in the form of a bandage cast or cast that extends from the bearing surfaceto the proximal metacarpus. However, once the joint isreduced and placed in an extended position, it usually isstable and therefore maintenance of this position with aRobert Jones or splinted Robert Jones bandage extending toproximal metacarpus or use of a compression boot maysufce. Transverse or oblique fractures of the metacarpal diaphysis Complete transverse or oblique fractures of the metacarpaldiaphysis are inherently unstable, displace immediately andinvariably are catastrophic in racehorses. Comminution iscommon and, due to the paucity of overlying soft tissue theyfrequently are, or become, open 1998; Beinlich Bramlage 2002; Hill 2003a; Bischofberger et al. 2009). Unrecognised or inappropriately managed incomplete fractures of the dorsal cortex are thought to be a major predisposing factor (Hill 2003a). The distal limb is uncontrollable and when moving at speed af flicted horses may fall; if possible the horse should be restrained (physically and chemically) in this position until subjected to euthanasia. Standing horses are markedly anxious and sometimes panic. Immediate sedation and sometimes physical restraint is necessary in order to effect control long enough for euthanasia to be organised. Any necessary dialogue with connections should be swift and opinions, including if necessary colleague support, forthright. Carpal subluxation Carpal subluxation is an uncommon racing or training injury.Most angular deviations result from displaced/collapsingcuboidal bone fractures which usually are comminuted andfrequently involve bones in both proximal and distal rows withconsequential collapse on the affected side. Radial with thirdand/or second carpal bones are most common, resulting invarus deformity (Ruggles 2006; Ross 2011). It is not knownwhether such fractures occur concomitantly or fromsequential overload. Lameness is marked and usually issufcient to prevent the horse from continuing to run. Angulation generally is visible and accompanied by crepituswith an abnormal range of mediolateral motion. Jointdistension (haemorrhage) is quickly evident together withperiarticular swelling over the affected bones as joint integritycommonly is compromised. In the absence of collapsing cuboidal bone fractures, mediolateral instability requires complete disarmament ofone collateral ligament and usually is accompanied also byfracture at its origin or insertion. In the author 's practice, the most frequently encountered of these is fracture of the proximal second metacarpal bone. The author has encountered dorsopalmar subluxation only in the presence of multiple palmar cuboidal bone fractures. Emergency immobilisation of choice is a tube/sleeve cast extending from proximal antebrachium to distal metacarpus with the limb in a loaded/weightbearing position ( Fig 10 ).Under sedation, the affected limb should be placed perpendicular to the ground so that the horse 'stands square '. Five-cm squares of adhesive cast felt with central 2 cm diameter circles removed (doughnut like) should be placed over medial and lateral styloid processes of the radius and accessory carpal bone. Three to 4-cm wide bands of the same can then be stuck to the skin at the proximal and distal margins of the cast. A single layer of conforming bandage such as Soffban 2then covers the cast area. Eight to 10 rolls of 10 cm plaster of Paris are layered over this, varying the thickness of the plaster of Paris to reduce protuberances in the limb and thus to create a smooth surface for the rigid breglass tape. Three rolls of 7.5 cm followed by four rolls of 12.5 cm polyurethane impregnated breglass tape follow immediately while the plaster of Paris is wet. This promotes interdigitation of the materials creating a secure bond and eliminating independent movement. At the ends of the cast, a small amount of foam/felt should protrude adjacent to the skin and a small amount of plaster of Paris should protrude from the breglass. Cast materials all are applied in accord with manufacturers 'recommendations. Useful tips include keeping the breglass wet for several minutes while rubbing the surface to encourage the polyurethane to run between the layers of breglass to promote bonding. Once frothing of the polyurethane subsides then wrapping loosely a water soaked gauze bandage over the cast surface also promotes this activity. Moving horses from the racetrack to the racecourse clinical facility is optimally achieved with a splinted full limbRobert Jones bandage or bandage cast in order to limit damage caused by the collapse and to permit the animal a degree of control of the limb which assists signi cantly in reducing accompanying anxiety. a) b) Fig 10: a) and b) Carpus immobilised in an extended position with a sleeve cast applied from proximal antebrachium to distalmetacarpus. \u00a92016 AE / SEPTEMBER 2017Carpal alignment can be maintained and/or supported by splinted Robert Jones bandages. Wooden struts as previously described (Part 2: Wright 2017) are most frequently employed and for maximal bene t should be applied over a modi ed Robert Jones bandage that doubles the diameter of the limb. If wooden struts are employed then a minimum of two splints placed at 90 \u00b0to each other are necessary. A lateral splint extending from the level of the elbow to the ground is necessary in all cases. This may be supplemented by a cranial splint from the level of the elbow to the distal metacarpus ( Fig 11 ) and/or a caudal splint from the level of the elbow to the ground. In the author 's hands, horses ambulate better with the former. An alternative is application of half or third diameter PVC piping caudally from the level of the elbow to the ground with layered cotton wool (Robert Jones-like) applied to the limb with suf cient quantity and distribution to create a parallel-sided tube, which ts with minimal movement into the curved pipe splint. All splintingmaterials must align well with the long axis of the limb and besecured tightly with overlying tape, which may be nonelasticor elasticated and pulled to its limit. Fractures of the carpus which do not jeopardise axial stability Fractures of the carpus are common training and racinginjuries but the vast majority do not compromise axial stabilityof the limb. Temporary immobilisation does not generallycontribute to tissue preservation, in fluence prognosis or provide signi cant analgesia. Indeed, in most circumstances, con ning bandages, splints etc. are an encumbrance to the horse. Thus noncollapsing slab fractures or chip fractures ofdorsodistal radius or cuboidal bones generally obtain nobene t from attempts at splinting. Sometimes, when haemorrhage and thus joint distension are marked, application of counter pressure in the form of an elasticated bandage appears to reduce discomfort. Suitable, tailored, zip up bandages (Pressage 3) are available. Fractures of the accessory carpal bone do not jeopardise axial stability of the limb. Complete fractures in a frontal plane are seen as training and racing injuries both in flat racing and, following falls, in jump racing. Such fractures commonly comminute and usually are markedly unstable with displacement occurring with flexion of the carpus. Whatever management route is taken minimising secondary damage, including trauma to the carpal sheath of the digital flexor tendons and its contents is likely to be contributory to case outcome. The carpus may be xed in extension by use of a tube/sleeve cast as described above or alternatively application of a cranial/dorsal wooden splint over a modi ed Robert Jones Fig 12 ).

Fractures of mid and proximal radius Fractures of the diaphysis and proximal metaphysis of theradius are uncommon racetrack injuries. When a fractureoccurs in this region, both flexor and extensor muscles no longer have an intact skeletal strut and they becomeabductors of the distal limb about the fracture site ( Fig 13a Mudge and Bramlage2007). All racing and training related fractures in this regionnecessitate a guarded to poor prognosis for survival as thereis little corporate experience of successful repair in horsesover 450 kg. Some nondisplaced fractures, which generallyare the result of external trauma, can be managed by crosstie or overhead wire restraint but complications associatedwith contralateral limb overload are common. The principal requirement of temporary immobilisation techniques suitable for fractures of the radial diaphysis is tocombat the distal limb abduction. This is achieved by use ofa single strut that extends from the level of the proximalscapula to the ground to which it should be perpendicular.The splint will contact the lateral proximal muscle masses anda modi ed Robert Jones bandage is constructed over the free limb in order to maintain the splint 's proximal contact, perpendicular orientation and to ll in the dead space between the free limb and the splint ( Fig 13b, c ). Further cranial and/or caudal splints can then be placed at 90 \u00b0to this to provide rigidity ( Fig 13c ). Although appearing ungainly, the technique is well tolerated and horses will move well with thisin situ . Fractures of the olecranon Fractures of the olecranon tuberosity of the ulna are notrecognised training and racing injuries but can arise on theracecourse as a result of traumatic incidents. When complete, the triceps apparatus is disarmed and the horse cannot x the limb in extension. This causes marked anxiety, usually accompanied by repeated lifting and placing activity. The animal also is unable to use the limb as a prop or support for balance during transport. Most are readily aided byxing the carpus in extension. Although caudally applied splints have been described (Furst 2006; Mudge and Bramlage 2007) these are bulkier, less easy to apply and not tolerated as well by the horse as a dorsally applied splint. The latter should extend from proximal antebrachium to distal metacarpus and be applied over a relatively light bandage in order to minimise the pendulum effect. Suf cient padding should be used only to minimise splint impingement and excoriation of the limb ( Fig 12 ). Fractures of the humerus In racehorses, fractures of the humerus usually arecatastrophic. A series of 21 complete, unilateral fractures hasbeen described in racehorses in California; 18 Thoroughbreds,two Quarter Horses and one Appaloosa (Stover et al. 1992). Seventeen occurred during training and two while racing.The history of the other two was unknown. These typically hada spiral caudoproximal to craniodistal con guration. Ten of 13 available bones had gross evidence of pre-existing stressfracture (periosteal callus) at the site of ultimate failure;usually on the caudoproximal diaphysis. In jump racing,fractures of the humerus frequently are associated withcollisions with jumps or impact from falling (Williams et al. 2001). Horses with complete fractures are invariably nonweightbearing. They usually displace and override toresult in an uncontrolled limb with shortened brachium(Fig 14 ). The close proximity of the brachial artery and its major trunks means that marked haemorrhage with rapidlydeveloping swelling commonly accompany diaphyseal a) b) c) Fig 13: a) Diagrammatic representation of the principal distracting forces on diaphyseal fractures of the radius; (b) diagram demonstrating the rationale for a long lateral splint to counteract distracting forces; (c) mid diaphyseal fracture of the left radiusimmobilised with a long lateral splint extending to the level of the proximal scapula with a cranial/dorsal splint extending from the levelof the elbow to the bearing surface incorporated into a modi ed Robert Jones bandage. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd508 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017fractures. This is a poor prognostic sign and, since the majorityof horses with complete, displaced fractures that occur onthe racecourse cannot currently be saved, swift humanedestruction is indicated (Hill 2003a; Dyson 2011). Control ofpain is dif cult in such horses and rarely satisfactory. Crepitus may be palpable and/or audible. The elbow and carpuscannot be xed, but in the peracute phase it is dif cult to be con dent whether this is a result of disarming the triceps apparatus and/or due to laceration of the radial nerve bythe displaced fracture. If the horse is recumbent with the injured limb uppermost then a clinical diagnosis can usually be established withoutthe need to get the horse to its feet. If this limb is on theunderside, then turning the horse may be necessary in orderto establish the reason for recumbency. In mostcircumstances this is readily achieved by attaching ropes tothe underside fore- and hindlimbs. However, if there is anysuspicion of fracture in either of these, then use of the upperlimbs also is recommended. As the horse initially is raised, theloss of skeletal continuity in the underside limb mayimmediately be apparent. All authors agree that there are no bene ts to be gained from attempting 1983, preclude effectiveimmobilisation and the surrounding muscle masses protectthe fractured bone. Fractures of the lateral tuberosity of the humerus that extend distally to involve varying amounts of the craniallateral diaphysis and deltoid tuberosity can result from falls injump racing. Af flicted may, on rising, be non- Crepitus may be humerus. The amount of haemorrhage isvariable but almost always less than that seen with thediaphyseal fractures and it is restricted to the fracture area.There is no brachial shortening and within a few minutes thehorse usually will tentatively load the limb though protractionwill be restricted. In contrast to complete diaphyseal fracturesthese often are amenable to removal or repair with return offunction (Mez et al. 2007). There are no necessary or contributory temporary immobilisation techniques. Most racetrack evaluations of humeral fractures are clinical only. If adequate radiographic facilities are available at or close to the racecourse, then it is appropriate for these to be utilised. Ultrasonography can be readily performed in racecourse clinical facilities and may con rm osseous discontinuity and aid in fracture differentiation. Fractures of the scapula Fractures of the scapula can result from stress overload in flat racehorses or from falls in jump racing (Adams 1996; Dyson2011). The latter most commonly involve the supraglenoidtubercle. After a short initial period of nonweightbearing,horses with fractures of the supraglenoid tubercle will loadthe limb, although, as the origin of biceps brachii is lost, the cranial phase to the stride (protraction) is severely reduced.External support is counterproductive, simply increasing limbload. Some, but not all, horses will be helped by assistancewith limb protraction/extension from a rope passed aroundthe pastern. This is used to reduce some of the effort neededto protract the leg; pull/lift should be applied in a steady,controlled manner once the limb breaks over. Complete fractures of the neck and body of the scapula commonly displace and override. Trauma to axialneurovascular elements is common and haemorrhagic swellingcan rapidly develop. Af flicted horses are non- or minimally weightbearing and usually are markedly distressed with minimalrelief from analgesics. Viewed from the front, the swelling canappear to result in abaxial displacement of the visualised by lateral tuberosity of the humerus) may appear ventrally displaced; this is not of itself pathognomonic, but shortening of the scapula length (assessed as the distance from the proximal margin of the scapula to the proximal margin of the lateral tuberosity of the humerus) is highly suggestive of a complete, displaced fracture ( Fig 15b ). If a con dent diagnosis cannot be made on clinical grounds, then it is appropriate to move the horse on an a) b) c) Fig 14: Acute diaphyseal fracture of the left humerus; (a) dysfunctional limb with 'dropped elbow 'posture; (b) swelling produced by haemorrhage; (c) shortened brachial segment demonstrated by ngers on the humerus EDUCATION / / SEPTEMBER 2017ambulance from the racetrack. Further examination inclinical facilities may be more rewarding. Con rmation can usually be achieved at this time by ultrasonographicexamination. In the author 's hands complete, displaced fractures of the scapula in adult horses carry a hopeless prognosis forhumane preservation of life. Even short-term comfort whileconnections are consulted can be dif cult to achieve. Sedation and combination analgesia are employed, whiledecision making processes are expedited. Hindlimb fractures Fractures of the middle and distal phalanges and navicular bone The mechanics of fractures of these bones are identical tothose involving their forelimb counterparts. However, thereciprocal apparatus makes alignment of the dorsal cortices of the third metatarsal bone and phalanges impossible. A plantar (board type) splint that produces a greater degree of distal joint flexion is preferred whenever joint flexion is indicated in temporary immobilisation of this region. Fractures of the proximal phalanges Sagittal and parasagittal fractures of the proximal phalangesin the hindlimbs are less common than their forelimbcounterparts (Hill 2003a). They are also more usually simpleand/or incomplete although all con gurations can occur. Horses nd it easier to ambulate on two fore- and one hindlimb than vice versa ; they also protect better distal hindlimb fractures during movement and transport. Theprinciples of temporary immobilisation are similar to theforelimb although proprietary boots t poorly and are less well tolerated on the hindlimbs. Positioning a painful hindlimb with the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints extended (in a weightbearingposition) often cannot be achieved with the leg perpendicularto the ground i.e. parallel to the uninjured limb. However, bypositioning the leg in a protracted position and, with asteadying hand on the calcaneus, a sedated horse will usuallykeep the limb there while support is tted ( Fig 16 ). A Robert Jones bandage or bandage cast generally are the techniquesof choice. Fractures of the plantar processes of the proximal phalanx may be immobilised with a plantar board splint. Fractures of the distal condyles of the third metatarsal bone Like parasagittal fractures of the proximal phalanx, these areless common training and racing injuries in the hindlimb thanthe forelimb but the disparity is not as great. The severity offractures of the hindlimb lateral condyle also is less than inthe forelimb but the propensity towards medial, proximallypropagating fractures is greater. a) b) Fig 15: Displaced fracture of the right scapula; (a) marked swelling produced by haemorrhage; (b) segmental shorteningbetween the proximal margin of the the lateraltuberosity of the humerus. Fig 16: Hindlimb positioned for application of support for distallimb fractures in a weight bearing position. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd510 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE evaluation ( Fig 2 ) and management/support follows similar guidelines to the forelimbs. However, as a general principle bandages in the hindlimb should have less bulk. Heavy bandages are not well tolerated. Additionally, if medial and lateral splints are applied these will have a tendency to rotate away from the line of the third metatarsal bone over a bulky bandage. When splints are employed these should t in apposition to the hoof wall at the bearing surface. Suf cient bandaging is then applied to ll in the dead space between the limb and splint to maintain the splints in parallel alignment to the proximal metatarsus. When a propagating (spiral) fracture is present or suspected, splints should extend to the level of the talocentral-calcaneoquartal (proximal intertarsal) joint. Bandages should not be placed further proximad. This almost invariably is resented strongly by horses that, in attempting to flex the limb, will abduct it in a wide proximal arc suf cient to lose balance and fall. Some horses will do this even withimmobilisation as described. Attendants should be prewarnedand rm but considerate handling is necessary for the safety of horse and personnel. The author 's preference for temporary immobilisation of unstable or propagatingfractures is a bandage cast tted in the described limb position and again of reduced bulk compared with the forelimb. Transverse and oblique fractures of the diaphysis of the third metatarsal bone These are rare training and racing injuries but can followtraumatic incidents. The majority of fractures in mature horsesare not amenable to repair and therefore destruction onhumane grounds is indicated. When applying temporaryimmobilisation to those fractures that merit furtherconsideration, the calcaneus can be used as a functionalextension of the metatarsus (Bramlage 1996). A plantar splintcan be placed from the calcaneus to the ground surfacesupplemented by a lateral splint from the level of the base ofthe calcaneus (adjacent to the calcaneoquartal articulation)to the bearing surface ( Fig 17 ). These should be placed over a minimal modi ed Robert Jones bandage suf cient to maximise splint contact only. If the bandage is too thick, then the rigid support offered by the splints will be diminished. It also will be difcult to maintain splint-limb alignment. A cast can also be used. Like the splints, on the plantar aspect, this should extend to the calcaneus tapering dorsally to the level of the centrodistal joint. The tarsocrural joint must not be enclosed. Fractures of the tarsus and tibia Complete fractures of the tibia are rare training and racinginjuries. Most are thought to result from pre-existing stressfractures (Hill 2003a). Fractures of the tibia and fractures of thetarsus that jeopardise axial stability are particularly dif cult to immobilise because of the reciprocal apparatus linking tarsal and sti fle joint motion. Its action is such that if the osseous column is disrupted then the intervening fracture may become the focus of its action producing or exacerbating displacement, fracture overriding and limb collapse. Additionally, the principal muscle masses are situated laterally so that, as described with fractures of the radius, when acting over a discontinuity in the skeleton, these produce distal limb abduction (Bramlage 1996; Furst 2006; Mudge and Bramlage 2007). Such fractures thus have a propensity to become open medially. This is counteracted, as in the forelimb, by utilising along lateral splint that should reach the level of the coxofemoral joint. Flexion and extension of the sti fle cannot be prevented and the normal flexion angles of sti fle and hock joints prevent use of cranial or caudal splints. However, a single wide lateral splint bent to follow limb angulation is placed alongside the biceps femoris with the limb as close as possible to perpendicular to the ground. Sufcient bandage material then is placed on the distal limb to contact the splinting device. This should not be excessive or the splint 's action will be compromised and the bandage bulk will act as a pendulum on the fracture. The ideal splint material is lightweight metal such as aluminium, electrical conduit or small diameter steel reinforcement bars (Bramlage 1983). A mild steel rod (12 mm diameter) can be fashioned into shape by hand and is strong enough to provide support (Walmsley 1996). Horses with fractures in this location will not consistently load the limb and so this is tted with the leg semi flexed i.e. toe foot ground contact and alignment with the third metatarsal bone and phalanges. The splint extends in a straight line from the ground to the tarsocrural joint where it is bent cranially to follow the tibial diaphysis. At the sti fle it is bent caudally and lies on the surface of the biceps femoris to the level of the coxofemoral joint. The splint is most effective if it is bent back on itself, retracing its course to the bearing surface (Bramlage 1983, 1996). In some smaller animals, fractures of the tarsus and tibia can be immobilised temporarily for transport and evaluation by a laterally positioned board splint. This should be approximately 10 -15 cm wide and 15 mm thick and cut to a length extending from the ground to the level of the animal 's coxofemoral joint. The limb is enclosed in bandage material sufcient to create contact with the board, which should lie on the lateral aspect of the biceps femoris and be Fig 17: Diagrammatic representation of splint for immobilisation of EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017perpendicular to the ground. The limb should be held slightlycaudal to the contralateral limb thereby extending slightlytarsal and sti fle joints. It is then tightly secured to the limb with nonelastic tape or tightly pulled elastic tape. Both techniques can be resented strongly by horses which, despite painful fractures, will make exaggeratedmovements and kick with the splinted limbs suf ciently vigorously to fall. This particularly can happen with the boardsplint. All associated personnel should be warned withrespect to personal safety and the inherent risks to the horse.Firm decisive handling is critical. Tarsal luxation and subluxation This is a rare racetrack injury. Most occur through thetarsometatarsal or talocalcaneal-centroquartal (proximalintertarsal) joint; the fourth tarsal interdigitation of the tibial malleoli anddistal intermediate ridge with the talus provides osseoussupport to the remaining joints (Moll et al. 1987). Collateral and short intertarsal ligament disruption is inevitable and mostare also accompanied by marginal fragmentation of tarsalbones. Complete or partial reduction is often spontaneous.The limb is most comfortable and stable when loaded. Ideal support is a tarsal cast extending from the distal third of the crus/tibia to the proximal-middle third junction ofthe metatarsus and applied with the horse standing and limbloaded ( Fig 18 ). Sedation is advisable. The author 's preference is for six rolls of 10 cm plaster of Paris followed by two rolls of 7.5 cm and two rolls of 12.5 cm breglass casting tape. 'Doughnuts 'of adhesive orthopaedic foam placed over the tibial malleoli reduce impingement sores over these prominences. Most horses tolerate the cast well although many will, on their rst movement, as tarsal flexion is restricted, lift the limb in a high abducted arc with a degreeof panic. Firm handling by experienced personnel is criticalas, if not controlled, the horse can become suf cientlyunbalanced to fall away from the affected/immobilised limb. Such behaviour generally subsides. Fixing the tarsus as described can result in rupture of the peroneus tertius . The author has experienced this only in recovery from general anaesthesia and not in horses in which the cast was applied standing. Fractures of the tarsus that do not jeopardise axial stability Fractures of the tarsus that occur during training and racingbut which do not jeopardise axial stability of the limb includefractures of the tibial (usually lateral) malleoli, fractures of thetrochlear ridges of the talus, parasagittal fractures of the talusand slab fractures of the central or third tarsal bones. Thelatter are seen in all forms of racing while the others are mostcommonly the result of falls and therefore are most frequentin jump racing. Although fractures of the lateral malleolus ofthe tibia frequently will disrupt the majority of the short lateralcollateral ligaments, they rarely extend suf ciently proximad to compromise signi cantly the long lateral collateral ligament and therefore tarsal stability. Attempts atimmobilisation almost always are counterproductive.However, the horse 's comfort level may be improved and surgical condition of the soft tissues enhanced by use of alight, conforming bandage. Proprietary, tailored elasticatedzip up bandages (Pressage 3) are ideal and generally are well tolerated by the horse. Stifle fractures Fractures involving the sti fle joints are invariably of a traumatic nature and therefore principally involve horses in jump racing although even in these sports such fractures are rare. Fractures of the patella and tibial tuberosity are impact injuries. Fractures of the tibial eminences, most commonly the medial eminence, can result from falls but commonly represent only part of a more complex injury, which may include suf cient ligamentous disruption to result in femorotibial instability. There is no adequate immobilisation for such cases. Fractures of the femur Fractures of the femur that present on the racetrack are mostcommonly diaphyseal, complete and displaced (I.M. Wright,unpublished observations). Limb shortening (greatertrochanter to patella distance) due to overriding offragments and rotational instability are common. Markedhaemorrhage frequently follows as the femoral artery and/ormajor emergent vessels are lacerated by fracture fragments.The animal 's thigh may be seen to enlarge visibly minute by minute. The prognosis generally is hopeless and pain and anxiety are usually inadequately controlled. Horses with evidence of haemorrhage should be moved as little as possible and, as soon as a con dent diagnosis is reached, the animal should be subjected to euthanasia on humane grounds to avoid the potential of painful and distressing exsanguination. Fractures which are suspected but which do not exhibit marked acute haemorrhage may be moved for further evaluation. The femur is surrounded by muscle and cannot be stabilised by any temporary immobilisation technique (Bramlage 1983, 1996; Furst Mudge and Bramlage 2007). Fractures of the greater trochanter occasionally are encountered but exhibit few reliable clinical signs in the Fig 18: Immobilisation of the tarsus in a weight bearing position with a cast extending from the junction of the middle and distalone-thirds of the crus to the junction of the middleone-thirds of metatarsus. \u00a92016 EDUCATION / AE / 2017peracute phase. Swelling as a result of haemorrhage mayfollow. Horses usually will load the limb. Fractures of the thirdtrochanter also have been recognised in horses in trainingand racing and are thought to be the result of traction injury.However, these do not generally present on the racecourseand more usually are discovered in subsequent lamenessinvestigations. Pelvic fractures Fractures of the pelvic girdle are common and potentially lifethreatening training and racing injuries. The vast majority offractures of the pelvis that occur during racing or training arestress related injuries and as such have predilection sites(Shepherd et al. 1994; Pilsworth 2003). Occasionally, fractures of the pelvic girdle will result from falls or other on coursetrauma such as injury in starting stalls. The ilial wing is one ofthe commonest site of stress fracture in skeletally immatureThoroughbred racehorses (Pilsworth 2003). These may beunilateral or bilateral with varying degrees of limbdominance. Fractures can be complete or incomplete indorsoventral and craniocaudal planes. Complete fracturesexhibit varying degrees of displacement determinedprincipally by fracture location and con guration. Fractures of the ilial wing that present on the racecourse usually arecomplete and frequently displaced. Trauma to dorsally lyinggluteal or caudally positioned iliolumbar arteries ( Fig 19 ) will result in varying amounts of haemorrhage into overlying muscle masses. This may be visible as a protuberance or increased convexity at this site. Affected animals frequently are in marked pain but the amount of haemorrhage rarely is life threatening. Classically, horses that have suffered pelvic fractures exhibit intense muscle spasm and guarding of the affected hindquarter. Asymmetry of osseous landmarks is indicative of fracture displacement but caution must be exhibited as postural abnormalities, soft tissue swelling and muscle atrophy can be misleading. Additionally, the longevity of asymmetry always must be questioned. As determined by location, displaced fractures of the ilial wing may result in displacement of the tuber sacrale ortuber coxa . When unilateral, the tuber sacrale frequently is ventral to its intact counterpart. Firm downward pressure at this site often isresented (Shepherd et al. 1994). Displacement of the tubercoxa , presumably as a result of continued muscular traction is accompanied by rotation in a cranioventral direction toward or into the sublumbar fossa (Pilsworth 2003). Narrowing of the space between the last rib and tuber coxa often is a useful guide ( Fig 20 ). In such cases the affected hemipelvis often appears narrower than its intact counterpart when the horse is viewed from behind. There may also be pain on palpation of the tuber coxa and crepitus may be appreciated in the acute phase before signi cant haemorrhage has developed. Fractures of the ilial shaft are immediately life threatening. While the degree of pain/lameness exhibited is not an accurate guide to the location or severity of the injury, horses with displaced fractures of the ilial shaft usually are extremely distressed. Pain in these animals often is not controlled adequately by any analgesic. Displacement of ipsilateral tuber sacrale and tuber coxa must be viewed with extreme caution as it necessitates fracture of the ilial shaft, wing shaft junction or a comminuted fracture of the ilial wing. Displaced fractures of the ilial shaft or at the junction of the shaft and IliolumbarGluteal Internal ExternalIliac Iliac Iliacofemoral Fig 19: Equine pelvic girdle showing the location of principal adjacent arterial trunks a) b) Fig 20: Reduced costocoxal (sublumbar) space of a displaced fracture of the right ilial wing/ tuber coxa (a) compared with its left \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd513 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / lacerate iliacofemoral arteries and maylacerate the parent internal iliac artery or, less commonly, theexternal iliac artery ( Fig 19 ). This frequently is catastrophic resulting in distressing haemorrhagic shock andexsanguination. Swelling may rst be visible in the pubic or perineal areas as haemorrhage dissects through fascialplanes before the whole hindquarter increases in size. Paincommonly is only minimally or temporarily controlled. At thisstage, in the author 's experience, survival is rare and euthanasia on humane grounds is justi ed. Af flicted horses can become uncontrollable so intervention should not be delayed unduly. Supportive or palliative care is futile. In one series, 6 of 11 racetrack pelvic fractures died from exsanguination within 1 h of injury (Hill 2003b). Of equal concern is the fact that fracture of the ilial wing and shaft may not displace immediately but can do so in a 'creeping ' manner over following days or weeks with equally catastrophic scenarios. Fractures of the pubis and ischium are less common racing and training injuries. Displaced fractures are rare and so vascular trauma and clinical presentation consequently less dramatic. Crepitus may be appreciated, particularly with fractures involving the acetabulum. If not evident on external palpation or manipulation, it is unlikely to be detected on rectal examination (Rutkowski and Richardson 1989). On the racetrack, all animals with a potential differential diagnosis of pelvic fracture must be managed with caution; in the peracute phase, con dent differentiation of fracture location frequently is not possible. Additionally, a number are complex fractures, some of which may not displace until hours, days or even weeks later (Pilsworth 2003). Horses should be moved carefully on low-loading trailers or boxes to the racecourse clinical facility. Unloading should also be performed cautiously with appropriate sedation and analgesia to maintain control throughout. Animals should be supervised at all times and prevented from lying down. Ultrasonography can offer quick, on site, con dent con rmation of a number of displaced fractures, particularly of the ilial wing. However, in the acute phase, nondisplaced fractures may not be evident, additionally, confusing acoustic shadows can be created by intramuscular vessels (Shepherd and Pilsworth 1994). Images of the ilial shaft should be interpreted with caution but any evidence of osseous discontinuity is of concern. On course ultrasonographic location of fractures usually is the most objective guide to acute case management available. The principal question to be answered is the relative safety of moving or transporting the horse. For emergency evaluation, it is not necessary to clip the horse; adequate contact will be obtained from liberal application of alcohol (Shepherd and Pilsworth 1994). In the absence of osseous discontinuity, hypo- to anechoic zones in the muscle pattern consistent with haemorrhage adjacent to the bone must also be viewed as suspicious (Pilsworth 2003). Sometimes independent movement of the fracture can be seen on limb manipulation during real time ultrasonography (Shepherd and Pilsworth 1994; Pilsworth 2003). In some cases of ilial wing fracture, callus indicative of prodromal pathology may be present before complete fracture and can be identi ed ultrasonographically (Shepherd and Pilsworth 1994). The decision to move horses with fractures or potential fractures of the pelvic girdle from the racecourse is one of the most dif cult decisions that face the racetrack veterinarian.Often, there is considerable pressure for horses to be moved and, in Europe at least, many racecourses do not have facilities or staf ng arrangements suitable for protracted periods of on site stabling. In these situations, the veterinarian has to act as an advocate for the horse 's welfare. Horses with complete fractures of the ilial shaft cannot safely be transported. However, in the acute phase, con dent diagnosis of such frequently cannot be made. Complete fractures of the ilial wing are less likely to be life threatening. All horses with suspected fractures of the pelvic girdle should be preventedfrom lying down by use of cross ties or overhead wires and, atleast for the rst few days, should be maintained under constant supervision. In addition to clinical monitoring,supportive care and nursing will be necessary in order tominimise the risks of pleuropneumonia, overload laminitis etc.Horses should stand on deep conforming bedding. Dryshavings laid over a 7 -10 cm layer of damp shavings or sand is preferred. Water must be present at head height but feed should be offered at ground level with the horse released from its restraining ties and held at not greater than 4 h intervals to promote mucociliary drainage of the respiratory tract.

FOLLOW Review Article A review of the healing processes in equine super cial digital flexor tendinopathy Sciences, Botnar Research Centre, Nufeld Orthopaedic a signi cant cause of morbidity and mortality in athletic and aged horses. These injuries require prolongedconvalescence and heal by the formation of scar tissueinstead of neo-tendon, predisposing to reinjury. This articlereviews the biological processes involved in tendon healingand their implications for clinical practice to improve futuretreatment of these injuries. Introduction Tendon disease affecting the equine distal limb is anotoriously challenging clinical problem. Whilst exercise andageing are important contributing factors to thedevelopment of tendon injury (Smith et al. 1999, 2014; Dudhia et al. 2007), incomplete understanding of the biological processes occurring in disease hampers the development ofeffective new therapies. In flammation and brosis are key biological processes central to the healing of all tissues in the body after injury. Whilst in flammation and brosis have been well studied in animal models of tendinopathy, knowledge of these important biological pathways is limited in equine tendon disease. Inflammation in tendinopathy: where is the evidence? Prior to clinical symptoms, there is a phase of subclinicaltendon pathology (Webbon 1977, 1978). Whilst not wellunderstood, the balance at some stage tips from cumulativemicroscale damage and progresses to macroscale damagemanifesting in clinical disease. At this acute symptomaticstage, horses frequently present with heat, pain and swellingin the region of the palmar metacarpal soft tissues. Lamenesslevels are variable and horses with acute SDFT injuries mayhave a short phase of severe lameness. Hyperextension ofthe metacarpophalangeal joint also occur and correlate withthe severity of tendon pathology. The overt phase of clinicalinflammation is frequently transient, lasting only days to weeks and is managed with limb support, box rest and anti-inflammatory drugs. An update of diagnosis and treatment for equine tendinopathy are discussed in detail elsewhere(Smith 2016). What biological processes are taking place within the tendon at this time and how can this inform therapeuticrationale? A growing body of evidence suggests thatinflammation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of human and equine tendon injury (Millar et al. 2010; Dakin et al.2012b; Campbell et al. 2014; Thorpe et al. 2014). In flammation involves recruitment of cell populations to debride the damaged tissue, orchestrating the repair process and triggering the resolution of in flammation such that the tissue returns to normal after injury (Levy et al. 2001). Studies of diseased equine super cial digital flexor tendons (SDFTs) have demonstrated in flammation is highly active at the cellular level, even after the clinical signs of in flammation including heat, pain and swelling of the tendon have subsided. Histological analysis of tissues from early stage tendinopathy (3-6 weeks after clinical onset) show injured equine SDFTs exhibit signi cant disruption of the tissue architecture and have increased cellularity compared with normal SDFTs (Dakin et al. 2012b) as illustrated in Figure 1 . Characterisation of these cells in diseased tendons has shown an abundance of macrophages in the regions corresponding to core lesions. Analogous to wound healing processes in the skin, the phenotype of these macrophages in damaged equine SDFTs has been shown to change throughout the course of tendon healing. Macrophages in early stage equine tendon disease exhibit a proin to an anti-in flammatory/pro brotic phenotype occurs in the later phases of tendon healing (Dakin et al. 2012b). Other immune cells such as B and T lymphocytes, mast cells and natural killer cells have been reported in samples of ruptured Achilles tendons in man (Kragsnaes et al. 2014). Increased vascularity and the release of stress signals including damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS, Table 1 ) from the damaged tissues facilitate the in ltration of in flammatory cells to the injured site, permitting debridement of the injured zone through the release of proteolytic enzymes. After apoptosis andphagocytosis of dead cells, the reparative and remodellingphases ensue analogous to healing processes in skin. Immunecells such as macrophages are key cell types orchestrating thisprocess. In the tissue remodelling phase, the phenotype ofthese highly plastic cells is more conducive to driving tissuerepair (Lucas et al. 2010). A recent study characterised in flammation in human shoulder tendinopathy illustrating diseased tendons show different in flammation signatures in early compared with advanced stage disease (Dakin et al. 2015). In this study inflammation was characterised using biomarkers representative of macrophage activation for pathways including Interferon, NF- jB, glucocorticoid receptor and STAT- 6 (Martinez and Gordon 2014; Murray et al. 2014) described inTable 1 .I nflammation signatures in shoulder tendons in man revealed expression of genes and proteins induced by Interferon and NF- jB in early stage disease and genes and \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd516 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / induced by STAT-6 and glucocorticoid receptoractivation in advanced stage disease (Dakin et al. 2015). This transition in in flammation activation signature with established disease has striking parallels to tendinopathy in the equineSDFT (Dakin et al. 2012b). Little is known of how tendon in flammation signatures change after treatment. To investigate this, shoulder tendonbiopsies from human patients were studied to investigate ifdifferences in in flammation pathways occurred betweensamples from patients who remained persistently painful 2 - 4 years after surgical treatment compared with those whose symptoms had resolved. Notably, tendon samples from asymptomatic patients after treatment showed signi cantly increased expression of genes associated with tissue repair and resolving in flammation including CD206 and ALOX15 compared with persistently painful patients, suggesting these pathways may moderate tendon pain (Dakin et al. 2015). Inflammation triggers resolution Inflammation stimulates a series of events broadly termed 'resolution 'that promote restoration of the damaged tissue to its normal state (Serhan et al. 1984, 2008; Serhan and Chiang 2002). Studies have shown that in flammation does not simply 'zzle out 'and that resolution is a highly orchestrated and active process that regulates the duration and magnitude of the in flammatory response. A repertoire of proresolving mediators are concerned with the timely resolution of inflammation to prevent prolonged or inappropriate tissue damage (Serhan and Chiang 2002, 2008). These 'stop 'signals for in flammation include limiting further recruitment of inflammatory cells, promoting phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and facilitating egress of in flammatory cells from the injured site (Ortega-Gomez et al. 2013). Mechanisms for sustaining chronic in flammation Chronic in flammation is thought to develop due to dysregulated or inadequate resolution of in flammation (Gilroy et al. 2004; Lawrence and Gilroy 2007). Whilst resolution has been well characterised in experimental rodent models, it isnot well studied in in flammatory musculoskeletal diseases. However, levels of the proresolving protein FPR2/ALX werefound to be increased in samples of early stage equinetendinopathy compared with normal tendons (Dakin et al. 2012b). This observation is further supported in samples fromdiseased shoulder tendons in man, whereby increasedexpression of proresolving proteins occurred in early stagetendon disease (Dakin et al. 2015). Collectively, these studies suggest that diseased equine and human tendons mount aHealthy Subacute Chronic a) b) c) Fig 1: Typical microscopic appearance of healthy and diseased equine super cial digital flexor tendons.

However, activation of these proresolving pathways is not sustained in advanced stage tendon disease. Furthermore, the persistence of inflammatory cells in advanced disease suggests failure of the tendon to return to normal and the development of chronic in flammation. Age is cited as an important factor contributing to the development of tendon injuries (Jarvinen et al. 2005; Dudhia et al. 2007). It is known that the ability of an individual to mount an effective response to in flammation reduces with age, a term coined 'inflamm-ageing '(Franceschi et al. 2000). A reduced ability to respond to in flammation may be a contributing factor in fluencing the reduced ef cacy of tendon repair. A recent study demonstrated an age- associated decline in expression of an in flammation-resolving protein, FRP2/ALX in diseased equine SDFTs (Dakin et al. 2012a). This nding suggests aged horses have a reduced capacity to resolve tendon in flammation, which may present as a potential mechanism for the development of chronic inflammation and reinjury. Resident stromal cells are also known to play a prominent role in the development of chronic in flammation (Buckley et al. 2001; Douglas et al. 2002). However, the inter- relationships between in ltrating in flammatory cells and resident tendon stromal cells are poorly understood. A recentlaboratory tendon-derived stromal mediators. Furthermore, cells isolated from diseased tendons were primed for responding to inflammatory stimuli compared with cells isolated from healthy tendons (Dakin et al. 2015). These ndings suggest that tendon stromal cells are an important niche that may contribute to the development of chronic in flammation. The in flammation- brosis link With time, injured tendons repair and remodel by theformation of scar tissue. Such brotic tissue is signi cantly different to functional and elastic tendon. This is exempli ed by marked differences in the proteomic composition ofdiseased compared with healthy tendons (Dakin et al. 2014b). The quality of the repair scar is inferior in structure andfunction compared with healthy tendon tissue. In vivo limb stiffness has been shown to reduce immediately followingSDFT injury and increase during the convalescent period,approximating that of the contralateral limb by 7 months postinjury (Dakin et al. 2011). The mechanical properties of the repair scar are functionally inferior to healthy tendons. Thetransitional interface between the site of injury and healthytissue is particularly predisposed to recurrent injury due tosegmental change in tendon structural stiffness at the site ofinjury (Crevier-Denoix et al. 1997). Fibrosis is de ned as the hardening or scarring of tissues and is attributed to excess deposition of extracellular matrixcomponents. These include increased production ofproteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans and collagen type 3 , which are associated with matrix disorganisation at the macroscopic and ultrastructural level. Fibrosis is the end result of chronic in flammatory reactions induced by a variety of stimuli including tissue injury (Wynn 2004). Whilst injured tendons show evidence of in flammation and brotic repair, brotic pathways are poorly studied in diseased equine and human tendons. Furthermore, there is a gap in ourknowledge of understanding the in flammation- brosis link and how we might therapeutically exploit this to improve the quality of tendon repair. Studies of in flammation driven brosis in other connective tissues might yield valuable insights into the mechanisms of disease. Chronic in flammation is known to drive brosis in diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary brosis, liver cirrhosis, systemic sclerosis and progressive renal disease, and treatment typically involves targeting the in flammatory response (Wynn 2004). Important regulators of brosis include Th2 cytokines such as IL-13 and factors (VEGF), growth factors (PDGF) and caspases which have been investigated as potential targets of anti- brotic drugs (Wynn 2003, 2004; Li et al. 2006; Parsons et al. 2007). Further studies are required to improve understanding of the mechanisms driving brosis in diseased tendons to inform therapeutic target discovery. Therapeutic rationale: the future of treating tendinopathy Recent work has highlighted the importance of in flammatory and brotic processes in healing tendons. The persistence of chronic in flammation in diseased equine and human tendons suggests in flammation and in flammation-resolving pathways are potential therapeutic targets. Improvedunderstanding of the complexities of in flammatory and brotic processes is pivotal to promote restoration of normal tendon function after injury. Complete in flammatory blockade may be potentially deleterious given thatinflammation has bene cial components and is necessary for the debridement of tissues and recruitment of immunecells to the injured area. In flammation also stimulates resolution, which promotes the restoration of tissuehomeostasis after injury (Serhan et al. 1984). COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to diminish endogenous resolution responses (Gilroyet al. 1999, 2004), which may impair the tissues 'innate ability to heal. Furthermore, prolonged use of NSAIDs isknown to have a deleterious effect on collagen synthesis(Christensen et al. 2011), which is likely to in fluence tendon repair processes. An alternative approach of moderating in flammation, whilst simultaneously potentiating resolution, may havetherapeutic bene t for cases with tendinopathy (Dakin et al. 2014a). Low dose aspirin works via a different mechanism toconventional NSAIDs, resulting in the release of stable aspirintriggered proresolving mediators, which potentiateresolution of in flammation et al. 2000; Morris et al. 2009). Stable isoforms of aspirin have shown ef cacy in chronic in flammatory diseases such as murine models of pulmonary in flammation (Levy et al. 2007) and in the treatment of infantile eczema (Wu et al. 2013). An in vitro model of in flammation using diseased human tendon stromal cells suggests stable isoforms of aspirin may bene cial for resolving tendon in flammation (Dakin et al. 2015). As chronic in flammation is known to drive the formation of scar tissue, preventing its development may also improve the quality of the repair of injured tendon tissue. Whilst in flammation-resolving mediators may hold therapeutic promise, many of these compounds are still in the research development phase and randomised controlled clinical trials are necessary to determine their plasma half-lives and therapeutic potential in vivo. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd518 EQUINE EDUCATION / AE / 2017Conclusions This review summarises the importance of in flammatory and brotic processes in the healing of tendon injuries. Preventing the development of chronic in flammation holds the key to promoting improved repair of tendon tissue. It is prudent totreat with a short course of anti-in flammatory drugs in the acute phase after injury. However, prolonged use of COX-2selective NSAIDs should be avoided in equine cases withtendinopathy. Author 's declarations of interest No con flicts of interest have been declared.

L. Meehan* School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol, Langford, Somerset, UK. *Corresponding author email: lucy.meehan@bristol.ac.uk Summary Introduction and history Solar penetrations are common and potentially lifethreatening. The location, depth and direction of the injuryare important in determining the structures involved. The useof diagnostic imaging is instrumental in diagnosis.Radiography and contrast radiography have been shown tobe useful; however, in recent years the use of magneticresonance imaging (MRI) has been advocated. Search method A population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO)question was constructed. In (horses with foot penetrations)does (MRI imaging) provide additional information comparedto (radiography and contrast radiography) for (treatmentand prognosis)? Searches of CAB abstracts and Medline were performed using the following search terms: (Horse OR horses OR equine) AND (MRI or 'magnetic resonance imaging ') AND (feet OR foot OR hooves OR hoof) AND ( 'solar penetration 'OR streetnail OR OR penetrat* wound OR lesion OR 'wound infection ') (Horse OR horses OR equine) AND (X-ray OR 'x ray 'OR radiogra* OR contrast) AND (feet OR foot OR hooves OR hoof) AND ( 'solar penetration 'OR wound OR lesion OR 'wound infection ') The search results were evaluated by title and abstract for relevance to the PICO question and nine references selected for further evaluation. Quality of evidence The studies included comprised four case series; tworetrospective clinical studies and three review articles. Thereview articles were excluded and six references evaluated. Radiography The use of plain radiographs (Richardson and O 'Brien 1985) and contrast bursography (Smith and Schramme 1992) have been described for investigation of solar penetration in the horse. With plain radiographs, 66% of horses had no evidence of radiographic changes at the time of presentation (mean interval between injury to examination 20 days). At surgery, 50% had abnormalities consistent with navicular bone (NB) osteomyelitis. The use of a metallic probe aided determination of depth and direction of the tract. Repeatradiography of horses without evidence of osteomyelitis revealed evidence of bony lesions in 50% of cases. A total of nine horses had subluxation of the distal interphalangeal joint(DIPJ), correlating with deep digital flexor tendon and ve of 32 horses had 'satisfactory 'outcome in this case series. Three cases were described using contrast bursography and arthrography to identify communication between the penetrating tract and synovial structures (Smith and Schramme 1992). Only one case had demonstrable communication between the navicular bursa and penetrating injury. All three cases evaluated by contrast bursography had lesions associated with the DDFT, which were not visible radiographically; however, these were detected at surgery or post-mortem. All three horses were subjected to euthanasia. Magnetic resonance imaging There have been two previous case series which havedescribed the use of low eld standing MRI in identifying penetrating injuries to the foot. Kinns and Mair (2005) describedthree cases that were imaged 48 h to 6 weeks after initialinjury. All cases had radiography and contrast bursographyperformed prior to MRI and were negative for synovial sepsis.All cases had DDFT pathology con rmed on MRI. One case was imaged at 48 h post-injury, at which time the tract wasidenti ed, but no DDFT lesion was apparent; however, repeat MRI 2 weeks later showed a lesion. A further case seriesreported the MRI ndings in two horses with chronic forelimb lameness (Boado et al. 2005). A penetrating tract and a lesion within the DDFT were identi ed on high eld MRI examination in both horses. A larger scale retrospective study (del Junco et al. 2012) evaluated the imaging ndings in 55 horses that underwent standing low- eld MRI examination following solar penetration. A total of 14 of these horses had radiographicabnormalities, the nature of which is not described. A clearsignal void tract corresponding to the penetrating injury wasseen in 35/55 horses. In total, 37 of the 55 cases had DDFTdamage. No information is given regarding the presence orabsence of synovial sepsis and whether this could bedetected on MRI examination. A poor correlation betweenMRI ndings and surgical ndings was described. A further large retrospective study evaluated the outcome for horses with solar penetration wounds thatunderwent surgery for synovial sepsis (Findley et al. 2014). These authors stated that the majority of horses sustained injuries to three structures, most commonly DDFT, DIPJ and NB. It was not stated how the DDFT injuries were con rmed and only 31 horses in this study underwent MRI; the ndings of the MRI examination are not described. Similarly, radiographywas used to 'aid diagnosis 'in 73 cases, but details of examination are not available. The presence or absence of abnormalities on imaging studies is not used in the regression models to describe outcome. Involvement of the distal \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd521 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / 2017phalanx was associated with increased risk of euthanasiaduring hospitalisation. Clinical implications Synovial sepsis, injury to the DDFT and osseous damagecommonly occur in cases of solar penetration. Radiographyand contrast techniques are useful in assessing synovialinvolvement, tract direction and depth and identi cation of overt osseous injury, but soft tissue injuries cannot be assessed.A high proportion of the described cases in all publishedreports had lesions in the DDFT. Soft tissue injuries and earlychanges in bone can be assessed on MRI as well asassessment of the depth and direction of the tract. It shouldbe borne in mind that false negatives for tendon damagehave been reported in the rst 48 h post-injury and repeat MRI may be necessary to identify tendon lesions. Conclusions Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in assessment of tractdirection and depth and assessment of soft tissue injurieswithin the hoof capsule in association with penetrating solarinjuries. A combined approach using MRI to assess the tractand radiography and synoviocentesis, if necessary, appearslikely to assist with prognosticating. Early detection of tendondisease and osseous injury using MRI may allow clinicians to prognosticate more effectively; however, further studies are required to evaluate the usefulness of the information gained by MRI in assessing injuries of this type.

O 'Brien Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Lane, Hat eld, Hertfordshire, UK. Corresponding author email: eobrien@rvc.ac.uk Summary Clinical scenario During a lameness investigation, the horse becomes soundafter a palmar digital nerve block is performed on theaffected limb. Could any structures, in addition to those ofthe heel, be contributing to the lameness in this case? Search strategy The PubMed database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) was searched using the string 'horse AND ((palmar digital nerve) OR (palmar digital nerves)) '. Proceedings of the Annual Convention of the American Association of Equine Practitioners were searched using the International Veterinary Information Service database (http://www.ivis.org/search.asp) and the strings 'palmar digital nerve aaep 'and 'palmar digital nerves aaep '. Thirdly, the journal Equine Veterinary Education was searched using the Wiley online library (http:// onlinelibrary.wiley.com/) and the string 'palmar digital nerve '. An additional study that the author was aware of was also included (Dyson and Murray 2007). Results were screened rst by title and second by abstract. Where similar reports by the same authors were available as conference proceedings and journal articles, the former were excluded. Similarly, smaller case series were excluded where data collected over a longer period (same start time) by the same authors were also available. Review articles were excluded. Results Quantity of evidence A total of three journal articles (Schumacher et al. 2000, 2004; Nagy and Malton 2015) and four conference proceedingswere identi ed (Ross 1998; Easter et al. 2000; Dyson and Murray 2007; Contino et al. 2012). Quality of evidence Experimental studiesSchumacher et al. (2000) demonstrated that palmar digital nerve blocks (PDNBs; 2 ml local anaesthetic each medial and lateral site) could improve lameness arising from solar pain. These authors used set screws, tted to the inside of customised shoes, to apply pressure to the solar surface just dorsal to the apex of the frog to induce lameness. Median lameness scores were signi cantly improved after PNDBs were performed just proximal to the edge of the heel cartilage. Easter et al. (2000) (3 ml LA each site) and Schumacher et al. (2004) (1.5 ml LA each site) showed that PDNBs could ameliorate pain arising from the distal interphalangeal (DIP) proximal interphalangeal (PIP)joints, respectively. endotoxin to induce lameness and intra-articular analgesia was performed at the end of data collection to con rm that the pain arose from the treated joints. Strengths of these three studies included the use of blinded lameness assessors. In the PIP joint study (Schumacher et al. 2004), PDNBs were performed separately 1, 2 and 3 cm above the heel cartilage. The effects of local anaesthetic were allowed to dissipate between each block. Median lameness scores were signi cantly improved for the higher two levels only but 1/6 horses improved substantially to blocking at the 1 cm level. In the study by Easter et al. (2000) the PDNB was performed just proximal to the heel bulb and a signi cant improvement in median lameness scores resulted. In the fourth study, Nagy and Malton (2015) compared distribution of radiographic contrast medium (contrast) injected in the fashion of a PDNB using two injection volumes (1.5 or 2.5 ml) at the heel cartilage or 2 cm proximal in live horses. The animals were examined after 0, 10 and 20 min. These authors showed that signi cantly more proximal spread occurred when the larger volume was used at the distal but not proximal site. Signi cantly greater contrast diffusion occurred with time. Limitations of this study include that the spread and uptake of contrast may not be the same as commonly used local anaesthetic agents. Case series Contino et al. (2012) reported a series of 15 horses in which lameness was improved by at least 90% by a PDNB ( 2.5 ml LA each site) and that underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the front feet. The most signi cant MRI nding in these cases was a metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint lesion and lameness in these animals subsequently improved with intra-articular analgesia of the MCP joint. Limitations of this study are that the level at which the PDNBs was performed was not speci ed, nor was the approach for intra-articular analgesia speci ed (e.g. dorsal or palmar). In a group of horses which were diagnosed with 'primary [sic] 'injuries of a collateral ligament of the DIP joint based on ultrasonography or MRI, lameness improved by 50% in 45/101 cases and 36/101 were sound (Dyson and Murray 2007). Limitations of this observational study include that it cannot be known with certainty that the pain was arising from the collateral ligament. Ross (1998) reported a series of 164 horses in which lameness was localised by PDNB and diagnosis reached by a combination of clinical, scintigraphic and radiographic examination. These diagnoses included proximal phalanx fracture and PIP, third phalanx and DIP pathology. This reportlacked detail on how the PDNBs were performed. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd523 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / SEPTEMBER 2017Discussion Can this evidence be applied to the clinical scenario?Lameness that improves with a PDNB can arise from sitesother than the heel. The experimental evidence indicatesthat a PDNB can ameliorate lameness arising from the DIPjoint and the sole. The clinical evidence strongly suggests thatthis block can improve lameness arising from the fetlock jointand likely can improve lameness arising from structures distalto the fetlock also. It is probable that using larger volumes ofLA, placing needles at greater distances proximal to thecollateral heel cartilage and allowing more time to elapsebetween blocking and assessment, all increase the likelihoodof desensitising structures above the foot.
