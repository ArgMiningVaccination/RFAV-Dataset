We will begin scheduling these clinics within the next few days, at which point individuals will be sent an email invitation to register for their 2nd appointment. If you were vaccinated February 10th, you will receive an invite for our March 10th clinic. If you were vaccinated on February 17th, you will receive an invite for our March 17th clinic. Please note: At this time we do not expect any additional vaccine shipments except for those allocated to the Wayland Housing Authority. Friday, February 24 - Those who are scheduled to receive their second dose with the town may receive an automated email message from the vaccine registration system to schedule their 2nd appointment. You should not use the link in that email to schedule an appointment. Please note that we are planning to provide your second dose and once we receive the vaccine we will be reaching out to notify you to register for your appointment that will coincide with a date we had previously provided and will provide a new link for you. Effective March 1st, the Wayland Health Department will no longer be provided with 1st doses of vaccine from the State. Because of this we will be temporarily suspending the sign up to the waiting list for an appointment. Please understand that we are greatly discouraged with this situation as we want to continue to provide vaccinations and are advocating for vaccine supplies, as well as exploring other options to deploy vaccination clinics. If we receive vaccine supply we will re-open the sign up for a waiting list on the town website. Until then, we urge you to seek vaccination elsewhere if you are in a currently eligible population. The closest of these MassVax sites has opened at the Natick Mall; appointments can be scheduled thru the following link: [https://www.maimmunizations.org](https://www.maimmunizations.org) please read the full press release [here for more details](https://www.wayland.ma.us/sites/g/files/vyhlif9231/f/uploads/vaccine_update_2.19.21.pdf) See the Map of the State's Phase Vaccine Locations: [https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-vaccine-locations-for-individuals-in-phase-1](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-vaccine-locations-for-individuals-in-phase-1) Individuals will need to provide proof of their eligibility at the site.

Like other towns in our region, please know that the Town of Wayland is completing all the necessary actions to obtain and distribute the vaccine to Wayland residents. At this time there is a very limited supply of vaccine available and we do not know when this will change. As of January 25, 2021, the state has advised municipalities similar to Wayland to expect approximately 100 doses of vaccine per week. The Town has requested its first round of 100 doses. [state's phased vaccination rollout plan](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/when-can-i-get-the-covid-19-vaccine). The Town Clinic may begin as early as next week at which point we will begin vaccinating eligible populations already identified by the Town and staff that will be designated as vaccinators. Please continue to check the Town and State websites, which are updated regularly. Clinic information will be posted on this page which will include dates and times they will be held, location(s) and information on how to register. We urge everyone to continue being patient, if you feel your need for a vaccine is urgent, you should contact your primary care physician's office or follow the link below to the State's PrepMod page to find a clinic that has availability near you.

Getting the vaccine is a good thing, but it does not mean that we can let our guard down and stop these important COVID-19 mitigation practices. |Attachment||Size| | | "}
