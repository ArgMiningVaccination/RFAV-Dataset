I am a Naturopathic Doctor (ND) who provides in-person and telehealth visits for patients seeking a holistic approach to their health. I offer traditional naturopathic approaches with a strong focus on homeopathic medicine. What is Naturopathic Medicine? [Naturopathic medicine](https://aanmc.org/naturopathic-medicine/) is a distinct medical profession that combines evidence-based medicine with traditional therapies such as herbalism, [homeopathy](https://naturemed.org/what-is-homeopathy/#:~:text=The%20naturopathic%20profession%20has%20a,of%20homeopathy%20among%20naturopathic%20physicians.), and other natural substances. Naturopathic doctors diagnose and treat illness by addressing the underlying causes of disease. This often involves nutrition, detoxification, counseling, and body function optimization. I provide a holistic, individualized evaluation of your symptoms and their potential causes. This is followed by a treatment plan that aims to rapidly restore your health and increase your resilience to illness.

Homeopathy refers to both a system and type of medicine. As a system, it dictates a specific approach to treatment, while \"homeopathic medicine\" refers to unique [preparations](https://www.wholehealthnow.com/homeopathy_info/hahnemann_labs_preparation.html) of natural substances. Someone who practices homeopathy is called a homeopath. A homeopath prescribes homeopathic medicines. There are thousands of different homeopathic medicines. However, some are used more often than others because they address symptoms common in many people. Dr. Pistoia evaluated and successfully treated me for a stubborn gallbladder condition that had stumped another doctor and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. He's a highly analytical thinker with an incisive mind and an ability to synthesize symptoms into a cohesive picture of a person's health. I've been struggling with digestive issues for over a year now and worked with many doctors to figure it out. Dr. Pistoia helped get to the root of the problem and genuinely cared about what I was going through. After the first visit he helped me to understand why my body was doing [. . .]. Within 2 weeks my symptoms were gone. I cannot remember the last time a doctor was interested in listening to my story and was able to instinctively assess the correct homeopathic medicine that alleviated my symptoms. I highly recommend Dr. Pistoia to anyone ready to have their maladies treated with true holistic care. About Me My mission is to provide you with the education and care you need to rapidly restore your health and improve your resilience to illness. I've been studying health since childhood and have always been curious about the human body and life in general. Nature, psychology, and physiology topics in particular have always interested me. Fortunately, I was introduced to the importance of exercise and nutritious eating early in life due to my father's weight loss goals. I took to cooking and exercise rather easily, but I was also introduced to illness early on, as I struggled with skin problems, IBS, and frequent infections.
