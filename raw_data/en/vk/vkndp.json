I provide emergency medical services, do I request PPE through DPH or MEMA? Either. Private/non-fire-based EMS generally will request PPE through DPH and Fire Departments with EMS included in their department will generally request through MEMA. A request will be processed regardless of where it is submitted. DPH and MEMA are coordinating on requests. If an entity submits a request through both DPH and MEMA those requests will be merged. If DPH cannot fill my request, should I submit a request through MEMA? No. DPH and MEMA coordinate to fill requests for PPE. If a request is made through MEMA for a supply that they do not have on hand, they will coordinate with DPH to try to fill the request. Comparably, if a request is made through DPH for a supply that they do not have on hand, they will coordinate with MEMA to try to fill the request. How will I know if my request is going to be filled? - All requests will be acknowledged within 48 hours. - Requestors will be asked if they have attempted to place an order through 1 or more of their procurement vendors. Some vendors are starting to deliver supplies.
