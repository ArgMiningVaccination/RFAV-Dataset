That comes to about $100 a year for every man, woman and child for substances that are often of questionable value.\" The article compares supplements and vitamins to placebos and mentions major studies that confirm the same. The fact that millions of Americans are willing to consume a product that brings no benefit, except profit to the makers of the supplements, could be a sign that people are desperate for ways to promote their health. Christian Science has a better way. Mary Baker Eddy, the discoverer of Christian Science wrote, \"The time for thinkers has come\" [Science and Health, p. vii](http://www.christianscience.com/the-christian-science-pastor/science-and-health/contents-preface?citation=SH%20vii:13-vii:21). As Jesus Christ demonstrated beyond cavil, true health is spiritual. It comes directly from God and is found through prayer and spiritual understanding. Yes, as humans, we need to eat and live responsibly, but the wisest human actions are always guided by direction coming from the one Mind of God that knows best. \"Know the truth, and the truth will set you free\" [John 8:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A32&version=NLT), Jesus instructed to those looking for health. Spiritual truth is the most effective \"vitamin\" available. Spiritual love coming from God is stronger than any supplement from a store to bring enduring calm, peace, and harmony. What you gain from God stays with you forever. There are no ups and downs or material maintenance programs necessary to keep the peace and calm that comes from knowing God's love and care for you. You won't need to reach for a bottle of placebos any longer to assure yourself that you have health. You will find it within, within what you already have from God and is spiritually yours forever. "}
