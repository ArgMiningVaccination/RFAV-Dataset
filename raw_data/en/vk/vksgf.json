By learning to look carefully. Enlivening our observation skills allows us to see consistent behavioral patterns and dynamics that show up in children's movement, learning, sensing, and memory. Within those activities we can learn to see archetypal pathways of development. Watching the way a child moves, listens, eats, or sleeps offers us insights into a child's experience of the world. Those gestures help tell the child's story. We learn to think in living processes, not checklists. Constitutional, or fundamental, polarities\u2014as introduced by Rudolf Steiner\u2014allow for individualized, therapeutic approaches to challenges such as aggressive behaviors, attention problems, anxiety, autistic behaviors, and depression. Teachers, counselors, and medical doctors will find tools here for enriching their work with children. These constitutional pictures are accompanied by diverse therapeutic indications that will encourage children to unfold new growth and maturation, from the inside out.
