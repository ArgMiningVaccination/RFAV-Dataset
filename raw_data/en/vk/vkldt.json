With a concentration on whole-patient wellness; the medicine is tailored to the person and emphasizes prevention and self-care. Naturopathic medicine attempts to find the underlying cause of the person's condition rather than focusing solely on symptomatic approach. Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) cooperate with all other branches of medical science referring patients to other practitioners for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate. Our Approach to Health - The concept, \"Let your food be your medicine and medicine your food\" has been the foundation of naturopathic medicine for hundreds of years. A growing body of scientific knowledge in this area is reflected in numerous professional journals of nutrition and dietary sciences, supporting the naturopathic approach to diet and nutrition. Many medical conditions can be improved as effectively with foods and nutritional supplements as they can by any other means, but with fewer complications and side effects. - With the ever mounting pressures of life, it is evident that mental attitudes and emotional states are important, and often overlooked, aspects of healing and disease. Naturopathic Physicians are trained in various psychological techniques, including counseling, nutritional balancing, and stress management. - Children and adults are now, and for many generations, being exposed to greater quantities of chemicals in the environment and food supply. These chemicals interact synergistically to increase their negative effects. Naturopathic testing, detoxification and immune restoration protocols provide invaluable support to the body's overtaxed systems. - The use of plant medicine is core to naturopathic medicine. Botanical medicines have been shown to be effective in addressing a wide variety of ailments. A resurgence of scientific research in Europe and Asia is demonstrating that some plant substances are superior to synthetic drugs in clinical situations. - This natural health system, developed by Samuel Hahnemann in the 1840s, continues to evolve. And while it's mechanism of action can be difficult to understand, this extremely safe form of medicine can provide positive results in many conditions for which conventional medicine has no treatment. This is a favorite of Dr. Asbill's for addressing night terrors in children. - Through the use of hot and cold compresses we can increase or decrease the flow of blood to any part of the body. Using scientifically applied principles, we can use this tool to help boost the immune system, improve circulation, and detoxify the body of unwanted waste. This is one of the oldest and most effective ways to support overall health and vitality. See the Constitutional Hydrotherapy page for more information. Our goal is to restore health by supporting the body and it's innate wisdom to heal itself. This includes supplementing nutrients that are found to be deficient, cleansing the body of harmful substances, correcting imbalances, and improving the systems of elimination. Every person is unique and thus a different approach is commonly utilized even for people with the same condition. The core modalities used by Naturopathic Physicians at Elixir are listed to the right. What to expect. Your practitioner will listen, perform a comprehensive intake about your concerns and history followed by a physical exam. Care is a partnership and thus the plan of action to address your concerns will be a shared decision making process. Your treatment plan will be discussed and next steps laid out. The Philosophy Naturopathic doctors (NDs) are primary care physicians clinically trained in natural therapeutics, in the states where they are licensed, and whose philosophy is derived in part from a Hippocratic teaching more than 2000 years old: Vis mediatrix naturae - nature is the healer of all diseases. Their practice is based on the same basic bio-medical science foundation that an allopathic practice is; however, their philosophies and approaches differ considerably from their conventional counterparts. Naturopathic doctors are trained to diagnose disease and treat patients by using natural modalities such as clinical nutrition, herbal medicine, homeopathy, counseling, physical manipulation, and hydrotherapy, among others. NDs are also well trained in conventional treatments, such as antibiotics and hormone replacement therapy, and utilize these when appropriate. Treatment is based on the individual patient, not on the generality of symptoms. This approach has proven successful in treating both chronic and acute conditions. The six principles that guide the therapeutic methods and modalities of Naturopathic medicine include: - Naturopathic medicine uses therapies that are safe and effective. A gentle approach is the best approach in most cases. - The human body possesses the inherent ability to restore health. The doctor's role is to facilitate this process with the aid of natural, non-toxic therapies that work in harmony with the body. - NDs seek out the underlying cause of a disease and do not simply suppress symptoms. Only rare circumstances call for a suppressive approach. Symptoms are viewed as expressions of the body's natural attempt to heal, or the language of the body. Naturopathic doctors are trained to speak this language and restore the body back to a state of health and balance. - Health, along with disease, is a balance of many different factors. Often people will need to be approached on multiple levels to achieve true and lasting health. - For thousands of years doctor's have had the responsibility to educate their patients and encourage them to take an active role in their health. An empowered, knowledgeable patient who takes responsibility of their health can achieve many wonderful things. - Naturopathic doctors are preventive medicine specialists. NDs are specially trained to assess patient risk factors and have the tools and knowledge needed to reduce risk and prevent illness. Education and a healthy lifestyle are two of the best ways to prevent disease and enjoy life. Naturopathic Physicians Through four years of postgraduate study and clinical training, Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) are able to combine the knowledge of conventional family practice doctors, herbalists, homeopaths, and nutritionists in one. NDs receive unique training that allows them to view health and disease from an entirely different perspective than conventional medicine. This perspective combined with extensive knowledge of the human body allow for the doctor's approach to be tailored to you, the individual. "}
