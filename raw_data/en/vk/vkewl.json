We are still not seeing patients with respiratory illness in the office unless they have a negative COVID test. If you have a respiratory illness, you can come to the office and a nurse can test you for COVID and Flu while you remain in your vehicle. If you are negative for both then you can be seen in the office with a mask on. If you are positive for either then we provide a telehealth appointment while you are in your vehicle. We do not offer COVID vaccinations in the office at this time. We are now offering telehealth appointments through secure HIPPA-compliant video chat. This service is available to most patients under their insurance. Copays and deductibles do apply. If you have regular Medicare you may be eligible under new rules just put in place.

Here at Bradenton East Integrative Medicine we advocate a community protected from vaccine-preventable diseases by supporting immunization best practices. By supporting best practices, we make sure that the immunization schedule provides the greatest amount of protection in the safest way. It is our responsibility as healthcare providers to do all we can to protect all parts of the population, from the youngest of us to the elderly and immune compromised by supporting prevention in public health. While we acknowledge concerns about vaccination and are open to conversations on the subject, given diseases like measles and polio still exist, we feel it is very important that all patients are up-to-date on their vaccinations. We believe all patients, regardless of their immunization status, should have access to healthcare and will continue to care for the unvaccinated. We do however, reserve the right to engage all patients in conversation on the importance of vaccinations for their individual health and the potential impact that these preventable diseases can have on the community.
