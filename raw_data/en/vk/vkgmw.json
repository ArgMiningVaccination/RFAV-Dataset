Hemorrhoid Energy Therapy (HET) is a simple, gentle, minimally non-invasive, yet effective non-surgical treatment option that eliminates mild to moderate internal hemorrhoids without pain. The treatment applies gentle hemorrhoid tissue compression and low-grade heat energy to the hemorrhoids\u2014thus reducing the blood flow to the hemorrhoids and significantly shrinking their size. Why You Should Consider HET - The treatment takes just a few minutes to perform, and can be done during a screening colonoscopy or on its own. - Most patients can resume their normal routines the same day following the procedure or the next day. - The HET treatment is virtually painless; the only discomfort being gentle pressure related to the instrument placement in the rectal vault. - The HET treatment is very effective for grade 1 and 2 internal hemorrhoids and very helpful for grade 3 lesions. Patients with grade 4 internal hemorrhoids that cannot be reduced are not candidates for the HET procedure. - Most patients undergo the HET treatment only one time for it to be completely effective. - Soon after treatment, patients experience a prompt reduction in the size of their hemorrhoids and steady improvement in their symptoms over the next several days.
