Dear Friends, It has been another landmark year for the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Maryland. Continuing with our long history of excellence in engineering education, the department's Center for Risk and Reliability celebrated its 25th anniversary of reliability engineering education and research. T wenty-five years ago, the University of Maryland (UMD) established the first degree-granting reliability engineering education program in the country, and today it is one of the largest and most comprehensive degree-granting graduate programs in the field of reliability and risk analysis of engineered systems and processes. This year also marks 50 years since we awarded our first Ph.D. degree. Supporting the Evolution of Mechanical EngineeringMechanical engineering continues to be an ever-evolving discipline, and as we look to the future, we see a greater collective impact from our work in engineering across people's lives, and across the globe. Engineering is becoming more inter-disciplinary, and as you will see in this issue's research highlights, we are making impacts across fields ranging from robotics to health and health care systems, risk and reliability engineering to energy systems, and sustainable energy and infrastructure to electronics and manufacturing. Together, our faculty, researchers and students are addressing challenging issues in brain injury mechanics, health care diagnostics and patient care, energy efficiency, energy storage, electronics and even bee health. We continue to enhance the learning experience for our students through expanded education programs, experiential and hands-on learning, unique research opportunities and top-notch academics. Faculty and Staff Notables Over the past year, our faculty members were recognized for their outstanding research, academic work and achievements. President Barack Obama named Associate Professor Sarah Bergbreiter a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, an honor previously received by only three other faculty members at the university. The University of Maryland recognized George E. Dieter Professor Michael Pecht, director of the Center for Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) with the university's inaugural Corporate Connector Award for his role in engaging the private sector and making CALCE the world's largest consortium in electronic parts reliability engineering, accelerated testing and supply chain management. Professor Avram Bar-Cohen received both the American Society of Mechanical Engineer's (ASME) 75th Anniversary Medal and the 2014 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology Award.

Their work is making a significant impact in traditional industries and the highly dynamic areas of healthcare and energy. Emergency Preparedness, Patient Care and T ackling Medical Challenges When you think of treating chronic diseases or creating revolutionary medical devices, mechanical engineering might not be the first field to come to mind. Think again. Researchers are applying basic and advanced mechanical engineering principles to improve emergency preparedness efforts, help patients better manage their own care and address one of today's most complex medical challenges\u2014the prevention and treatment of traumatic brain injury. Although the opportunities to reduce the likelihood of a terrorist attack are limited, steps can be taken to reduce the consequences. Associate Professor Jeffrey Herrmann is drawing on his background in operations research and industrial engineering to improve emergency planning. \"Some years ago, we began a collaboration with Montgomery County, Maryland, to develop mathematical models that could be used by emergency preparedness planners to design points of dispensing (POD) for distributing medications or vaccinations during a public health emergency, such as an outbreak of smallpox or anthrax,\" says Herrmann. His models were based on queuing theory, and the software he developed has been used by public health agencies nationwide. \"In the H1N1 flu epidemic a few years ago, this software was useful in planning the vaccination clinics,\" relates Herrmann, who has presented his research before the Institute of Medicine on issues surrounding the \"stockpiling\" of antibiotics by agencies and individuals. Herrmann is now collaborating with UMD Marketing Professor William Rand to analyze T witter data collected during Superstorm Sandy and Hurricane Irene as part of a study on the diffusion of information during emergencies. \"If we can predict how fast people react to information, then we can better predict demand for vaccinations and medications,\" adds Herrmann. For individuals who suffer from chronic diseases such as diabetes and frequently must administer their own medication and monitor their conditions, Professor Monifa Vaughn-Cooke is exploring design options to make the required medical devices easier to use. \"Many devices, such as glucose meters (glucometers) and blood pressure monitors, are designed without thinking of the end users, who often have vision, mobility and other impairments and are often part of high-risk demographic subgroups,\" says Vaughn-Cooke, who recently testified at a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hearing on the importance of including such groups in usability testing for medical devices. In work funded by the Maryland Center for Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation and the FDA, Vaughn-Cooke is drawing on her expertise in human factors engineering to determine how data taken by diabetic patients through blood pressure monitors and glucometers could be directly integrated into their personal health records. \"If we can integrate biometric information and reduce the collection of data to one device, we could help patients better adhere to doctor's orders,\" she adds. Her work with students was recognized with a first place win in the 2013 American Public Health Association's (APHA) Codeathon, a student competition for projects that could assist in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The UMD team's winning entry was ACA Benefits Buddy, an easy-to-use application that connects users with basic information on preventative health benefits. fEature STORY FROM LEFT TO RIGHT: UMD TEAM MEMBERS AND GRADUATE STUDENTS LUIS SANTOS AND MAIA NAFTALI, STEPHEN CLARKE, MARION COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND CHRIS GUDAS, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.A. JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING . UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND3 fEature STORY Improving Blood Pressure Diagnostic Tools and Drug Delivery Systems for Critical Care Patients Blood pressure measurements are an important indicator of an individual's cardiovascular health; however, most traditional blood pressure assessment tools do not always provide accurate or reliable readings. Assistant Professor Dr. Jin-Oh Hahn, an expert in biosystems and healthcare, is tackling two projects to improve non-invasive, blood pressure diagnostic capabilities. Hahn is working on one project that aims to improve the accuracy of existing blood pressure tools, like the blood pressure cuff in your doctor's office, by creating algorithms that will improve blood pressure readings by using aortic blood pressure (BP). Pressure readings taken closer to the heart, aortic BP and flow, rather than BP taken on the arm, provide a better picture of a patient's cardiovascular health. Currently, aortic BP measurements with a high degree of accuracy can only be taken through invasive aortic catheterization. Hahn's work uses aortic BP data to create algorithms that will improve readings taken peripherally on the arm and provide a more accurate estimate of a patient's cardiovascular health. This improved signal-processing algorithm could be implemented into existing blood pressure tools and monitors\u2014much like a software update\u2014without the need to completely re-design the blood pressure tool itself, providing an easier and more cost effective healthcare upgrade to implement. Hahn's second project is to develop a cuffless blood pressure diagnostic model that would use pulse wave velocity\u2014the time it takes blood to travel from the heart out through the arterial tree. This research could lead to a compact alternative to the BP cuff and provide a low-cost, high throughput and continuous blood pressure monitoring tool for independent healthy living. Hahn is also working with Assistant Professor of Surgery Andrew Reisner in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital to improve drug delivery systems for patients. Individual responses to medications are highly variable. These responses can be subtle, yet highly detrimental to the patient if they are not quickly noticed and accounted for in the administration of the drug. Hahn and Reisner are working to develop a better system for drug administration that would use a patient's biofeedback information, such as blood pressure, respiration and pulse, to (continued on page 4) Robots to the Rescue In the not-so-distant future, a different type of technology - robots - may play an even greater role in patient care. \"To take robots to the next level in patient care, they need to respond to touch and physically communicate in ways similar to human touch interactions,\" explains Professor Elisabeth Smela. Together with Professor Hugh Bruck and Associate Professor Miao Yu, Smela is now working on a project to develop sensory abilities in robots, which will allow them to better respond to patient needs such as moving them in and out of bed. Through \"Compliant Multifunctional Robotic Structures for Safety and Communication by Touch,\" a three-year, $600,000 NSF-funded grant that is part of the National Robotics Initiative, they will develop a sensory system for robots similar to the human nervous system using deformation sensitive polymers. The sensing skin will be integrated onto compliant, padded robot structures and will be able to detect the distribution of applied forces. It will contribute to new bio-inspired control principles for training robots. \"If robots can distinguish humans from other objects in their environment, it will significantly advance robotic safety and decision-making and create possibilities for new multifunctional robots in critical fields such as healthcare,\" adds Yu, who has obtained three patents in the area of fiber optic sensors. Her work has been recognized with an NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award and a Young Investigator Research Program Award from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. She was previously recognized by the UMD Office of Technology Commercialization for developing a fly ear-inspired miniature acoustic sensor system that mimicked a fly's highly accurate directional hearing. Associate Professor Sarah Bergbreiter, Mechanical Engineering and Institute for Systems Research, along with Associate Professor Teng Li, is also receiving funding as part of the National Robotics Initiative. Her work on \"Active Skins for Simplified Tactile Feedback in Robotics\" was among eight robotics projects funded by NASA to support future missions in space. Her focus is on the fabrication process, modeling and algorithm design for sensors that will allow robots to more easily acquire and interpret tactile data. Learn more about Bergbreiter's NSF funded robotics research. With over a quarter of the U.S. population suffering from some form of cardiovascular disease, Hahn's vision is to extend his blood pressure work into improved screening tools for cardiovascular disease. 4 METRICS N EWSLETTER .2014 fEature STORY automatically adjust the drug delivery based on those changes, which is important for patients in critical care. In particular, Hahn is looking at vasopressors, drugs used to raise blood pressure in patients with poor circulation, such as those with spinal cord injuries or extreme low blood pressure. He has created a new analytic tool to improve the administration of vasopressors by using changes in blood pressure to evaluate underlying cardiovascular factors to automatically adjust drug administration. This could lead to automated control of vasopressor therapy and improved patient care outcomes. New Fabrication T echniques for Liposomal Drugs Liposomal drugs are a critical piece in treating a wide range of cancers. Liposomes are tiny, versatile nanoscale capsules that can deliver high concentrations of drugs in very selective ways, and reduces the degree of toxicity when compared to delivering the drug alone. They are particularly effective in cancer drugs and treatments because they are biocompatible and can used to deliver drugs directly to cancerous tumors and other diseased cells or tissue. Currently, liposomal drug production involves complex, multi-stage processes that take almost a week to complete. The complexity of the process has resulted in poor drug reliability and frequent drug shortages. In recent years, highly effective liposomal cancer drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae, were forced off the market due to issues in manufacturing reliability and the high cost of production. These drug shortages adversely affect cancer patients\u2014causing further spread of their disease, to experience relapses or develop complications from changes in their drug treatments. Professor Don DeVoe, along with Renee Hood (Bioengineering, Ph.D. '14) and collaborators Javier Atencia, Wyatt Vreeland and Donna Omiatek at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, has developed a new and more reliable system for synthesizing liposomes that could reduce the time it takes to produce critical drugs and increase the reliability of the product. The team's new liposome generator is a 3D microfluidic device that consists of a 3-millimeter-diameter glass cylinder containing a bundle of seven tiny glass capillary tubes\u2014each about the diameter of a pinhead\u2014with one in the center and six surrounding it. A microsized plastic capillary (about 500 micrometers in diameter or the length of an amoeba) is fed through the center tube and extended just beyond the end of the capillary bundle. A water-based solution (known as PBS) flows through the outer six capillaries while the center channel carries the phospholipid dissolved in alcohol (in production, the PBS would carry a drug or other cargo for the vesicles). A standard glass pipette attached to the end of the microfluidic device improves mixing by concentrating the ratio of water to lipid/alcohol. \"The capillary-based device in this study overcomes multiple shortcomings of bulk-scale production, including size variability and process reliability, while reducing production costs. This is significant because size and size variability are imperative factors for drug delivery and dosing,\" Hood says. \"The 3D microfluidic device we have developed generates distinctly-sized liposomes at a rate which is four orders of magnitude faster than previous 2D devices and can be assembled from commercially available materials which require no expensive laboratory infrastructure or equipment.\" \"When combined with other microfluidic technologies developed by our team, this system can generate the next generation cancer-targeting liposomal drugs in only 15 minutes using a single chip, unlike conventional methods that require a week using multiple reaction vessels,\" says DeVoe, who directs the Maryland MEMS and Microfluidics Lab. The team's device will improve the liposomal nanomedicine manufacturing process by enabling precise control over nanoparticle size, decreasing production time and improving reliability. This would increase the availability of critical cancer drugs while enabling the development of a new class of size-optimized liposomal drugs and greatly improve patient care and outcomes.

Kiger and Fischell have applied for a patent for the device and have submitted a proposal for additional funding to the National Football League and GE-sponsored Head Health Challenge, which supports projects designed to improve the safety of athletes and military members. Building an Energy-efficient and Resilient Future With national and regional renewable energy goals in mind, researchers are pursuing a host of initiatives to reduce energy consumption and create viable energy alternatives. \"Because the footprint of mechanical engineering decisions is seen on a global scale, we are working more closely with meteorologists, climate scientists, social scientists and policymakers to make a difference,\" explains Professor Jelena Srebric, who is an Elected International Fellow of the Serbian National Academy of Engineering. Her recent work has focused on analyzing and reducing energy consumption in the building environment. In a four-year study funded by the NSF , Srebric and colleagues assessed the interaction between building design and energy management on the campuses of Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Pennsylvania State University. \"Our findings demonstrated the difficulty of collecting good data on building energy performance,\" says Srebric, who noted that information, such as peak use and energy demands by various tenants in multi-use buildings, is difficult to track. This year, she is working with students to collect, analyze and compare data for different buildings on the UMD campus. Another research proposal currently under review, \"Community Infrastructure for T ransformation of Urban EcosYstems through Anticipatory and Adaptive Energy-PopulatioN Interactions (CITY-EN),\" would pair Srebric with colleagues on multidisciplinary teams to study urban energy consumption in four East Coast cities: Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. \"We will look at the socioeconomic, public health, climate, policy, and building energy and power system aspects of the urban energy sustainability challenge,\" explains Srebric. who is leading the department's efforts to create a graduate certificate and a new master's degree in sustainability. (continued on page 6)An Engineering Approach to Traumatic Brain Injury Research While the medical profession focuses largely on biochemical changes to the brain during traumatic brain injury (TBI), Associate Research Professor Henry Haslach and colleagues are looking at mechanical processes that could be precursors to those biochemical changes. In work published in the Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, Haslach and his team describe how the brain is made up of both solid matter and a high fluid content, and the configuration of \"brain tissue is maintained by the interaction between the cellular solid material and the brain extracellular fluid (ECF).\" Their research suggests \"trauma-induced increases in ECF hydrostatic pressure, which may induce pathological ECF flow, are a possible immediate mechanical cause of brain damage.\" By comparing organs and tissues such as cartilage and arterial tissue that are load-bearing with the brain that is not load-bearing, Haslach hopes to gain more insight on how brain injury occurs. \"We are focusing on substructures in the aorta to develop a rupture theory for arteries,\" adds Haslach, because the widely accepted fracture theory for metals does not apply to hydrated biological soft tissue. The researchers are working to develop a mathematical model to help predict brain response to impact, particularly to blast injuries sustained in military combat. Professor Ken Kiger, along with Clark School benefactor and entrepreneur Robert E. Fischell, M.S. '53, physics, is developing a new device to prevent traumatic brain injury for athletes. Their company, Guardian Helmets, LLC, was founded to accelerate the development of a device that uses \"smart fluids\" to resist impact to the head much like shock absorbers help a car deflect bumps in the road. \"Dr. Fischell's idea was to design a damper that connects the helmet and body and absorbs impact on the playing field,\" explains Kiger. The device, called a Superspine, would be made of high-strength metal plates attaching to the back of a helmet and to the top of the shoulder pad. \"The 6 METRICS N EWSLETTER .2014rEsearch HIGHLIGHTS Residential and commercial buildings now account for nearly 40 percent of total U.S energy consumption. The energy-saving imperative is clear: Create heating and cooling products for buildings that use less energy. For two consecutive years, student teams, led by Research Professor Yunho Hwang, have garnered top honors in a national competition to design, build and test ultra-efficient product prototypes that can reduce energy consumption in buildings. Last year, the winning team created an energy-saving, two-stage heat pump clothes dryer. The team's heat pump dryer could improve energy savings 40 to 46 percent over the average U.S. electric dryer. In 2012, a UMD team developed a super energy-efficient air conditioner. Conventional air conditioning systems use the same process to cool and remove moisture from indoor air - typically cooling air below the desired temperature to remove humidity and then reheating it. The UMD team designed a wall unit that separates the two processes, creating a separate system for both sensible and latent heat cooling. Tests of the prototype in a climate chamber showed energy savings of more than 30 percent over standard air conditioners. At UMD's Center for Environmental Energy Engineering, where he directs the Alternative Cooling Technologies and Application Consortium, Hwang works with some 30 research sponsors, including the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Department of Defense and the Maryland Industrial Partnerships Program to improve energy efficiencies. His most recent work moves beyond using vapor compression to meet cooling and refrigeration needs to neutralizing shape memory alloys and using them as an active material for elastocaloric cooling, a solid state cooling mechanism. When it comes to energy-saving transportation, one of the most technically challenging barriers to the widespread commercialization of hydrogen-fueled vehicles is the limitation of on-board hydrogen storage. Associate Professor Teng Li is working with the world's thinnest material - graphene - as a solution for more efficient hydrogen storage. Li, a Keystone professor and member of the Maryland NanoCenter and the university's Energy Research Center, and Graduate Student Shuze Zhu have found that they can make one-atom thick squares of graphene fold into a tiny origami box, which will open and close itself in response to an electric charge. Inside the box, the team stored hydrogen atoms more efficiently than previously thought possible, reaching storage density of 9.5 percent hydrogen by weight. \"We believe we can reach even higher storage density,\" says Li, noting the project has already exceeded the 7.5 percent hydrogen weight goal set by the U.S. Department of Energy for 2020. The technique could greatly increase a fuel cell's ability to store and release hydrogen \u2014an advance that could improve the capacity of hydrogen fuel cells for powering cars. Li is also part of a research team that developed a battery made of wood fibers that could advance the development of long-lasting, sodium-ion batteries, a promising solution to low-cost and high-performance, grid-scale energy storage. Professor F . Patrick McCluskey is studying another source of alternative energy\u2014offshore wind turbines\u2014in collaboration with Aris Christou, a professor in the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering. The team is analyzing data collected from wind turbine projects in the North Sea to make recommendations on the installation and servicing of turbines as part of the Maryland Offshore Wind Energy Research (MOWER) Challenge Program. \"Studies show that electronics cause more than half of all unscheduled maintenance in wind turbines,\" says McCluskey. \"The turbines are exposed to large crashing waves, storms, high winds, sun and ultra-violet radiation. If we can make electronics robust against the offshore environment and reduce repairs, we can help make wind turbines economically viable as the state starts to build offshore wind turbine fields in the Atlantic Ocean.\" McCluskey's latest research stems from more than 20 years of experience working with power electronics for such applications as down-hole, oil well drilling, hybrid vehicles and industrial motor drives, much of which has been conducted through the Clark School's Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering.

JAMES CLARK SCHOOL of ENGINEERING . UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND7 rEsearch HIGHLIGHTS Embedded Cooling Could Advance Next Generation Power Electronics Professor Michael Ohadi is leading a $2.1 million contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop \"embedded cooling\" technology for compound semiconductor microchips and high power electronic systems. Inadequate cooling capabilities for on-chip computing power has constrained advances in high-performance electronic systems in both commercial and defense applications. DARPA's IntraChip Enhanced Cooling (ICECool) program, which funds the contract, is seeking to integrate a thermal management solution directly into the chip layout. The UMD team will use innovative microfluidics and on-chip thermoelectric coolers to improve chip cooling rates, reduce the size of the cooling package and decrease the amount of cooling fluid in circulation. The Maryland team, which also consists of Professors Serguei Dessiatoun, F . Patrick McCluskey and Bao Yang, will develop a system in which a thin film of fluid is pumped through a series of channels, narrower than the width of a human hair, etched onto the chip's substrate. As the fluid evaporates in a thin film mode, it cools the chip in the same way the human body uses perspiration for evaporative cooling. When successfully implemented, thin film evaporation can be one of the most effective cooling mechanisms, with potential for at least an order of magnitude higher cooling rates than most conventional cooling technologies. \"With a direct or embedded cooling system, it is possible to achieve high levels of cooling while shrinking the dimensions of the thermal management hardware, since the embedded microfluidic-based system will deliver the cooling in close proximity to the on-chip heat source,\" says Ohadi, principal investigator for the project. \"We are at the frontier of the specific technology area for each of the topics we are pursuing, which requires pushing the envelope into uncharted territories.\"Some of the major challenges the team faces are designing for material and fabrication constraints, selecting a working fluid that is compatible with the intended application, avoiding local dryout, raising the critical heat flux and ensuring that the system performs reliably under harsh conditions and repeated on-off cycles. Maryland leads a team that includes Case Western University, Laird Technologies (formerly Nextreme Thermal Solutions), Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems and Science Research Laboratory in the three-year research program. The collaboration will help ensure that the proposed solutions are compatible with defense system requirements. The ICECool proposal grew out of more than 25 years of research at the cutting edge of thermal packaging technology, with significant funding from industry and government agencies. These efforts were considerably strengthened by Professor Avram Bar-Cohen, former chair of the department who is internationally recognized for his pioneering text books and recently released Encyclopedia of Thermal Packaging. Reflecting the growing need for innovative thermal management techniques, the UMD team is establishing the Maryland Center for Embedded Cooling (MEmCo) to pursue direct cooling in a diverse range of thermal management applications. MEmCo researchers look to directly impact high-performance computing, power electronics, renewable energy and smart grid development, energy recovery/conversion, and process intensification applications. \"This is a high-risk, high- reward, disruptive research project. Results of this research will substantially contribute to the rapid innovation and development of game- changing technologies that can dramatically alter the future of high heat flux electronic systems.\" - Michael Ohadi SOURCE: AVRAM NANOSTRUCTURES IN AN EMBEDDED COOLING PARADIGM,\" JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY IN ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE, 2013.

As part of a cross-department collaboration between the UMD Department of Entomology and the Department of Mechanical Engineering, students, researchers and faculty are developing a device that could help reduce the number of parasitic varroa mites currently infesting honey bee colonies. According to honey bee expert and UMD Associate Professor Dennis vanEngelsdorp, varroa mites are one of the leading causes of mortality for European honey bees and the number one issue challenging bee keepers. Varroa mites, sometimes referred to as vampire mites, are ectoparasites that feed off the blood of both adult and juvenile bees, weakening their immune systems and making them susceptible to viruses and infection. The parasites are becoming resistant to chemical treatments, and more effective treatments cannot be used when bees are producing honey for human consumption. Over the years, vanEngelsdorp noticed that hive disturbances\u2014such as hive relocation or transport in a vehicle\u2014often led to a decrease of varroa mite infestation on bees in a hive. The disturbances seemed to generate enough vibration to cause the mites to fall off their hosts. These observations made vanEngelsdorp wonder if he could create a non-chemical, mechanical solution to this problem\u2014a hive mounted 'Bee Shaker' that could create enough vibration to force mites off host bees without physically moving hives.VanEngelsdorp also serves as a project director for the Bee Informed Partnership, a collaborative effort between research institutions, universities and beekeepers, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, to accelerate the flow of information among beekeepers. He was prompted by the partnership's project manager and engineer, Karen Rennich, to seek help from the UMD's Department of Mechanical Engineering. A team of faculty and undergraduate students pursued the project as part of a class aimed at tackling \"advanced problems in mechanical engineering.\" Led by Assistant Professor Jin-Oh Hahn, the Bee Shaker team included post-doctoral research fellow Chang-Sei Kim and undergraduate students Max Frantz, Jake Johnson, Mark Ragland, Sean Bartlett, Pedro Pessoa and Matthew Lewis. The students dove into the design challenge, brainstorming ideas and selecting and discarding components to develop the Bee Shaker prototype. Johnson, a senior in mechanical engineering, enrolled in the course because he was looking for more hands-on experience. While the team initially spent a large chunk of time pouring through data sheets to find the right parts for the project, he \"had a taste for a large design project\" and enjoyed the creative freedom the project offered. The student team applied principles of control systems engineering\u2014the same principles that apply to automobile traction and cruise control systems\u2014to develop a successful Bee Shaker prototype that was capable of producing vibrations at variable speeds, forces and frequencies. The students designed a computer-controlled and programmed shaker to be mounted to the side of hives so beekeepers and researchers could test a variety of scenarios on the hives. Students refined the prototype design this spring by making it smaller, more powerful and capable of running off a portable energy source such as a car battery. The current team, Shaking Things Up!

Based on the team's success with its designs and fabrication process, vanEngelsdorp is testing several prototypes on colonies to determine their effectiveness on varroa mite infestation. Collaborations like the Bee Shaker project are part of an ongoing effort to create multi-disciplinary design courses for engineering students. These projects not only assist researchers attempting to solve critical issues, but create unique learning opportunities for students. \"Such projects...allow students to exercise their design and analysis skills on an open-ended and realistic project, which is often difficult to squeeze into a classroom environment.[Students] also get practice articulating ideas to different audiences, which is an important skill in their future professions.\" Mechanical Engineering Director of Undergraduate Studies Kenneth Kiger rEsearch HIGHLIGHTS Solar Energy Helps Power Robo Raven III As Robo Raven III navigates the skies, it could be drawing more and more of its energy from the sun. Professors S.K. Gupta, (Mechanical Engineering and the Institute for Systems Research) and Professor Hugh Bruck and their students in the Maryland Robotics Center have developed and demonstrated a new version of the Robo Raven micro air vehicle (MAV) that incorporates solar panels in its wings. While the solar panels do not produce enough energy to power Robo Raven III in flight (they produce around 3.6 watts while Robo Raven needs around 30 watts to fly), they are effective in charging the MAV's batteries when it is stationary. Because the vehicle's wings offer a surface area that is large enough to create a usable amount of solar energy, the Robo Raven team decided to incorporate flexible solar cells into them. The captured solar energy is then used to supply Robo Raven's onboard batteries. \"These new multi- functional wings will shape the future of robotic birds by enabling them to fly longer, farther and more independently because they will be getting their power from the sun,\" says Ph.D. student Luke Roberts, a member of the Robo Raven team. The underlying material of the flexible solar panels required that the team design new wings and develop a new additive manufacturing process to fabricate them, Gupta says. \"We still need to make significant improvements in solar cell efficiency and battery energy density to replicate the endurance of real ravens in Robo Raven III,\" Gupta notes, \"but the good news is that Robo Raven III has already demonstrated it can fly with a solar cell and battery combination. Now that we've successfully taken this step, swapping new, more efficient technologies should be relatively simple.\" Gupta has been working on flapping-wing robotic birds for the better part of a decade. His team first successfully demonstrated a flapping-wing bird in 2007. In spring 2014, the group introduced Robo Raven, the first flapping-wing MAV with independently flapping, programmable wings. ROBO RAVEN III IS THE FIRST FLAPPING WING MAV IN THE WORLD THAT FLIES ON BATTERIES CHARGED BY ONBOARD SOLAR CELLS. 10 METRICS N EWSLETTER .2014 On April 2, 2014, the Center for Risk and Reliability hosted a 25th Anniversary Celebration of the University of Maryland's Reliability Engineering Education Program. From energy, defense and infrastructure to manufacturing, systems and software, reliability engineering is an integral and fundamental part of ensuring that today's complex technological systems operate safely and efficiently. UMD was the first university in the U.S. to establish a degree- granting program in reliability engineering, and it continues to be one of the flagship programs in the field. Over 120 reliability engineering experts, leaders and alumni attended the event, which kicked off with a symposium featuring presentations from members of NASA, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, Northrop Grumman and the Ford Motor Group. In addition to federal agency and industry representatives, speakers included a host of faculty and researchers from both UMD and universities across the U.S. and abroad. A series of panelists spoke to the impacts and value of reliability engineering across a variety of disciplines\u2014from nuclear energy to the automotive and defense industries\u2014and presented areas for future research and exploration. NRC Commisioner George Apostolakis and Chief Nuclear Officer for Constellation Energy Group Maria Korsnick discussed the critical importance of risk assessment and reliability engineering in nuclear energy for improving safety and mitigating both internal and external risks. NASA Deputy Chief for Safety and Mission Assurance Thomas Whitmeyer provided insights into NASA's Mars missions and the impact of reliability engineering for successful space missions. Northrop Grumman Engineering Fellow Elias Anagnostou discussed the impacts risk assessment had on deploying new technologies in fixed-wing plane fleets. He highlighted the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Navy's Structural Integrity Prognosis System (SIPS) that was used to manage uncertainty and provide actionable information that helped reduce the costs associated with failures. University of Tennessee Postelle Professor and Head of Nuclear Engineering J. Wesley Pines and Rutgers University Distinguished Professor Haong Pham presented the challenges currently confronting educators in reliability engineering and highlighted both educational opportunities and hurdles facing today's reliability engineering students. Featured keynote speakers included UMD Reliability Engineering Kenneth Farquhar (M.S. '93), president and general manager of ManTech International Systems Engineering and Mission Support Business Unit, and Jeong H. Kim, entrepreneur, chairman of Kiswe Mobile and former president of Bell Labs. Kim was the first recipient of a Ph.D. from Maryland's Reliability Engineering Program, and he discussed the vision and impact of reliability engineering for both the center and himself. \"At first, my thought was that [reliability engineering] was an offshoot from the nuclear engineering program\u2014where risk assessment was a component of it\u2014but obviously with broader implications. I quickly realized that the vision for reliability engineering was much, much broader,\" said Kim. \"The vision is that you are dealing with uncertainty. Which happens in industry, it happens in your personal life, it happens all over the world. How to deal with uncertainty and incorporate that into your decision making process was the skill set that I acquired that has served me well over all of these years.\" department EVENTS \"There have always been reliability engineers because risk-assessment is so fundamental to so many fields, but the development of reliability engineering as a formal educational program\u2014 that is what is so significant. And it is not just that they helped birth a new discipline and educated the next generation, but it is also that so many of you who are here today...helped contribute to the development of this discipline.\" - UMD President Wallace Loh UMD Celebrates 25 Years of Excellence in Reliability Engineering Presentations and speaker videos available at: ter.ps/re14websiteA.

Dieter, Jr. and his wife Nancy Dieter have established the Capstone Design Enhancement Fund through the University of Maryland College Park Foundation to support the department's unique student engineering design curriculum. Every semester, mechanical engineering seniors enroll in the ENME 472 Integrated Product and Process Development course. This capstone design course enables students to synthesize the skills and knowledge they have developed during their undergraduate coursework. During the semester, they work in collaborative teams to select, design, build and present a working prototype for a unique product that solves an engineering problem. The capstone design course not only challenges students' engineering know-how, but fosters creative thinking, collaboration and problem solving. The course's main project also offers students a taste of entrepreneurship by incorporating business strategies such as target market and consumer requirement analysis to create a more marketable prototype. The semester-long project culminates when students present their prototypes to faculty, staff and special visitors during the semi-annual Design Day. Dieter has been involved with teaching the mechanical engineering capstone design course since 1977, when he was named dean of engineering at the university. At that time, Dieter saya, there was very little curriculum devoted to the design process and fewer resources were available for students taking the capstone design program. Since then, Dieter has literally written the book on the engineering design process: Engineering Design: A Materials and Processing Approach. First published in 1983, the book is now in its fifth edition, and since the fourth edition, fellow Mechanical Engineering Professor Linda C. Schmidt, one of the department's leaders in engineering design curriculum, has been a co-author. Many of the students in the capstone design course have never been involved with a hands-on building or engineering project, explains Dieter. This course gives them not only an opportunity to develop their engineering skills, but gives them experience working in teams. The students also learn how to quickly find new information to apply to a problem and gain an introduction to the use of patent literature. Over the years, the capstone design course has developed a more structured approach, and student projects have become broader in scope and variety. Today, approximately 300 students participate in the capstone design course each year, and the diversity among student projects has increased each semester. The student projects coming out of the program are an impressive display of the engineering skills students have learned, but they also require a variety of resources such as reference materials, tools, testing equipment and special software that stretches the program's existing resources. \"They require resources that are beyond that of other lab-based courses,\" says Dieter, and this challenge is one of the reasons he has decided to create the Capstone Design Enhancement Fund. He wants to make resources more readily available to the students and provide support for additional resources in all design courses. Dieter cannot stress enough the value of this curriculum, and its impact on students' experience with engineering. He has talked to many mechanical engineering alumni over the years, and even when the course was not as robust as it is now, graduates look back on the experience as a highlight of their four years.

'14) was born to be a Terp. Her parents, and their families, attended the University of Maryland\u2014it seemed like the natural choice, but according to Yep, she wasn't initially keen to go to the University of Maryland (UMD). \"Everyone from [my] high school goes there; I wanted to do something different!\" Yep had a lifelong interest in math and science, but she was initially unsure of an exciting career that would best use those skills. It wasn't until she attended a career fair in high school, where she saw a display from the local community college engineering department showing the breadth of what engineers could accomplish\u2014from space exploration to Hollywood special effects\u2014that she considered engineering that career. Family tradition and Yep's experiences at a UMD Exploring Engineering summer camp for high school girls, led her to decide on engineering at Maryland. Led by Paige Smith, the UMD summer camp exposed Yep to the University's wind tunnel, nuclear reactor and neutral buoyancy tank. \"All of which were on campus, for crying out loud,\" said Yep, \"How could I not have a passion for engineering after that?\" Yep was involved in numerous academic and engineering activities, including the Keystone Engineering program\u2014where she was also a teaching fellow for the Dynamics course. Most recently, Yep swore the oath of the Order of the Engineer and was accepted into the University Medallion Society. As a student, she furthered her engineering goals by interning at General Electric Healthcare and at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, where she worked with the team designing and testing the F-35 Lightning fighter plane. Not only did Yep excel in her studies, but she was also a talented athlete. She captained UMD's Varsity Cross Country and T rack and Field teams and served on regional athletic committees. Yep was a Cross Country MVP , named to the ACC All-Academic Team and selected as an Arthur Ashe Sports Scholar finalist. In addition, she helped her team win the UMD President's Cup awarded to the team with the highest cumulative grade point average. Between academics, internships and athletics, Yep was forging a successful undergraduate career, but during a volunteer experience with elementary school children from lower-income areas, she became stumped by a seemingly simple question: What is an engineer?Yep discovered it was difficult to express to the children what exactly an engineer was\u2014especially when compared to more identifiable jobs such as veterinarian or teacher. Mechanical engineering students have unique qualities that allow them to help countless people in new and exciting ways, however, it is often difficult to define what qualities define an engineer. In her Spring 2014 undergraduate commencement speech, Yep sought to answer this difficult question. \"Even I didn't know exactly what an engineer was, only that my dad was one and that it seemed like a good way to help people,\" said Yep, who went on to relay her definition of an engineer. \"We are creators and innovators, brilliant minds who tackle problems in new ways. We venture far out into space and deep into the ocean. We bend wind and experiment with nuclear physics. We build safe and warm buildings for the masses, provide means for people to get across the globe, both physically and virtually, and deliver water and education to the poor. We give humans the ability to fly, to 3D print new limbs, to create futuristic robots, all while obeying the laws of physics.\" Post-graduation, Yep will work for Boeing in Philadelphia. She is grateful to her parents and family, her friends, her professors, her coaches and the wonderful administrative staff of the engineering department. In her commencement speech, Yep exclaimed, \"Next time people ask what an engineer is, Terps, be ready to reply, 'I am'.\" \"Engineers, like superheroes, make an impact.

UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND21 alumni NEWS Alumni News Notes BRAD BOYERINAS (Ph.D. '13) published work in the April 9, 2014, issue of Nano Letters on a new breakthrough in hydrogen energy storage. His discovery, the formation of novel nanostructures in Pd films during hydrogenation through epitaxial control, is a significant breakthrough for the use of these materials in renewable hydrogen energy applications. The nanostructures can reduce defects and fractures that compromise performance for hydrogen energy storage. JEONG H.

U.S. Postage PAID Permit No. 10 College Park, MDThe Department of Mechanical Engineering 2181 Glenn L. Martin Hall University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742 WWW.ENME.UMD.EDU At the A. James Clark School of Engineering, and in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, we are dedicated to recruiting the most talented and diverse undergraduate students and providing them with unique education and research experiences. Most importantly, we believe that these opportunities should be made available to as many well deserving students as possible, regardless of their economic background. Unfortunately, many Clark School students struggle with tuition costs. For the 2012-2013 academic year: \u00b7 More than 600 Clark School undergraduate students received Federal Pell Grants. \u00b7 Clark School P ell Grant students had a cumulative unmet need of $3,877,197. \u00b7 Almos t all Pell Grant recipients have a family income at or below 250% of the poverty line. Many of these students must delay or abandon their undergraduate education altogether. In an effort to ease the financial pressure on our students, the University of Maryland has created the TerpStart Matching Scholarship Program. With a minimum contribution of $30,000 payable over five years, you can establish a scholarship that will help the Clark School's neediest students and give them the chance to follow their passion for engineering. To ensure that your scholarship has the greatest impact, the University of Maryland will match the spendable income generated each year by the endowment in perpetuity. That means your gift's impact is doubled forever. Your scholarship will support Clark School Students for many years to come. MATCHING SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMONE SCHOLARSHIP CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE For more information or to make a gift, contact: Sammy Popat, Director of Development, Individual Gifts 301-405-0224 or spopat@umd.edu Learn more about how the Department of Mechanical Engineering is making impacts by attending this year's Mpact Week.
