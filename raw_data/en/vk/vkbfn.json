Our Reviews - Samantha's Review of The BodyHoliday - Claudia's Review of The BodyHoliday, St Lucia This is precisely what BodyHoliday has in mind for its guests; the attention to detail, the thoughtfulness of the service and the in-house expertise make BodyHoliday not only a very special place in paradise, but also a great option for anyone looking for an all-inclusive wellness holiday to re-connect with nature, have fun and get the mind and body back on track. - Paul's Review of The BodyHoliday LeSport, St Lucia The Caribbean is known for its palm beaches, rum punches and all-inclusive hotels, but in St Lucia there's a well-being resort which promises if you give them your body for a week they will give you back your mind, and if you really engage yourself in their healthy holiday promise it will happen. I spent 9 nights in St Lucia at BodyHoliday for a health and fitness break... Guest Reviews - DanielleVisited February 2020 My partner and I visited with our baby for an early Valentine's break. The whole experience was amazing from start to finish. Both of us agreed that the hotel was better than 5 star London hotels we have stayed in. The staff were so helpful and welcoming, very professional but also friendly and down to earth. Nothing was too much trouble for them which really made our stay so much more special. The man on the front desk was so knowledgeable about the history of the building which we loved hearing about, he even gave us a mini tour which made us both really want to come back and explore the other bars and restaurants that we didn't have time to visit on this stay. The staff were also great with our little boy and made the hotel feel extremely family friendly. Great quality high chairs, and a proper cot in the room (and adorable hotel teddy bear!). The hotel and rooms are so stunning and there is so much attention to detail; I could write on and on about it but you have to experience it for yourself. Food was also great; afternoon tea and restaurant 88 both excellent service and food. Overall, the best luxury hotel stay we have had. Loved it, thanks Grantley Hall for a lovely stay. - KateVisited July 2019 The most perfect place in the world for a solo traveller - you can be alone and be treated well or be part of a group, it's entirely up to you and you will not feel uncomfortable. Lovely members of staff and fantastic facilities, not to mention the beachfront stunning location. - NicoleVisited November 2018 The hotel, facilities, staff, activities and spa treatments are excellent. Location is perfect and it's the ideal resort for everyone including solo travelers, couples, and groups. Everybody seems to get along and integrate. The general manager made himself very visible and spoke to each guest ensuring that we were all happy with everything. It's the kind of attention to details that really impressed me. - AngelaVisited August 2018 I had the best time ever at BodyHoliday. What a place! I made so many friends and now understand why everyone goes back year-after-year. I'll do the very same from now on. Thank you, Health and Fitness Travel, for suggesting and organising all for me. I really enjoyed the extra 150 dollars to spend there as part of my reservation (and the sunset cruise too)! - DianeVisited July 2018 BodyHoliday is a beautiful resort. The fact that it includes spa treatments and all the activities is wonderful. I enjoyed every minute of it. Tennis coaching for me was the highlight of my stay, along with spa treatments perfectly timed at the end of each day after a lot of exercising. It's a genuine all-inclusive place, no hidden extras. The communal dining table worked really well for me too. The staff always knew our names and remembered us. I made lots of friends through the tennis and by dinning using the communal table. My sincere advice is 'Go for it!' It has everything you could want, from the amazing and endless exercising possibilities to being the best place if the world for solo travellers. A holiday to remember! I feel so much healthier, fitter and happier. - KateVisited July 2018 BodyHoliday is a great combination of sun, beach, fitness activities and spa treatments. Expect exceptional staff, great food and an unbeatable atmosphere. They make it easy for you to eat healthy but it is also great to have a Pimms in the afternoon and wine with your meal. - JadeVisited November 2017 I've been back home for over a week now and it still feels like the most amazing dream! BodyHoliday is the Dorchester of spa holidays; you'd have to have serious problems if you had any fault with it. The service is exceptionally good, the classes are outstanding and the one spa treatment per day just completed what can be easily called a dream holiday. I travelled by myself and made some great friends who I will be meeting up there again next year! There's no other destination that could give me the same, so I have now officially stopped looking! Thank you for introducing me to such a wonderful destination! - AliVisited October 2017 I've booked my holiday with Health and Fitness Travel and want to say thank you for such a superb service! I was forced to cancel my travel plans with another company and they worked with me and BodyHoliday to rebook my stay for 5 days later. I'm so thankful! They really took the time to check all possibilities and the best outcome for my holiday! They resolved a very frustrating situation for me with excellent communication and professionalism throughout. I have been so impressed with the service which Health and Fitness Travel provided to me and I will not hesitate in recommending them. I travel to BodyHoliday every year and will be booking my next stays with them again and again. - RachelVisited September 2017 I loved the diversity of activities, the variety of food options and the amount of spa included! I've made an ample amount of amazing friends - it was VERY well catered to solo travellers. If you are going to BodyHoliday I recommend going by yourself as it's the perfect place for people travelling by themselves. It gives you lots of opportunities to be social but also plenty of alone time. You can really make the vacation to be exactly what you want it to be. - JoannaVisited July 2017 My holiday at BodyHoliday exceeded all of my expectations! It was the best value for money holiday I have ever had! Health and Fitness Travel was excellent at customer service. Words can't describe how good my stay was! The classes, the treatments, the sunset cruise, the beach... everything! My honest advice is, don't hesitate to book it! Try to go for 2 weeks, you need time to relax and time to enjoy all that the resort has to offer. And also, try to travel solo! - RonnieVisited July 2017 My goodness! What an fantastic holiday! The best one I have ever had, by far. I've already recommended it to lots of people and cannot stress enough more how wonderful it was. Health and Fitness travel was great at suggesting it to me at organising it all. Great work, guys! Thank you. Best place in the world for single travellers, everything is designed to make you feel comfortable and relaxed, interacting with other fellow travellers as much as you feel like. Location is beautiful and the variety of activities is second to none. Overall, the most perfect holiday I could ever dream of! - MonicaVisited May 2017 I cannot fault anything at the BodyHoliday! The statement \"Give us your body and we will give you back your mind\" is very accurate! You will feel amazingly relaxed. It's paradise and you will get a break from real life. You will also gain strength to deal with real life when you return home. The classes, Spa, beach and service are all excellent. The setting is calming, both guests and staff are very friendly and you can chat with anyone. The food is healthy but still very nice and you will never be hungry. Watching the sunset in Clubhouse with a glass of Cava or Cocktail is an unforgettable experience. It's my third time booking with Health and Fitness Travel and the extra resort credit and sunset cruise are such a great addition. Thank you so much - SharonVisited March 2017 It was the perfect holiday for me! The selection of activities is fantastic. All very organized, warm and the staff is so welcoming, the treatments were tailored to my specific needs and the staff knowledge helped to guide me as to the appropriate treatments that would further be helpful to me. With regards to my fitness goals, I was able to test my limits with the support of the fitness team. They were great! My favourite things were the dance classes and the evening activities. I really appreciated the US $250 credit from Health and Fitness Travel - it helped with the extra treatments that I needed for my muscles. If you are travelling solo, it's the best place to be. Staff made sure I was comfortable and it was great to be able to share a table with other guests who were also friendly. It really was the perfect holiday, the perfect balance of physical activities and relaxation! - MarkRowan6260Visited November 2015 This is a great hotel to stay in. It has everything you could ever need in one place. Lots to do if you it's your thing or just relax by the pool or on the beach. Fantastic friendly staff who cannot do enough for you. Rooms are large clean and inviting. We had a luxury ocean view room but expect that all rooms are of a high standard. No TVs in the bedrooms but we were provided with an iPad. Food and choice of food and restaurants excellent, you will not be disappointed. Highly recommend that if you plan on visiting St Lucia that you stay at the body holiday. I do hope to be back in the future. - Joanna TVisited November 2015 We have just returned from our first visit to The Body Holiday hotel and had a fabulous holiday. The resort is very private with superb amenities. Spotlessly clean, well equipped and all the activities offered were all first class, with excellent coaches and instructors. The food was faultless and the spa outstanding. This hotel offers so much but one thing it truly excels at is the service by the staff - the staff are the most polite, hardworking, accommodating and friendly we have ever come across. We had such a wonderful holiday we are already looking to book to go again in the spring! - Charmain BVisited February 2013 I had a great holiday. I was really pleased with Health and Fitness Travel, everything was perfect from the finding of the holiday to the support received throughout the booking process. It was great that you found such a perfect holiday based on listening into my requirements. The resort itself was amazing, facilities were perfect and the activities were varied and suited me perfectly!! The spa credit was also great touch.

Lows - Due to its location in a secluded cove, the resort is rather isolated, and requires catching a taxi in case you want to explore areas (of the island) outside the facility. - It can be tricky to find many elements showing authentic parts of the Caribbean culture; most of the guests are British, so the music, food and entertainment are designed to meet their standards. - The extensive spa menu is too tempting to just have one all-inclusion daily treatment. Treat yourself to some additional treatments to enhance your luxurious wellness experience. - The all-inclusive programme offers good value, however, it manifests itself in the buffet offering that can sometimes lack in variety and creativity. - Late risers should watch out so that they don't miss out on all the fun since many fitness and sports classes start quite early in the morning.
