It is a type of complementary and alternative medicine. It is a form of touch therapy that uses the principles of Acupuncture and Oriental medicine. In acupressure, the same points on the body are utilized as in acupuncture, but are stimulated with finger pressure instead of using the insertion of needles. Acupressure is used to alleviate a variety of symptoms and pain. Shiatsu massage is very closely linked to acupressure, working with the very same points on the body and the exact same general principles, though it was created over centuries in Japan rather than in China. Reflexology is a form of bodywork based on acupressure concepts. There is an increasing number of practitioners who practice bodywork technique of Jin Shin Do that combines acupressure, Qigong, Reichian theory, and meditation. Acupressure is essentially a method of sending a signal to the body (by fingers) to \"turn on\" its own self-healing or regulatory mechanisms. Normally, Qi (vital energy) circulates through natural pathways in the body called meridians. Blockage of this flow or an imbalance in Yin and Yang can cause illness and pain. Acupressure helps to correct functional imbalances and restore the flow thus returning the body to a more natural state of well-being. Acupressure is an effective form of stimulation used to help relax the muscles. If done regularly, this method of self-massage can sustain improvement and minimize recurrence of symptoms.

A simple way to stimulate these points is to press firmly with a finger in a rotary movement or an up-and-down movement for several minutes at a time. It is recommended that you use this information under the guidance of your physician.

Acupressure & Oriental Medicine The body is viewed as small part of the universe, subject to harmony and balance that exists everywhere. Chinese medicine does not create as eloquent a distinction as Western medicine does between mind and body. The Chinese system considers that emotions and psychological conditions are every bit as powerful on disorder as only physical mechanisms, and considers factors such as environment, work, and relationships as fundamental to a patient's health. Chinese medicine also uses very different symbols and thoughts to go over the human body and wellness. While Western medicine typically describes health as mainly bodily processes composed of chemical equations and reactions, the Chinese use notions such as yin and yang, chi, along with the manhood to describe health and the body. Everything in the universe has properties of yin and yang. Yin is associated with cold, female, passive, downward, inward, shadowy, wet. Yang, on the other hand can be thought about as hot, male, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and the like. Nothing is completely yin or yang. These two principles always interact and influence each other, even though the body and its organs may become imbalanced by having either too much or too little of either. It is found in food, air, water, and sun, and it travels throughout the body in channels called meridians. There are 12 big meridians within the body which transport energy, corresponding to the 12 chief organs categorized by Chinese medicine. Infection is seen as an imbalance of the organs and chi in the body. Chinese medicine has developed intricate systems of the organs are linked to physical and mental symptoms, and it's invented corresponding treatments employing the meridian and pressure point networks that are classified and numbered. The goal of acupressure is to stimulate and unblock the circulation of chi, by activating very specific points, called pressure points or acupoints. Acupressure seeks to stimulate the points on the chi meridians that pass near the skin, as these are easiest to unblock and manipulate with finger strain. Acupressure can be utilized as a member of a Chinese physician's prescription medication, as a session of massage treatment, or as a self treatment for common aches and disorders. A Chinese medicine practitioner examines a patient very thoroughly, looking at physical, psychological and psychological activity, taking the heartbeat usually in the wrists, examining the complexion and tongue, and observing the patient's demeanor and attitude, to find a comprehensive diagnosis of that organs and meridian factors are out of equilibrium.
