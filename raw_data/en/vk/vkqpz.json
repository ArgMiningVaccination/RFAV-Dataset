Despite their rarity, hypersensitivity reactions to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been described and could become the reason not to complete the vaccination. Desensitization protocols for other vaccines have been described and validated, while the use of this approach for anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is still anecdotal. We herein describe our experience with 30 patients with previous allergic reactions to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or to any of their excipients, proving that they are effective and safe; only two patients experienced hypersensitivity reaction symptoms during the desensitization procedure. Moreover, in this article, we propose desensitization protocols for the most common anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-04-27", "cleaned_text": "Patients with High Risk of Allergic Reactions [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050910](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050910) [Allergic Reactions to vaccination has been the best tool so far available to significantly reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of both morbidity and mortality. A report by the Italian National Institute of Health estimated the number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 directly avoided by anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the period January 2021-September 2021; it found more than 445,000 infections, more than 79,000 hospitalizations in medical units, over 9800 hospitalizations in intensive care units and over 220,000 deaths were averted during the period analyzed [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00910)]. [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00910), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00910)]. Severe allergic reactions to anti-COVID-19 vaccines are, however, extremely rare. From an analysis of more than 17 million individuals who underwent vaccination in the United States between 14 December 2020, and 16 January 2021, it appeared that anaphylaxis occurred at a rate of 2.5 and 4.9 per million doses of the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccine, respectively. Most reactions occurred following the first vaccine dose and in the absence of a previous history of anaphylaxis, remarking the importance of adequate training and equipment for the management of severe allergic reactions in all vaccination centers. Interestingly, nearly all the reported anaphylaxes occurred in female individuals (63 out of 66) [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00910)]. [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00910), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00910)]. [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00910), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00910)]. The precise mechanisms underlying hypersensitivity reactions to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are not yet completely elucidated; thus, diagnostic procedures to predict allergic reactions to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines do not seem to be consistently recommended. On the basis of the data available in the literature and the experience in real life, it is deemed that skin tests with Polyethylene glycol (PEG), Polysorbate 80 and Tromethamine (excipients contained in the current available anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and with a certain degree of known ability to induce allergic reactions [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00910), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00910), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00910)]) have a debated role in identifying individuals at risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions to vaccines [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00910), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00910)]. PEG is implied in mRNA vaccines, whereas Polysorbate 80 is in adenoviral vector vaccines. Tromethamine is present in the mRNA-1273 vaccine only. PEG and Polysorbate 80 share structural similarities, and a recent study showed that cross-reactive type 1 hypersensitivity to PEG and Polysorbate 80 may occur [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00910)]. [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00910)]. [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00910)]. As stated in the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) position paper on rapid desensitization for drug hypersensitivity, drug desensitization is indicated when the culprit drug is irreplaceable or more effective than the alternative, or it has a unique mechanism of action. Desensitization procedures should be avoided in patients with uncontrolled asthma or uncontrolled cardiac diseases. Desensitization is completely contraindicated in patients who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Drug-Induced Hypersensitivity Syndrome (DIHS) or Drug Reaction [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00910), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00910), [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00910)]. 2. Materials Methods 2.1. Study Design 2.2. World Allergy Organization (WAO) Systemic Allergic Reaction Grading System [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00910)] that classifies allergic reactions into 5 grades based on organ system involved (cutaneous, conjunctival, upper respiratory, lower respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and other) and severity. A reaction from a single organ system such as cutaneous, conjunctival or upper respiratory, but not asthma, gastrointestinal or cardiovascular is classified as a grade 1. Symptoms/signs from more than 1 organ system or asthma, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular are classified as grades 2 or 3. Respiratory failure or hypotension, with or without loss of consciousness, defines grade 4 and death grade 5. The grade is determined by the physician's clinical judgment. 2.3. Desensitization Protocols [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00910-t001)) through a 2-h period and followed by 2-h of observations, according to what was suggested by Kelso et al. [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00910)] and following the general recommendations given by the European Network on Drug Allergy (ENDA) and EAACI position paper on allergies and COVID-19 vaccines [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00910)] that suggests taking into account the different total volumes of the currently available vaccines (e.g., 0.3 mL of BNT162b2 and 0.5 mL of mRNA-1273 and ChAdOx1-S). 2.4. Brighton Collaboration Case Definition Criteria for Anaphylaxis [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00910)]. The Brighton classification has 5 levels: level 1 represents the highest level of diagnostic certainty that a reported case is indeed a case of anaphylaxis; levels 2 and 3 represent lower levels of diagnostic certainty. Level 4 describes a case of anaphylaxis that does not fulfill the Brighton Collaboration case definition criteria. Level 5 is a case that was neither reported as anaphylaxis nor meets the case definition. 3. Results [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00910)]. Three patients (10.0%) had positive skin test for at least one vaccine excipient (PEG or Polysorbate-80) and a clinical history of suspected allergic reactions to any drug containing those excipients. [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00910-t002)). The vaccine that was associated with the hypersensitivity reaction was preferentially chosen to continue the immunization process through a desensitization procedure; in 13 cases, however, for reasons independent of the authors of this article and the health professionals who conducted the desensitization procedure, and mainly due to which products were available and distributed by the health authorities to our vaccination center, the choice of vaccine used for desensitization differed from that associated with the hypersensitivity reaction. [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00910-t002)) experienced diffuse itching and significant hypotension (Brighton 1) during desensitization with the BNT162b2 vaccine. The patient was immediately treated with 500 mcg of intramuscular epinephrine, and after resolution, within a few minutes, the patient was nonetheless transferred to our Emergency Department for observation. Prior to the vaccination following the desensitization protocol, this patient underwent skin prick testing for both Polysorbate-80 and PEG, and interestingly only dermographism was reported. Another patient (n.23 in [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00910-t002)) experienced diffuse itching, angioedema, and nausea (Brighton 3) during desensitization with the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Symptoms completely resolved within one hour after intramuscular administration of antihistamine (Chlorpheniramine 10 mg) and corticosteroids (Beclometasone 4 mg). The patient was dismissed with allergological contraindication to the booster dose. In both cases, the desensitization protocol was interrupted. Among the 3 patients with a positive history of previous suspected allergic reactions to drugs containing vaccine excipients and positive skin tests to them (all of them resulted positive for Polysorbate 80), none developed hypersensitivity reactions during or after the desensitization protocol with BNT162b2 vaccine. 4. Discussion [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00910)]. In the present case series, the same desensitization protocol with the BNT162b2 vaccine was applied to 15 patients proving to be safe and able to lead to the completion of the vaccination in 14 patients. In a patient with a history of acute urticaria following the first dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and skin tests for vaccine excipients uninterpretable for demographics, the desensitization procedure was associated with anaphylaxis and was, therefore, ineffective. Recently, Iemoli et al. described two patients who experienced bronchospasm after vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine and for whom gradual administration of incremental doses of vaccine was not sufficient to prevent the recurrence of symptoms [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00910)]. Other experiences, on the other hand, are reassuring of the efficacy of desensitization protocols with the BNT162b2 vaccine [ [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00910), [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00910)]. As regards the other vaccines (mRNA-1273 and ChAdOx1-S), the desensitization protocols used were designed according to the international recommendations for desensitization to drugs and vaccines [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00910), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00910), [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00910)], proving to be safe and effective. [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00910)], confirming that desensitization protocols are also able to provide appropriate protection immunology for the patient. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00910)], and therefore allows patients who experienced possibly allergic reactions after the first dose to complete the vaccination series (through desensitization) to become dutiful and ethically relevant action both in terms of individual protection and the wider effect on public health; related to this, most of our patients (except the two who developed anaphylaxis during the desensitization procedure) managed to receive the subsequent doses of vaccine always applying the desensitization protocol. [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00910)]; in another case, a patient with anaphylaxis after preparation for PEG colonoscopy, found to be sensitized to both PEG and polysorbate 80 and scheduled to start anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha drug therapy for Crohn's disease, was successfully desensitized with infliximab (an anti-TNF alpha drug with polysorbate 80 as excipient) and subsequently vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, without hypersensitivity reactions, with Ad26.COV2.S vaccine containing polysorbate 80 as excipient [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00910)]. We did not consider it appropriate to desensitize with PEG or Polysorbate 80, as the role of these excipients in determining hypersensitivity reactions to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is still not fully understood [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00910)]. Instead, we preferred to use a more pragmatic and direct approach to the product that caused the reactions, choosing to desensitize with the entire vaccine. 5.
