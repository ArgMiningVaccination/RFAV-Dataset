It is quite common to experience many health emergencies (some of which can be minor) that require medical attention, including bites, cuts, bruises, burns, migraines, allergies, depression, cramps, cough, flu, sore throats, etc. But how do we deal with these? Homeopathy is a system that works on the belief that the body is capable of rejuvenating or curing itself. And that's why homeopathic remedies/supplements derived from natural substances, like plants and animals have been effectively used as a complementary treatment to stimulate the body's natural healing process. However, for you to maintain a healthy living, there are some rules and tips that you should adhere to Homeopath Expert's Tips for Healthy Living Here is a list of best tips for a healthy living recommended by homeopath experts: - Eat fruits and vegetables You can get loads of vitamins, minerals, prebiotic fibers, and antioxidants by eating fruits and vegetables. These nutrients have been shown by [studies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000282230000420X) to help people live longer. More so, when you take fruits and vegetables, it lowers your risk of health ailments such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other illnesses. - Minimize your sugar intake One of the worst ingredients in our modern diet is added sugar. When you take these substances in large amounts, it can harm your metabolic health. Not only that but high sugar intake has been [linked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11229668) to several ailments, including heart diseases, type 2 diseases, and many forms of cancer. - Get enough sleep You need to get enough quality sleep to maintain a healthy living. Poor sleep can affect your appetite hormones, reduce your mental and physical performance, and drive insulin resistance. More so, some [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2398753/) have linked insufficient sleep to a 55% and 89% increased risk of obesity in adults and children. That's more reason you need to get the 7-8 hours of sleep recommended by doctors. It gives your body enough time to heal itself and regenerate new cells. - Take care of your gut health with fiber and probiotics Your gut houses a group of beneficial microorganisms called the gut microbiota. These bacteria serve a lot of functions, including keeping enteric pathogens away and increasing the bioavailability of nutrients. You can improve your gut health by taking probiotics like sauerkraut and yogurt. You can also eat a lot of fiber to fuel your gut bacteria and improve your overall well-being. - Drink plenty of water Drinking water has numerous benefits. It can help boost your metabolism and increase the number of calories you burn.

So if you drink 2 liters of water daily, you will be getting 96 additional calories every day. That said, note that the best time to drink water is before meals. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661958) shows that drinking 500ml of water 30 minutes before eating helps to boost weight loss by 44%. - Eat more raw foods and remove processed foods from your diet Raw foods are naturally packed with minerals, vitamins, enzymes, hormones, oxygen, and water. It hasn't gone through any processing, instead, it stays as nature produced it. With raw foods in your diet, you'll always notice the difference in not only your physical body but also in your emotional and mental wellbeing. So instead of those processed and refined foods that provide you empty calories, you can stick with raw foods to maintain good health. - Stay away from bright lights before bedtime Bright lights are capable of disrupting the production of melatonin- a sleep hormone. And this can hinder you from getting enough sleep. So always avoid bright lights two hours before bedtime. Also, you can use a pair of amber-tinted glasses to block blue light from getting into your eyes when it's evening time. This way, melatonin will be produced normally, just like it will when it's completely dark, and you can get a good night's rest. - Do some cardio Aerobic exercises are great for your mental and physical health. When you do some cardio regularly, it reduces your chances of falling sick, hence improving your quality of life. Besides, exercising helps to reduce belly fat, the harmful kind of fat that collects around your organs. And when this fat is reduced, it helps you get significant improvements in your metabolic health. You can try some form of exercise for 30 minutes or more daily. You can mix your aerobic exercises with some resistance training. And as you age and become less flexible, you can do more of yoga. Then what do you do during times of illness? You can use homeopathic remedies to boost your innate healing mechanisms and recover more quickly with no side effects. - Take herb and spices Many herbs and spices are filled with health benefits. For example, turmeric and ginger both have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which helps for healthy living. So, you can try to include as many spices and herbs as possible in your diet, and you will feel their impact on your health. - Build good relationships Your social relationships have a huge impact not only on your mental health but also on well you're doing physically.

So homeopaths always advise taking care of your relationships and staying happy. This goes a long way to help your body heal faster on its own whenever you have a health ailment. - Don't go on a diet A lot of people believe going on a diet will help them live healthier, but diets rarely work well in the long term.
