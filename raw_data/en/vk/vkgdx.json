I so often hear people say...\"I need to use some of that homeopathy stuff.\" I just have to smile because I know they are thinking \"home remedies\" or \"natural remedies.\" Although homeopathic remedies are made from natural substances, for the most part, they are medicines. Homeopathy is derived from the Greek \"homeo\" meaning like or similar and \"pathos\" meaning pathology or illness. Put those together and you get the idea! Similar pathology. A homeopathic medicine is given based on its ability to mimic the disease state, and it stimulates the body to heal itself. To put it simply, \"Like cures Like.\" I hate to give this analogy, but it's like giving someone a flu shot to keep from getting the flu (we won't go down that rabbit trail). Homeopathy has been around for over 200 years! There used to be more homeopathic hospitals in the US than modern day hospitals. Homeopathy began in Germany in the 18th century with a physician and scholar named Samuel Hahnemann. He even has a statue in Washington, DC to commemorate his contributions. I look forward to writing more blogs to provide more information about alternatives that can help us to live healthy lives. "}
