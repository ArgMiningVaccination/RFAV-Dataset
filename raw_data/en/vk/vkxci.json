The first extraction is 45 days of high quality, certified organic cane alcohol extraction (ethanol). After the herbs are strained, they are extracted a second time for 45 minutes at a low temperature (140deg F) with reverse osmosis water. The two extractions are combined and held at 140deg F for 10 minutes to flash a percentage of ethanol to maintain potency. The purpose of a double extraction is pulling both ethanol and water soluble nutrients from each herbal blend into solution. A double extraction does not dilute the strength of a tincture if done properly.

Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) detox tincture I was wondering how bad this might taste before I tried it. To my suprise, it actually tastes fresh, clean and great! I do put it in a small glass of water. I am getting blood tests in a few weeks and hopefully it has helped along with my dietary changes and exercise changes. We shall see! This is most definitely the best Tincture I've ever used, and I've used quite a few. I noted results after 4-5 days. I will use it again this spring. "}
