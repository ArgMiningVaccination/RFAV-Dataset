Equivalency of Protection from Natural Immunity in COVID-19 Recovered Versus Fully Vaccinated Persons: A Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis (preprint) [systematic review]and pooled [analysis]of clinical studies to date, that (1) specifically compare the [protection]of [natural immunity]in the COVID-recovered versus the [efficacy]of full [vaccination]in the COVID-naive, and (2) the added benefit of [vaccination]in the COVID-recovered, for prevention of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODSUsing the PRISMA 2020 guidance, we first conducted a [systematic review]of available [literature]on [PubMed], MedRxIV and FDA briefings to clinical studies either comparing COVID [vaccination]to [natural immunity]or delineating the benefit of [vaccination]in recovered individuals. After assessing for eligibility, studies were qualitatively appraised and formally graded using the NOS system for observational, case-control and RCTs. [Incidence rates]were tabulated for the following groups never infected (NI) and unvaccinated (UV), NI and vaccinated (V), previously infected (PI) and UV, PI and UV. Pooling was performed by grouping the RCTs and observational studies separately, and then all studies in total. [Risk ratios]and [risk]differences are reported for individual studies and pooled groups, in 1) NPI/V vs. PI/UV and 2) PI/UV vs. PI/V [analysis]. In number needed to treat (NNT) [analysis]was performed for [vaccination]in naive and previously infected cohorts. RESULTSNine clinical studies were identified including three randomized controlled studies, four retrospective observational cohorts, one prospective observational cohort, and a [case-control study]. The NOS quality appraisals of these articles ranged from four to nine (out of nine stars). All of the included studies found at least statistical equivalence between the [protection]of full [vaccination]and [natural immunity]; and, three studies found superiority of [natural immunity]. Four observational studies found a statistically significant incremental benefit to [vaccination]in the COVID-recovered individuals. In total pooled [95% CI 0.001-0.007], annual case of [infection]in COVID-recovered [patients]was 218, compared to 6.5 in COVID-naive [patients], representing a 33.5-fold difference in benefit between the two [populations]. CONCLUSIONSWhile [vaccinations]are highly effective at protecting against [disease], our [review]demonstrates that [natural immunity]in COVID-recovered individuals is, at equivalent to the [protection]afforded by full [vaccination]of COVID-naive [populations]. There is a modest and incremental relative benefit to [vaccination]in COVID-recovered individuals; however, the net benefit is marginal on an absolute basis. COVID-recovered individuals represent a distinctly different benefit- [risk] [calculus]. Therefore, [vaccination]of COVID-recovered individuals should be and "}
