Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench, Echinacea an- gustifolia DC., and (Nutt.) Nutt. (Asteraceae) are frequently used as medicinalplants for the prevention and treatment of thecommon cold, influenza, and upper respiratorytract infection. The aerial parts of E. purpurea are used, as well as the whole plant including theroots from all three species. Polysaccharides, gly-coproteins, caffeic acid derivatives and alkamideshave been considered as the constituents beingmost relevant for activity [1]. Polysaccharides,glycoproteins and caffeic acid derivatives havebeen shown to have immunomodulatory effects.However, the question of bioavailability is stillnot solved. Recent investigations have demon-strated that at least alkamides are detectable inhuman blood in reasonable concentrations afteroral application of Echinacea preparations. Alka- mides possess a with anan-damide, an endogenous ligand of cannabinoid re-ceptors, and in fact it was shown that they alsobind to cannabinoid receptors and trigger effectson cytokines [2]. Besides asking for evidence ontheir efficacy, there is an increasing interest forsafety of these preparations. Therefore we havesystematically reviewed the available literaturefor evidence on drug interactions, contraindica-tions, adverse events, duration of safe use, and da-ta on safety of use in pregnant and nursing wom-en and have assessed the safety and tolerabilityprofile of corresponding Echinacea preparations. Cautions from the Committee on Herbal Medici-nal Products (HMPC) [3 -7] have been critically evaluated, especially the use in children below 12years of age, duration of use, contraindicationslike allergic diathesis or in case of immunosup-Abstract ! Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea angustifoli and Echinacea pallida are frequently used as medicinal plants. Besides asking for evidence on their effi-cacy, there is an increasing interest for safety data.This review systematically presents the availableliterature on drug interactions, contraindications,adverse events, duration of use, and safety of usein pregnant and nursing women, and assesses thesafety profile of corresponding Echinacea prepa- rations. It is noteworthy that all safety data re-ported are as product specific as the pharmaco-logical or efficacy data are. In pharmacokineticherb-drug interaction studies performed in vivo , no significant inhibitions of human CYP2D6 andCYP3A4 isoforms have been found after the ad-ministration of standardized E. purpurea prepara- tions. However, contradictory results exist instudies using liver microsomes. Adverse eventsreported during clinical trials following adminis-tration of Echinacea spp. mono-preparations were generally mild and mostly without causal-ity. Due to published long term studies with con-tinuous ingestion of different Echinacea prepara- tions up to 6 month with no reported toxicologi-cal concerns, Echinacea can be recommended also for long-term use. Moreover, the contraindica-tions in cases of autoimmune diseases and im-mune-suppression are questionable, since lipo-philic Echinacea preparations containing alka- mides suppress cellular immune responses, andbeneficial effects in autoimmunity were reported.The same applies for the use during pregnancy.Although there has been some impact reportedon embryonic angiogenesis in mice, no associa-tion with an increased risk for major or minormalformations during organogenesis was foundin a literature review. Altogether, the differentevaluated Echinacea preparations are well-toler- ated herbal medicines in the management in chil-dren and adults alike.Review and Assessment of Medicinal Safety Data of Orally Used Echinacea Preparations Authors Karin Ardjomand-Woelkart, Rudolf Bauer Affiliation Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Graz, Graz, Austria Key words l\"Echinacea spp. l\"Asteraceae l\"safety received February 8, 2015 revised August 5, 2015 accepted August 14, 2015 Bibliography DOI http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0035-1558096Published online 16 38 09 86 0Rudolf.Bauer@uni-graz.at17 Ardjomand-Woelkart K, Bauer R.

Many of these warn-ings are based only on the theoretical possibility that the im-mune-mediated inflammatory mechanism of diseases like auto-immune disease, tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis and human im-munodeficiency virus infection, can be exacerbated by the im-munostimulatory properties of Echinacea [3-8]. Therefore, this review shall help to make evidence based deci-sions about the advice safe use of Echinacea preparations. Pharmacodynamic interactions One study in healthy mice reported that a commercially prepared powder extract of the root of E. purpurea (0.45 mg/mouse/day) and melatonin (0.0142 mg/mouse/day) administered together,but not alone, had a detrimental effect on the levels of maturegranulocytes in both, bone marrow and spleen [9,10]. A poten-tially positive interaction between E a docu- mented teratogenic activity. Most notably, phenytoin is known toincrease the risk of cleft palate development if taken in preg-nancy. Its use in pregnancy has also been reported to be associ-ated with an increased risk of heart malformations. The increasedincidence of cleft palate reportedly can be reduced by the stimu-lation of the maternal immune system. These led researchers toinvestigate the use of ethanolic (70%) extract of E. purpurea dried aerial parts with phenytoin in relationship to the incidence ofcleft palate in mice. The incidence of cleft palate with phenytoinalone, phenytoin with the immune modulator levamisole, orphenytoin plus E. extract (360 mg i.p.) was 16%, 5.3% and 3.2%, respectively, showing that both levamisole and Echina- ceadecreased the incidence of cleft palate [11]. It is unknown whether the observed effects have any clinical relevance.In a recently published clinical study by Abdul et al., the pharma-codynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions of either Echinacea (1275 mg four times daily containing a mixture of 600 mg of E. angustifolia roots and 675 mg of E. purpurea root; standardized to contain 5.75 mg of total alkamides per tablet) or policosanol(10 mg tablet twice daily) with warfarin in healthy subjects havebeen investigated. The apparent clearance of (S)-warfarin wassignificantly higher during a concomitant treatment with Echina- cea, but this did not lead to a clinically significant change in an INR (International Normalised Ratio) measurement. No evidenceof any apparent effect of CYP2C9 interaction has been found. Echinacea nor policosanol warafarin pharmacodynamics, baseline clotting sta-tus in healthy subjects [12].Although details of drug administration, species, and type of ex-tract are not stated, it is worth to mention a first report on a pos-sible interaction between Echinacea and etoposide, a CYP3A4 substrate [13]. A 61-year-old man newly diagnosed with cell lungcancer began concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin and eto-poside. He was admitted to the hospital on day 8 of his first cycleand found to be thrombocytopenic. His platelet count reached anadir of 16 \u00d7 10(3)/L, requiring platelet transfusion support.Upon admission, it was discovered that he was taking vitaminB12, vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin C, Echinacea (not character- ized) and \"vitamin B17 (laetrile-apricots kernel), which were discontinued. He received his next cycle of chemotherapy with-out taking herbal products and vitamins and with the additionof pegfilgrastim. As the patient also stopped taking laetrile andhis other vitamins after cycle 1, a potential interaction betweenlaetrile and etoposide or cisplatin cannot be fully excluded. The authors of the report concluded that since the exact preparationofEchinacea and corresponding plant extract constituents was unkown, the interaction remains equivocal. However, it has beenwritten that cautions should be exercised in The vast majority of reported interactions are of pharmacokinetic nature, resulting in changes in biotransformation of the affecteddrug through inhibition or induction of en-zymes. A vivo studies a poten- tial for herb-drug interaction between different uncharacterizedEchinacea extracts and the cytochrome P450 family of drug A2 the recently published pharmacokinetic drug interactionstudies determined the influence of chemically characterizedEchinacea preparations on CYP3A and CYP2D6, with four con- ducted in human [18 -21] and seven in vitro studies [22 -27]. In a recently performed clinical study on the activity of humanCYP2D6, no significant inhibition was detected after the applica-tion of E. purpurea softgel capsules (Gaia Herbs, Inc., Brevard, NC, USA, 267 mg extract, three times daily) standardized to contain2.2 mg alkamides per capsule [18]. Penzak et al. investigated theinfluence of standardized E. purpurea fresh plant liquid extract 8:1 (250 mg) softgel capsules with 500 mg (two 250 mg cap-sules) 3 times/day for 28 days on the pharmacokinetics of lopina-vir (400 mg)/ritonavir (100 mg) twice/day and on CYP3A and p-glycoprotein activity by using the probe substrates midazolam(8 mg) and fexofenadine (120 mg) as single doses, respectively.The concentrated extract from freshly harvested E. purpurea plants contained standardized amounts of alkamides 0.25 mg/mL, polysaccharides 25.5 mg/mL and cichoric acid 2.5 mg/mL.The 13 volunteers received for 14 days E. purpurea in combina- tion with lopinavir-ritonavir and for 14 days purpurea alone. Neither lopinavir nor ritonavir pharmacokinetics were signifi-cantly altered by 14 days of E. purpurea co-administration [21]. More recently, interactions between inhibitor of HIV) and darunavir (proteaseinhibitor) with capsules containing E. purpurea root extract at a dosage of 500 mg every 6 h from days 1 to 14 has been investi-gated in HIV infected patients. Etravirine and darunavir undergoextensive metabolism the hepatic CYP3A4 isoform. Similar tolopinavir studied by Penzak et al., no significant interaction hasbeen found with darunavir [19]. Also no significant treatment ef-fects were observed for any of the primary pharmacokinetic pa-rameters after administration of etravirine with or without E. purpurea [20]. Already in 2007, Raner et al. evaluated the potential of 11 isolatedalkamides and a 33% and 95% in human liver microsomes andfrom an in vitro expression system. Extracts of E. purpurea root in 95% ethanol (2.0 \u00b5L of extract in 500 \u00b5L reaction) significantly in-hibited the activity (30%) of cytochrome P450 2E1 in human livermicrosomes. No seen when 2 \u00b5L of the 33% etha-nolic extract of the E. purpurea roots was used in a 500 \u00b5L reac- tion using human liver microsomes or expressed inhibi- tion at as low as 25 \u00b5M, which corresponds to18 Ardjomand-Woelkart K, Bauer R.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. roughly 6 \u00b5g/mL, whereas the caffeic acid derivatives had no ef- fect [27]. Compared to the measured plasma levels in humans(~ 10 ng/mL) the concentration needed for in vitro CYP450 2E1 inhibition was about 600 times higher and therefore the rele-vance of these results for the in vivo -situation is questionable. A standardized E. purpurea preparation induced mild the most,and least sensitive enzyme. In further studies, theEchinacea alkamides were suspected to be responsible for CY- P3A4 inhibitory activity [24]. In a more recent approach, a de-tailed analysis of six commercial Echinacea liquid preparations with emphasis on the metabolomics characterisation of the Echi- nacea compounds responsible for inhibiting CYP3A4 has been re- ported by Modarai et al. 2010. The used preparations were apressed juice from the aerial parts of E. purpurea (Madaus AG), a tincture from the roots of E. pallida (Salus), and three different tinctures from E. purpurea (with 22% ethanol from Viridian, with 65% ethanol from Holland & Barrett, Echinagold \u00aewith 50% etha- nol from a Health Food Shop in Denmark), and a herb/root prep-aration from E. purpurea (Echinaforce \u00ae, Bioforce). After the sepa- ration of each preparation into their ethanol and water-solublecomponents, the results directly confirmed the role of alkamidesin the inhibition of CYP3A4. Levels of variable and conflicting re-sults in CYP3A4 inhibition between laboratories, it is now sug-gested to use multiple CYP3A4 probes in the assessment of CY-P3A4 interaction potentials. Hansen and colleagues comparedthe CYP3A4 inhibition profiles of E. purpurea (Echinagard \u00ae, with final concentrations between 0.24 -6360 \u00b5g/mL) measured by three different CYP3A4 substrates and different methodologies.Testosterone metabolism showed a much lower (IC 50354 and 452 \u00b5g/mL, respectively). The choice of substrate might thus be essential for the evaluation of the inhi-bition of CYP3A4 metabolism for some herbs when performing in vitro studies. The previously described inhibition potential of E. purpurea towards CYP3A4-mediated metabolism was confirmed by the use of three different substrates [28]. Aside from direct en-zymatic inhibition also the transcriptional activity can be alteredby different herbal medicinal products (e.g. induction or inhibi-tion of CYP expression). Hellum and colleagues found that a com-mercial pressed juice from the aerial parts of E. purpurea (Echina- gard \u00ae-Madaus AG) moderately suppressed CYP3A4 expression human hepatocytes [22]. In addition, Gorski et al.found that an 8-day course of 400 mg of E. purpurea root prepa- ration administered 4 times daily could cause an induction of CY-P3A4 in intestinal cells, but suppressed hepatic However, the bioavailability of midazolam, a CYP3A4 sub-strate, increased by the same amount, leading to no overallchange in AUC [15]. Kortenkamp et al. (2011) carried out anal-ysis of the CYP3A4 induction in human hepatocellular carcinomaHepG2 cells by an and root (Echina- force \u00ae, Bioforce), using real-time reverse transcription PCR) to determine steady-state mRNA lev- els. HepG2 cells were exposed for 96 h to clinically relevant con-centrations of the E. purpurea preparation (22, 11.6 and 1.16 \u00b5g/ mL), or of four Echinacea alkamides (1.62 and 44 nM). Neither Echinaforce \u00aenor the produced any significant in the steady-state CYP3A4 mRNA levels [29]. A furtherstudy on the rat cytochrome P450 expression level has been car- ried out only recently by Mrozikiewicz and colleagues. The po-tential influence of a standardized E. purpurea 60% ethanolic ex- tract of the aerial parts containing 3.7% m/m polyphenolic com-pounds expressed as caffeic acid on the mRNA expression level ofmajor CYP450 enzymes using an animal model has been investi-gated. The male Wistar rats were randomly divided into fourgroups from A to D (n = 10). Group A was treated once a day with50 mg/kg p.o. of E. purpurea ethanolic extract for 3 days, and group B received a standard diet. Group C was treated with thesame extract like group A, 50 mg/kg p.o. once a day, but for 10days, whereas group D was used as control for group C. TotalRNA was isolated from the rat liver tissue sixteen hours after thelast administration. The authors concluded that the obtained in vivo data indicated a potent inhibition of the expression of CY- P3A1 (41%, p < 0.05) and CYP3A2 0.001), and an induc-tion of CYP1A1 = 0.01) and CYP2D1 (40%, = administration of an E. purpurea ethanolic extract [26]. How- ever, nothing has been reported about the important isoform CY-P3A4.In a pharmacokinetic herb-drug interaction study in rats, the characterized preparations ofE. angustifolia, P450 (CYP) interaction potential. A total of 216 ratswere assigned to the different experimental groups (n = 12) withvarious dosages, positive/negative tered for consecutive weeks. On the last blood sampling. Plasma levels of substratesand their metabolites were quantified using a validated LC MS/ MS method [30]. Pharmacokinetic parameters (C maxand AUC last) were calculated and compared with the blank control group us-ing geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and its 90% confidence inter-val (CI). E. purpurea, E. angustifolia and E. pallida preparations showed significant interactions mainly on CYP1A2 substrate of E. < 0.01; Echinaforce\u00ae p < 0.001 and pressed juice p < 0.01) with theophylline led to asignificant increase in the AUC lastof the metabolite, 1,3-dimethy- (tet- raenes) inhibited CYP1A2 with for the AUC lastand 2.96 (2.59 -3.39) (rat CYP2D2 metabolite) were moderately tion on CYP3A and CYP2C activities [3,31].Preclinical studies conducted since 2004 indicate that Echinacea constituents modulate immune mechanisms and there is in-creasing evidence that lipophilic Echinacea preparations contain- stress-related cellular immune re-sponses [2,8,32 -37], in contrast to older literature published, which described only \"immunostimulatory \"effects [38 -43]. Therefore, the activity of Echinacea be described as \"immunomodulatory \"rather than immunostimulatory [44]. Warnings against the concomitant use of Echinacea spp. together with immunosuppressive drugs because of the theoretical possi-bility of diminished effectiveness and the ingestion in peoplewith inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, and HIV, there-fore remain questionable [45,46].19 Ardjomand-Woelkart K, Bauer R. Review and Assessment ...Planta Med 2016; 82: 17 -31Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. The Eclectics, a group of practitioners, who were prominent around the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the U.S., usedEchinacea (especially the root of E. angustifolia ) for an extensive range of conditions, including tuberculosis [47]. The use for tu-berculosis and disorders related to autoimmunity as diabe-tes, psoriasis, and renal with the contraindications suggested by some recent au-thors.Although it is recommended by the authorities that \"Echinacea \" should be avoided in patients with autoimmune diseases, veryfew published case reports exist in this context, moreover theyhave a limited causal association [48,49]. The suggestion thatEchinacea preparations are contraindicated in autoimmune dis- eases assumes that the modulation of any aspect of immunefunction is deleterious. However, immune function is extraordi-narily complex and a substance that acts largely on phagocyticactivity may be safe or even beneficial in autoimmunity [50 -54]. There were no clinical or laboratory alterations (blood count,electrolytes, liver and kidney functions) reported after the inges-tion of E. angustifolia whole plant dry extract (undefined extrac- tion solvent) over 12 weeks by HIV positive subjects. Special warnings and precautions for use Since the possibility of immune-related adverse consequenceshas not been ruled out in atopic individuals, especially this groupof patients should use Echinacea spp. with caution and under the supervision of a health care practitioner. The Community HerbalMonograph stated that atopic patients should consult their doc-tor before using Echinacea [4-6]. The potential allergenicity of Echinacea has received a fair amount of attention, although some may have not been definitively associated with the ingested Echi- nacea preparations [55]. Undesirable effects Reports of adverse effects within clinical trials, comparing mono- preparations of Echinacea with placebo since 1996 are summar- ized in l\"Table 1 . Most of the adverse events were specified as mild to moderate. However a causal relationship between Echi- nacea and the adverse events could not be established. Headache, one of the predominant mentioned adverse effects, may not ac-curately reflect adverse events because it is also a frequent symp-tom of the common cold. Allergic reactions E. angustifolia (3825 mg whole plant extract) and E. purpurea (150 mg dry root) have been associated with allergic reactions,including one reported case of anaphylaxis [56,57]. Skin allergytesting of 84 patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis demon-strated reactivity to those Echinacea extracts in 16 subjects (19%) [57].Huntley et al. analysed a total of 8 case reports of allergic reac-tions to Echinacea with such typical signs as generalized urticaria, itchy and watery eyes, gastrointestinal upset, respiratory ob-struction, asthma, and a positive reaction to skin prick test (skinallergy test, SPT), which may or may not resolve with time [45]. A19-year-old female suffered an acute asthma attack and severelyitchy and watery eyes and a runny nose within 10 minutes of herfirst ever exposure to an Echinacea -containing tea, with no fur- ther characterization of the species and the plant part. It is neces-sary to mention that combination products and homeopathicpreparations were excluded from this safety reviwe.Jeschke et al. [58] published the results of a prospective pharma- covigilance study of Asteraceae extracts, including Echinacea . The aim of this study was to analyze prescribing patterns and adversedrug reactions (ADRs) for Asteraceae-containing remedies inGermany. Altogether, 18 830 patients (58.0% < D4, 10% > D4). No serious adverse drug reactions were re-ported. In a subgroup analysis, considering also non severe ad-verse drug reactions in 6961 prescriptions for Asteraceae, 11non-serious adverse reactions were detected (all for homeopath-ic preparations and none for phytotherapeutic preparations).This supports the observation that allergic reactions due to Echi- nacea products are rather rare and mostly not serious [3,58]. There is no literature available for the Stevens-Johnson Syn-drome, which is mentioned in the HMPC Monograph as an hy-persensitive reaction. But obviously there have been 4 cases re-ported in the Eudra vigilance database [3]. Thrombocytopenia Only one adverse event report with thrombocytopenia was iden-tified specifically for E. pallida . Liatsos et [59] reported a case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in an oth-erwise healthy 32-year-old Caucasian man. Examination re-vealed hypotension, sinus tachycardia, mild elevation in temper-ature, and few diffused petechiae, anemia (Hb (platelets = 20000/\u00b5L), and microangiopathic-type haemolytic anemia with fragmented red blood cells, in-creased indirect bilirubin, and markedly elevated LDH levels. Bac-terial and viral antibodies were negative. The patient was trans-fused with red blood cells and fresh frozen plasmas (FFPs) buthad a syncope episode followed by seizures and finally enteredstatus epilepticus which was controlled with general anesthesia and ventilator assistance. He was treated with large-volume plas-mapheresis twice a day, and administration of FFPs. He finallyhad an uneventful outcome [59]. Causality has not been evi-denced. Leucopenia and eosinophilia Kemp and Franco published a case report of leucopenia associ-ated with the long-term use of an uncharacterized Echinacea product (450 mg tid). A 51-year old woman appeared healthyfrom all aspects with the exception that her white cell count haddecreased from 5800/\u00b5L the preceding year to 3300/\u00b5L (normalrange 4000 to 11000). For the past 8 weeks she had been takingthe undefined Echinacea product (1350 mg of Echinacea per day), Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae; dosage not given), bupropion for depression (300 mg daily), as well as vitamins-C, -E, -B, and calci-um. She suffered from hayfever, but did not take medication for it.One month after the discontinuation of therapy with Echinacea , her white cell count had increased to 3700/\u00b5L. The next year sheresumed taking Echinacea and after two months her white cell count was 2880/\u00b5L. Two months after discontinuing taking Echi- nacea , her white cell count was 3440/\u00b5L and 7 months later arose to 4320/\u00b5L. Due to the fact, that the authors could not find anoth-er reason for the leucopenia, they assumed a relationship to theintake of Echinacea [60]. Although it is known tant product, bupropion (Wellbutrin SR \u00ae), releases changes hematology.

Furthermore, a case of a patient with eosinophilia of unclearaetiology whose condition resolved after the discontinuation of\"Echinacea \"has been reported. The authors felt that this repre- sents an IgE-mediated allergic process to an uncharacterizedused Echinacea preparation [62]. Erythema nodosum One isolated report describes the case of a 41-year-old man who experienced four episodes of erythema nodosum after using anundefined Echinacea preparation at each onset of an influenza- like illness. The man had been using Echinacea intermittently for 18 months, as well as loratadine on a basis as required, andSt. John s wort for the previous 6 months. Each episode of erythe- ma nodosum responded to conventional treatment, includingprednisone. The man was advised to discontinue the treatmentwith Echinacea and, after 1 year, he had not experienced any fur- ther recurrences. However, the report does not provide any de-tails (species, plant part, formulation, dosage regimen) of theEchinacea (or the St. John s wort) preparation involved and there- fore is difficult to interpret. Causality has not been established[63]. Sj\u00f6gren syndrome Logan and Ahmed reported on a 36 year old woman, who in-gested St. John s wort, undefined Echinacea , and Kava for 2 weeks, a development of severe general muscle weakness, whichresolved under supplementation of NaHCO 3and KCl. The report did not provide any further details of the Echinacea species that was contained in the product, or of the types of preparations, for-mulations, dosages and routes of administration of any of theherbal medicines listed. Complaints of joint stiffness, fatigue,dry mouth and eyes surfaced 6 weeks later. Sj\u00f6gren syndromewas diagnosed and a Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine 200 mg dai-ly) treatment begun. The abnormalities renal tubular function re-sulting in hypokalimea and acidification with muscle weakness,are reported because of the Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Problems re-solved under therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide,which unterlines the autoimmunogenesis. This case may repre-sent one example where an autoimmune disease was exacer-bated. The connection between the Echinacea therapy and the undesirable effect has been estimated as possible, but is not con-clusive [49]. Exanthema An autoimmune disease supposedly triggered by an unspecifiedEchinacea supplement has been reported by Lee and Werth. A pa- tient with pre-existing chronic inflammatory condition startedtaking Echinacea for the first time in his life at the onset of an upper respiratory tract infection. Within days the patient devel-oped blisters on body, head and oral mucosa. The authors alsomentioned that the temporal relationship of the patient diseaseflare with ingestion of Echinacea is strongly suggestive of a causal relationship. However, the practitioners could not rule out thepossibility that the patient experienced an exacerbation as partof the natural course of his condition, nor could they dismiss thepossibility that the upper respiratory tract infection contributedto his flare [48]. Furthermore, no further details of the product,including species of Echinacea , plant part, excipients, type of preparation, and dosage were provided. Without verification thatthe product implicated did contain Echinacea material and was free of other ingredients or adulterants, this report adds little toTable 1 Continued First author (reference)N Patient population and study designPreparation Adverse events experienced (cases or %) Active treatment Placebo Jawad [89] 325 (n = 673) Healthy adults with 2 or more colds per year.

Acute cholestatic autoimmune hepatitis In a case report by Kocaman et al. (2008) a 45-year old male pa-tient complained of fatigue and jaundice of 1-week duration. Hetold that he had started taking \"Echinacea root \"(1500 mg/day) after catching a common cold. Physical examination revealed anicteric patient. Markers for viral hepatitis, ceruloplasmin, ironand ferritin levels, and alpha 1 antitrypsin level were not remark-able for acute hepatitis. Liver biopsy revealed an interface hepati-tis, prominent cholestasis, and a portal lymphoplasmocytic andeosinophilic granulocyte infiltration. After admission, the patientstopped taking the \"Echinacea \". One month later, all laboratory values were normalized, except for the anti-smooth muscle anti-body positivity. The authors concluded this first report of an Echi- nacea -induced acute cholestatic autoimmune hepatitis (ACAH) as a result in a breakdown of autoimmunity self-control in the liver.Due to the undefined Echinacea preparation used (species, for- mulation) it is difficult to interpret the connection between Echi- nacea and the severe acute hepatitis [65]. In the same year, a case communication reported a patient with autoimmune hepatitisand hypergammaglobulinemic purpura related to Chi- nese herbal mixtures, and Kava Kava \". The 57 year old woman, a practitioner of alternative medicine, was hospitalized with jaun-dice and weakness. Viral serology for hepatitis B and C were neg-ative. A liver biopsy demonstrated cirrhosis with severe piece-meal necrosis, severe intra-acinar necrosis, focal necrosis andcholestasis. The patient was started on prednisone 60 mg perday with a prompt laboratory improvement and complete nor-malization of her liver function. It remains speculative whetherthe association between the herbal preparation and the autoim-mune hepatitis is causative or only coincidental. Above all, theconnection between the uncharacterized \"Echinacea \"prepara- tion and the autoimmune hepatitis is questionable [66].Concerns of potential hepatotoxicity have been raised, althoughdocumented cases are lacking. Miller published that all Echinacea preparations, if used beyond 8 weeks, could cause hepatotoxicityand therefore should not be used with other known hepatotoxicdrugs, such as anabolic steroids, amiodarone, methotrexate, andketoconazole [46]. However, the magnitude hepatoxicityhas Echinacea lacks pyrrolizidine alkaloids with a 1,2 unsaturated necine ring associated with hepatotoxic-ity. There have also been hepatoprotective effects of Echinacea re- ported in male rats [67]. Therefore, there is no clear evidence forhepatotoxicity.Autoimmune diseases like encephalitis disseminate and theEvans Syndrome are undesirable effects cited in the HMPC mono-graphs with unclear background. There is no literature availablein connection with Echinacea . In the recent update of the Euro- monograph on E. purpurea [4] Evans Syndrome has already been deleted.Effects on Reproduction and Development ! Preclinical data indicate that E. purpurea aerial part or root prep- arations are unlikely to cause negative reproductive or develop-mental effects in laboratory animals. Oral doses up to 2700 mg/kg of Echinacin \u00aedid not cause embryotoxicity in rats or rabbits or affect postnatal development in rats. Studies looking for genemutations, malignant transformation, or chromosome aberra-tions in bacteria, mouse lymphoma cells, cultured hamster cells,or human lymphocytes have found no evidence of mutagenicityof Echinacin \u00ae[68]. However, Ondrizek et al. reported that very high concentrations of E. purpurea (0.6 mg/mL, plant part undis- closed) applied directly to sperm impaired sperm motility andthey suggested that this may have a negative effect on male fertil-ity. Motility was inhibited at 24 and 48 h after incubation. Theyreported similar in vitro results using hamster sperm and oocytes [69,70]. It is questionable whether these findings are relevant inanin vivo situation. In 2007, the first study was conducted to evaluate whether phar-maceuticals containing alcoholic extracts of E. purpurea given to pregnant mice (n = 8) influence angiogenic activity and may thenlead to severe developmental disturbances. They found an in-crease in the angiogenic activity of tissue homogenates in the Es-beritox \u00aegroup, containing 3.2 mg of a native dry extract (30% ethanol) from Baptisia tinctoria herba, and a diminution in case of Immunal forte (1 tablet con-tains 80 mg dry E. purpurea pressed juice 31 -60:1). The growth factor concentration was lower in all groups compared to thecontrol. They concluded that there is some possibility that phar-maceuticals containing E. purpurea might influence the fetal de- velopment in humans also, because they may interfere with em-bryonic angiogenesis, and should not be recommended for preg-nant women [71].The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) known as the mostpowerful angiogenesis promoter plays a crucial role in organo-genesis, liver and pancreas induction, kidney glomerulus, boneand nervous system placentation and cytotrophoblast proliferation duringpregnancy. Wasiutynski et al. (2009) evaluated the effect of thefollowing E. purpurea containing drugs on the angiogenic concentration of murine sarcoma L-1 tumors: Immunalforte tablets (1 tablet contains 80 mg dry E. purpurea pressed juice 31 -60:1; LEK, Slovenia) and Echinapur tablets (no detailed characterization; Herbapol Poznan). They found that both drugssignificantly diminished the VEGF concentration in L1 sarcomatumor tissue and they speculated that therefore they may affectthe placenta formation in pregnant women [72,73].Perri et al. (2006) conducted a literature review with no specifi-cation of Echinacea (species, plant part and extraction method used) of seven electronic databases from their inception through2005 and compiled data according to the degree of evidence forthe use, safety, and pharmacology of Echinacea pertaining to pregnancy and lactation [74]. No association with an increasedrisk for major or minor malformations with a reported gestation-al use of Echinacea during organogenesis was found [75 -77]. Capsule and/or tablet formulations of undefined Echinacea were used by 114 (58%) of the 198 respondents, while 76 (38%) of therespondents used tinctures. The dosage of capsules and/or tabletsused varied from 250 to 1000 mg/day. Tincture dose varied froma minimum of 5 to 10 to a maximum of 30 drops per day. Dura-tion of use also varied but was normally continuous for 5 to 725 Ardjomand-Woelkart K, Bauer R.

The different brands used covered the two species E. angus- tifolia and E. purpurea without detailed characterization. 112 women (54%) reported taking the herb in the first trimester ofpregnancy, and 17 (8%) used Echinacea throughout their preg- nancies. No significant differences were noted between the Echi- nacea and the control groups in the rate of major or minor birth defects, nor were there any differences in pregnancy outcome,delivery method, maternal weight gain, gestational age, infantbirth weight, or foetal distress. Thirteen miscarriages were docu-mented in the Echinacea group, compared with seven in the con- trol group [76]. The study has several limitations. The most im-portant is that participants used a range of different preparationsofEchinacea at different dosage regimens. So the study does not provide adequate evidence for a specific preparation. Use in children G\u00f6tte and Roschke [78] made an observation in children with re-curring infections of the upper respiratory tract to assess the tol-erability and efficacy of an alcohol free pressed juice from theaerial parts of E. purpurea . The children had to be at least 2 years of age, and the juice was administered over a period of 11 dayswith doses adjusted according to age. In more than 95% of cases(n = 1322), the physician and parents globally assessed the toler-ability as good or very good [78]. It has been reported in a re-cently published study by Du et al. that the use of herbal medici-nal products in general is closely associated with younger age be-tween 0 and 17 years, and that two thirds of the preparationsused are for the treatment of coughs and colds [79]. Taylor et al.found an increased risk of rash when children of 2 to 11 years(mean 5.5 years, standard deviation 2.7 years) received an alco-hol-free preparation of dried pressed E. purpurea juice of the aer- ial parts, compared with those who received a placebo [80]. Inthis study adverse events were found in 45.1% of patients receiv-ingEchinacea (and in 39.5% of patients receiving placebo). The most frequent adverse events were: stomach ache, diarrhoea,drowsiness, headache, \"hyper \"behaviour, rash and vomiting. Rash was the only side effect that was significantly more frequentin the Echinacea group compared to the placebo group (7.1% ver- sus 2.7%, respectively). Therefore, caution is recommended whenusing this E. purpurea juice preparation in children who have ato- py and asthma because they are likely to be at higher risk for arash. In a subgroup analysis of the Taylor et al. data it has beenfound that children taking Echinacin \u00aejuice were significantly less likely to have another URI compared to children receivingplacebo. Use of Echinacea was associated with a 28% decreasedrisk of subsequent URI (p = 0.01) [81]. Moreover, in a study per-formed by Saunders and colleagues, the safety and tolerability ofan open-label E. purpurea product prepared from the dried, pressed juice of aerial parts (Echinagard \u00ae) has been examined in children. The dose was based on age (2.5 mL three times q day forchildren aged 2 -5 years, and 5 mL two times per day for children aged 6 -12 years) and administered for 10 days in an open-label trial. No allergic or adverse reaction occurred and no safety issuesarose during this study [82].Four observational studies regarding the safety of the oral admin-istration of preparations of the aerial parts of E. purpurea in dif- ferent dosages for children below the age of 18 were submittedby the German authority [3]. From the in total 1184 children,two cases of nausea and two generalized exanthema have beenreported, which could be due to an infection as well. Three chil-dren dropped out due to the bad taste of the preparation. Other-wise there were no reports concerning adverse events even when used more than 10 days [3]. Duration of use Several authoritative sources (e.g. EMA/HMPC/48704/2014) havesuggested that Echinacea should be used only for limited periods of time (not longer than one week or 10 days), without givingreasons and references to verify the scientific background. TheWorld Health Organization (1999) and the European ScientificCooperative on Phytotherapy on Echinacea , cautions that internal and external administration of E. pallida andE. pur- purea should not exceed 8 weeks, again without rationale. There was no data found supporting a treatment duration limit for Echi- nacea [84]. When addressing the issue of a duration limit for Echinacea preparations, Bone (2004) emphasized the importance of reviewing the traditional use of Echinacea by the U.S. Eclectic physicians that were active in the late 19th and early 20th cen-tury. Authoritative works published by these physicians, basedupon their extensive clinical experience, indicate that Echinacea was used over a long-term in chronic conditions without side ef-fects [47].Several studies of long-term (10 -24 weeks) oral use of different Echinacea preparations without occurrence of serious adverse ef- fects have been reported [85 -87]. The longest intervention of E. purpurea whole plant dry extract (undefined extraction solvent) studied to date was 800 mg twice per day for 6 months. The onlyadverse events reported by these subjects were nausea withoutvomiting (n = 4) and diarrhoea (n = 5) [87]. Melchart et al. studiedthe oral use of an E. purpurea root liquid extract and E. angustifo- liaroot extract for 12 weeks (100 drops daily of a 1:11, 30% etha- nolic extract for 5 days a week). No toxicological concerns werereported [86]. Parnham published that no adverse reactions oth-er than aversion to the taste have been reported after oral admin-istration of Echinacin \u00ae(E. purpurea pressed juice) for up to 12 weeks [88]. Recently, Jawad et al. tested the safety and efficacyofE. purpurea (57.3% m/m alcoholic extraction and 5% roots, Echinaforce \u00ae) in a large clinical trial (755 healthy subjects) and investigated its risk/benefit in along-term treatment (4 month). In the haematological or bio-chemical measures no significant or clinically relevant changesfrom before to after Echinacea treatment and in comparison to placebo were detected. No abnormalities were found after the 4-month exposure to Echinacea [89]. Schapowal reported that a standardized extract of Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce \u00ae) can be recommended for long-term use, also in children, the elderlyas well as those suffering from COPD, asthma patients or smok-ers, people in whom the consequences of cold and flu can be se-vere [90]. Discussion ! After review of the available literature, all medicinal species ofEchinacea \", including E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, and E. pallida appear to be quite safe. While the absence of severe drug-relatedadverse events does not conclusively prove safety, it is an indica-tion that significant acute toxicological events are lacking. In atoxicity study by Mengs et al. it has been concluded that even alethal dose could not be found [68]. Except for in vitro studies, which claim some cytotoxic effects [70,91], studies in humansand with experimental animals are reassuring and suggesting a26 Ardjomand-Woelkart K, Bauer R. Review and Assessment ...Planta Med 2016; 82: 17 -31Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. wide therapeutic window of safety. Oral treatment of rats for 4 weeks at doses up to 8 g/kg daily of the fresh juice of E. purpurea aerial parts failed to cause any toxicology. Moreover, oral dosesup to 2700 mg/kg of the same preparation did not cause embry-otoxicity in rats or rabbits or affect postnatal development in rats[68]. While Echinacea ingestion during human pregnancy is touted to be safe [74,76,77] others are more sceptical, indicatingthat other members of the family Asteraceae have distinctly neg-ative effects on human pregnancy [56,92]. However, the Astera-ceae family is very big and plants are quite different in constitu-ents. Echinacea for example is lacking sesquiterpene lactones. Some caution exists regarding the use of an E. purpurea extract (0.6 mg/day within Esberitox \u00ae, Immunal\u00aeor Echinapur\u00ae)i nt h e first trimester of pregnancy based upon testing in mice. Thegrowth factor concentration was lower in all Echinacea groups compared to the control. Based on animal studies, there is somesuspicion that pharmaceuticals containing alcoholic extracts of E. purpurea and pressed juice of E. purpurea might influence fetal development in humans, because they may interfere with em-bryonic angiogenesis, and should therefore only be taken duringpregnancy and lactation after consulting a physician [71 -73,93]. However, there is no evidence on the possibility that consumingEchinacea may promote spontaneous abortions. This hypothesis arose from only one report. Gallo et al. found a virtual doublingin the number of spontaneous abortions, i.e., in 13 women con-suming two species, E. angustifolia andE. purpurea without a de- tailed characterization (total: 206), versus 7 in 206 women notconsuming the herb [76]. It is known that, in vivo, Echinacea , giv- en to either normal, healthy adult mice, or to adult leukemicmice, significantly increases the numbers of natural killer cells[94,95]. Since, natural killer cells have been implicated in foetusrejection, manifesting in humans as spontaneous abortion [96 - 99] it was speculated that Echinacea may influence abortion. Ac- tually, the results from the human and animal studies of Echina- ceaspp. are not sufficient to conclude on the safety in pregnancy [100]. No firm conclusions on the risk of spontaneous abortionsand angiogenesis can be drawn from the animal studies [71,93].The small number of test animals and the dubious relation to hu-man conditions make the results questionable. Furthermore, Per-ri et al. conducted a literature review and found no significant dif-ferences between the Echinacea group ( E. angustifolia andE. pur- purea , without detailed characterization) and the control groups in the rate of major or minor birth defects, nor were there any dif-ferences in pregnancy outcome, delivery method, maternalweight gain, gestational age, infant birth weight, or foetal dis-tress. For clarification and rational evaluation more studies areneeded, however, pregnancy is not necessarily a contraindicationand application of Echinacea preparations during pregnancy should be subjected to medical supervision.Cautions from several authoritative sources (Community HerbalMonographs) are available and concern especially hypersensitivepersons like atopic or immunosuppressed patients, the durationof use, and children. However, many trademark products con-taining Echinacea sp. will be defined as dietary supplements and thus not be legally bound to follow the recommendations in theofficial plant monographs. E.g., in the latest Monographs statedfrom the official European Medicines Agency (EMEA) [3 -7], it has been suggested that the medicinally used Echinacea species should not be used for more than 10 days, but there were nopharmacological, toxicological and clinical data found supportinga limit of treatment duration for any \"Echinacea \"species used in either modern or traditional medical literature. The primary con-cerns for these temporal limits appear to be theoretical, including over-stimulation of the immune system and possible immunedepression and immune habituation following long-term use.However, up to now the limitations are not justified and no sub-stance classes can be hold responsible for the temporal limits.Long-term use of the pressed juice of Echinacea purpurea has not shown evidence of a deleterious effect on immune cells. Onestudy reported that the immune reactivity in mice was greaterafter 10 weeks of continuous oral doses of an expressed juice ofthe aerial parts of Echinacea purpurea than after 2 weeks [85]. Miller et al. reported in a study that the chronic administrationof an Echinacea purpurea root extract (0.45 mg daily for 14 months) from puberty until old age in mice resulted in the pres-ervation of NK cell activity. Natural killer cell activity normallydecreases with age and contributes to an increased mortality.The use of Echinacea purpurea preparations increased the life span of most of the mice and no toxicological concerns werenoted [52]. Moreover, three further long term studies (12 -24 weeks) with continuous ingestion of ethanolic Echinacea purpur- earoot or whole plant extracts reported no toxicological con- cerns [86 -89]. Moreover, no significant or clinically relevant changes from before to after the Echinacea treatment and in com- parison to the placebo were detected in haematological or bio-chemical measures, after 4-month exposure to an E. purpurea preparation (alcoholic extraction from freshly harvested 95%herba and 5% roots) [89]. There is no firm evidence to concludethe debate on duration limits.Application of \"Echinacea \"species and preparations in those tak- ing immunosuppressive drugs has been assumed as with any im-mune stimulant. Similarly, those with allergic sensitivities tomembers of the plant family Asteraceae, as well as atopic individ-uals and patients with asthma, should use Echinacea species with cautions and after consulting a physician. Regardless, very fewpublished reports exist in this context, and those have limitedcausal association [48,49]. The cautions in taking \"Echinacea \" from atopic patients arise from the common known allergenicityto the pollen proteins from plants of the sunflower family (Aster-aceae). E. purpurea aerial parts products have more potential to elicit allergic reactions in atopic individuals than do root prod- ucts. Considering the fact that proteins are very poorly extractedin ethanol-water mixtures it is also unlikely that an allergy wouldresult from the fluid extracts and tinctures of Echinacea ,e v e ni f the aerial parts were used. Proteins that are potentially containedmay be denaturized by alcohol and are unlikely to cause an aller-gic cross-reactivity [52]. This indicates that the general risk for anallergic reaction to Echinacea is low. However, atopic patients and those with asthma should be informed about such a possibilitybefore intake of preparations containing Echinacea .T h es u g g e s - tion that \"Echinacea \"preparations are contraindicated in autoim- mune disease assumes that the modulation of any aspect of im-mune function is deleterious. However, immune function is ex-traordinarily complex and a substance that acts largely on thephagocytic activity may be safe or even beneficial in autoimmu-nity [50 -54]. It is known that a stimulation of cytokines may lead to an exacerbation of autoimmune related inflammation and amajority of autoimmune diseases are thought to be due to a lossof tolerance to self-antigens and a IFN- has indicating that both Th1 cytokine and IFN- and T-cell proliferation can angustifolia [101].

The published data on leucopenia have to be consideredas not relevant for the safety of Echinacea due to reports concern- ing the occurrence of changes in hematology, like anemia andpancytopenia after a concomitant ingestion of bupropion (prod-uct information Wellbutrin, PDR, USA). Moreover, the patientshowed also low respectively borderline levels of the white cellcounts without Echinacea [60]. A specific risk in children is not documented and adverse eventsare very rare, with no causality. Rash was the only side effect thatoccured significantly more frequent after the ingestion of an al-cohol-free preparation of the dried pressed juice of the aerialparts of E. purpurea compared to a placebo (Taylor et al. 2003). Moreover, it has been found that those children taking thepressed juice from E. purpurea were significantly less likely to have another upper respiratory infection [81]. Risk/benefit re-sults suggest that the use in children can be recommended, butan intake of any Echinacea preparation in children less than 1 year of age should be discussed with a physician, because theirimmune system is not fully developed.Concerning pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions, which canresult in tremendous variability (over 10-fold changes) in phar-macokinetics of concomitantly administered drugs, only thestudies published since 2007, present reasonable data. The stud-ies before have been performed with different and phytochemi-cally insufficient characterized Echinacea preparations. With the in vivo studies published no significant inhibitions of human CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 isoforms have been found after the applica-tion of standardized E. purpurea preparations (softgel capsules with 267 mg, 3 times daily or fresh plant liquid extract again insoftgel capsules with 500 mg, 3 times daily) [18,21]. No signifi-cant interaction has been found with etravirine, [19 -21]. Only a that Echinacea alkamides inhibit CYP2E1 and [27]. After separating each characterized Echinacea preparation (pressed juices or alcoholic tinctures from E. purpur- eaandE. pallida ) into its ethanol- and water-soluble components, the results directly confirmed the role of alkamides in the inhibi-tion of CYP3A4 [24,25]. Controversial results exist on the tran-scriptional/translational activities with, e.g., induction or inhibi-tion of CYP3A4 expression. A pressed juice from the aerial partsofE. purpurea and an E. purpurea root expression [15,22]. Whereas, no the Echinaforce \u00aenor the pure alkamides [29]. How- ever, herbal products are often marketed as dietary supplements,which have fewer requirements for testing of pharmacokineticinteraction potential before marketing compared to registereddrugs. Recently the U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser-vices, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EuropeanMedicines Agency (EMA) released \"Guidelines on the Investiga- tion of Drug Interactions \"[102,103]. Two pharmacodynamic in- teraction studies in mice exist about the administration of an E. purpurea root extract or an ethanolic extract of E. purpurea dried aerial parts. One study found a negative effect on levels of maturegranulocytes after a concomitant ingestion of melatonin [9,10].However, a positive interaction has been reported after takingphenytoin at the same time, with a decrease in the incidence ofcleft palate [11]. No evidence of any apparent effect on warfarinpharmacodynamics with platelet aggregation or baseline clotting status in healthy subjects has been found after concomitant ad-ministration of Echinacea (600 mg E. angustifolia roots and 675 mg E. purpurea roots, four times a day) with (S)-warfarin [12].A declaration of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interac-tions with homeopathic preparations is not needed.In conclusion, these data suggest that medicinally used Echinacea spp. have a very good safety profile. Conflict of Interest ! The authors declare that they have performed consulting workand analytical investigations for companies producing Echinacea products. References 1Barnes J, Anderson LA, (L.)
