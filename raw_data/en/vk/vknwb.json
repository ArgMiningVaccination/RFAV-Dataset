Yet there are many non-cosmetic reasons for vaginal rejuvenation. It is not just for older women, but it is a great solution to several problems that women can have, especially following pregnancy and childbirth. Stress Incontinence Many women find that after childbirth, especially if they have had multiple children, that they dribble urine when they cough, laugh, or are startled. This is called stress incontinence, because you are only incontinent when there is stress put on the bladder and vaginal muscles.

You may have begun to notice some fine lines and wrinkles. Perhaps you have been noticing these signs for a while, and they are just becoming too pronounced to continue to ignore. There are a lot of treatment options for lines, wrinkles, and facial folds, but one of the most common and minimally invasive treatments are dermal fillers. What Are Dermal Fillers? Dermal fillers are a solution that is injected just beneath the surface of the skin. The main purpose of dermal fillers is to plump the skin so that fine lines and wrinkles are smoothed out. Some dermal fillers are designed for more severe lines and wrinkles or facial folds. Different dermal fillers can have different ingredients, but the active ingredient in many dermal fillers is hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is a natural compound that is produced by the body for skin health. Production of hyaluronic acid, collagen, and elastin decreases over time, which is what causes skin to begin to wrinkle and lose volume. Hyaluronic acid dermal filler can plump the skin and eliminate wrinkles in a more natural way with only a few side effects.

This is because the addiction to nicotine is only part of the problem. A large part of the habit is psychological, not just physical. Because of this, it is one of the most difficult things to quit doing. One way that you can increase your chances of success is by adding acupuncture to your treatment plan. Here's how it works and can help you. Motivated Smokers Smokers who are already very motivated to quit are the most likely to have success with acupuncture. If you are quitting for the wrong reasons and don't really want to quit smoking, it may not be successful for you. However, a study done by the National Institute of Health found that smokers who were very motivated to quit either decreased their cigarette habit significantly or quit altogether using just acupuncture treatment.

This natural decrease in hormones can lead to a number of symptoms in both men and women, including mood changes, weight changes, sexual dysfunction, and other changes in your body. Studies have found that long term use of synthetic hormone treatments increase the risk of breast and other cancers. Bioidentical hormone therapy is the solution that has been offered to counteract these risks. Here are the main advantages of bioidentical hormone therapy. Potentially Safer Than Synthetic It is believed that bioidentical hormone therapy is safer than receiving synthetic hormones. Bioidentical hormones are derived from plant and animal sources, and they are chemically identical to the hormones that our body produces naturally. It is thought that because they are chemically identical, there is less risk of breast cancer and other complications. However, it is important to note that clinical studies of the long-term effects of bioidentical hormones are still ongoing, and there are no hard conclusions, as of yet.
