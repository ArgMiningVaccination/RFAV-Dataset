I provide the connection for Source to flow through me and into you -cleansing, realigning, balancing your energy field and chakras -removing any blockages from the Sacred Holy River of Divine Source energy that runs through our bodies which bring us into Union with our true purpose for being through connection with the One within (God/Spirit/Source/Higher Self,etc what you know It as within yourself) so that we begin to allow and cultivate space to bring Spirit into the body to live in oneness, Bliss, Peace, Grace, Love. To Be the Living Spirit. Closing Burn Bowl Afterwards we will burn the intentions you wrote earlier to release and/or receive.

Namaste -Taya I wear my labradorite pendant almost every day, mainly when I work. I've noticed that it actually helps me remain calm and understanding during stressful and emotional situations. Days I forget to wear it, I get a flustered easily. I've received many compliments on it's beauty too! When I first moved into my home I had some very bad energy brought into it by a friend so I asked enlightened Crystals OM to come bless my house, and they graciously accepted as I knew they would. What I did not know what the level of commitment and detail that would follow...I thought they would burn some sage and smudge me but boy was I wrong ...there were many different things they used and went through every room especially the threshold which still to this day no bad energy passes through...along with this blessing came a burn bowl and which I wrote down what I wanted for the house and atmosphere I wished to surround myself with .after we burned that there was a Chakra meditation during the whole time the sage and more was steady filling my house up thick...as I laid on the ground Tay took me deeper and deeper with each Chakra and I became further from myself like I was above me looking down.the entire time she was using her singing bowl which started as a vibration but progressively became louder and more intense with the sound of her voice so completely warm and soothing taking me further even more .I am not sure what Chet was doing because my eyes were closed but I felt like I was I a rainforest in a downpour.I have never experienced something so wonderfully intense nor have I ever been so easily taken there but at the end when she did my final Chakra, the crown,I literally felt like these white sparkling fireworks were shooting embers out of the top of my head. I was so deep into this place they created it to a few minutes for me to come back ...i swear I vibrated this warm energy for days.when it was over the house was compleey engulfed in smoke and she said now we will open the windows and doors and all of the bad will disappear.IT DID AND HAS NOT RETURNED,IT TRIES ,BUT DOES NOT PASS THE THRESHOLD . YOU GUYS ARE TWO OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE HUMANS I HAVE EVER MET AND I AM PROUD TO CALL YOU MY FRIENDS. there were many steps I left out but I highly recommend anyone even if you don't have bad energy...enlightened crystals is the place to go. Dearest Friends, I was in a moment of disconnection, misalignment, and wounded spirit. I knew I needed reiki so I contacted Tay. My experience is truly indescribable, English words do not measure the angelic healing process Tay provides. I can say that my energy, vibration, and cells felt a powerful sense of serenity. Tay's herbal tea, singing bowls, voice, guided meditation, and touch created a portal for my spirit to safely land back into my body. With Tay's unique frequency and Angel wings, invisible to the eye, I left my session with my mind, body, and spirit feeling whole, at ease, and refreshed. I highly encourage anyone who feels drawn to a session to book. It's WORTH IT.Love & Respect, Lali Metta We have a physical booth set up each Saturday at the far North end of Palafox Market in downtown Pensacola from 9A-2P. Please stop in and get a free crystal "}
