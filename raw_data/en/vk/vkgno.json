For the latest quarter assessed by the U.S. EPA (January 2021 - March 2021), tap water provided by this water utility was in compliance with federal health-based drinking water standards. Utility Details - Tarheel, North Carolina - Serves: 4,589 - Data available: 2014-2019 - Source: Surface water Contaminants Detected Legal Safe EWG Health Guidelines fill the gap in outdated government standards. The federal government's legal limits are not health-protective. The EPA has not set a new tap water standard in almost 20 years, and some standards are more than 40 years old. Contaminants Detected Perfluorobutane a member of a group of perfluorinated chemicals used in many consumer products.
