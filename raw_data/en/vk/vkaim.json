Connecting to Polkadot gives you the ability to interoperate with a wide variety of blockchains in the Polkadot network. Economic & transactional scalability Polkadot provides unprecedented economic scalability by enabling a common set of validators to secure multiple blockchains. Polkadot provides transactional scalability by spreading transactions across multiple parallel blockchains. Easy blockchain innovation Create a custom blockchain in minutes using the [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) framework. Connect your chain to Polkadot and get interoperability and security from day one. This ease of development helps Polkadot's network grow. High energy efficiency Polkadot consumes a small fraction of the energy used by conventional blockchains thanks to its next-generation nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) model. Using the equivalent of ~6.6 US households worth of energy per year, Polkadot has the [lowest carbon footprint](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-02/polkadot-has-smallest-carbon-footprint-crypto-researcher-says) among proof-of-stake protocols analyzed in [ recent research](https://www.carbon-ratings.com/dl/pos-report-2022). Security for everyone Polkadot's novel data availability and validity scheme allows chains to interact with each other in a meaningful way. Chains remain independent in their governance, but united in their security. User-driven governance Polkadot has a sophisticated governance system where all stakeholders have a voice. Network upgrades are coordinated on-chain and enacted autonomously and without forking the network, ensuring that Polkadot's development remains future-proof and community-driven.

Governance Polkadot token holders have complete control over the protocol. All privileges, which on other platforms are exclusive to miners will be given to the Relay Chain participants (DOT holders), including managing exceptional events such as protocol upgrades and fixes. Staking Token holders keep the network secure and collect rewards by [staking DOT](/features/staking/). Polkadot's advanced staking system is designed for maximum decentralization and fair representation, rewarding good actors and punishing bad actors to ensure network security. Bonding New parachains are added by bonding tokens. Outdated or non-useful parachains are removed by removing bonded tokens. This is a form of proof of stake.

Web3 Foundation has commissioned five teams and over 100 developers to build Polkadot, including: Founded by some of the blockchain industry's designed to shape promising developers into tomorrow's leading blockchain engineers, just wrapped up its 3rd wave in Berkeley, California.
