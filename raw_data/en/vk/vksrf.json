More children are participating in sports activities than ever before. However don't forget that there are some important injury prevention tips that every parent should know as we get back to the playing fields this summer and fall! The first step to injury prevention while playing sports is to make sure your child has an up to date physical. Most schools and many youth athletic leagues require a pre-participation physical evaluation to ensure that each child is healthy enough to participate safely in his or her chosen sport. Getting a sports physical can help minimize potential risks of illness or injury and allows medical professionals to monitor for health problems and give age-appropriate advice. Time for your child's sports physical? Patient First offers sports physicals on a walk in basis every day of the year! Stretching is an important part of warming up the body before exercise. A warm-up routine is essential for preparing the body. Be sure your athlete stretches the appropriate muscles before every practice or game. It's also helpful to stretch after a workout to help keep muscles from tightening or being sore. Knowing how to safely play a sport is important in preventing injuries. Your athletes should keep in mind usual safety precautions that pertain to their sport. These tips could be small, like remembering not to throw the bat after swinging in baseball or softball, avoiding collisions with other players on the soccer field, or diving in shallow water, or when there is a person in the way, or dangerous checking in field hockey or lacrosse. Sports have built in safety rules, for which a player may get penalized, so it's best for your athlete to be aware of the rules of the game. These basic safety tips should be taught early on and followed always. Talk to your athlete about knowing when to stop. Tips like getting plenty of rest between workouts can help avoid over-use injuries. Also talk with them about listening to their bodies, and not pushing their limits. This can greatly help reduce the risk for injuries. If they are feeling any pain, your athlete should seek medical attention to prevent further muscle or bone damage. If your child does have pain or has suffered an injury, they should sit out until healed. It is crucial to your athlete's safety that they always wear any safety equipment required for their sport. This can include, cleats, goggles, face masks, helmets, skates, mouth guards, gloves, etc. Make sure your child knows the importance of wearing all gear correctly to prevent them from injury. This is especially important in close contact sports that may result in concussions, or orthopedic injuries. In addition to sports equipment, your player should also take care of their bodies. Eating a healthy diet can provide the proper nutrition your little one needs to be the best player they can be. This means eating snacks high in protein before a game, and avoiding sugary foods. It's also important to teach your kids about proper hydration. Ensure they drink plenty of water on game days and during practices as dehydration can lead to muscle cramps, fatigue, and injury. This all leads to your child's body being in the best condition it can to perform the task ahead!
