It's caused by a coronavirus The virus spreads very easily to other people Some infected people have no symptoms, but others get very sick, and some people die Swabs from your nose or throat are tested to diagnose COVID-19 No medicines cure COVID-19, but some might help people with severe infection or people at risk of severe infection What is a pandemic? COVID-19 is a pandemic. That's an infection that's spreading rapidly in many parts of the world all at once. What causes COVID-19? COVID-19 is caused by a type of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. The virus spreads: Mostly through the air, in droplets that an infected person spreads through a cough, sneeze, singing, or talking Through touching things that infected people have touched and then touching your face You can spread the virus that causes COVID-19 before you have any symptoms. Also, COVID-19 spreads from person to person much more easily than other respiratory infections like [colds](/home/quick-facts-infections/respiratory-viruses/common-cold) [ Common Cold The common cold is a viral infection.

What is a coronavirus? There are hundreds of different coronaviruses that are all related. Most of them infect only animals. Only a few coronaviruses can infect people Some of them cause only colds Three coronaviruses cause very serious illness and can be fatal Besides COVID-19, the other serious coronavirus infections are called [SARS](/home/infections/respiratory-viruses/coronaviruses-and-acute-respiratory-syndromes-covid-19-mers-and-sars#v47616268) [ Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illness ranging in severity from the common cold to fatal pneumonia.

Hardly anyone gets those infections anymore. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Many people with COVID-19 have almost no symptoms. If you do get symptoms, you'll likely have: Fever Dry cough Trouble breathing Feeling really weak and tired You may also have: Runny nose Sore throat Loss of your sense of smell and taste Headaches Stomach problems such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea A bad infection goes into your lungs, causing viral pneumonia. That will make you very short of breath. A bad infection can also affect a lot of organs, including your brain, heart, and kidneys. Is COVID-19 fatal? You can die from COVID-19. The older you are, the higher your risk of death. Most deaths occur in people over 50 years old. People over 80 are at very high risk. But even children and young adults can die. You're also at higher risk if you have other medical problems such as heart disease, obesity, or [diabetes](/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/diabetes-mellitus-dm-and-disorders-of-blood-sugar-metabolism/diabetes-mellitus-dm) [ Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high.

You should be tested for COVID-19 if you: Were exposed to a person with COVID-19 (you are a \"close contact\")\u2014get tested around 5 days after your last contact Were asked to get tested for a workplace, school, or community screening, particularly if you are not fully vaccinated The most common test that a doctor or other healthcare worker does, called a PCR test (polymerase chain reaction test), uses: A swab taken from your nose or throat The swab is sent to a lab to look for the virus or other evidence of an infection. It can take a few days to get your results. Antigen tests are a different type of test than a PCR test. Antigen tests can be done at home or in a healthcare setting and use a swab taken from your nose. They are generally less accurate than PCR tests. But antigen tests can provide rapid results (within 15 minutes). A blood test can look for [antibodies](/home/quick-facts-immune-disorders/biology-of-the-immune-system/overview-of-the-immune-system#v37673584) [ What are the main parts of the immune system?

It takes your body a few weeks to make these antibodies, so this test is not useful when you first get sick. But it can help tell whether you were ever infected. How is COVID-19 treated? If you have a mild or moderate case, you'll: Stay home and not go out or go near other people (isolation) Wear a mask so you don't spread the virus Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and aches If you have a severe case, with breathing problems, you'll need to go to the hospital. Doctors will: Give you oxygen Sometimes, give you medicines Sometimes, put you on a ventilator (machine to help you breathe) You may need to be on a ventilator for up to a few weeks. How can I prevent COVID-19? The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to be [vaccinated](/home/infections/immunization/covid-19-vaccine) [ COVID-19 Vaccine Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines provide protection against COVID-19. COVID-19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are multiple COVID-19 vaccines... read more ](/home/infections/immunization/covid-19-vaccine) and stay up-to-date with any boosters you are eligible to get (see [CDC: Vaccines for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html) and [CDC: COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shots](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html)). The vaccines are safe and effective You can't get COVID-19 from a COVID-19 vaccine Vaccine effectiveness can decrease over time\u2014a booster dose helps to \"boost\" how well your vaccine works COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild side effects (a sore arm, body aches, headache, fever) for a day or two You should get a COVID-19 vaccine even if you had a COVID-19 infection There is a small chance of having a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine. This usually happens within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. An allergic reaction requires emergency treatment (call for emergency medical care [911 in the United States] or go to the nearest hospital). In addition to being vaccinated, you should avoid being exposed to the virus. That can be difficult. People who can spread the virus may not have any symptoms, so you can't tell who has it and who doesn't. The CDC recommends additional ways to help avoid the virus based on [COVID-19 Community Levels](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html). Levels can be low, medium, or high. The level is determined by looking at the number of hospital beds being used, hospital admissions, and new COVID-19 cases in an area. You should wear a well-fitting face mask, covering both mouth and nose: When in indoor public places in areas where the COVID-19 Community Level is high, regardless of vaccination status If you're at increased risk for severe illness, or you live with or spend time with someone at higher risk, in areas where the COVID-19 Community Level is medium and if advised by a health care practitioner to wear one When sick and around other people When caring for someone who has COVID-19 When on public transportation (for example, planes, buses, trains) and while indoors at transportation hubs (for example, airports, train stations) regardless of COVID-19 Community Level In addition to being up to date with vaccinations and wearing a mask: Get tested if you have symptoms of COVID-19 Avoid crowded places and indoor spaces that do not have fresh air from the outdoors, if you're at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19 Maintain good social distance (about 6 feet) from other people if you aren't up to date with vaccinations, especially if you're at higher risk of getting very sick with COVID-19 If possible, keep 6 feet away from a person who is sick with COVID-19 Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands Stay home when you're sick Cover a cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe Pay attention to your health and watch for symptoms Quarantine and isolation Quarantine and isolation measures have been recommended in an attempt to limit the local, regional, and global spread of this outbreak. Quarantine is meant to separate people who had close contact with a contagious person so they do not infect other people. Currently, the CDC does not advise quarantine for people who have been exposed to Covid-19 but are not infected. See [CDC: What to Do If You Were Exposed to COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/if-you-were-exposed.html) for information regarding masking and testing after exposure. Isolation separates people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from those without COVID-19. Regardless of vaccination status, people with COVID-19 symptoms and/or who have a positive COVID-19 test should isolate for at least 5 full days. People who are in isolation should stay home and separated from others, or wear a well-fitting mask when they need to be around others in the home. For an additional 5 days, they should wear a mask when around others both in public and at home.
