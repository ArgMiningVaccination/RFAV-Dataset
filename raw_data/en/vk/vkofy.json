Millions of workers routinely handlecarbonless copy paper (CCP) forms each day. Reports of possible health effects from at least 12countries have been published in the scientific literature. This document presents a review of thehealth effects of CCP. When investigating the relationship between occupational exposures and ad - verse health effects, NIOSH generally prefers to use the published literature; but some unpublishedsources were used in this review because the published literature was limited. Also considered aspart of this review were more than 14,000 pages of material submitted to NIOSH in response toFederal Register notices requesting information about CCP. Such a comprehensive review should help address issues of CCP exposure in the U.S. workforce. Lawrence J. Fine, M.D., Dr.P.H.Acting Director, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Centers for Disease Control and Prevention iii Executive Summary In 1987, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requested that the National Institute for Occupational Safety andHealth (NIOSH) investigate the validity of re - ported adverse health effects in workers occu - pationally exposed to chemicals contained in or released from carbonless copy paper (CCP).Because of limited published information,NIOSH issued a Federal Register notice solic - iting information about possible adverse health effects from CCP exposure [52 Fed. Reg. * 22534 (1987)]. On the basis of informationavailable at that time, no strong conclusioncould be reached concerning a consistent linkbetween CCP and major health effects. Be-tween 1987 and 1997, additional reports in-volving health problems potentially related toCCP were identified. Therefore, in 1997NIOSH issued a second Federal Register no- tice soliciting new information [62 Fed. Reg.8023 (1997)]. This report contains a review ofthe published literature on CCP and the sub - missions to the NIOSH docket from the two Federal Register notices. CCP was introduced in 1954 by the National Cash Register Company as no-carbon-required (NCR) paper \u2014an alternative to separate sheets of carbon paper [Sandberg 1955; Miller and 1991]. A given CCPcan vary greatly as to its constituents, weightand types of paper coatings, paper color, dyecolors and combinations of dyes used on coat - ings, solvents and solvent mixtures (including *Federal Register . See Fed. Reg. in references.variations from different suppliers), physical form of the paper (rolls versus sheets), and fi - nal form of the product (i.e., bound with adhe - sives). Thus the product known as CCP is not a single product but includes thousands of differ - ent and often unique products [Mead Corpora - tion 1997]. This fact needs to be considered when interpreting the findings from the scien - tific literature. About 10 years after the introduction of CCP, medical complaints began to be reported byoffice workers [North Carolina Medical 1965,various health effects associated with expo-sure to CCP have been reported in the litera-ture appearing from Denmark, Finland,England, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands,France, Italy, Belgium, Japan, Norway, and theUnited States. NIOSH has reviewed the published and unpub - lished literature on CCP. The following para - graphs summarize the findings from this review regarding the primary health effects associatedwith CCP exposure. Irritation of the Skin, Eyes, andUpper Respiratory Tract The most common findings from the humanstudies are symptoms consistent with irrita - tion of the skin, eyes, and upper respiratory system following exposure to some types ofCCP. These symptoms have also been de - scribed in numerous case reports and case se - ries of persons exposed to CCP, and associations between these symptoms and ivCCP exposure have been observed in several cross-sectional epidemiologic studies. A posi- tive exposure-response relationship between these symptoms and CCP exposure has also been observed in those studies that examinedthis relationship. The cross-sectional epidemiologic studies have several major methodologic limitationsthat make them difficult to interpret. One ma - jor potential source of bias in these studies is overreporting of symptoms by workers whoare already aware of a potential association be - tween CCP exposure and irritative symptoms. This form of bias is often referred to as \"recallbias\" and is well recognized to be a potentiallyimportant factor in epidemiologic studies inwhich symptoms or exposures are identified byquestionnaires administered to the study sub-jects. Selection bias is also a major con-cern\u2014particularly in studies with a lowparticipation rate, where subjects with symp-toms may have been more likely to return thequestionnaires. These studies may also havebeen biased toward observing no effects by(1) analyzing a mix of workers with high andlow potential for CCP exposures and (2) in-cluding only active workers and thus excludingworkers who may have left the workforce as aresult of adverse health effects related to CCPexposure. The strongest evidence for an association be - tween symptoms and CCP exposure comes from the studies of indoor air quality. Thesestudies report a positive (and in several casesstatistically significant) association betweenCCP exposure and symptoms of skin, eye, andupper respiratory tract irritation. Of the stud - ies reviewed in this document, the indoor air quality studies are the least susceptible to re - call bias because they were not conducted in workplaces where specific concerns aboutCCP or other indoor pollutants wereheightened by previous complaints. None ofthese indoor air studies were designedprimarily to address the CCP question, hence investigator bias is also less likely. Other information supports the plausibility of the findings from the experimental studies inhumans. The plausibility of signs and symp - toms of irritation associated with CCP expo - sure is supported by the presence of several known irritants and allergens (e.g., types of CCP and by similar effects inexperimental studies of animals. For example,in seven studies of CCP and formaldehyde,nearly all exposure measurements exceededthe NIOSH REL (but not Finally,laboratory humans support theplausibility of the associations between irrita-tive symptoms and exposure to CCP. Signs con-sistent with irritation of the skin and/or theupper respiratory tract have been noted in afew of the experimental laboratory studies inhumans. However, most of these studies failedto demonstrate any effects or showed extremelymild reactions to CCP exposure. Inconsis - tencies in the findings of these studies might easily be explained by differences in study de - sign and particularly by differences in the types of CCP tested. Allergic Contact Dermatitis Several authors have reported cases of allergiccontact dermatitis that appear to have been as - sociated with CCP or its components [Marks 1981; Kannerva et 1990a,b, 1993; Shehade1987]. Development of sensitization to CCP orits components was also reported in a few per - sons in several industry-sponsored repeated in - sult patch test (RIPT) studies (Report 77-512-70 and Supplemental Report79-512b-70, Report 77-896-71, and Report v79-0085-73, all from Hill Top Research, Inc.; and Project SH-72-4, dated April 18, 1972,performed by the Shelanski Holding Company,Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, for Monsanto Co.,St. Louis, Missouri). In 8 of 217 test materials,study investigators indicated that skin sensiti - zation occurred in some human subjects. How - ever, these studies were mostly judged to be negative for irritation by the investigators.Thus in a small proportion of the population,CCP or its components appear capable of in - ducing cell-mediated (type IV) immune re - sponse and allergic contact dermatitis, particularly under the intensive exposures as - sociated with RIPT protocols. Cases of allergic contact dermatitis were reported only in RIPTstudies from the 1970s that were submitted tothe 1987 NIOSH docket; no cases were re-ported in the studies submitted to the 1997docket. This fact indicates that the CCP com-ponent(s) responsible for the allergic contactdermatitis observed in the early studies mayhave been removed from current formulationsof CCP. Systemic Reactions Three patients with systemic reactions clini- cally suggestive of mast cell and/or basophildegranulation after cutaneous challenge withCCP or its components have been reported intwo published case reports [Marks et al. 1984;LaMarte 1988]. These reports suggest that someCCPs or their components can induce reactionsclinically compatible with those caused bymast cell and/or basophil mediator release. Im - munologic sensitization was not adequately evaluated in these studies, and thus it is unclearwhether an immunologic mechanism underliesthese reactions. However, no additional reportswere located in the peer-reviewed literatureover the last 12 years. Thus, even if the re - ported reactions were referable to CCP expo - sure, systemic reactions of this type appear to be exceedingly rare. Furthermore, the rele - vance of these reports to current CCP expo - sures is uncertain.Conclusions On the basis of a NIOSH review of the scien - tific literature and information submitted in re - sponse to its 1987 and 1997 Federal Register notices, NIOSH concludes the following: /c167The weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that exposure to certain typesof CCP or its components has, undersome conditions, resulted in symptomsof irritation of the skin and of themucosal membranes of the eyes and up - per respiratory tract. This conclusion is based primarily on interpretation of the evidence from theepidemiologic studies. Although the mag - nitude of the effects observed in these studies was only weak to moderate, these studies were reasonably consistent in re-porting an association and evidence of anexposure-response relationship betweenCCP exposure and irritative symptomsof the eyes, skin, and upper respiratorytract. The plausibility of the epidem-iologic evidence is supported by thepresence of known irritants in sometypes of CCP, toxicologic studies thatdemonstrate mild irritation in laboratoryanimals exposed to CCP, and the evi - dence for respiratory and skin irritation in some of the experimental laboratorystudies in humans. Some of the epi - demiologic studies may have been bi - ased, particularly by overreporting from study subjects who were already con - cerned about the potential effects of CCP exposure (i.e., recall bias). How - ever, it is unlikely that recall bias could explain the associations observed be - tween CCP exposure and irritative symp - toms of the eyes, skin, and upper respiratory tract in the indoor air qualitystudies, since these studies were notconducted in an atmosphere of concernregarding the health effects of CCP. vi/c167Exposure to CCP or its components may rarely cause allergic contact dermatitis. This conclusion is based on published case reports of allergic contact sensitiza - tion and results reported in several in - dustry-sponsored RIPT studies. Cases of allergic contact dermatitis were reportedonly in RIPT studies from the 1970s thatwere submitted to the 1987 NIOSHdocket; no cases were reported in thestudies submitted to the 1997 docket.This fact may indicate that the CCPcomponent responsible for the allergiccontact dermatitis observed in the earlystudies was removed from the more re - cent formulations of CCP. /c167Systemic reactions have occurred in a few persons exposed to CCP. This conclusion is based on the finding that three such cases have been reportedin the peer-reviewed medical literature.No cases have been reported in the last7 years, and thus there is no evidencethat current exposures to CCP present arisk for this health outcome. /c167Data are insufficient to evaluate claimsof other adverse health effects (such asneurologic effects and reports of multi - ple chemical sensitivity [MCS]) that have been suggested in some of theclinical reports submitted to the NIOSHdocket. In conclusion, although the weight of the evi - dence indicates that exposure to CCP in the past has resulted in adverse health effects, it isuncertain whether current formulations of CCPrepresent a significant risk to exposed work - ers. Only a few cases of systemic reactions and allergic contact dermatitis have been reportedin the United States or in Europe, whichsuggests that the risk of these serious outcomes is extremely low given the large number ofpeople who have been exposed to CCP over aperiod of many years. Recently conducted ex - perimental studies in humans (RIPT studies) suggest that the potential for skin irritationfrom exposure to current formulations of CCPis nonexistent, or at most slight. However, it isunclear how well these experimental studiessimulate the exposures and potential responsesof CCP users\u2014particularly heavy users. Datafrom industry reporting systems suggest nowidespread problem and in fact indicate a de - crease in health-related complaints in recent years despite an increase in CCP production.However, these passive reporting systems areunlikely to capture all or even most cases ofCCP-related health effects, and changes inpublicity about CCP may have caused fluctua-tions in the reporting of cases. Since the 1980s,no epidemiologic studies have been conductedto determine irritative symptoms among U.S.workers exposed to CCP [Mendell et al. 1991].A positive epidemiologic study was conductedin Finland in 1991 [Jaakkola and Jaakkola1999]. However, the relevance of these find-ings for U.S. workers may be limited becauseof differences between the CCP products usedin Europe and the United States. Thus informa - tion is lacking about the prevalence of irrita - tion of the eyes, skin, and upper respiratory tract among workers currently handling CCPin the United States. Recommendations NIOSH recognizes that it may occasionally benecessary to limit CCP exposure in certainworkers through administrative controls (suchas job rotation). But in most cases, implement - ing normal precautions and recommendations for maintaining acceptable indoor air qualityshould be adequate to reduce or eliminatesymptoms. Good industrial hygiene and workpractices are likely to prevent symptoms frompotent irritants (such as formaldehyde) that viimay be emitted from CCP. These include ade - quate ventilation, humidity, and temperature controls; proper housekeeping; minimalhand-to-mouth and hand-to-eye contact; and peri - odic cleansing of hands. In addition, NIOSH recommends the follow - ing: /c167CCP manufacturers and their suppliers are encouraged to follow best practices,such as the Product Stewardship Codeof Management Practices [AmericanChemistry Council 2000]; they shouldalso consider enhancing their productguidance to reflect that published studiesindicate that irritative symptoms appearto increase with increasing exposure toCCP./c167CCP manufacturers and their suppliersshould also consider how human testprocedures (e.g., RIPT) can be modifiedby the use of standardized protocolsthat include proper controls (e.g., bondpaper), tests that mimic high-usesituations, and meaningful criteria forscoring and interpreting these tests toassess safety from skin contact (e.g.,ASTM D 6355-98) [ASTM 1999].Current best practices in the field ofproduct testing may not be sensitiveenough to identify mild skin irritants. /c167As part of ongoing surveillance, CCPmanufacturers and their suppliers maywant to evaluate the frequency and se - verity of irritation in workers using CCP. viiiContents Foreword . . . .........................................i i i Executive Summary .......................................i v

OSHA also requested that NIOSH pub - lish its findings if health effects were con-firmed. The OSHA request was based on one worker's concern that skin, respiratory prob-lems, and possible brain damage were due toconsistent exposure to CCP [52 Fed. Reg. * 22534 (1987)]. In addition, 10 to 12 of the ini-tial complainant's coworkers who were alsoexposed to CCP were reported to have sufferedadverse health effects. Thus in 1987, NIOSH issued a Federal Regis - ternotice soliciting information about possible adverse health effects from CCP exposure [52Fed. Reg. 22534 (1987)]. On the basis of infor - mation available at that time, no strong conclu - sion could be reached concerning a consistent link between CCP and major health effects.Between 1987 and 1997, a number of addi - tional incidents were identified as involving health problems potentially related to CCP.Therefore, in 1997 NIOSH issued a secondFederal Register notice soliciting infor [62 Fed. Reg. 8023 (1997)]. *Federal Register . See Fed. Reg. in references.This report contains a review of the published literature on CCP and the submissions from thetwoFederal Register notices. NIOSH prefers to use the published literature when investigat - ing the relationship between an occupational exposure and adverse health effects, but someunpublished sources were used in this case be - cause the published literature was limited. The unpublished information was found to be ofvariable quality, validity, and utility. 1.2 Development and Production of CCP CCP was introduced in 1954 by the NationalCash Register Company as no-carbon-required(NCR) paper\u2014an alternative to separate sheetsof NCR a patentedname, but many of the patents have expired,and several companies have licenses in othercountries. The mechanism of CCP involves coating the under surface of the top sheet of CCP withan emulsion of a colorless dye in a solvent(see Chapter 2). The emulsion is held in mi - croscopic capsules (microcapsules) that are ruptured by firm pressure from a writing in - strument. The released dye reacts with a re - agent on the surface of the paper and changes the dye to a colored product (generally violet,blue, or black). CCP may also be referred to asone of the following: /c167Pressure-sensitive paper 1/c167Reaction-copy paper /c167Color-reaction paper /c167Self-copying paper CCP comprises an extremely complex group - ing of products. A given CCP can vary greatly as to its constituents, weight and types of papercoatings, paper color, dye colors and combina - tion of dyes used on coatings, solvents and sol - vent mixtures (including variations from different suppliers), physical form (rolls versussheets), and final form of the product(i.e, bound with adhesives). To improve qual - ity and performance, the \"recipes\" used in the manufacture of CCP change frequently. Nosingle product can be identified as a typicalformulation of CCP since each product mayhave its own distinct constituents and differentmanufacturing processes. Thus the productknown as CCP is not a single product butincludes thousands of different and oftenunique products [Mead Corporation 1997 (aNIOSH docket submission)]. Production of CCP grew on an enormous scale after its introduction in 1954. By the 1960s,U.S. sales were about 16,000 tons, and pro - duction had started in Europe. In 1962, a Japanese company signed a license agree - ment with the National Cash Register Com - pany, and by 1970, worldwide production rose to 100,000 tons. In 1991, about 1.8 million tonsof CCP (the equivalent of nearly 200 billion8.5- \u00d7 11-in. sheets) [Fetters 1997 used[Buring and Hennekens 1991; Murray is divided into three principalregions: North America\u2014800,000 tons, Japanand the Far East\u2014300,000 tons, and - rope\u2014600,000 tons [Murray 1991]. The Asso - of Carbonless Papers [AEMCP 1985] indicatedthat in 1985 there were more than 50 manufac - turers of CCP throughout the world.By 1979, four companies in Great Britain, four in Japan, five in other European countries, andfive major companies in the United States weremanufacturing this paper [Calnan 1979]. Cur - rently, 12 plants (5 manufacturers) in the United States [Fetters 1997 (a NIOSH docketsubmission)] and more than 50 plants aroundthe world [AEMCP 1985] manufacture CCP.U.S. production averaged during period 1987-1996 andTardiff 1999]. Annual global sales exceed$5 billion [Finch 1990]. The production industry employs more than 10,000 workers [Fetters 1997 (a NIOSHdocket submission)]. Although the total num - ber of workers potentially exposed to CCP in workplaces other than manufacturing (such asoffices, laboratories, other businesses, schools,banking, etc.) is unknown [Pedersen 1998], itis likely to be in the millions. Also unknown isthe extent to which the general public is poten-tially exposed to CCP during business transac-tions, receipt checking, etc. 1.3 Reported Health Effects About 10 years after the introduction of CCP,medical complaints began to be reported by ex - posed office workers [North Carolina Medical Journal information from physiciansabout any unusual frequency of eye, mucousmembrane, or skin irritation associated withCCP similar to the information being reportedat that time in Sweden [North Carolina Medi - cal Journal 1982]. Since 1965, various health effects associated with exposure to CCP have been reported inthe literature appearing from Denmark, Fin - land, England, Sweden, Germany, the Nether - lands, France, Italy, Belgium, Japan, Norway, and the United States. The National SwedishBoard of Occupational Safety and Health 2 Carbonless Copy Paper1 INTRODUCTION1 INTRODUCTION [1976] gathered information about the compo - nents of CCP and came to the following con - clusions: /c167None of the substances present in CCP at that time had known irritant or aller - genic effects. /c167The problems of skin and mucous mem - brane irritation are most common in the winter when the humidity is low. /c167None of the substances gave rise to largeamounts of dust. /c167None of the substances would lead oneto expect vapors to be generated at roomtemperatures. /c167The odor reported by some may origi-nate from the solvents in the adhesivesor the inks. Despite these negative conclusions, the Swed- ish Board noted that further attention to thequestion was warranted, \"since problems withthe skin and mucous membranes are still beingreported by persons working with carbonlesspaper.\" Thus they also issued advice and in - structions related to the handling of CCP [Na - tional Swedish Board of Occupational Safety and Health 1976]. In February 1980, the Swedish Trade Union called for a ban on CCP [G\u00f6the et al. 1981],which was claimed to be the cause of numer - ous conditions including the following [G\u00f6the et al. 1981; Kanerva et al. 1993]: Itching Headache Redness of the skin Joint painBreathing difficulty Rapid heart beatHoarseness and airway obstructionBurning of the nose, eyes, mouth, and chestChest tightness and painUnpleasant smell and taste Asthma Contact urticariaFatigue Allergic contact dermatitis Nausea Irritant contact dermatitis Government and public concerns have waxed and waned in response to various reports in theliterature as well as anecdotal information. TheDanish, French, Swedish, and German govern - ments have offered recommendations for re - ducing exposure to CCP (summarized in Chapter 6) that rely on simple work practices,personal hygiene, substitution, administrativecontrols, and increased ventilation as preven - tive measures. The Danish, French, and Ger- man governments have also recognizedalleged health effects from CCP exposure ascompensable according to the seriousness ofthe worker's reaction [Norb\u00e4ck et al. 1983b]. At the first symposium on CCP (which was held in Stockholm and attended by producers,labor, government, and representatives fromnine nations), G\u00f6the et al. [1981] commentedthat strong forces had been mobilized in Swe-den 2 years before the meeting to ban CCP orfind a substitute for it. They noted that supportfor such resolutions has \"often been anxious - ness enhanced by unverified rumors or alarm - ing mass-media reports about dramatic and serious diseases caused by work withcarbonless copy papers.\" On the basis of theirfield investigations, G\u00f6the et al. [1981] indi - cated that handling large amounts of CCP might induce dose-related but benign andnonallergic irritative symptoms, particularly inthe mucous membranes of the nose and mouth.These authors did not consider these symptomsto be specific for CCP: they could also be elic - ited by handling large amounts of ordinary pa - per. But it appeared that a higher percentage of CCP workers might develop these symptomsthan workers exposed to ordinary paper. These Carbonless Copy Paper 3investigators did not consider the phenomenon to indicate any large health risk, but they notedthat CCP seems to be somewhat more irritatingthan ordinary paper in equivalent amounts. In Canada, Harris [1983] reported that the symptoms directly associated with use of CCP(and shown to decrease outside of work or atother tasks) develop primarily in office work - ers who use CCP and less in those who make it. He stated that the symptoms (1) appear to bequickly reversible when exposure ceases,(2) are rarely caused by allergic reactions, and(3) vary greatly from office to office (whichmay depend on combinations of factors includ - ing the brand of CCP, the intensity of use, and office conditions such as ventilation and hu-midity). He further stated that no individualchemicals such as formaldehyde, oils, or paperdust had been identified as causing the relatedsymptoms and that measurements in the officeair were generally too low to account for thesymptoms. Harris [1983] concluded that thereported health problems were due to the mix-ture of chemicals used in CCP and to mechani-cal irritation by the clay coatings on the paper. To provide a comparison with the information available on CCP, Brissette and Paquette[1987] summarized the known informationabout the prevalence of health problems asso - ciated with carbon paper in Quebec, Canada. They reported that 34 of 390 cases of industrialdermatitis reported in 1929 and 5 of 5,000cases reported between 1932 and 1936 were re - lated to carbon paper, but the observations were not based on patch testing. They furtherreported that at the Finsen Institute in Copen - hagen, cutaneous toxicity to carbon paper wasevaluated in 40,000 people. Only four cases of allergic contact dermatitis were recorded, andthe agents responsible were triorthocresylphosphate, oleic alcohol, nigrosine, and violetmethyl. None of these agents are reported to beused in CCP. On February 13, 1986, the National Swedish Board of Occupational Safety and Health de - creed that the CCP Announcement No. 1976:2 [National Swedish Board of OccupationalSafety and Health 1976] (which recommendedactions to be taken when CCP-exposedworkers showed symptoms of irritation) wasno longer valid: \"The problems which werepreviously considered to be caused by carbon - less paper are now regarded as being of an ex - tremely complex nature and have been linked directly to the paper only in a small number ofcases (see Arbete Och H\u00e4lsa [Work Problems Caused by Carbonless Paper) . 1.4 Information Sources and Types This NIOSH report is based on published andunpublished information. The published infor-mation includes case studies and case series,cross-sectional epidemiological studies, patentliterature, and some reports of human and ani - mal experimental studies. The unpublished materials were submitted to the NIOSHDocket in response to the Federal Register no- tices in 1987 and 1997 [52 Fed. Reg. 22534 (1987) and 62 Fed. Reg. 8023 (1997)]. Theseunpublished materials generally include hu - man repeat insult patch test (RIPT) studies, an - imal exposure studies, and medical records of workers who indicated that they had exposureto CCP. 4 Carbonless Copy Paper1 INTRODUCTIONCarbonless Copy Paper 52 The Technology of CCP 2.1 How CCP Works Athree-part business form (Figure 2-1) il - lustrates the concept of how CCP works. The first sheet in this three-part example is acoated-back (CB) sheet, the second is acoated-front and -back (CFB) sheet, and thethird is a coated-front (CF) sheet. The bottomsurfaces of the top and the second sheet arecoated with a layer of microcapsules that have a diameter of 3 to 6 /c70m. The coating includes inert spacer particles (\"stilts,\" such as floc, un-cooked arrowroot, and/or wheat starch parti-cles) that are larger than the microcapsules andare added to protect the microcapsules frompremature rupture. a 6% a high-boiling-point-organic sol-vent) rupture under pressures encountered innormal handwriting or impact printing. Forexample, in a three-part form, the released dyesolution is transferred from the bottom surfacesof the first and second sheets to the top surfacesof the second and third sheets, respectively,where it reacts with the clay or resin coating toform an image. The capsules and reactive coat - ing can be coated onto the same paper surface. In this case, the product is called self-containedCCP. 2.2 CCP Production The principles of the CCP production processare similar throughout the industry, but manycomponents are variable and complex. DuringCCP production, an acid-sensitive dye precur - sor such as crystal violet lactone (CVL) or N-benzoylleucomethylene blue (N-BLMB) ismicroencapsulated with a high-boiling-pointsolvent or oil within a cross-linked gelatin or in synthetic mononuclear microcapsules, includ - ing polyamides, polyesters, or polyurethanes. From the origination of NCR paper until 1970,the main solvent for the dyes was poly - chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs [Arochlor]). Ex - amples of solvents that have replaced PCBs are hydrogenated terphenyls, diarylethanes, alkyl - naphthalenes, cyclohexane, and dibutyl - detailed information about solvent composition, technical requirements,and admixtures is given later in this section).These materials are often diluted with odorlesskerosene [Calnan 1979]. CCP production consumes thousands of tons of microcapsules annually. During CCP man-ufacturing, microcapsules are coated onto theback of the top sheet (referred to as a CBsheet) at a density of several million per cm 2 with a binder or suitable adhesive [Certinand Zissu 1983]. Since paper is the usual sup - port, the binders or adhesives are principally paper-coating agents such as the lattices copolymers or acrylichomopolymers /c167Gelatin /c167Polyacrylates /c167Polystyrene /c167Polyvinyl alcohol The paper employed comprises not only nor - mal paper made from cellulose fibers, but alsopaper in which cellulose fibers are replaced(partially or completely) by synthetic polymers[Bedekovic and Fletcher 1986]. (Please referto Section 2.8 for a listing of brand names andtrademarks of CCP.)The sheet intended to receive the image, the CFsheet, is treated on the front with a clay or resinthat is alkaline on the surface but acidic inside,or with an alternative reactive coating [Calnan1979]. In Europe, the color developer system istypically based on clays, whereas phenolicresins are most commonly used in the UnitedStates and Japan [Murray 1991]. The coating isspread in a mixture, dried, and adhered with astyrene-butadiene-latex or one of the binderslisted above. When the top sheet ismechanically impacted, the dye capsules rup - ture and the dye solution is transferred to thereceiving sheet, where the acid developer acti - vates the dye as a result of a change in pH oroxidation. 2.3 Microcapsule Production Three processes can be used to micro - encapsulize the dyes for the size requirementsof CCP: complex coacervation, or in situ polymerization[Kroschwitz and Howe-Grant 1979, 1995;Sliwka 1975]. The complex coacervation pro - cess produces a shell material of gelatin andgum arabic (treated with glutaraldehyde); thechemical class is or chemi-cally classed as a cross-linked polymer. Thein situ process results in a shell material ofaminoplasts and is also considered to be in thecross-linked polymer chemical class. Micro-capsules have a wide range of geometries andstructures. These range from a continuous coreshell that surrounds the core material to amultinuclear capsule in which a number ofcells of core material are distributed uni-formly throughout the matrix of shell materialand a continuous core capsule with two differ - ent shells. Examples of other synthetic resinsused for the microencapsulation process are 6 Carbonless Copy Paper2 THE TECHNOLOGY OF CCP Figure 2-1.

The coating is spread in a mixture,dried, and adhered with a sty - rene-butadiene-latex or one of the binderslisted above.

The plant they in - vestigated made paper from pulp and then applied the appropriate coatings to the paperto make CCP. The paper itself is usually pro - duced in a continuous sheet from a pulp slurry to form a wet web of paper as it exits on ascreen, such as in a Fourdrinier paper machine.Apol and Thoburn [1986] describe a processin which the CF and CB coatings are appliedto the wet web. The CF coating can also beapplied as the paper exits from the paper ma-chine. As the coating is applied, the paperpasses through a dryer and is wound on a roll.The CB coating may be applied in a separateplant area to the paper as it passes through aseries of dryers and is rewound on a roll. The CF and CB coatings are prepared in the coater preparation area. The phenolic resins (1- to 10- /c70mo r1 -t o3 - size range is preferred may be preparedby grinding the resins to specific-size particles,or they may be purchased already prepared.The already prepared resin reduces exposure tophenol among workers who handle the coating preparation and is the preferred option for to - day's technology. A typical coating composition for the CF component is shown in Table 2-1. The CF isdried in a high-velocity air oven at 93 \u00b0C[Kroschwitz and Howe-Grant 1995]. Millerand Phillips [1972] stated that suitableamounts of the various materials per unit of pa - per are as follows: chromogenic dyes, 0.03 to 0.075 lb/ream (one ream is 500 sheets of25- \u00d7 38-in. paper totaling 3,300 ft 2), with the preferred amount being 0.05 lb/ream; solvent,1 to 3 lb/ream; polymer, 0.5 to 3 lb/ream. CF, CB, and CFB coated papers are produced in large rolls weighing up to several tons.These are subsequently cut down by machinesto a variety of smaller reel and sheet sizes.This cutting means that the contents of themicrocapsules will be ruptured and released.Although many of the sheeting, reeling, andpacking operations are automated, some of thepaper still needs to be hand-sorted. The workerswho hand sort these papers are potentiallyexposed to the components, particularly thecontents of the ruptured capsules that havebeen cut in previous mechanical operations.Some of these workers sort paper at the rateof 90 kg/hr (or more than 2 tons/week [600,000sheets]) [AEMCP 1985].

Thisprocess is normally performed by printers withappropriate forms design using conventionalprinting inks as well as specialized desensitiz - ing inks. The latter are applied to the CF surface to prevent the color former from de - veloping into an image on certain areas of the paper [AEMCP 1985]. CCP may be collated into business form sets that are glued along one edge. The glues(called edge-padding, edge-tipping, or\"fanapart\" glues) are similar to those used forordinary paper writing pads. Manifold formsusing pressure-sensitive CCP are produced us-ing conventional printing press techniques. Forsome applications, the production of themultipart form by photocopying or laserprinter operations is preferred\u2014especially inshort-run for production, emergencies, andexperimental or individualized forms. Themanifold forms are bound with an adhesivecontaining gum resins such as abietic acid.More recently, Moore Business Forms, Inc.,was granted a patent [McIntyre and Greig1989] for the use of a repositionable adhesivepad on the CF (such as is found on moneywrappers). Bodmer and Peters [1984] andBodmer and Miller [1985, 1986] noted that CFcoating components can accumulate on theheated fuser roll of the copier or the laserprinter, which becomes tacky and can lead topoor copy quality. limonene), and/or an oil-soluble metallic salt (primarily zinc) of a phe - nol-formaldehyde novolak resin can be used to overcome the fuser roll contamination prob - lem, which may or may not result in slower print speeds.2.6 Other Forms and Variations of CCP Technology Forms sometimes combine CCP with carbonpaper to become a \"two-write\" system [MeadCorporation 1992]. The Branch Safety Coun - cil for Offices and Administrations [1988] also reported on another type of CCP that ispressure sensitive and is called \"mechanical\"paper. The CB sheet is coated with zinc chlo - ride and covered by a thin layer of wax. Pres - sure created on the top side of the form causes the zinc chloride to break through the wax andadhere to the sheet below that is coated withan absorbing layer of color generators, polyvi - nyl acetate, and clay. The Mead Corporation was granted a patent that incorporated a micro - encapsulated, photosensitive material that cured to a stable image when heat-activated in thepresence of a developer such as an organicperoxide [Sanders 1984]. The Mead Corpor-ation was also granted a patent on a novelsystem that uses a self-contained imaging sheetto produce images on plain paper using a pho-tosensitive *, photocurable, image-forming agent and a developer material on the surfaceof the paper support [Feldman et al. 1994]. The NCR Corporation (formerly the National Cash Register Company) was granted a patent[Marinelli 1985] for the addition of an aqueouswax emulsion to the CB coating to act as a bar - rier between the reactants in the CB coating and in the CF coating in multiple-copy printingoperations. The technology prevents precolorformation caused by reactants seeping theCF and can CF coating(presumably with desensitizing inks). Formu - lations included the use of Jonwax 120 (an emulsion of polyethylene and paraffin wax),Jonwax 26 wax emulsion water-based entire electromag - netic spectrum. 8 Carbonless Copy Paper2 THE TECHNOLOGY OF CCPThe wax emulsion also replaces some of the microcapsules on the substrate. (Jonwax is aregistered trademark of S.C. Johnson and Son,Inc., of Racine, Wisconsin.) According toGraves and Tardiff [1999], this process wasnever commercialized. 2.7 Desensitizing Inks Frequently, information entered on the topform must be unreadable on certain sections ofthe form or forms beneath. If the areas on theforms beneath are not needed for other data,two types of obscuring methods can be used.The most common is the \"masking\" blockout,which entails the printing of a solid block ofblue ink over the appropriate areas. The secondtype of blockout method calls for printing adense pattern of random lines and blotchessuggestive of Chinese characters (\"Chineseblockout\"). Both methods use the same colorink as the carbonless image color. When theblocked-out areas must remain clear to allowdata entry on lower plies, the manufacturermust print a special clear \"desensitizing\" inkon that area. This desensitizing ink deactivatesthe carbonless imaging system by not allowingthe CF side to react with the color former en-capsulated on the CB surface [Mead Corpora - tion 1993]. Desensitizing inks may contain a variety of solvents such as white spirits, kero - sene, inks are sold toindustrial other printing inks [Graves and Tardiff 1999]. Chang [1978] described a patented method of desensitizing CCP when the color devel - oper is a combination of acid clay, phenolic novolac resin, and metal salt of an organiccarboxylic acid coated with 10 to 35 partsN-vinylpyrrolidone and about 65 to 90 parts ofa free-radical, co-polymerizable compound ofa photoinitiator having at least one terminalethylenic group per molecule. The paper isthen subjected to ultraviolet radiation. Some CCP originates from printing shops that may use different manufacturing sources ofCCP in the same manifold. Thus it is extremelydifficult to trace the origin of a particular pa-per. For example, the CF sheet could comefrom one manufacturer and the remainder ofthe form from another supplier or manufac-turer. In addition, the printer can apply the de-sensitizing inks to the form [Danish BranchSafety Council for Offices and Administration1988]. 2.8 Summary of Chemical Components of CCP This section lists the known components ofCCP classified as to the microcapsule, colordeveloper, CF coating, etc. The compilationwas taken from the scientific literature, patentapplications, and manufacturers' submissions.

This chapter summarizes exposures from CCP handling reported in the literature(Table 3-1). Little consistency exists amongthese reports: they vary depending on thechemical composition of the CCP, the methodof manufacturing during the study period, andthe number of forms handled during theindustrial hygiene survey. For workers whohandle CCP, the most common exposuresare to formaldehyde and kerosene or its com-ponents. Formaldehyde is used in some micro-capsule manufacturing processes as part of themixture that forms the shell for the micro-capsules; it is also used in the manufacture ofother paper products such as plain bond paper.Kerosene is one of the principal solvents usedto solubilize the precursor dyes contained inthe microcapsules. 3.2 Exposure Data 3.2.1 Published Studies Some studies listed in this section are de - scribed in another section of this review. Jujo Paper Company, Ltd. 1979. One of the earliest reports with CCP exposure data camefrom the Jujo Paper Company, Ltd. [1979].They reported that the maximum concentrationof CCP solvent (unspecified) in a finishingroom where 100 tons of CCP were handledeach day was 0.3 mg/m 3. The company also reported an average CCP solvent retention of180/c70g on the fingers of women who handle, sort, and count 50,000 to 70,000 sheets eachday. Blood samples obtained 15 to 16 hr afterwork revealed no detectable concentrations ofthe solvent. Further biochemical tests of theblood and urine, skin tests (types unspeci - fied), examinations, and interviews of 135 exposed workers and 84 comparison workersrevealed no differences between the twogroups. The company indicated that no skindisorders had been reported by any workersince the CCP mill came into operation. No in-dependent survey of worker complaints wasperformed. M\u00f8lhave and Grunnet 1981. In an addendum to the telephone company report by Menn\u00e9et al. [1981], M\u00f8lhave and Grunnet [1981]reported on a headspace analysis (samplingof the gaseous phase of a sample heated to50 NC) of the CCP in use at the time of the study. They used one paper sample receivedfrom the factory where the problem was inves - tigated and one sample from the manufacturer of the paper. The authors reported that morethan 42 chemicals degassed from the papersamples, and concentrations were seven timesgreater in the paper from the facility than inthose of the manufacturer's sample. About 90%of the emission was alkanes or alkenes(C 5-C14). Another analysis was performed on the Santosol oil content of both CCP samples.The CCP that (according to the authors) causedthe original skin problems contained up to 150times the amount of Santosol oil contained bythe manufacturer's sample of CCP. Accordingto the authors, the Santosol oil consists Carbonless Copy Paper 13See footnotes at end of table. (Continued)Table 3-1.

CarbonlessCopyPaper 153 EXPOSUREmainly of hydrogenated terphenyl,*which is known to produce eye, skin, and respiratoryirritation and possibly sensitization in experi - mental animals [Haley et al. 1959]. At the telephone company that reported the problem,workers exposed to CCP dust and vapors emit - ted from the paper experienced marked irrita - tion at air concentrations exceeding 10 mg/m 3 (data not given). M\u00f8lhave and Grunnet [1981] believe that the terphenyls act as primary irri - tants, particularly when workers are wearing protective gloves that trap moisture and expo - sures next to the skin. G\u00f6the et al. 1981 and Norb\u00e4ck et al. 1983b. G\u00f6the et al. [1981] and Norb\u00e4ck et al. [1983b]reported on an investigation of climatic andairborne concentrations of microcapsule sol-vents found in printing offices and ordinary of-fices that used the same type of CCP. Theauthors noted that very few complaints wererelated to CCP in the printing offices comparedwith ordinary offices. Temperature and rela-tive humidity were, on the average, about thesame in the two environments. The highestconcentrations of microcapsule solvents wereobserved in the printing offices (Table 3-1).This finding suggests that no simple correla-tion exists between solvent vapor concentra - tions and the occurrence of complaints; or it may indicate that skin contact is the importantfactor. Gockel et al. 1981. Gockel et al. [1981] re - ported on formaldehyde released to the air from CCP forms that were suspected of caus - ing eye, skin, and respiratory irritation among office workers. Water extraction of CB whitesheets of CCP yielded 0.18 to 1.89 mg formal - dehyde per 8.5-\u00d711-in. top sheet of CCP. The authors felt that water extraction might haveenhanced the formaldehyde concentrations, so *This description differs from other descriptions of Santosol components, which do not refer to terphenylsbut to diphenylmethanes.they adopted a sampling procedure that col - lected the formaldehyde released into 15 L of air (1 L/min for 15 min). Formaldehyde con - centrations ranged from 33.6 to 858 /c70g/kg of forms sampled and from 0.02 to 0.96 ppmin the 15-L air samples using 8 dif ferent CCP forms. A modification of the pro cedure en - sured adequate air flow past all parts of each form in the sampling apparatus. Standardizedtesting of four sheets of equivalent area foreach type of five different forms resulted informaldehyde concentrations ranging from 0.45 to 16.8\u00b5g/kg, demonstrating a 37-fold differ - ence in formaldehyde emissions. The authors demonstrated that these air sample analysesusing a standardized testing area produced re - sults that varied by a factor of 0.83 to 1.42 compared with sampling of a full form. Theauthors also provided evidence that the resid-ual formaldehyde is dissipated into the air as aresult of handling and storage. Air concentra-tions of formaldehyde were as high as0.51 ppm in filing cabinet drawers where theforms had been separated and stored for morethan 6 months. Chrostek and Moshell 1982. See Section 4.2.1 for a description of this study. Norb\u00e4ck 1983b. Norb\u00e4ck [1983b] studied the chemical emissions from entirely unused pa - per and from paper in which approximately 1% of the microcapsules had been crushed by stan - dard writing. Most of the CCPs studied were handled by workers who had experiencedwork-related respiratory irritation symptomswhen handling CCP. In light of the observedemissions of formaldehyde from CCP overtime [Gockel et al. 1981], the 1- to 2-year-old paper was replaced with fresh CCPs of vari - ous types collected from three different print - ing shops. Most measurements were performed at an ambient temperature of22 NC and 20% to 30% relative humidity. Sev - eral tests were also performed at 27NC. CCP was cut, weighed, and measured for surface 16 Carbonless Copy Paper3 EXPOSURE3 EXPOSURE Carbonless Carbon Paper 17area. It was then placed into wash bottles (0.25-L), and air was passed through them atthe rate of 0.1 L/min. Charcoal (for solventanalysis) or Amberlite XAD (coated with2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine for aldehydeanalyses) was used to collect the emissions for30 to 60 min. Solvent concentrations weremeasured using gas chromatography (GC),and aldehyde analyses were performed withliquid chromatography. The relative solventemissions calculated were based on mea - surement times, surface area, and amounts of solvent/aldehyde released. Mann-Whitney'srank sum test was used for testing the statisti - cal significance of paired t-values. Norb\u00e4ck [1983b] found small but measurable amountsof formaldehyde (0.1 to 0.3 mg/m 3; detection level=0.3 mg/kg per hr) in 3 fresh CCPsamples. No glutaraldehyde was detected(detection level=0.1 mg/kg per hr). No alde-hyde emissions were detected from any of thepapers that were 1 to 2 years old. One weekafter the microcapsules had been crushed, fourof the five solvents studied were still beingreleased in measurable quantities, includingmonoisopropyl biphenyl (MIPB), kerosene,phenylxylylethane, and diisopropylbiphenyl\u2014but not hydrogenated terphenyl. The keroseneemissions ranged from 5 to 60 mg/m 3, with the two CCP samples not linked to work-relatedrespiratory tract symptoms yielding the lowestkerosene emissions. On the basis of this obser - vation, the author tested three different groups of kerosene-containing CCP, some of whichhad observed links with work-related respira - tory tract symptoms. He demonstrated in this study that no links existed between mucousmembrane symptoms and kerosene emissions.He also showed that there were no statisticallydemonstrable trends toward a link betweenwork-related respiratory tract symptoms andhigh kerosene emissions\u2014even where all CCPsassociated with respiratory symptoms werecombined, and regardless of the solvent content.This difference was attributed to the differencein encapsulation processes (MIPB used \"poly - mer,\" and hydrogenated terphenyl used gela - tin). The author noted that the kerosene concentrations in the wash bottles were 10 to100 times higher than those measured in thebreathing zones of workers involved in inten - sive manual handling of CCP. The author also concluded that aldehyde emissions from CCPwere not likely to explain the irritative mucousmembrane symptoms among workers who han-dle such paper. Table 3-2 demonstrates howwriting on CCP (and thereby crushing themicrocapsules) affects the solvent emissionsfrom the paper. Norb\u00e4ck and G\u00f6the 1983. In a Swedish study, Norb\u00e4ck and G\u00f6the [1983] collected personaland area samples in Stockholm at 11 officeswhere large quantities of CCP were handledand at five printing shops where form (mani - fold) sets of CCP were produced. The mea - surements were made from January 1980 to November 1981, mainly during the winter halfof the year (the period in which problems Table 3-2. Solvent emissions from CCP with intact microcapules and 1% crushed microcapsules (mg/m 2per hour) CCP form treatment Kerosene emissions MIPB emissions Unused 0.35 0.33 Crushed 0.243 EXPOSURE 18 Carbonless Copy Paperwere reported). Workers from 10 of the offices studied had been referred to the clinic of Occu - pational Medicine at Southern Hospital be - cause of health problems associated with handling CCP. The authors measured ambienttemperatures, relative humidities, and ventila - tion efficiencies. As a measure of the chemical emissions from CCP, airborne concentrationsof the solvents from microcapsules wereanalyzed using activated charcoal tubes. Thecarbon-disulfide-desorbed solvents were ana - lyzed by GC, and detection limits varied be - tween 0.001 and 0.02 mg/m 3. Airborne concentrations of total dust, dust-bound solvent, solvent in the vapor phase,and formaldehyde were also determined in alaboratory situation using a 34-m 3room with an air-exchange rate of 0.8 times/hr. Thirtysheets of each type of paper were handled ina standardized procedure for 60 min. Table 3-3shows that airborne solvent concentrationsare generally low, and they are considerablylower in the office environment than inthe printing shop. Area samples were alsoconsistently lower than personal samples, suggesting that manual handling generatesairborne solvent. For example, kerosene (whichis relatively volatile) had the highest airborneconcentrations, whereas the hydrogenatedterphenyls (whose volatility is low) producedunmeasurable concentrations. The dataindicate that various paper types generatedsimilar concentrations of dust during stan - dardized paper handling in the laboratory. The airborne formaldehyde concentrations were below the limit of detection (<0.05 mg/m 3). This finding does not support formaldehyde as thecause of the health effects. The particle-boundsolvents were also consistently below thedetection limit (<0.0002 mg/m 3), which corre - sponds to a dust solvent content of less than 1% by weight. Norb\u00e4ck and G\u00f6the [1983] con-cluded that no obvious climatic differenceswere evident between the two environments,even though health problems occurred in theoffices and not in the printing shops. The au-thor observed that these health problems occurin offices with both high and low levels of Table 3-3.

The solvent concentrations wererelatively higher in printing shops than inoffices, but the number of health problemsin the printing shops was low. The authorscited a study by Hasegawa et al. [1973] thatfound a diisopropylnaphthalene concentrationof 0.3 mg/m 3in the air at a sorting department in which each worker daily handled 50,000 to70,000 CCP sheets containing the solvent.They also cited an unpublished report byDodds [1980] who found hydrated terphenylconcentrations in the ppb range during the pro - duction of microcapsules containing color for - mer dissolved in hydrogenated terphenyls.Norb\u00e4ck and G\u00f6the [1983] conclude that themeasured dust concentrations did not containsolvents in sufficient quantity to be associatedwith primary irritation. This study is unclear asto whether encapsulated CCP solvent attachedto airborne fibers is extractable by carbondisulfide and is thus included in measurementsof dust-bound solvent. This study did not con-sider the effect of high local concentrations ofsolvent on the epidermis when a microcapsulefractures. Also unresolved are the relative skinexposures for workers in offices and printingplants. Although printing plant workers pro-cess a far greater tonnage of paper than officeworkers, its not clear whether printing plantworkers have more or even as much skin con - tact as CCP users in offices.Olsen and M\u00f8rck 1985. Olsen and M\u00f8rck [1985] extensively studied a brand of CCP thatwas dominant in the Scandinavian countries atthat time. They performed gas chromatogra - phy/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis,finger analysis of the residual CCP componentson the skin, analysis of keyboard surfaces ofcomputers and typewriters, microbiologicalanalysis of the microcapsules, analysis of themucous membranes of the nose, electron mi - croscope studies of the skin using tape beforeand after handling CCP, dust measurements,and headspace analysis of CCP emissions. Theauthors found that hydrogenated terphenyls aretransferred to the skin (120 /c70g per sorting finger) along with their impurities of bi-,tetra-, and pentaphenyls, but they did not findkerosene in detectable amounts owing to itsvolatile nature. The ratio of hydrogenated ter - phenyls to kerosene in the microcapsules was1:3; but after rupture, analysis of the CFlayer revealed that more than half of the ker - osene had evaporated. Analysis of exposedworkers' mucous membrane secretionsfailed to reveal any CCP components. Head - space analysis demonstrated that keroseneevaporated from the CCP without mechani - cal rupture of the microcapsules (value notgiven). The amount evaporating increasedafter rupture (the highest concentration foundin room air was 1.9 mg/m 3[0.3 ppm]), but hy - drogenated terphenyls were not released intothe air as vapor. Analysis of keyboards re-vealed concentrations of hydrogenated ter-phenyls and transfer of this compound totelephones, table tops, etc. in the office. Mea-surements of total dust ranged from 0.11 to0.21 mg/m 3, and no chemical components of the CCP were associated with it. No growth offungi or bacteria resulted from the incubationof microcapsules, but one base paper sample(not CCP) supported the growth of actino-mycetes at 50 NC. Electron microscopy did not show transfer of the clay/kaolin components tothe hands after 3 hr of handling CCP.Apol and Thoburn 1986, Chovil et al. 1986,and Burton and Malkin 1993. See Section 4.2.1 for a discussion of these studies.Omland et al. 1993. See Section 4.2.3.2 for a discussion of this study.Zimmer and Hadwen 1993. In response to a request from the management of the FederalRecords Center in Dayton, Ohio, Zimmer andHadwen [1993] investigated six worker com - plaints of an overpowering, irritating odor inthe archives area where Federal tax records andX-ray films were stored. Acetic acid was theapparent source. Concentrations of acetic acid and cyclohexane were below the NIOSH RELsof 25 and 1,050 mg/m 3, respectively. Formal - dehyde concentrations were 0.023, 0.024, and exceeding the NIOSH REL of 0.02 mg/m3. The most likely source of the formaldehyde was theCCP records located throughout the center. Thompson 1996. Thompson [1996] reported measurements of indoor air quality in an un - published U.S. study of 75 workers who con - tinuously handled CCP in the finance and accounting building of a university. This build - ing had a history of indoor air quality problems and medical complaints from workers datingfrom 1992. The relative humidity, temperature,and mold and fungus counts were within theAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigerating,and Air-Conditioning (ASHRAE) limits of 40% to 60% relative humidity, 74 to 78 /c69F temperature, and low indoor spore counts (rel-ative to outside counts for mold and fungus)[ASHRAE 1981]. The carbon dioxide concen-tration was 1,000 theASHRAE standard [ASHRAE 1989]. Correc - tive actions to the ventilation system included repair of the heating, ventilating, andair-conditioning system, increased outsidefresh air supply, earlier air-handling startuptimes, and increased air circulation (which de - creased carbon dioxide concentrations to 400 to 700 ppm). Area air samples were collected in two loca - tions of the CCP building and compared with an air sample from another building that had60 occupants, no history of medical com - plaints, and minimal use of CCP. GC/MS standards were prepared from the CCP forms(all three sheets, top sheets alone, and bottomsheets alone) and a sample of SurSol 290 (asolvent carrier for dyes used in the productionof the microcapsules). Table 3-4 lists the con-centrations of chemicals found in these sam-ples.

Thenumber of workers who reported symptoms wasnot given, but the report stated that the incidenceof symptoms was higher among the 22 em - ployed in the purchasing section than in the 16 employed in the vouchers section. Several for - mer employees reported that their symptoms ceased when they terminated employment.Formaldehyde was measured inside a closedcabinet containing CCP forms, and the levelwas found to be just above the limit of detec-tion. Other measurements were obtained forhydrocarbons linked to toner solvent from acopy machine and for chlorinated solventslinked with correction fluid, waxes, glues, etc.Interviews were conducted at four other officeswhere workers handled CCP forms. Workersreported no symptoms in the press office, whereforms were handled for printing and gluing.In the personnel office, where forms werehandled but not typed on, one worker reportedtransient skin irritation. Two of four workersin the mail and supply office reported skin ir - ritation. In the central receiving office, two workers complained of odor and headacheswhen using continuous-roll copy paper; how - ever, the report did not note whether this paper was CCP. Alterations in the air-handlingsystem (which were engineered to exceed theminimum rate for office spaces) did not reducethe reported symptoms. The author stated thatthe reported symptoms were probably causedby CCP based on the available scientificliterature, but she offered no definitive scien - tific evidence in support of this conclusion.Recommendations from the available litera - ture were suggested to improve the comfort and health of the workers, but no followupsurvey was reported. 3.2.2.2 Hazelton Laboratories 1985 A NIOSH docket submission by Hazelton Laboratories [1985] (Final Report, March 11,1985: A Study to Determine the Potential Ema - nation of Formaldehyde Vapor from Carbon - less Copy Paper) describes an investigation performed for a member of the U.S. CCP in - dustry to determine the potential emanation of formaldehyde vapor from CCP. The experiments were performed in a glove box to measure the following: (1) the maximumformaldehyde air concentration (collected withimpinger and measured using NIOSH Method 125 [NIOSH 1994]) produced by a set numberof sheets of CCP and (2) the effects of mark-ing and separating four-ply CCP forms on theemission of formaldehyde. The experimentsalso evaluated the effects of ventilation on theformaldehyde concentrations from various typesof CCP. The formaldehyde concentration inthe glove box ranged from 0 to 0.7 ppm for theCF and the \"self-contained black\" paper, re - spectively. Those products containing black ink produced substantially higher formalde - hyde concentrations than those containing blue ink. A model was developed from the kineticexperiments to predict air concentrations offormaldehyde attributable to handling CCP inthe office environment. Product test methods. An aluminum pouch containing the papers was placed in the 285-Lchamber for testing. Table 3-5 presents thedata for turning 2 or 6 sheets/min using a vary - ing number of total sheets turned. Chamber concentration of formaldehyde increased as3 EXPOSURE Carbonless Copy Paper 21the number of exposed sheets increased. An- other test (Table 3-6) was performed to deter-mine whether the rate of turning would affect the final concentration of formaldehyde inthe test chamber immediately after turningand 60 and 90 min after turning. When mea-sured immediately after turning, concentra - tions decreased as the turning rate increased. But concentrations varied little when measured60 and 90 min after the tests. This result indi - cates that the rate-limiting factor for total form - aldehyde released from CCP is the amount of time spent equilibrating with the environment. The final test method evaluated was an emission rate study. In this study, 120 sheets of paperwere placed in the chamber and turned at a rateof 4 sheets/min. Short-interval sampling beganwith the initiation of the page turning and con - tinued for 90 min (Table 3-7). The chamber air achieved a constant formaldehyde concentra - tion in less than 30 min. The initial rate of formaldehyde release was 0.098 /c70g/sheet per min. This rate was calculated from the firstsample by considering the 0.310- /c70g/L concen- tration as the midpoint concentration between 0/c70g/L and equilibrium, and by assuming an approximately linear increase in the airborneconcentration of formaldehyde over the15-min sampling period. Product testing. Three replicate sets of eight types of CCP were tested by placing 60 sheetsof CCP in the chamber and turning them ata rate of 4 sheets/min. They remained stackedin the chamber for 15 min and were then re - turned to the foil packages for the duration of the air sampling, which was conducted for20 min at a rate of approximately 0.5 L/min.The airborne concentrations of formaldehydein the test chamber averaged from 0.009 to0.693 ppm (Table 3-8). Little formaldehydewould be expected from the CF since itcontains no microcapsules. All types of theCB and CFB with black ink produced higheraverage formaldehyde concentrations than didthe blue ink counterpart.

The study director stated that the total formaldehyde release for the four-partform could be predicted from the sum of itsparts. Office activities. Experiments were performed to examine the effects of office activities onformaldehyde emissions from CCP. Four-plyCCP forms were manipulated by marking, sep - arating marked forms, and separating un - marked forms. /c167Marking forms : Four-ply forms were used to examine the effects of markingon the emission of formaldehyde vapor.Thirty forms (120 sheets) were placedinside the chamber for each test. A tem - plate was used to achieve consistent pen - cil lines. The desired rate of marking was 40 lines/minute, 20 lines/form,repeated four times throughout the 1-hrsampling period. This rate wasachieved on the second test; the firsttest averaged a rate of approximately28.7 lines/min. The sampling flow ratewas approximately 0.5 L/min. The maximum average formaldehyde con-centration for two replicates was0.402 ppm after 1 hr. /c167Marking and separating forms : Four-ply forms were used to examine the effectsof marking and separating pages on theemission of formaldehyde vapor. Thirtyforms (120 sheets) were placed insidethe chamber for each test and a templatewas used to achieve consistent pencillines. Each form was marked with 20lines and separated in 1 min. After the30-min marking and separating period,the forms were left exposed in the cham - ber the rest of the 1-hr sampling process. The sampling rate was approximately 0.5 L/min. The maximum average formalde - hyde concentration for 2 replicates was 0.402 ppm after 1 hr. /c167Separating unmarked forms : Four-ply forms were used to examine the effectsof separating unmarked forms on theemission of formaldehyde vapor.

Sheets wereseparated at the rate of 1 form or4 sheets/min. After the 30-min separat - ing procedure, the sheets were left ex - posed in the chamber for the rest of the 1-hr sampling process. The samplingflow rate was approximately 0.5 L/min.The maximum average formaldehydeconcentration for 3 replicates was0.37 ppm after 1 hr. /c167Ventilation studies : Four types of paper were used to examine the effect ofventilation on the concentration of form - aldehyde in the chamber air. For each test, 120 sheets of paper were placedinside the chamber. Page turning, venti-lation, and sampling all began at timezero. Pages were turned at the rate of4 sheets/min for 30 min and were leftexposed in the chamber for the final30 mins. Ventilation and sampling werecontinuous for the full hr. Ventilationwas simulated by forcing compressed airinto the chamber and allowing the air toflow out through a hole in the rear of thechamber. The ventilation rate was ap-proximately 0.5 air change/hr for CB-15blue, CB-15 black, and self-contained-17 black. This rate was obtained by using aflow rate of 2.6 to 2.9 L/min. Ventilationfor SC-14 black was approximately 1 airchange/hr, obtained by using a flow rateof 5.1 L/min. The sampling flow ratewas approximately 0.5 L/min. The re - sults are shown in Table 3-9. The release of formaldehyde for the combined marking and separating activity demonstrateda value between the maximum concentrationsfor either activity measured alone. The maxi - mum average formaldehyde concentration was 0.402 ppm after 1 hr for 2 replicates for mark - ing and separating. Marking the forms (maxi - mum average formaldehyde concentration was0.497 ppm after 1 hr for two replicates) had a greater impact on the release of formaldehydethan did separating them (maximum averageformaldehyde concentration was 0.37 ppm af - ter 1 hr for 3 replicates). The results permitted the investigator to develop a formula for pre - dicting formaldehyde release in the office en - vironment. Using the rate constants developed (the assumptions and calculations used werenot provided), the investigator predicted aformaldehyde concentration of 0.033 ppmfor a worker confined to a 1,000 ft 3room with no ventilation while marking and separat - ing 30 four-ply forms/hr for 8 hr. This value is between the NIOSH recommended ex posure limit (REL) of 0.016 ppm as an 8-hr time-weighted average (TWA) (with a 15-min ceiling limit of 0.1 ppm) and the OSHA per-missible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.75 ppm as an8-hr TWA (with a 2-ppm short-term exposurelimit [STEL]). 3.3 Conclusions Little consistency has been found in the litera-ture when various investigators elected to per-form air sampling analyses to assess potentialexposure to CCP and its components as sum-marized in Table 3-1. The most frequentlychosen analyte was formaldehyde. Of theseven studies reporting formaldehyde concen - trations (summarized in Table 3-10), nearly all measurements exceeded the NIOSH REL of0.016 ppm as an 8-hr TWA with a 15-minceiling limit of 0.1 ppm [NIOSH 1981]; how - ever, none exceeded the OSHA PEL of 0.75 ppm as an 8-hr TWA with a short-termexposure limit of 2 ppm [29 CFR 1910.1048].Short-term exposures to this strong-smellinggas cause eye, nose, and throat irritation insome persons at concentrations of <1 ppm. At5 to 30 ppm, formaldehyde causes cough,chest tightness, unusual heartbeat, and lowerairway and chronic pulmonary obstruction[NIOSH 1998; standard [29 253 EXPOSURE 26 Carbonless Copy PaperTable 3-9.

Reg.22290 (1992)]. A full discussion of the healtheffects of formaldehyde is beyond the scopeof this review. Reported measurements for kerosene and total dust were far below the occupationalexposure limits. The NIOSH REL for kero - sene is 100 mg/m a 40-hr workweek [NIOSH 1977]. No NIOSH REL has been established for total dust.OSHA has a PEL of 5 mg/m 3for the respira - ble fraction of particulates not otherwise regulated [29 CFR 1910.1000(z)(1)].

Symptoms of kerosene exposure include eye, skin, nose, and throatirritation; burning sensation in the (if liquid kerosene is aspirated). Airborne exposures at concentrations cited inthe CCP studies are not likely to lead to eye orupper respiratory irritation. Quantitation ofskin exposure to kerosene from CCP has notbeen reported. However, skin contact withCCP containing kerosene or its componentscould result in skin irritation. Carbonless Copy Paper 273 EXPOSURE4 Health Effects 4.1 Introduction During the early 1970s, manufacturers, employers, and occupational safety and health organizations received numerous com - plaints of skin and mucous membrane symp - toms related to handling or working in close proximity to CCP [Calnan 1979; G\u00f6the et al.1981; Parmeggiani 1983]. The association ofCCP with cases of occupational contact derma-titis was first investigated by Calnan [1979],who also reviewed reactions to ordinary car-bon paper, which CCP has largely replaced.According to Calnan, proven allergic contactdermatitis from carbon paper was a rarity. Fourearly outbreaks of CCP health effects were de-scribed by Calnan [1979] and G\u00f6the et al.[1981] at a scientific symposium in Stockholmin 1981. Although skin-patch tests were nega-tive and therefore did not support allergic con-tact dermatitis as the mechanism of CCP healtheffects, five pieces of evidence indicated an oc - cupational origin for the CCP symptoms: /c167The reporting of symptoms from several workers in a number of unrelated andunconnected companies /c167The receipt of customer complaints byall of the CCP manufacturers /c167The similarity of reported symptoms andsigns /c167The similarity of complaints from differ - ent countries /c167The absence of reported symptoms be - fore the introduction of CCPCalnan [1979] concluded that the reactions appeared to be toxic (i.e., irritant) rather thanallergic because the affected workers wereable to continue working in the same generalenvironment without immediate recurrence oftheir symptoms and because many of theworkers related their symptoms to periods ofintensive work handling large amounts ofCCP. Calnan [1979] noted that the CCP manufactur- ers had reported an absence of skin, oral, ocu-lar, or respiratory tract symptoms among theirown workers employed in packing large quan-tities of CCP. However, subsequent investiga-tions identified health problems in thesegroups as well. Calnan also pointed out that allCCP complaints were associated with usedCCP paper, indicating that the rupture of themicrocapsules containing the color formersand solvents may be important\u2014even thoughonly a small proportion of capsules in eachsheet of paper are broken. Ultimately, Calnanconcluded that the eye, nose, mouth, and throatsymptoms were caused not by the color formerchemicals but rather by the encapsulated sol - vents, which would presumably have to evapo - rate to cause other than dermal symptoms. In a review of the evidence, Buring and Hennekens [1991] found most of the availablestudies on CCP health effects to be criticallylacking epidemiologically and difficult to in - terpret. They were able to find no \"analytic studies\" of CCP health effects for review.However, they concluded that unequivocal ev - idence was not likely ever to be available, even with great expenditure of effort and resources. 28 Carbonless Copy PaperThey recommended instead that consideration be given to \"implementing measures to preventor reduce the frequency\" of the reported ef - fects. Murray [1991] also conducted a review of the potential health effects of CCP exposure atthe request of the Commission of the EuropeanCommunities. He noted an absence of docu - mented cases of skin disorders among workers in the manufacturing industry\u2014despite the factthat workers in this industry would be ex - pected to have much higher exposures than office workers. On the basis of both his reviewof the literature and his experiences as a con - sultant for a manufacturer of CCP, Murray concluded that although individual casesof sensitivity to CCP components would con-tinue to be reported, a \"negligible\" threat isposed to the health of producers and users. Since 1991, additional studies (including some that qualify as analytical epidemiology) haveappeared in the scientific literature. The fol-lowing review considers not only informationpublished in the scientific literature but alsoinformation that was submitted to NIOSH inresponse to announcements in the Federal Register in 1987 and 1997. More than 14,000 pages of combined submissions were receivedin response to the 1987 and 1997 Federal Reg - ister notices. Most of the submissions were made after the latter notice. No materials wereaccepted or reviewed if the submitter consid - ered the items to contain proprietary informa - tion that could not be made available to the public. Information that contained personalidentifiers was blocked out unless thesubmitter wanted the information to remainpublic. The following review of CCP health effects separately considers the information fromhuman and animal studies.4.2 Human Studies Human studies of CCP have dealt mostlywith exposures in office settings. Three typesof human studies of CCP have been con - ducted: individual case studies or case series, cross-sectional studies, and laboratory studiesin humans. The following sections separatelyreview each type of study. 4.2.1 Published Case Reports and Case Series The case report is a detailed profile of a single subject; case series describe the characteristicsof a number of patients with a given disease.Case reports and series document unusual fea-tures of a disease or a patient's exposure his-tory; they are a type of descriptiveepidemiologic assessment. Case reports andseries can present a major problem ininterpretability because the presence of anyrisk factor may be simply coincidental. Theirusefulness is generally limited by the lack of acomparison group (i.e., persons without suchsymptoms who had similar opportunity for ex-posure). The lack of a formal comparisongroup in these studies can make it difficult todetermine whether the observed associationsrepresent more than the normal backgroundrate of disease. Lack of a comparison group isparticularly problematic when the cases in - volve common diseases or symptoms and when the exposure is relatively common(which is clearly the case with these reports forCCP exposures). In the absence of a compari - son group, case reports and series can provide the first clues to the identification of new dis - eases or exposure effects, and they are poten - tially useful for formulating research questions; however, the evidence usually can - not be used to test hypotheses [Buring and Hennekens 1991]. On the other hand, whencharacteristic symptoms and clinical signsvary over time in direct correspondence with4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 29changing work exposures, it may be possible to reliably discern a causal relationship. Further - more, some of these reports included individ - ual experiments in which subjects were exposed to CCP or its components and objec - tive signs and symptoms were evaluated fol - lowing these exposures. These studies can provide stronger evidence for causality thanordinary case reports that are based on subjec - tive reports of past experiences. Table 4-1 lists 39 currently available, pub - lished case reports and case series related to CCP, including a number of series assembledin NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluations(investigations conducted under the authorityof the Occupational Safety and Health Act of1970 [29 USC *1900]). Nine reports provided information about the experience of a singleworker. In the case series, ranging from 2 to276 workers, symptoms were generally clus-tered within a defined period and involved anumber of employees at a single workplace,often situated in a single room or activity. Theobserved symptoms varied considerably fromsite to site, but most included skin problemssuch as itching, rash, dryness, and eczema aswell as mucous membrane irritation,particularly of the eyes, mouth, nose, and throat.Lower respiratory problems were less frequent.Headache was also reported as a problem (to asmaller extent), and fatigue was alsomentioned. The following are summaries of the studies outlined in Table 4-1. Magnusson 1974 . Magnusson [1974] con - ducted his investigation in Sweden at a workplace where 15 of 18 women workingwith CCP had reported itching and dryness ofthe skin, lips, tip of nose, and eyes as well asburning sensations or dryness in the mouth. The *United States Code . See USC in references.symptoms mostly appeared a few weeks after the first exposure to CCP. Seven of the 15women showing symptoms were skin-patchtested using the paper in question and a stan - dard series. All tests were negative but one, which showed reaction to nickel and cobalt.Symptoms disappeared after introduction of anew type of paper containing a resin to bind theclay material. Hannuksela 1975. A report by Hannuksela [1975] (unavailable to NIOSH but cited byJeansson et al. [1983]) found 20 workersamong several hundred in a Swedish bank whosuspected that eczema on their hands wascaused by contact with CCP. None of the 19workers who were skin-patch tested with aCCP bottom sheet emulsion showed an allergicreaction. One later case was reported as posi-tive, with most of the complaints attributed tophysical factors (such as abrasiveness) relatedto CCP. Wahlberg 1975. In a personal communication reported by Jeansson et al. [1983], Wahlbergfound the CCP-related problems to be rela-tively evenly distributed between two maintypes of CCP used in Sweden at the time\u2014clay- and polymer-based papers. He suggestedthat a finely distributed dust arising from leaf - ing through and tearing the paper was a likely explanation of the symptoms. Hirvonen et al. 1976. Hirvonen et al. [1976] obtained positive skin-patch test reactions forirritation in 4 of 32 cases associated with CCPfrom a total of 1,050 cases of occupationaldermatitis in Sweden during the period 1973 to1976. In all four cases, the rash began in areastypical of paper contact\u2014the finger tips of oneor both hands and the outer edges of the hand.The eyelids of one worker also revealed a rash.Of the four patients, two reacted only to the topside of the paper but not to the CB or CF por - tions.

Carbonless Copy Paper 354 HEALTH EFFECTS4 HEALTH EFFECTS 36 Carbonless Copy Papersurfaces of the papers. Tests on the ingredients of the papers were negative. The authors attrib - ute the reactions to nonspecific irritation of the skin. Maggio et al. 1978. Maggio et al. [1978] reported an investigation of the chemical com - position of CCP in Italy. They identified or - ganic dyes dissolved in mineral oil or PCBs enclosed in the microcapsules made ofurea-formaldehyde resins or gelatin. Thesymptoms reported by those using CCP wereskin complaints such as acne and general com - plaints such as headache, nausea, and uncom - fortable olfactory sensations. The authors assumed the symptoms to be related to thePCB exposure. Andanson et al. 1979. In France, Andanson et al. [1979] described the chemical compositionof CCP and the spectrum of symptoms result-ing from handling sheets of CCP directly orpossibly from contact with vapor. The onset ofsymptoms (reported by 27 of 35 exposedworkers) varied but generally developed a fewweeks after first exposure. The authors men-tioned symptoms of the skin (pruritus of un-covered areas on the hands, face, forearms,thorax, and legs), eyes (pruritus, conjunctivalhyperemia with tearing and photophobia), andrespiratory system (pruritus, by rhinorrhea, edema, and one case of true immediateasthma). The authors noted that chemical in - formation from the manufacturers was inade - quate to relate the symptoms to the exposure and that office environments involved nonex - istent or inadequate ventilation. The authors reported that symptoms disappeared soon afterexposure ended. They considered the irritantsymptoms definitive but performed no tests toassess the allergic potential. The authors con - cluded that while some of the cases were rela - tively severe, they did not consider them \"a great historic pathology.\"Calnan 1979, 1981. Calnan [1979, 1981] re - ported on three episodes of complaints from various types of office workers in the UnitedKingdom who attributed their symptoms to theuse of CCP. The first episode occurred in 1965in a group of nine women who worked withbusiness forms in an enclosed computer roomat an insurance company. Within a few weeksof the introduction of CCP, several of thewomen complained of itchy hands, swolleneyelids, and headaches. Skin-patch testing tothe paper and all of its constituents was nega - tive. At the time, the solvent for the ink was chlorobiphenyl (a PCB), which was suspectedas the causal agent. When ventilation in theworkroom was improved, the episode sub - sided. Soon afterwards, the PCB use was dis - continued by all manufacturers. A second episode occurred in 1975 and in- volved two men working intensively over along, hot weekend checking a large number offorms in a small office. One reported a burningsensation on his face and forehead, fatigue,thirst, sore throat and tongue, chills, and achinglimbs. He recovered in a few days withouttreatment, returned to the office to continue hiswork, and suffered a recurrence of the samesymptoms. The other man was similarly butless severely affected and had small, itchy blis - ters on the centers of his palms. The third episode described by Calnan occurred in 1976 in a small office where all four workerscomplained of similar symptoms whenever theyhandled large amounts of CCP. They reporteda burning sensation of the lips and tongue, soreeyes, dry throat, and some dryness of the skin. Calnan [1979] also reported on complaints from three users of CCP made in Japan. Thecomplaints included nausea, sore eyes andthroat, and skin irritation (see Table 4-1).Among all of these reported episodes, no workers changed jobs or were forced to stopwork. All skin test investigations were nega - tive, and the CCP came from different manufacturers. Calnan hypothesized that ifthere was a responsible agent, it was mostlikely to be the solvent in the could Cronin [1980] that four workers involved in the making of microcap - sules for CCP in the United Kingdom were found with eczema of the hand (which hadbeen present in one worker for 4 years) orpalms (present in one worker for 10 years).Two Proxel compounds (Imperial ChemicalIndustries) were used as preservatives for gela-tin in a factory making the emulsion for CCP.Both contained the active ingredient 1,2-ben-zisothiazolin-3-one, and one also containedethylenediamine. Both the active ingredientand the Proxel provoked positive skin-patchtest reactions in all four workers, but theethylenediamine provoked a response in onlytwo of them [Kanerva et al. 1993]. The authorconcluded that two of the workers' eczemapredated their contact with the agents, and thesensitization was thought to be an aggravatingfactor in their dermatitis rather than its com - plete cause. Another dermatitis case was cited in a paper mill worker. Dodds and Butler 1981. In Belgium in 1975, these investigators described five femaleworkers who handled paper forms and reportedskin and eye irritation (specifically eczema,itching, and red spots). An additional 12 work - ers reported itching of the eyes. The incident coincided with the use of a new desensitizingink (\"D-ink,\" a coating to disable the color for - mation process). Before the use of this ink, no symptoms had been reported for 7 years. Ahamster cheek-pouch test resulted in transientischemia that lasted approximately 15 min.Detailed studies of the new desensitizing for - mula led to the conclusion that one of its ingre - dients (1-hydroxyethyl-2-oleylimido-azoline) caused the severe effect. In a second case inDenmark, similar symptoms were reported af - ter workers handled paper that contained the same desensitizing ink. The manufacturer wasreported to have immediately terminated pro - duction of the formulation. Marks 1981. Marks [1981] reported the fol - lowing case of a 21-year-old woman in the United States who had a 1.5-year history of anintermittent eruption of the face and neck. Sheworked as a clerk in a college registrar's officewhere CCP forms were used for student regis - tration. Within 24 to 48 hr after using the forms, she developed pruritic, erythematous,and edematous dermatitis. She was skin-patchtested with a standard series of allergens aswell as with pieces of paper and the compo-nents of the paper backing. She reacted to threeof the four colored sheets of CCP. She alsotested positive to the color former, identified asparatoluene sulfinate of Michler's hydrol, acomponent of furtherskin-patch tested with paratoluene sulfonic acid(results were negative) and with the Michler's hydrol (4,4 /c78-bis[dimethylamino]benzhydrol) (results were positive). Twelve control subjectstested negative to the paper and coatingmaterials. Menn\u00e9 et al. 1981. Menn\u00e9 et al. [1981] per - formed an investigation resulting from 70 complaints at a telephone company in Den - mark that employed 2,600 workers who han - dled up to 900,000 sets of CCP per year (i.e., an average of 1.3 sets per person per day). Theyfirst investigated 38 of the complaints andfound that 26 workers had skin symptomsonly, 9 had skin and mucous membrane symp - toms, and 3 had mucous membrane symptoms only. Among the workers with skin symptoms,22 reported that they started on the hands, and4 reported that they began on the face. The skin4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 37symptoms were temporary redness, burning, and itching that occurred after 2 to 3 hr ofwork; they disappeared overnight or over theweekend. Itching of the eyes or the nose,hoarseness, and burning in the mouth werethe other symptoms recorded. Twenty-nine ofthe 38 received standard skin-patch tests, and11 were found with one or more reactions.Twenty-five workers were further skin-patchtested with 17 paper substances and withthe paper. Eight workers were tested with thepaper components plus the paper, but noreactions were observed. Other tests includedprick testing, photo-patch testing, open tests onthe forehead (dab testing), and short-termpatch testing for 20 min. All results werenegative. The three skin-prick tests using thepaper components were negative. Eight werephoto-patch tested, and eight had open-patchtests to assess phototoxicity, but all reactionswere negative. Twenty-six were skin-pricktested with two types of CCP; six reacted toone type, and five reacted to the other type withreactions the size of one histamine equivalent.However, authors considered these responsesto be nonimmunological. Among the 35 con-trols, one had a positive reaction to one of theskin-paper prick tests. The controls were alsotested with 17 different components of the CCP;all tests were negative. The authors stated thatapproximately 4,000 separate tests were car - ried out without reaching any definite conclusions. Menn\u00e9 et al. [1981] also reported on the case of a worker from a different company who beganexperiencing redness of the face, headache,and dizzy spells on the day that a new deliveryof CCP was made. The worker's symptomsdisappeared 2 hr after he returned home. Twomonths later, the paper was replaced and hissymptoms disappeared. Chrostek and Moshell 1982. Chrostek and Moshell [1982] a walk-through sur - vey and administered nondirected medicalinterviews with 21 workers at a U.S. telephone company. These service department workersacted on reports of malfunctioning telephoneservice and requests for new services, whichwere printed on yellow CCP. Previously, car - bon paper had been used with no complaints. The following health complaints were de - scribed after the introduction of CCP: eye itch - ing and burning, nose itching and burning, dry throat, headaches, facial itching, and sinus,skin, and respiratory problems. Some of theworkers stated that the adverse health prob - lems existed only when handling yellow CCP\u2014not white CCP. Five air samples werecollected for total dust; they ranged from 0.06to 0.2 mg/m 3. The two samples collected for formaldehyde were 0.22 mg/m3. Workers han - dling the CCP were asked to wear white cotton gloves, which were analyzed. The commoncontaminant in both the gloves and the CCPwas other contami-nants (diethyl detected in the gloves. Qualitativeanalysis of the carbonless paper did not detectformaldehyde. On May 13-14, 1981, a NIOSHdermatologist interviewed and examined 33workers. Of these, 28 were skin-patch testedwith unmarked white and yellow CCP and amarked yellow CCP. On the basis of the nega - tive skin-patch tests and a lack of skin findings consistent with allergic contact dermatitis, theauthors ruled out type IV allergic phenomenaas a major problem. However, they allowedthat certain individuals might have been aller - gic to a component of the paper. Levy and Hanoa 1982. Levy and Hanoa [1982] reported on an isolated epidemic thatoccurred in northern Norway when a new typeof invoice form (30,000 sets) had been intro - duced by a builder's supply company. During the first week of use, workers complainedabout an unpleasant odor, rashes, headaches,and itching eyes, face, and hands. Thirteen fe - male workers were examined in June 1979; six had serious symptoms and three exhibited mild4 HEALTH EFFECTS 38 Carbonless Copy Papersymptoms. These workers were again exam - ined in November 1979 when some CCP sets were still in circulation but most had beenreturned to the supplier. The complaints gradu - ally declined until none of the workers exhib - ited serious symptoms and eight had only mild symptoms. In September 1980, when none ofthe original CCP remained in use, only one ofthe workers (who had a previous history of al - lergy) complained of itching and irritation of the eyes. The solvent MIPB and associated im - purities (which had a characteristic odor) were suspected. Formaldehyde was not thought tobe of any importance in the incident. Roure et al. 1982. Roure et al. [1982] de - scribed subjective symptoms and objective signs occurring in 22 of 35 workers exposed ina French company during the introduction ofCCP. The following frequencies of subjectivesymptoms were observed: pruritis localized onthe hands (13 cases), face (9 cases), forearms(5 cases), or thorax and legs (1 themouth, burning, and taste perturbations(3 cases); and headache (3 cases). All symp-toms appeared as early as the start of the work - week, lessened in the evening, and disappeared on the weekends. Objective signs in 18 work - ers consisted of erythematous patches on the hands and face (9 cases), urticaria (1 case), mi - gratory edema (1 case), conjunctivitis with edema of conjunctival hy lacrimation rhinorrhea glottal stricture (1 case), nasal ob - struction (1 case), and spasmodic cough and asthmatic breathing (4 cases). An etiologic sur - vey showed evidence of previous allergies in three subjects and enabled a distinction to bemade between the risks due to \"transfer-contact\"and \"chemical-contact\" copy papers. Certin and Zissu 1983. Results of analyses requested of the French National Researchand Safety Institute were reported by Certin and Zissu [1983] and compared with otherpublished studies. They reported 51 requestsfor analysis of CCP during the 10 years pre - ceding publication of the results. Reasons stated in 46 of the requests included cutaneousproblems (allergies, irritation, pruritis, andchapping) (41), respiratory problems (12), oc - ular disorders conjunctivitis) (10), irritation andothers asthenia, anemia, headache,and arthralgias. According to the authors, derma - tological and respiratory problems seemed to be linked to the use of these papers and were morelikely to be due to irritation than to allergy. Norb\u00e4ck et al. 1983a,b,c; 1988. Norb\u00e4ck et al. [1983a] summarized conclusions from fivestudies in Sweden. Studies in 80 office workersobserved only eye and respiratory tract irrita-tion caused by CCP. Norb\u00e4ck et al. [1983b]found no correlations between airborne solventconcentrations from CCP and the occurrenceof irritative symptoms. Formaldehyde, glutar-aldehyde, and the organic solvents in which thecolor formers are dissolved were studied understandardized conditions. According to the au-thors, the emission of aldehydes from CCP wastoo low to cause the irritative symptoms. Thehighest airborne concentration was that of ker - osene, which could not be related to symptoms. Norb\u00e4ck et al. [1983c, 1988] searched for the discomfort-inducing factors in 276 papersamples (233 of which were CCP) submittedby workers claiming to have experiencedirritative symptoms while handling the papers.Interviews regarding symptoms and handlingvolume were conducted with subjects who hadsubmitted 190 of the CCP samples. To distin - guish between CCP of different makes, GC of paper extracts was performed, sometimescombined with thin-layer chromatography(TLC) of the color formers. Coded paper sam - ples were used to permit blind analyses of the4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 39papers and blind interviews of the exposed persons. The samples were extracted with car - bon disulfide, and the extracts were analyzed by GC or TLC. Most correlations of CCP withdiscomfort were not statistically significant butwere found in one brand of paper that usedMIPB as the solvent for the color formers.However, the authors concluded that the dis - comfort-inducing factor was unlikely to be MIPB because two types of MIPB paper wereon the market at the time of this study, but pa - tient complaints identified only one of them. CCPs treated with D-ink were more frequentlylinked to work-related skin symptoms thanthose not treated with the ink. This correlationwas statistically significant ( P<0.05). No such correlation was seen for mucous membraneirritation symptoms. The authors concluded thatthe causal factor was probably two desensitiz-ing inks available on the Swedish market dur-ing the investigation period (from January 1 toOctober 27, 1980)\u2014but not necessarily to D-inksin general. The suspected ingredient in one ofthe D-inks was 1-hydroxyethyl-2-oleylimido-azoline\u2014the same ink that had previously been associated with skin and eye irritation amongoffice staff in Belgium [Dodds and Butler 1981]. Jeansson et al. 1983, 1984. See Section 4.2.3.1 for a discussion of this study. Marks et al. 1984; Trautlein et al. 1984. A 27-year-old woman in the United States had an8-year history of pruritus, eye and throatirritation, hoarseness, irregular heartbeat,headache, nausea, tightness of the chest,shortness of breath, and fatigue within 30 minof exposure to CCP [Marks et al. 1984;Trautlein et al. 1984]. For 10 years, she hadworked in the same factory, which printed, cut,collated, and packaged CCP. She reported thather symptoms became progressively worse asshe processed greater amounts of CCP in herjob of removing and stacking forms from a col - lating machine. When working with regular paper, she was asymptomatic. Her symptomsdisappeared on weekends, nights, and after 1 hr of exposure to fresh air. On two occasions, shewas challenged in a controlled-blinded fashionwith portions of complete forms of the CCP.Both challenges resulted in contact urticaria ofthe hand that held the paper and changes in pul - monary function characteristic of upper airway obstruction. To determine whether alterationsin prostaglandin (PG) metabolism might ex - plain these findings, plasma PGF2 alpha and thromboxane B2 (both capable of causingthese symptoms) were measured before andduring the second exposure period. Both PGF2alpha and thromboxane B2 increased substan - tially. The authors concluded that the cutane - ous and respiratory symptoms induced by CCP were probably related to PG release andcaused by a chemical formed from the reac-tion of the color former with the color devel-oper, since the patient reacted only to thecomplete forms and not to the single sheets.When the patient was relocated within the fac-tory with no exposure to CCP, she wasasymptomatic. Similar symptoms were found in 9 of 59 workers in a subsequent plant survey. Thesymptoms reported by the 9 workers includedthroat irritation (8), skin itching (5), headache(4), hoarseness (3), difficulty breathing (3),chest tightness (3), rash (2), burning eyes (2),chest pain (2), nausea (1), weakness (1), andrapid heartbeat (1). A statistically significant(P<0.01) relationship existed between symp - toms and high exposure to CCP (compared with low exposure to CCP). Messite and Baker 1984; Messite and Fannick 1980. Messite and Baker [1984] summarized a number of NIOSH Health Haz - ard Evaluations dealing with indoor environ - mental quality and specifically reported on a previous study involving CCP [Messite andFannick 1980]. Six complaints of skin and eyeirritation among 100 office staff members andfaculty at a school were related to heavy CCP 4 HEALTH EFFECTS 40 Carbonless Copy Paperexposure during marking periods of 1 to 2 days. Analysis of the paper did not identifythe sensitizing agents or significant irritants.The problem was alleviated by spreading thetask of marking papers over several days andfrequent hand-washing during handling of thepaper. Menn\u00e9 and Hjorth and Hjorth [1985] reported from Denmark that frictionaltrauma with CCP to the palms and fingertipscan provoke dermatitis. Elimination of the ex - posure led to healing within 2 to 3 weeks. Three case histories of patients with frictionalcontact dermatitis were examined. Case 1 involved a 35-year-old male office worker. Each day for 2 years, he had handled100 to 200 documents written on CCP. Hegradually developed a scaling patch of dermati-tis on the left hypothenar, second finger, andtip of the right index finger at areas of contactwith paper. Standard skin-patch tests and pa-per- and glue-patch tests were negative. In Case 2, a 64-year-old female medical secre- tary spent long hours handling CCP. She hadnoted pruritic vesicles on the left palm surfaceof the thumb that was in contact with the paper.Eruptions decreased when she wore gloves.Standard skin-patch tests and patch tests to thecarbonless paper were negative. In Case 3, a 37-year-old male bus driver had a fissured eczema of the fingertips, apparentlycaused by tearing CCP tickets from the stub.The eczema cleared during holidays and onnight shifts when there were fewer passengers.Standard skin-patch tests and patch tests withthe ticket paper were negative. The histo - pathology of this type of dermatitis was char - acteristic, showing necrosis of prickle cells with intraepidermal vesicles and an absence ofspongiosis, which excludes a diagnosis ofchemical dermatitis. The authors concluded thatin patients with dermatitis of the palm or fin - gertips, frictional trauma should be considered. Olsen and M\u00f8rck 1985. See Section 4.2.3.2 for a discussion of this study. Apol and Thoburn 1986. Apol and Thoburn [1986] reported on an investigation requestedby an authorized representative of the Associa - tion of Western Pulp and Paper Workers in the United States. They examined employee expo - sure to diethylenetriamine (DETA), hexa - methylene diisocyanate (HMDI), and other chemicals used during the production of CCPat the Boise Cascade facility in Vancouver,Washington. This facility makes paper frompulp and applies CCP coatings to the paper.Personal breathing zone samples and areasamples were collected to determine workerexposures to chemicals used by the coaterpreparation operators, coating operators, andmaintenance personnel. The airborne concen-trations solvents (0.7 to 12 mg/m 3), and total particulate (one sample was 2.70 mg/m3). All the sample results were less than the regu - latory limits for these substances. Symptoms reported as a result of exposure included voicechange, cough (sometimes productive), tight - ness and soreness in the chest, running sinuses, and skin rashes. Medical interviews with 65 employees sug - gested that when the process was operating properly, few (number unspecified) healthcomplaints were associated with the coatingprocess. The maintenance workers had symp - toms associated with exposure to the coating equipment, with the HMDI equipment re - portedly being the worst offender. Four work - ers reported pulmonary symptoms consistent with exposure to diisocyanates. Breathing4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 41zone concentrations of biphenyl were below the limit of detection (i.e., <0.02 ppm),butylobiphenyl concentrations ranged from0.12 to 0.29 ppm, and ranged from 0.7 4.5 /c70g/m 3for coater and as - sistant coater operators. On the basis of the medical questionnaire data obtained during theinvestigation, the authors concluded that someworkers may have had pulmonary problems re - lated to past diisocyanate exposure. This inves - tigation is one of several that document CCP-attributable health effects at a CCP man - ufacturing facility. Bennett and Chrostek 1986. At the request of the management of the Defense Industrial Sup - ply Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, NIOSH evaluated possible excess cancerdeaths and respiratory problems encounteredamong workers [Bennett and Chrostek 1986].Measurements were taken for carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide, temperature, relative hu-midity, organic vapors, and airborne dust.Samples were taken of insulation, solventcleaners, and CCP used at the facility. Theamount of outside air being introduced into thebuilding was occasionally in the lowrange\u2014such that headaches and complaints ofrespiratory and mucous membrane problemscould develop, even though concentrations ofcarbon monoxide and carbon dioxide werewithin safe limits. In addition, the building wasovercrowded. The authors concluded that haz - ards were posed by inadequate ventilation, high temperatures, and low humidity. The au - thors recommended improvements in ventila - tion and the use of impermeable gloves when using solvents. However, they made no state - ments or recommendations about the use of CCP\u2014other than the possibility of formalde - hyde release. Chovil et al. 1986. Chovil et al. [1986] reported cases of eye irritation, sinusitis, derm - atitis, and psychological manifestations associated with an outbreak of a building-relatedillness at a U.S. university. As part of a build - ing expansion program in August 1983, the student advisement office was relocated to arenovated area on another floor. Shortly afterthe move, the nine-member staff began com - plaining of skin and mucous membrane irrita - tion. The presence of asbestos increased staff concern over their symptoms. Medical histo - ries were taken and clinical examinations were performed. Air flow in the ventilation systemwas evaluated. Seven staff members reportedsymptoms that they believed were work re - lated. All claimed that their symptoms oc - curred when they were in the file storage area or when they handled the files. Air-flow measurements indicated that any noxious agent originating from the files wouldtend to stay localized in the filing area insteadof being dispersed throughout the work area.An inquiry revealed that the university hadchanged suppliers of advisement forms com-posed of CCP in April 1983. The authors sug-gest that the outbreak was due to low-levelenvironmental pollution, probably originatingfrom the CCP in the forms. Reported symp-toms may have been exacerbated by the fear ofasbestos. In all but one case, symptoms weremild. The worker who exhibited severe symp - toms restricted contact with CCP and had no recurrence. The authors added that informal in - quiries revealed at least two workers in other departments who had symptoms of mucousmembrane irritation during periods of peak us - age of these forms (at the beginning of each se - mester). A followup 8 months later revealed that the staff members were no longer com - plaining about symptoms\u2014in spite of the fact that previous recommendations for improvingthe ventilation and for reducing CCP handlinghad not been implemented. Shehade et al. 1987. In the United Kingdom, Shehade et al. [1987] identified a case of aller - gic contact dermatitis associated with exposure to CVL in CCP. Skin-patch tests were4 HEALTH EFFECTS 42 Carbonless Copy Paperemployed to identify the cause of an irritant ve - sicular rash on the hands and fingers of a fe - male office worker whose occupation entailed the day-long handling of significant quantitiesof CCP. The symptoms developed within 2days of the subject's return to work after 18months of leave. They resulted in the patient'sstopping work after 3 weeks. Initial skin-patchtests to nickel sulfate, cobalt chloride, and fra - grance mix gave positive results, but there was no reaction to the CCP. The patient improvedduring 3 months on sick leave, but the condi - tion recurred severely as soon as she returned to work. Subsequent skin-patch tests to the fivecolor formers supplied by the manufacturer ofthe CCP showed an allergic reaction to CVL atconcentrations of 0.01% to 5%. The authorsconcluded that the patient was allergic to CVLand that CCP skin-patch tests with CCP onlyare not sufficient to detect allergies to colorformers. They therefore suggested that the colorformers themselves be used to test patientswith hand eczema and regular contact withCCP. LaMarte et al. 1988. Acute systemic reactions to CCP, including laryngeal edema, were re-ported in two U.S. office workers by LaMarteet al. [1988]. The first case was a 39-year-oldwoman with a 2-year history of recurring epi - sodes of hoarseness, coughing, flushing, pruri - tus, and rash appearing within 30 min of topical exposure to CCP. She was a clerk/typistwith frequent exposures to CCP during herworking hours. Cutaneous application testswere performed using six chemical ingredientsof CCP. Approximately 15 min after 1%alkylphenol novolac resin dispersion wasrubbed onto her forearm, she was noted to de - velop hoarseness, wheezing, and angioedema of both arms. A subsequent challenge with thematerial was followed by hoarseness, wheez - ing, and angioedema at the challenge site. Video endoscopy of the larynx was interpretedas showing diffuse swelling and marked edemaof the true vocal cords. Plasma histaminelevels obtained at the onset and peak of symp - toms were sixfold higher than the prechallenge level. The second case described by LaMarte et al. [1988] was a coworker of the patient in the firstcase. This 45-year-old woman had a 6-monthhistory of hoarseness, coughing, flushing, andlocalized angioedema subsequent to skin con - tact with CCP. She was challenged by rubbing 1% alkylphenol novolac resin onto one armand was reported to have angioedema of thearm and hoarseness 30 min after the challenge.The authors concluded that the reaction wasmast cell/basophil-mediated, that these casesdemonstrate a connection to a specific compo - nent of CCP, and that they indicate a poten - tially life-threatening adverse reaction in susceptible patients. Hammel 1990. Hammel [1990] reported the results of a NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluationof a U.S. consumer refrigeration manufactureremploying 2,600 workers, including 900 officepersonnel. CCP was used in all departments,but most users were in the export and purchas-ing departments. Medical interviews were per-formed for four workers who felt that theirhealth problems were associated with CCP ex - posure. Two of four workers had developed re - current episodes of hoarseness, coughing, flushing, pruritis, and rash, which would occurwithin 30 min of handling CCP. The thirdworker described having nausea and dizzinesswhen handling one type of CCP form but notother types. The fourth worker developed red - ness and itching on the edges of both hands when handling CCP forms (a dermatitis thatresolved during weekends). Symptoms im - proved in all four workers when they avoided exposure to CCP. Two of the four workers be - came so sensitized that they could not be in the vicinity of CCP without being hoarse. Medicalevaluations confirmed acute systemic reac - tions to CCP (laryngeal edema and sixfold in - creases in plasma histamine levels) after4 HEALTH challengeswith novolac resin, componentof CCP. Subsequently, both workers devel - oped hoarseness as a response to other chemi - cals such as paint, wall paper adhesives, andcolognes. Job rotation to positions with mini - mal or no contact with CCP effectively allevi - ated health problems in all four workers.Kanerva et al. 1990a,b; 1993. Kanerva et al. [1990a,b; 1993] investigated the case of a43-year-old machinist in Finland whose workinvolved the manufacture of CCP and who de - veloped occupational dermatitis on the hands.The worker was a healthy man with no previ - ous skin disease. He had been employed by thesame paper-making company for 23 years.During the last 4 years, he was exposed to theagents used in the CCP manufacturing sys-tem\u2014initially, just on the weekends. After anew microcapsule machine was introduced,the patient was given the responsibility of get-ting the machine into operation. Because ofproblems with the new machine, his exposureexceeded what would have been expected innormal use. He had direct contact with themicrocapsule dispersion and contracted handdermatitis within a month of the installation ofthis new machine. Vesicular eczema devel - oped on both hands but cleared over a 3-monthsick leave followed by vacation. Upon return - ing to work, the worker relapsed.Skin-prick testing was negative for 20 com - mon allergens and natural rubber latex. Onskin-patch testing using a series of standardEuropean allergens and CCP, both CCP andone of the chemicals used to produce the micro - capsules of CCP provoked a strong (3+) aller - gic reaction. Analysis of the paper showed that it contained enough DETA to induce allergiccontact dermatitis. The paste, They allreacted negatively.The source of the DETA in this case was its useas a cross-linking agent that was added to a so - lution of color formers in a suitable organicsolvent and then mixed with a polyisocyanate.The authors commented that DETA remainedeven though the vendor claimed that the pro - cess ensures that all of the polyisocyanate hasreacted. The authors recommended that work - ers who handle CCP and develop symptoms ofcontact dermatitis be skin-patch tested withDETA. This patient was the only one who re-acted to DETA among the 20 to 30 subjectstested each year since 1986 at the facility\u2014ex-cept for a painter who also tested positive toethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),which was a component of the hardener in anepoxy resin paint.Burton and Malkin 1993. Burton and Malkin [1993] responded to a management requestbased on a report that a former worker at theMichigan Printers in Chicago, Illinois, had suf - fered adverse reactions to CCP and solvents.They conducted an industrial hygiene and medi - cal survey. The facility employed 12 workers incheck printing and other offset printing onCCP. Samples of personal breathing zone andarea air quality were analyzed for printing sol - vents and metal particles. Workers were inter - viewed and work practices were observed. Theventilation units appeared to be operating welland were well maintained. The authors con - cluded that workers were not overexposed toorganic solvents or metals at the time of thesurvey. Of the 11 workers interviewed, 1 re - ported chest tightness and cough. The formeremployee (on which the investigation wasbased) had reportedly experienced cough, 4 HEALTH EFFECTS 44 Carbonless Copy Paperrhinitis, headache, and rash when using CCP; however, management reported that the cur - rent CCP was a different brand than that used by the former worker. The authors were unableto evaluate the effects of the previously usedCCP and concluded that no symptoms were re - lated to the current use of CCP. Sim and Echt 1993. In response to a request from the Health Commissioner for Kentucky,Sim and Echt [1993] investigated an outbreakof skin disorders among 10 laboratory work - ers at the Health Services Building in Frank - fort, Kentucky. Workers were concerned about their symptoms, which they felt resulted fromcontact with CCP forms that accompanied thebiological specimens analyzed in the laborato - ries. Itchy skin and rashes on exposed skin and areas where clothes rub were reported in earlyMay of 1993, soon after the start of fibrousglass insulation installation in the mechanicalrooms that housed the air-handling units forthe laboratories. Symptoms were reportedmore often in the early part of the week, wereless severe in the latter part of the week, andusually resolved on the weekends. The symp-toms tended to recur upon returning to workthe following week. Several nonskin symp-toms were reported during medical interviewswith some workers, including breathing diffi - culties, headaches, sinus infections, irritated eyes, and a tingling sensation of the nose andlips. Three of the workers reporting skin symp - toms did not handle CCP forms. The number of workers with symptoms who handled CCP wasnot reported. Although a new printing of CCPforms occurred at the beginning of 1993, themanufacturer indicated that no change to theforms had recently occurred. The nature ofsome of the symptoms was consistent with theirritant dermatitis caused by exposure to insu - lation, and the onset of symptoms also coordi - nated well with the timing of this operation. The authors concluded that the most likelycause of the symptoms was irritant dermatitisdue to contact with glass fibers.Zimmer and Hadwen 1993. See Section 3.2.1 for a description of this study. Ziem and McTamney 1997 .In the United States, Ziem and McTamney [1997] publisheda case series of patients assigned the diagnosisof multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). MCSis a controversial diagnosis used by some prac - titioners to refer to illness in persons who typi - cally describe multiple symptoms attributed to numerous and varied environmental chemicalexposures in the absence of objective, diagnos - tic physical findings or laboratory test abnor - malities that define an illness. A new name for the condition\u2014idiopathic environmental in - tolerances\u2014was recommended in 1996 by a workshop organized by the InternationalProgramme on Chemical Safety of the WorldHealth Organization disorder characterized by recurrentsymptoms that (1) are referable to multiple or-gan systems, (2) occur in response to demon-strable exposure to many chemically unrelatedcompounds at doses far below those known tocause harmful effects in the general popula-tion, and (3) do not correlate with any singlewidely accepted test of physiological function.The Interagency Workgroup on MultipleChemical Sensitivity [1998], in of proposed theories of causa - tion (immunological, neurological, and psy - chological), found many variations and theories that were interrelated. Two of 91 patients attributed their conditions to CCP. For one of these patients, few immu - nologic changes were demonstrated, and most of the values were within normal limits. Theauthors believed that immune measures pre-and post-challenge testing were unlikely toshow major changes and were therefore not di - agnostic of specific MCS etiologies. They re - ported that after being away from exposure for4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 45many months, this patient showed significant clinical improvement. They also mentioned thatanother investigator had seen chemical sensi - tivity in about 100 patients with substantial oc - cupational exposure to CCP, but this information was unpublished. Smith et al. 1999. In the United Kingdom, a 49-year-old male forklift driver at a paper millproducing CCP described a 2-year history ofhand dermatitis and was diagnosed as havingfissured hyperkeratotic eczema of the thumbs.He responded positively to patch testing withpara-phenylenediamine in a standard series;and when tested with a dye series, he reacted tothe azo dye Disperse Orange 3. Several azodyes were used at the mill to produce coloredpaper; the patient's job entailed transportationof dye containers. Skin contamination wasthought to have occurred during the collectionof the used dye containers. Work restrictionsfrom handling the dyes led to resolution ofthe hand dermatitis. The azo dyes were notlikely to have been part of the CCP system, butthey were used as a background color for thepaper; the authors did not explain the use of thedyes. 4.2.2 NIOSH Docket Submissions 4.2.2.1 Unpublished Case Reports and Case Series Submitted byIndividuals This subsection describes case reports or case series that were submitted to the NIOSHdocket from sources other than CCP manu - facturers in response to the 1987 and 1997 Federal Register notices regarding CCP [52 Fed. Reg. 22534 (1987); 62 Fed. Reg.8023 (1997)]. Twenty-six cases involvinghealth effects attributed to CCP were sub - mitted. The sex of the respondent is men - tioned in 14 cases, all of which were female.Age was mentioned in 11 cases. Mean age was 43, with a range from 32 to 55. Symptomswere reported in 23 cases. Multiple symptomswere attributed to CCP in many cases, with5 or more symptoms reported in 14 of the 23cases. The most common symptoms attributedby patients or their doctors to CCP included skinsymptoms (irritation, rash), re spiratory symptoms (breathing difficulty/s hortness of breath, nasal/respiratory irritation, lip sores,frequent colds, hoarseness or loss of voice),eye symptoms (eye irritation, blurred vision,eyes feeling swollen and hurt), and generalsymptoms (fatigue, dizziness, vertigo, lack ofenergy, fever, malaise, trouble thinking/fo - cusing, and weakness/pain of muscles in gen - eral or specifically of the legs, back, or arms). Some information about laboratory workupwas provided in eight cases. Immunologictesting, performed in six cases, was ex tensive but used tests of unknown utility. Small devia-tions from laboratory normal ranges were at- tributed to or said to be compatible withimmunotoxicity. Extensive neuropsychiatrictesting was reported in seven cases, and ab-normal results were attributed to or said tobe compatible with neurotoxicity. Sophisti-cated neuroimaging studies such as magneticresonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brainand single positron emission computed to - mography (SPECT) scans of the brain were reported in three cases. Abnormalities inSPECT scans of unknown importance wereoften attributed to or said to be compatiblewith neurotoxicity. Eleven of the subjects werecharacterized as suffering from MCS or\"chemical sensitivity.\" In four cases, symp - toms were attributed to formaldehyde sensi - tivity.

These inqui - ries are summarized in this section.Appleton Papers, Inc. 1987. A letter from Duane Jones at Appleton Papers, Inc. (datedAugust 18, 1987, and submitted to theNIOSH docket) reported that from 1976 to 1986, Appleton received an average of six in - quiries per month (with a range of one to nineper month) regarding skin, headache, nausea,odor, breathing, eyes, nose, mouth, and un - specified symptoms. No seasonal or other pat-terns were reported in the frequency ofsymptoms. Table 4-2 summarizes these data.Other details are contained in the NIOSHdocket submission.Moore Business Forms, Inc. 1987. An Au- gust 24, 1987, letter to Richard Lemen fromDr. Norman Macaulay of Moore BusinessForms, Inc., noted that in the past 5 years (1982to 1987), Moore had received only 23 inquiriesconcerning CCP, and only 6 of 7,500 custom - ers had inquired about skin irritation that theythought was associated with CCP. Also, Moorehad produced 13 billion CCP forms during theprevious year.CCP Manufacturers 1998. A letter dated October 6, 1998, was received from Robert G.Tardiff, Ph.D. (representing the CCP manufac - turers in the United States) in response to aquery from NIOSH. The Institute had askedwhether the end users of CCP were reportingto the CCP manufacturers and sellers anyhealth-related symptoms that might be perceivedto be associated with CCP in the workplaceover the last 10 years (1987-1996). Each of thefive U.S. manufacturers contributed data, whichwere normalized to the amount of paper soldyearly. The letter stated that the figure might beoverestimated, based on the following ratio-nale: (1) customers, unsure of which manufac-turer's paper was and is being used, might haveaddressed the same inquiry to several differentcompanies; (2) a customer might inquire at dif-ferent levels within the manufacturing and dis-tribution chain, with each contact being treatedas a separate report; (3) a consumer might 4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 47Table 4-2.

The letter further explained that most of the in - formation they receive is anecdotal and incon - sistent in terms of type, quantity, and quality of information, including the circumstances ofproduct use. Most often the inquiry is receivedindirectly from merchants, printers, brokers,etc. The yearly average of health-based inqui - ries is stated to include claims from companies alleging health symptoms and may or may nothave included the regular inquiries. Further - more, some inquiries do not state the numberof workers affected and are thus treated as a single inquiry. Some of the inquiries resultfrom odors associated with CCP. Also, someinquiries result from news articles and mayhave no temporal relationship with actual ex-posure. For the years 1987 to 1996, the yearlyaverage (\u00b1standard deviation) for health-based inquiries for all U.S. CCP manufacturers was113 (\u00b14) for 960,115 (\u00b16,473) tons of papersold\u2014or approximately 1 inquiry per 10,000 tonsof CCP sold (equivalent to less than 1 inquiryper 1 billion 8.5- \u00d7 11-in. sheets). The informa - tion was examined for trends by the companies. They found an increasing volume of CCP soldduring the period 1987-1992, with a corre - sponding increasing rate of inquiries followed by an apparent sharp decrease in health inqui - ries over the last 5 years (1992-1996) (see Fig - ure 4-1). CCP manufacturers have provided no descriptive details (such as conditions of workor volume of CCP used) for the health com - plaints that led to the reported inquiries. 4.2.3 Cross-Sectional Studies The cross-sectional studies reviewed in this section were conducted to evaluate either thepotential health effects of indoor air contami-nants in general or those of CCP specifically.Both types of studies are summarized in Ta-ble 4-3.

Summary of cross-sectional studies that used questionnaires to assess the health effects of indoor air contaminants in general or CCP specificallyhealth effects (symptoms) was generally iden - tified by surveys of workers using a question - naire. A major concern with studies based on questionnaires is the potential for overreportingof symptoms, particularly when the study sub - jects are already concerned about the exposure being studied. This concern is greater for the CCP studies than for the indoor air quality studies be - cause the CCP studies were generally con - ducted at facilities where complaints of symptoms were allegedly related to CCP. The indoor air quality studies were not conductedin facilities where complaints were related toCCP, and thus they are generally considered toprovide better information than the CCPcross-sectional studies. The indoor air qualitystudies and the CCP studies are consideredseparately below. 4.2.3.1 Cross-Sectional Studies of Indoor Air Contaminants A number of studies on indoor air quality have associated CCP exposure (and other fac- tors) with workers' symptoms (Table 4-3).Three indoor air et al.[1985], Reinikainen et al. [1990], and Thomp - son [1996]\u2014are not included in this review because they were judged to be largely uninfor - mative with respect to potential health effects associated with CCP exposure. One commonlimitation of the studies described below is thatthey generally include only two or at most threecategories of CCP exposure and thus provide avery limited assessment of exposure-response. Skov et al. 1987, 1989. Skov et al. [1987] conducted a cross-sectional survey of officeworkers and indoor climates in 14 town hallsand other affiliated buildings in Copenhagen.Researchers administered a questionnaire to4,369 workers and measured indoor climatefactors in town halls. The return rate for thequestionnaire was 80%. Measurements of themany indoor climate factors yielded values considered acceptable or within a typicalrange for office buildings as previously re - ported. The analysis showed that the follow - ing tasks were significantly correlated with the presence of mucosal and general symp - toms: photocopying, working at video display terminals (VDTs), and handling CCP. How - ever, in this univariate analysis the potential exists for confounding between CCP, photo - copying, and VDT exposures. Subsequently, Skov et al. [1989] described the influence of personal characteristics as wellas job-related and psychosocial factors onindoor air quality complaints in the samepopulation. Of the 3,507 respondents (2,347women), the CCP-exposed included 1,102women and 424 men. For the 19 buildingsstudied, numbers were sufficient for multi-variate analyses. The questionnaire provided in-formation about work activity, previous andpresent diseases, the presence of mucous mem-brane and general symptoms (headache,fatigue, and malaise), indoor climate, familyand housing conditions, exercise habits, smok-ing, and consumption of alcohol and other bev-erages. Thirty-six percent (397) of thesewomen reported complaints, as did 26% (110)of the men. In logistic regression analyses, sex,type of job, and the following job activitieswere significantly related to mucous mem - brane ( - copying ( P<0.0001), working at VDTs (P<0.0001), dissatisfaction with one's superiors (P<0.0001), and work overload ( P<0.0001). Crude prevalence rates showed a dose-responsebetween frequency of CCP exposure and mu - cous membrane symptoms: % Monthly or less frequent use \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b72 4 Weekly use of 25 sheets or fewer \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b73 2 Weekly use of more than 25 sheets \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b74 34 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 57With multiple logistic regression analysis,handling CCP weekly or daily had a significant effect on mucosal irritation (odds ratio [OR]=1.3,95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1-1.6), and han - dling CCP was the only exposure with a signifi - cant effect on general symptoms (see above;OR=1.6, 95% CI=1.1-1.7). Also the authors com - mented that these office workers handled rela - tively small quantities of CCP.Zweers et al. 1992. Zweers et al. [1992] conducted a cross-sectional epidemiologic studyof indoor air quality and health effects in theNetherlands. Approximately 10,500 workersin 61 office buildings were studied. CCP usage,which was not the primary focus of the study,was ascertained in a questionnaire and analyzedas a dichotomous variable\u2014handling \"morethan zero CCP per day\" versus handling \"zero.\"No usage prevalence was reported. Multivariatelogistic regression models adjusted for personalvariables, type of air-handling system, andvarious job and workspace variables. Con-trolling for some variables in the multivariatemodels (e.g., allergic or respiratory symptoms)may have underestimated actual CCP effects, asthese factors may themselves have resulted fromCCP exposures. Despite these limitations, the au-thors found associations of CCP handling withoronasal symptoms (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.00-1.39),perception of air contaminants CI=1.05-1.40), and lighting complaints(OR=1.30, CI=1.12-1.51).Mendell 1991 and Fiske et al. 1993. Mendell [1991] and Fiske et al. [1993] conducted across-sectional epidemiologic study in North - ern California among 880 office workers in12 office buildings. A strength of this study,unlike previous studies, was that the studyfacilities were selected without regard toworker complaints. Work-related symptomsused in the analyses were defined as those that\"occurred often or always in the last year andimproved when away from work.\" Thequestionnaire response rate was 85%. A num - ber of factors (including CCP) were associatedwith the prevalence of work-related symptomsafter adjustment in a logistic regression modelfor personal, psychosocial, job, workspace,and building factors (Table 4-4). The OR wasnotincreased for a set of control symptoms in - cluded to detect overreporting associated withrisk factors of possible concern (such asair-conditioning or CCP). In multivariateanalyses adjusted for other workplace expo - sures, the authors reported that the use of CCP for more than 1 hr/day was associatedwith increased ORs for the following: eye,nose, and See Section 4.2.3.2 for a discussion of this study.Jaakkola and Jaakkola 1999. Jaakkola and Jaakkola [1999] conducted a cross-sectionalepidemiologic study of office workers in 41randomly selected buildings in Helsinki in1991. They used a questionnaire to investigateassociations of health effects with work in - volving CCP, photocopying, and VDT use.The populations studied had not been selectedon the basis of prior complaints or concernsabout CCP. The response rate to the question - naire was 81%, representing a study popula - tion (1,119 men and 1,559 women).Of these workers, 910 were exposed to CCP.The outcomes studied included the work-relatedsymptoms often associated with sick buildingsyndrome as well as chronic respiratory symp - toms and respiratory infections. Multivariateanalyses controlled for building ventilationtype in addition to a number of demographic,psychosocial, and other environmental factors.Blinding to the specific study hypotheses re - duced the likelihood of information bias inreporting exposure.

CCP use was analyzed as \"any\" versus\"none.\"Statistically significant associations were ob - served between work with CCP (involving34% of the population) and most of the out - comes studied\u2014including weekly work-relatedeye, nose, pharyngeal, and skin symptoms,headache, and lethargy (ORs=1.56, 1.48, 1.66, and 1.38, respectively); re - wheeze, and chronic bronchitis 1.43,1.41, and 1.79, respectively); and respiratory in - fections including sinusitis and acute bronchi - tis (ORs=1.46 and 1.54, respectively).In contrast, only one of the 20 or so outcomesassessed (the common cold) was significantlyelevated among workers with light or heavyphotocopying work, and two symptom catego-ries (otitis and general symptoms) were ele-vated for light or heavy VDT users. Additionalanalyses focused only on VDT and photocopierusers; they identified several additional out-comes related specifically to these activities.This study provides strong support for the CCPhealth effects hypothesis. The numerousrelationships found between health outcomesand CCP use (but not between health out - comes and photocopying or VDT work) makeoverreporting due to health concerns in the ran - domly selected buildings an unlikely explana - tion for these findings.4.2.3.2 Cross-Sectional Studies of CCP Exposures Sixteen cross-sectional studies using ques - tionnaires to assess health problems in rela - tion to CCP exposure were conducted in Swe - den, Denmark, and the United States (seeTable 4-3). These studies attempted todescribe and estimate the prevalences of vari - ous symptoms, primarily mucous membraneand skin irritation associated with the handlingor manufacturing of CCP. A few of these stud - ies had strong cross-sectional designs with ap - propriate unexposed comparison groups,ascertainment of symptoms independent ofworkers' opinions on their association withCCP use, and multivariate analysis allowingdetermination of the association with CCP ex - posures independent of other factors. Insurveys with data on self-reported and uncon - firmed symptoms that respondents subjec - tively attributed to CCP handling, concernabout the use of CCP might (throughhypervigilance or enhanced recall) upwardlybias estimates of symptom prevalence.Fristedt and Pettersson 1980. Fristedt and Pettersson [1980] conducted a questionnairesurvey of 180 persons (88% were women) inSweden. Of these 180 study subjects, 135 hadbeen identified in a previous survey of the Swedish Association of Municipal Technol-ogy (SKTF) union as having reported symp-toms related to CCP exposure. An additional45 cases were identified from interview refer-rals (i.e., workers who had not previously dis-closed symptoms but were mentioned ininterviews with other workers). The averageduration of CCP exposure was 5 years (maxi - mum of 18 years), with 87% handling paper formore than 50% of their working time.By correlating the time and use patterns, 68%(122 workers) were thought to have symptomsrelated to work with CCP, including someworkers in printing operations. Fifty-threepercent of this group with symptoms reportedmucous membrane symptoms (primarily of thenose and eyes), and 47% reported skin symptoms In this previous survey, only 243 (8%) of the 3,000 persons surveyed responded to the questionnaire, whichraises serious concerns about the representativeness ofthe respondents.4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 61(see Table 4-5). The skin disorders consisted mainly of dryness that occurred first on thehands and later on the face. The latter islocalized around the eyes and sometimescombined with irritation of the eyes (assumedto be caused by touching the face with thehands). According to the authors, the moststriking disorders occurred among the 67 whohad a history of similar complaints or \"a ten - dency to allergy.\" Of the 180 interviewees, 22 complained of an unpleasant smell that couldnot be linked to a specific CCP. Oneinterviewee lost the sense of smell and taste, and two stated that they no longer had feelingin their tongues. The authors stated that in the original survey of 3,000 workers, 30% to 50% of the em - ployees at some workplaces had complained; but at others, no one had complained in spiteof massive handling of CCP. Workers whohandled clay-based papers reported skin disor - ders more frequently than those who handled polymer-based (phenolic) papers (71% [29/41]4 HEALTH EFFECTS 62 Carbonless Copy PaperTable 4-5. Types and locations of skin and mucous membrane symptoms in a Swedish questionnaire study Type and location of symptomNumber of workers reporting symptoms% workers linking symptoms with CCP Type of skin symptom Dryness ItchngDryness and itchingRedness and rashEczema with polymer-based (phenolic) papersreported mucous membrane disorders more of - ten (81% [56/69] compared with 68% [28/41]). Solvents used in the clay paper consisted of hy - drogenated terphenyls plus ker osene, and those in the polymer paper consisted ofphenylxylylethane plus diisopropylnaphthalene[Norb\u00e4ck et al. 1988]. Other numbers of symp - toms were too small to discern patterns. Of the 35 workers who were skin-patch tested withCCP, none had positive reactions. Environ - mental factors such as high temperature, low humidity, and dust were thought to be contrib - uting. The authors concluded that it was diffi - cult to decide which symptoms could definitely be correlated with CCP. The preva - lence of complaints was 4% of the 3,000 work- ers who came in contact with CCP; but if slightcomplaints of doubtful origin were ignored,the prevalence was 2.4%. Symptoms weremore severe in those predisposed to allergy,but no allergy to CCP components was demon-strated. Also, the authors remarked that mostof the workers interviewed had reported illhealth symptoms only after the newspaperpublicity had appeared. Andersson et al. 1980. This Swedish study used a questionnaire to address CCP effectsamong 158 workers at an insurance officewho had reported symptoms of the skin (irrita - tion and itching of hands, forearms, and face), eyes (itching and burning), and mucous mem - branes (dryness of mouth and throat, nasal stuffiness, and catarrh). To obtain comparativedata, the same kind of questionnaire was dis - tributed to four other office places (183 per - sons). The authors examined the type of paper in question as well as other environmental fac - tors. The prevalence of symptoms increased when subjects were exposed to CCP or towall-to-wall carpeting. This increase was ob - served in both atopic and nonatopic patients.\u00d6berg 1980. As cited in Murray [1991], \u00d6berg conducted a questionnaire study of 205 people;74% handled more than 10 CCP forms perday. Forty percent of the study population re - ported symptoms, including itching and dry - ness of the hands, eyes, and mouth. Four cases of eczema were found. The author reports adose-response relationship, but Murray sug - gests that information was inadequate to verify this result. Sondergard 1981. Sondergard [1981], as cited by Murray [1991] and Olsen and M\u00f8rck[1985], conducted a questionnaire study ofworkers at two locations of Scandinavian Air - lines Systems. The frequency of symptoms re - ported was 73% (68 of 93 workers studied), and the symptom frequency increased with theamount of CCP handled daily (see Table 4-6).The author noted that the dose-response con-nection was not statistically significant be-cause of the small number of workers inGroups 2 and 4 (numbers were not reported bythe reviewers). Menn\u00e9 et al. 1981. Menn\u00e9 et al. [1981] admin- istered a questionnaire survey to workers at theDanish telephone company; the authors alsoperformed a clinical evaluation of the cases(see Section 4.2.1). Approximately 77% of theworkers responded to the questionnaire. Ofthese, some were eliminated because they didnot handle CCP. Of the remaining 1,855 re - spondents, 208 (11%) indicated that they had experienced skin and/or mucous membrane ir - ritation. Analysis revealed that the symptoms were not related to the type of building inwhich the subjects worked. According to theauthors, the number of CCP contacts per dayappeared to be clearly related to the frequencyof symptoms: Symptom Contacts: frequency (%) 0-10 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b75 5 0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b72 04 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 63The authors suggested that mass psychosis was an unlikely explanation for their findings sincean exposure-response relationship was identi - fied\u2014not the all or nothing response expected with mass psychosis. The authors also sug-gested that mass psychosis was inconsistentwith the fact that no relationship existed be-tween the age of the workers and the number ofcomplaints: they would expect younger work-ers to have the weakest ties to the company andthus to be more likely to report symptoms. Inrejecting mass psychosis as an explanation fortheir findings, the authors suggested that somecomponent of the paper was responsible for theobserved symptoms. G\u00f6the et al. 1981 and Norb\u00e4ck et al. 1983b . G\u00f6the et al. [1981] and Norb\u00e4ck et al. [1983b]presented findings about the frequency of re - spiratory symptoms in three groups of Swedish patients: /c167Group A: 19 patients referred to theClinic of Occupational Medicine atSouth Hospital /c167Group B: 38 patients at the KarolinskaClinic of Occupational Dermatology /c167Group C: a random sample of 22 pa - tients with no CCP exposureThe patients in Groups A and B were referred during the period January 1976 to October 1980because of health problems associated with oc - cupational handling of CCP. However, be- cause the authors did not describe thepopulation from which the patients were re-ferred, population prevalence rates could notbe calculated. Among patients with healthcomplaints from handling CCP, roughly halfreported irritative symptoms involving theeyes or upper respiratory tract, and 11%(Group A) to 28% (Group B) experienced na-sal catarrh or congestion. In the unexposedgroup (Group C), 14% experienced ocular orupper respiratory irritation, and there were nocases of nasal catarrh or congestion. The dif - ference in incidence between the exposed groups (A and B) and the unexposed group (C)was statistically significant (P<0.01) for eye and upper respiratory irritation. The elevatedincidence of nasal catarrh or congestion wasstatistically significant ( P<0.01) in Group B but not in Group A relative to the unexposedGroup C. Symptoms such as headache, fatigue,nausea, and a metallic taste in the mouth oc - curred at a low rate (1% to 9%), with no statis - tically demonstrable correlation with the type of exposure or the volume of CCP handled.The results in Table 4-7 contrast patients in a high-exposure group ( /c36150 sheets per day) with those in a low-exposure group4 HEALTH EFFECTS 64 Carbonless Copy PaperTable 4-6.

Patients were excludedif they had irritation of the respiratory tractthat was not specifically related to work withpaper. The data show that throughout, the fre-quency of complaints was higher in thehigh-exposure groups than in the correspond-ing low-exposure groups for all types of paper,including ordinary paper. These data also dem-onstrated a higher prevalence of work-relatedrespiratory symptoms in patients seen atthe clinic and exposed to CCP containingMIPB\u2014a solvent used in the microcapsules.This prevalence rate was 100% in thehigh-exposure group.Norb\u00e4ck et al. [1983b] also investigatedwhether the dose-response associations mightbe due to an increased proportion of sensitiveworkers among those who handle largeamounts of paper. They determined whetherpatients with atopy or nonspecific hyper - reactivity of the respiratory tract were concen - trated among these highly exposedindividuals. Atopy was assumed to be presentif the patient had a history of asthma or hayfever or a tendency to develop eczema.Nonspecific hyperreactivity was assumed to bepresent if the patient had reported experiencingrespiratory tract irritation when exposed tononspecific irritants such as perfume, cigarettesmoke, and vehicle exhaust in the everyday en-vironment. Fewer sensitive patients ( P<0.05) were identified among those who handledlarge volumes of paper than among those whohandled small volumes of paper, indicatingthat confounding by atopy could not explainthe observed exposure-response relationships.These authors also investigated the role ofD-inks, which were present in about 20% ofthe CCP. A significant increase ( P=0.00009) occurred in the prevalence of work-related pru - ritus combined with erythema in those workingwith CCP treated with D-ink versus those notworking with these inks (39% versus 0%).Analysis of other contributing factors in thispopulation revealed that work involving pho - tocopies or the presence of wall-to-wall carpet - ing was not significantly correlated with skinor mucous membrane symptoms. The authorsconcluded that a significant dose-response4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 65Table 4-7.

The authors stated that the same phenomenon occurs withordinary paper and carbon paper but that CCPcan produce symptoms when lower volumes ofpaper are handled. Kolmodin-Hedman et al. 1981. At a clinic for occupational medicine in Uppsala, Sweden,Kolmodin-Hedman et al. [1981] conducted aninquiry among those employed by an insuranceoffice (total of 145 workers) and a hospitallaboratory (12 workers). A comparison groupof 20 was composed of hospital office staffwho did not handle CCP. The investigationwas triggered by six cases in an insurance of - fice; the main symptoms were irritation of the upper respiratory tract. The prevalence ofsymptoms was greatest in the hospital labora-tory (92%), where about 1,000 forms werehandled per day by each of the five reception-ists and seven computer operators. The insur-ance office workers worked with fewer forms(number not given) than the laboratory work- ers; they reported a 32% prevalence. The com-parison group reported a 10% prevalence ofsymptoms. Of those in the insurance group whocomplained of symptoms (46), 17 were diag - nosed as atopic and 6 with underlying allergic or eczematous conditions. Of the remaining 23,one had symptoms connected with handling\"wet copies,\" and another had a complaint thatwas clearly linked to the use of a certain type ofstamp pad. The remaining 21 had skin and/ormucous membrane complaints: 13 stated thatthey had the most trouble at work, and 8 statedthat their symptoms were independent ofwhere they were. None of the six types of CCPforms used were known to contain D-inks, andthree contained hydrogenated terphenyls,diethylethane, and diisopropylnaphthalenes.Two contained unknown solvents. Among theworkers who handled only clay-based paper atthe insurance office, the frequency of mucousmembrane symptoms was approximatelyequal to that of the comparison group. The skin (hands and face) and eye symptoms were con - sidered likely to be related to CCP exposure, since their frequency (21% among insuranceworkers versus 67% in laboratory workers)was much higher than that of the comparisongroup (5%). Kleinman and Horstman 1982. In the United States, persistent health complaints attributedto the use of CCP by office workers on thecampus of the University of Washington led toa preliminary study by Kleinman andHorstman [1982]. The goals were (1) to esti - mate the extent of the problem in a population of known CCP users, (2) to describe the healthproblems that the users attributed to CCP, and(3) to make a preliminary determination of thechemical constituents of the paper. An un-known number of office workers were asked tocomplete a health questionnaire and to attachto it copies of the forms they used. Among the265 subjects respondng to the survey, 71(27%) reported complaints. Across differentoffices, the minimum estimate was 10.7 healthcomplainants per 100 users, similar to thatfound by investigators in the United Kingdomand Denmark [Calnan 1979; Menn\u00e9 et al.1981], but this estimate was lower than that re - ported by other investigators and by anecdotal material. Of the 108 respondents who an - swered \"yes\" (n=71) or \"don't know\" (n=37) to the question relating symptoms to CCP, 53participated in a medical exam. The positivefindings are tabulated in Table 4-8. Kleinmanand Horstman [1982] also reported asignificant relationship (X 12 =0.0002) between the amount of CCP used daily and worker re - ports of health effects they attributed to CCP: 41.3% of the heavy users of CCP (those whohandled 51 or more forms/day) responded\"yes\" to the question relating health effectswith CCP, compared with 29.9% of moderateusers (11 to 50 forms/day) and 18.8% of mini - mal users (1 to 10 forms/day).The authors hy - pothesized that concurrent factors such as poor4 HEALTH EFFECTS 66 Carbonless Copy Paperventilation, high temperature, and/or low hu- midity might play a role in the clinical expres-sion of CCP effects. Pryor et al. 1983. In response to a request for a NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation, Pryor et al.[1983] investigated complaints of respiratory,eye, and skin irritation and one case ofthrombocytopenia at a Colorado municipalcourt house. A questionnaire was administeredto eight employees who worked in an area withintensive storage and use of CCP forms andalso to eight others who worked in an area withlittle CCP contact. The CCP storage was im - mediately next to 2- and 4-inch pipes carrying hot water during the winter for heating thebuilding; these pipes were believed to be caus - ing increased emissions from the CCP. Heating CCP paper samples in the NIOSH lab - oratory produced formaldehyde and also sub - stituted biphenyls and terphenyls typical of CCP. However, air samples taken in the officeat various times during the months of Decem - ber and March identified only formaldehyde.CCP-exposed workers during the month of April had somewhat higher prevalences ofeye, nasal, and throat complaints (rangingfrom 25% non-CCP-exposedworkers, whose symptoms ranged from 0% to50%. However, small numbers precluded astatistical test. Olsen and M\u00f8rck 1985. Olsen and M\u00f8rck [1985] administered a questionnaire and physi - cal exams to the 129 workers at two Danish form-printing shops. The authors confirmedcomplaints that the CCP-exposed exhibited \"heavy irritative itching, vesicles, and wounds to - gether with more chronic changes with lichenification, furrows, and chaps.\" The fre - quency of symptoms increased significantly (P<0.01) with the volume of CCP handling (see Table 4-9).

These groups were matched for sex,age, location of workplace, known skindiseases, history of childhood asthma, knownallergy to nickel, asthmatic conditions, chronicbronchitis, eye diseases, nettle rash, and useof tanning facilities. Double-blind derma - tological exams included observations and his - tories, skin-prick tests for allergens, scratch tests for CCP and its components versus ordi - nary paper, objective measures of dermal ery - thema after occluded testing, and skin-patch tests. Temperature, humidity, formaldehyde,and total dust were measured. Two groups ofworkers were exposed to CCP. Over a periodof 4 weeks, the first group of 5 sent out 120,000identical forms printed on CCP that had beenstored in the work area. Their work consistedof tearing off forms from a continuous paperweb and stuffing the forms into envelopes(about 1,200 per day per worker). The secondexposure group of 15 workers processed the42,000 returned forms over a 2-week period,checking and entering information into com- puters (about 280 per day per worker). Thecomparison group was selected from 122 em-ployees who worked in the same large officebuilding and had returned completed question-naires about symptoms and exposure to CCP.These questionnaires were administered weeklyduring the exposure periods. They includedquestions about CCP exposure, work withcomputers and photocopying, and subjectivesymptoms of skin and respiratory irritation.Temperature was 23.5 NC and humidity was about 40% in both offices. These were reportedalong with six formaldehyde measurements,(including both area and personal samples)ranging from 0.1 to 0.62 mg/m 3. Total dust measurements were 0.34 mg/m3in the study office and 0.28 mg/m3in the comparison group office. Table 4-10 shows the incidence ofsymptoms during both exposure periodsamong the exposed workers and their matchedcomparison workers.

Exposed workers re - ported large decreases in most symptoms dur - ing the second period, when they handled the completed forms with broken microcapsules(280/day) rather than the fresh forms(1,200 per day) during the first period. Thesesymptom decreases during the second periodincluded a sixfold decrease in skin irritationand threefold decreases in eye irrita - tion, pruritus, nasal congestion, nose - bleed, and cough. However, increases occurred in facial erythema, rash, and runny nose. Figure 4-2 shows the relationship between pruritus and increasing CCP exposure. Four ofthe 18 comparison workers (22.2%) during the first exposure period and 3 of the 16 compari-son workers (18.8%) during the second expo-sure period reported pruritus. Ten of the 20workers (50%) exposed to CCP experiencedpruritus: 4 of 10 employees (40%) who worked daily with 101 to 750 form sets, and 6 of 10employees (60%) who worked with >750 formsets reported pruritus. These results show a sta - tistically significant increase in the prevalence of pruritus with increasing exposure to CCP,regardless of whether the responses were usedfrom the first exposure period ( P=0.049) or the second exposure period ( P=0.03). Clinical ex - amination revealed no significant differences between atopic workers in the exposed andcomparison groups.

Prevalence of pruritus among CCP handlers by sheets of CCP handled during the exposure period.4 HEALTH EFFECTS significant, the authors noted that the higher number of nickel reactions in the exposedgroup may indicate a higher prevalence ofatopic workers in that group and thus a poten - tial bias in the study. No increased skin dryness or desiccation was noted in the exposed orcomparison groups. Possible shortcomings ofthis otherwise well-designed study are that(1) the matched comparison workers were notmatched for the amount of ordinary paper theyhandled, and (2) the matching does not appearto have been considered in the analysis of thedata. Thus the study results may be potentiallyconfounded by the matching factors and by or - dinary paper exposure. On the other hand, the strength of the association ( P<0.007) and the evidence of an exposure-response relationship(P=0.049) support an association of some types of CCP with pruritus. Apol and Thoborn 1986. See Section 4.2.1 for a discussion of this study. 4.2.4 Laboratory Studies in Humans This section reviews studies that used some form of experimental testing in humans (suchas patch or prick tests) under controlled labora - tory conditions to assess the potential health effects of exposure to CCP or its components.These studies are distinct from the laboratorystudies performed in some of the case studiesand cross-sectional studies reviewed earlier inthis chapter (see Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.3),which generally involved a few cases from aspecific company and did not employ a rigor - ous experimental design. In addition to the peer-reviewed literature, this section examinesunpublished experimental studies that wereusually sponsored by the U.S. manufacturersof CCP and were submitted to the NIOSHdocket. The experimental nature of laboratory studies offers advantages over the observational stud - ies described in earlier sections. These studiesdo not have the potential for confounding or re - call bias that the observational studies had. However, laboratory studies also have limita - tions that undermine their usefulness for judg - ing the causal relationship between CCP exposure and health effects. First, these studiesare largely limited to the inclusion of healthyvolunteers. A consequence of this approach isthat persons with a history of allergy or irrita - tion reaction might be less likely to volunteer than those with no symptoms, thus creating se - lection bias. Second, it is unclear whether the exposures in laboratory studies are representa - tive of those actually experienced by workers in the field. Third, most of the laboratory stud - ies did not include ordinary paper as a control. Thus it is not possible to determine whetherthe effects observed in some studies resultfrom chemical components of CCP or from thepaper itself. 4.2.4.1 Peer-Reviewed Literature Studies Table 4-11 summarizes the three experimental studies in humans that have appeared in thepeer-reviewed literature. These studies are dis-cussed below. Nilzen 1975. At the request of a CCP manufac - turer, Nilzen [1975] of Sweden conducted pro - vocative tests (including patch, prick, eye, and nose irritation tests with water extracts) and va - por inhalation studies with crushed CCP and ordinary bond paper. The patch tests in eightsubjects were negative, but prick tests resultedin an unspecified number of weak and me - dium-strong reactions to both CCP and ordi - nary bond paper. Two subjects were tested by inhalation of vapors from CCP or bond paper,and both resulted in irritation; however, theCCP caused a greater reaction. The author con - cluded that (1) certain persons with a history of allergy or irritative reactions may react to CCPas well as to ordinary bond paper and a varietyof other materials and (2) despite evidence of Carbonless Copy Paper 71Table 4-11.

Jeansson et al. 1983, 1984. During patient followup visits, the authors investigated pa - tients who had complaints related to any type of paper and who had been referred to an oc - cupational dermatitis clinic in Sweden from January 1974 to December 1980. Their com - plaints included irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, arms, face, and scalp; cold symptoms;hoarseness; sores; itching, dryness, redness, oreczema of or taste;fatigue; headache; nausea; pains; and afeeling of paralysis. Jeansson et al. [1983] appraised the chemical contents of the papers by skin tests (patch andscratch) and by other examinations of 148 pa-tients. No controls were included in this study.Three of the original 151 complainants werelost to followup. The focus of the study was tofind the triggering chemical factor by (1) ex-amining the chemical content and the toxico-logical effects of the paper, (2) examining thedistribution of patients according to the sus-pected cause of problems, and (3) investigatingthe relative prevalence of contact allergies.The complaints involved multiple brands ofCCP. Manufacturers submitted lists of thecomposition of 13 brands of CCP on the Swed - ish market along with samples of the chemicals from the production process. The authors ap - plied a series of patch tests using a standard panel of 30 known antigens as well as samplesof paper (CCP, data paper, carbon paper, andphotocopying paper) and CCP components.The tests were performed on 134 patients(those with CCP-related complaints) using theCCP with which they worked. Of these pa - tients, about 50 were also tested with approxi - mately 60 chemicals from the paper production process. The authors tested the following CCPcomponents: those in the CB and CF surfacesin both wet and dry preparations, salineextracts of CCP, 62 chemical components (representing about 95% of the components onthe Swedish market), 7 desensitizing chemi - cals, and 3 adhesive products. Specific antibodies (IgE, RAST) against dust and molds were identified in 4 of 35 cases,none of whom were among the patients withCCP complaints. The authors noted that thisnumber was not an overrepresentation for agroup such as this. The only positive reactionsthat occurred from any of the test materialsother than the standard ones were from twotypes of carbon paper (not CCP). Slight irrita - tion occurred when testing 50% kerosene (1 of 59) and 50% isoparaffins (1 of 59). Slight red - ness (1 of 1) occurred with 100% alkylated benzene, but no reaction occurred at repeattesting with a 50% concentration in 54 test sub-jects. Two of five D-inks produced primary ir-ritation at 5% concentration: the first inkresulted in a slight redness in 43% of patients(19 of 44); and at 1% concentration, the secondcaused slight redness in 59% of those tested(26 of 44). \"Itch\" tests assessing skin responseto a nonantigenic stimulus (histamine) wereperformed. Responses were measured as theduration of the sensation of itch and the size ofthe reddened area after administration of 3 con - centrations of histamine below the epidermis. Twenty patients having CCP-related com - plaints were compared with 17 patients having previous complaints about non-CCP paper.The CCP patients suffered a significantly lon - ger duration of itch (0.05> P>0.01 [G\u00f6the et al. 1981]) than the matched comparisons; how - ever, the area of redness did not differ between the two groups. The authors commented thatthe longer-lasting itch correlated with thehigher prevalence of mucous membrane irrita - tion on exposure to CCP (65% versus 50%). Among the patients examined with possible CCP-related symptoms, no allergic or singleirritant mechanism was found to explain howthe handling of CCP directly resulted in4 HEALTH EFFECTS 74 Carbonless Copy Papermedical problems. On the basis of the available assays of irritant or allergenic potency, the au - thors were unable to conclude that a specific chemical was common to CCP complaints.Two patients had probable allergic reactions tocomponents in the synthetic resins (one to mel - amine formaldehyde and one to resorcin), but those reacting to resins or solvents did not reactin patch tests to their own CCP. Other contrib - uting factors were mentioned, such as the han - dling of paper generally (i.e., carbon paper, plain paper, CCP, etc.) and atopy. The authorsasserted that there were no differences by CCPbrand; however, because of the design of thestudy (only symptomatic workers were in - cluded) differences in prevalence or incidence of symptoms across CCP brands could not beassessed. The authors concluded (based on theabsence of a causal agent) that CCP was not theleading suspect responsible for symptoms inmost of the patients exposed to CCP. Morgan and Camp 1986. Morgan and Camp [1986] conducted an experiment in the UnitedStates under controlled laboratory conditionsto quantify upper respiratory congestion inclerical workers reporting prior sensitivitywhen exposed to CCP. Seventy percent of thesubjects reported having symptoms associatedwith CCP use. These symptoms included dry - ness, light-headedness, headache, dry mouth, burning sinuses, dizziness, sore throat, tickle inthroat, sneezing, irritation, itching nose, con - gestion in throat, and flushed face. The symp - toms reportedly increased with increased use of CCP and tended to dissipate rapidly whenthe worker was removed from the exposure.The authors used an objective measure of nasalcongestion\u2014measurement of the nasal contri - bution to breathing (nasal impedence) by posterior rhinomanometry. Thesubjects were 28 clerical workers who reportedhandling 1 to 200 CCP forms per day, with anaverage of 90 forms per day. These workerswere subjected in random, single-blind fashionto controlled exposures of vapors from twosets of three-page, blue-dye CCP forms and to vapors from plain bond paper. Any particlesreleased by the paper were removed by a0.3-\u00b5m particle filter. Total hydrocarbon con - centration during CCP exposure averaged 1 ppm. Nasal impedance increased afterexposure to CCP forms ( P<0.025) and 8% af - ter exposure to plain paper ( P>0.10). How - ever, frequency of symptoms did not differ between exposure to CCP and plain paper, andthey were not correlated with the nasal mea - surements. The authors concluded that quanti - tation of nasal congestion by this technique may be a sensitive measure of short-term reac - tion to inhalation of irritants. In subjects with a history of allergy, changes in nasal functionwere reported after exposure to both papertypes, but only the change after CCP exposurewas statistically significant (paired t-test,P<0.05). In these patients, nasal aerodynamic response to CCP vapor was significant evenwith low concentrations of hydrocarbon expo-sure, and objective changes were measured inthe absence of consistent subjectivecomplaints. 4.2.4.2 NIOSH Docket Submissions RIPT Studies. NIOSH reviewed all of the in - dustry-sponsored laboratory studies in humans submitted to its docket as a result of the Fed- eral Register notices in 1987 and 1997. Most of these studies were RIPT studies, which aresummarized in Table 4-12. The RIPT is a testmethod designed to evaluate the potential ofa material to induce and elicit type IV skin sen - sitization reactions (allergic contact dermati - tis) in humans [ASTM 1999]. In general, these tests were performed by administering multi - ple potentially sensitizing doses of study ma - terial as occlusive patch tests over a several-week period. After 2 to 3 weeks,subjects were challenged with an additionaldiagnostic patch test and evaluated for responsesconsistent with allergic contact dermatitis.4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 754 HEALTH EFFECTS 76 Carbonless Copy Paper See footnotes at end of table.

Highest recorded grade of skin reaction per study participant for a particular test material (based on multiple applications). Before 1980, Hill Top Research, Inc. employed a scoring scale that ranged from 0 to 7 (a score of 5 or greater=primary skin irritant; less than 5=nonirritating). Since 1980, Hill Top has used a scoring scale that ranges from 0 to 5 (a score of 3 or greater=primary skin irritant; less than 3=nonirritating). Inveresk Research International used a scoring system of 0 to 8, with a score of 5 or greater indicating irritancy. This labora tory scoring system is more analogous to the Hill Top pre- 1980 system, even though it is a post-1980 study. N were determined by NIOSH according to the scoring system listed in footnote. iDiscontinued means that (1) the ingredient is no longer used to make CCP, or (2) the formulation as constituted is no longer used to make CCP, or (3) the CCP product is no longer sold in the United States. cThe study director described skin reactions as sensitization. #Responders to sample E (grade 2 and grade 6 reactions) were dropped from the study (77-512-70). **A responder to sample H (grade 1 reaction) was dropped (77-512-70 H). Responder to sample B (grade 1 reaction) was dropped (78-578-70). \u00a7\u00a7Two reactors with grade 2 reactions and one reactor with grade 3 reaction to T3012PP dropped out of the study [81-0318-73(2)] and are not included in the denominators. \u00b6\u00b6One grade 3 reactor to T3013PP was dropped from the study [81-0138-73(2)]. ii Two dropped out with a score of 1; 1 dropped out with a score of 2. ccOne dropped out with a score of 1; 2 dropped out with a score of 2. Three dropped out with a score of 1; 1 dropped out with a score of 3. ##One dropped out with a score of 1; 1 dropped out with a score of 3. ***Three dropped out w ith a score of 1; 1 dropped out with a score of 2. Two dropped out with a score of 1; 2 dropped out with a score of 2. These results reflect the same person who expressed elevated scores throughout this study, regardless of the material tested. In addition, the scoring responses conflict with the study methodology since the responses increased, rather than decreased, across primary, secondary, and tertiary application sites. Therefore, the results for this person are suspect. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7As designated by performing laboratory, \"+\" denotes \"slight, confluent or patchy erythema.\" This symbol indicates a score between 0 and 1 on a scale of 0 to 7 (see footnote ) and is not used universally. \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6The analytical laboratory that co nducted this study concluded that this irritancy score was likely to be a recording error because of deviations from the study protocol.One of the difficulties in interpreting the RIPT studies is that although there is a stan - dard procedure for evaluating changes consis - tent with allergic contact dermatitis, no guidelines exist for determining what consti - tutes a significant irritant Part 1500.41]have guidelines for animal testing but not forhuman testing. Report 81-0138-73(2) fromHill Top Research, Inc., (Table 4-12) definescategories of responses for interpreting thefindings in their test reports [Graves andTardiff 1999]. The test report states thefollowing: If Category I responses (defined as negative orinsignificant findings or significant findings un-related to the test material) are projected to98 percent or more of the total population, thenthe results are not significant for dermatotoxicpotential. This means that two percent or less ofthe population could possibly have some type ofmild reaction. A mild significance is one where no Category III reactions (no vesicular, bullous, or spreading) ex-ist and Category I (negative) reactions exist in95 percent or more of total population. Thismeans, that at most five percent of the populationcould have some type of mild, non-vesicular,non-bullous, non-spreading response. A strong significance for dermatotoxic potential exists if there are any Category III responses(vesicular, bullous, strong spreading reactions) orif enough Category II responses (significant re - sponses excluding vesicular, bullous, and spread - ing reactions) exist to decrease Category I to 85 percent or less of total population. This meansthat if any one person (approximately 1/200 orone-half percent of the test subjects) would havevesicular, bullous, or spreading reaction or 15 per - cent or more would have some type of significant reaction, then the test would be defined as having Code of Federal Regulations . See CFR in references.strong statistical significance for dermatotoxic po - tential. Eighty-five (85) percent of the population could have non-significant or negative reactionsand the test would still be considered strongly sig - nificant. This definition, which henceforth will be re - ferred to as the \"Hilltop Guidelines,\" combines information about the likelihood of the re - sponse with information about the severity of the response to determine whether the overallresponse is significant. With this definition atest would be declared negative or insignificanteven if mild reactions occurred in a small pro - portion ( /c352%) of the test population. More - over, as the ASTM standard argues, from a population experiencing 1.5 allergic reactionsper 100 users, a sample of 200 could easilyyield no cases just by chance [ASTM 1999]. Most of the RIPT reports submitted to NIOSH were judged to be negative by the investigatorsusing criteria similar to those described above.However, in 8 of 217 test material combina-tions shown in Table 4-12, study directors in-dicated that skin sensitization occurred amonghuman subjects. A few of the RIPT reportssubmitted in response to the 1987 Federal Register notice document responses to CCP or its components that were consistent with theinduction of allergic contact dermatitis underthe intensive exposures of the experimentalprotocols. These RIPT reports Hill TopResearch, Inc., Report and 79-0085-73; andShelanski Holding Company Report SH-72-4(Table 4-12). Note, however, that reactionsoccurred in response to types of CCP that man - ufacturers claim are no longer in use. Cases of allergic contact dermatitis were not observedin any of the studies submitted in response tothe 1997 Federal Register notice. Two of the RIPT reports (e.g., Hill Top Re - search, Inc., Reports 98-101981-76 and 99-101981-70) suggest that some CCP testmaterials have a minor potential for skin4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 97irritation. Test results for these materials did not meet the testing laboratories' criteria forprimary skin irritants, but they provided evi - dence of an irritant response. Because most studies did not include comparison groups ex - posed to plain paper, it is unclear whether this potential for skin irritation would have beenmuch different from that of paper alone. Tests Under Simulated Conditions of Use . Three industry-sponsored tests evaluating theirritation potential of CCP under simulatedconditions of office use were submitted to theNIOSH docket in response to the 1987 and1997 Federal Register notices. Hill Top Research, Inc., conducted a dou- ble-blind placebo study in which subjects wereprovided with scissors and asked on 4 consecu-tive days to cut up samples of paper for 60 minunder controlled temperature and humidity(Hilltop Research, Inc., Report 83-0965-70).Three types of CCP and a control (\"white\") pa-per were tested in random order by two groupsof 10 and 9 subjects. After the 19 study sub-jects were exposed to one of the CCP samples(sample B), 10 (53%) reported irritation of theeyes, nose, or skin. When exposed to the sec - ond and third of the remaining CCP samples, 3 subjects (16%) and 2 subjects (10%), respec - tively, reported irritation symptoms. One subject (5%) reported irritation following expo - sure to the control paper. The authors con - cluded that their results demonstrated an unequal distribution of irritation symptomsamong the samples tested and that the numberof symptoms reported was particularly highwith exposure to one of the CCP samples. Theeyes were the most sensitive indicator, andsome symptoms persisted for 24 hr. Theauthors recommended that studies of this typeallow greater separation in time between sam - ples to prevent carryover effects from preced - ing samples.Hill Top Research, Inc., (Report 83-0123-70) conducted another double-blind study in which20 subjects were recruited to handle a stack of120 sheets of test paper. Every 30 sec, the sub - jects ran their hands over each side of another piece of paper until all the pieces had been han - dled at the end of 1 hr. The testing was done in a single room, with four different types of pa - per being handled each day. Subjects were ex - amined for signs of irritation and were questioned regarding symptoms before expo - sure and 30 min, 60 min, and 24 hr after expo - sure. One subject dropped out. No irritation responses were reported or observed for theeyes, forearms, or face with any of the testpapers. Seven subjects reported respiratorysymptoms, but four of them demonstratedthese effects with all four samples. These lattersymptoms appear to have resulted from preex-isting cold symptoms rather than from expo-sure to the paper samples. The results of thisstudy are difficult to interpret in light of the co-existing cold symptoms and pretest symptomspresent even for the control exposure. In 1998, Moore Business Forms, Inc., reported on tests for scoring irritation or sensitization asa result of challenge with Moore Clean Print \u00ae CB, CF, and CFB. This test was performed byBiosearch in 1983 (Table 4-12). The volun - teers included 200 men and women aged 16 to 68. Of the 200 subjects, 33 had allergies to typ - ical materials. Subjects were instructed to rub a sheet of the test paper (CFB) on their hands andwrists using a hand-washing motion. The pro - cedure was performed over a 4-week period using 8 sheets of paper per day for 5 days perweek. The subjects were examined weekly andwere instructed to report any unusual interimoccurrences. After day 20 of treatment, thesubjects rested for 2 weeks and again per - formed the same procedure with 8 sheets of CCP. They were examined immediately afterthe challenge and 4 and 24 hr later. The com - mercial laboratory that performed the test re - ported that none of the 200 subjects had any4 HEALTH EFFECTS 98 Carbonless Copy Papersigns of irritation or sensitization following any of the 20 initial or challenge exposures. 4.2.4.3 Summary In summary, the results of these laboratory studies in humans suggest that under someconditions of exposure to CCP or its compo - nents, workers may experience irritation of the upper respiratory tract or skin, and/or they maydevelop allergic contact dermatitis. It must beemphasized that most of these studies werenegative, and the reactions observed in the pos - itive studies were extremely rare. Furthermore, cases of allergic contact dermatitis were re - ported only in the earlier RIPT studies, which tested CCP types that are no longer in use; themore recent RIPT studies have detected onlyminor signs of skin irritation. If the Hill TopResearch, Inc., guidelines are applied, then themild irritation responses identified in some ofthe industry-sponsored RIPT studies would beconsidered Category I responses, which are de-fined as negative or insignificant findings, orsignificant findings unrelated to the test mate-rial. However, these same results do suggestthat 2% or less of the population could havesome type of mild reaction to CCP. Whetherthese mild irritation reactions would have beenobserved with ordinary bond paper is unclear,since these studies did not include bond paperas a control. 4.3 Animal Studies 4.3.1 Published Studies Hasegawa et al. 1982a. Hasegawa et al. [1982a] reported that diisopropylnaphthalenes(Kureha Micro Capsule Oil [KMC-A]) and1-phenyl-1-xylyl-ethanes (SAS) are twoclasses of solvents that are used in the manu - facture of CCP. They were introduced in Japan as replacements for PCBs in 1971. KMC isused by the Federal Republic of Germany andby Japan at a rate of 10,000 tons per year[Sturaro et al. 1994]. Large amounts of both materials were found in the body fat and sub - cutaneous fat of male JCL-SD rats 2 hr after a single oral dose of 0.1 mg/kg. The amounts in - creased with time until 24 hr after the dose. In the liver, the amounts were nearly the sameas those in the fat after 2 hr, but they rapidlydisappeared thereafter. The concentrations inblood were similar to those of the heart, kid - neys, and brain. Although the ratio of isomers in the KMC-A did not change, those of theSAS 296 differed by a ratio of 3:1 for1-phenyl-1-metaxylyl to 1-phenyl-1-orthoxylyl - ethane, respectively. This result was attributed to differences in hepatic metabolic rates. Noaccumulation was found in the organs, and lit - tle accumulation was found in the fat after daily administration for 1 month. Hasegawa et al. 1982b. Hasegawa et al. [1982b] administered 0.1g/kg body weight ofKMC-A and SAS 296 to JCL-SD rats everyday for 1 month. Biochemical examination re-vealed (1) a slight decrease in body weight anda small increase in liver weight (0.3% to 0.6%)compared with the controls; (2) disturbance oflipid metabolism in the liver (statistically sig-nificant decreases in triglycerides, glycolipids,and phospholipids) and serum (statisticallysignificant free fatty acid twofold to threefoldincreases, total and free cholesterol decreases);and (3) disturbance of glucose metabolism inthe liver (statistically significant decrease inglycogen and increase in pyruvate) from ad - ministration of both substances. A significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in theserum occurred in the case of SAS 296administration. L\u00f6froth 1982. L\u00f6froth [1982] examined a number of office materials for their potentialmutagenic activity and found that none of theCCPs contained detectable amounts of muta - genic components. However, the author com - mented that some impurities in triaryl methanes4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 99(used as color formers) have been reported to be mutagenic [Bonin et al. 1981]. Certin and Zissu 1983. Certin and Zissu [1983] performed cutaneous irritation tests in rabbits.They compared extracts of 12 CCPs with 5highly irritant reference oils, acetone (CB), orethyl acetate or acetone (CF) extracts (4 hrof soxlet extraction of 50 g, or acetone extrac - tion of 1 kg CB sheets in an ultrasonic tank for 1 hr). The CCP extracts were moderately orseverely irritating using the Draize method(Table 4-13). Chemical analysis using GC/MSanalysis identified the \"oils\" listed in Table 4-13. Thirteen papers contained a phenolic resin in the CF layer and traces of free phenols, bis - phenol A, and phenylphenol. For all of the CF analyses, compounds similar to abietic acidwere found. Certin and Zissu [1983] reportedthat 8 of the 12 extracts were moderately irri-tating (irritation index from 2.7 to 4.7), and theremaining 4 extracts were severely irritating (irritation index from 5.6 to 7.3). Histopathology results from animals exposed to moderatelyirritating products exhibited epidermalacanthoses alternating with superficial epider - mal necrosis, which led to thin, scaly crust that was sometimes continuous over the entire ex - tent of the lesion. The severely irritating prod - ucts caused more pronounced morphological findings. These were characterized by necrosisof the epidermis and superficial dermis, withinflammatory exocytosis and homogeneousdegeneration of the connective tissue of themid-dermis. The authors concluded that it wasprobably the oily constituents of the papersthat produced the observed irritation of theskin and mucosa of office workers. However,they also noted that the animal test results areprobably more grave than those experiencedby humans, since human exposures were lim-ited to several hundred micrograms on the fin-gers at the end of a day of handling. The authors4 HEALTH EFFECTS 100 Carbonless Copy PaperTable 4-13.

Not enumerated.remarked that nasal or ocular irritation is prob - ably explained by contact with soiled fingers. They did not think that it was likely that the oilsproduced respiratory irritation because of thelow volatility of their constituents; however,they did not discuss paper fibers as a potentialvehicle for the irritants. Cameron et al. 1986 . Cameron et al. [1986] studied the percutaneous absorption of triaryl - methane and phenoxazine-type color former components of CCPs. The percutaneous ab - sorption of carbon-14-labeled color former components of CCP was investigated in the ratas a model for assessing possible absorption ofthese components by human users of such pa - pers. Formulations of a proprietary color for - mer/solvent mixture were applied to the shaved backs of hooded rats. The mixture con-tained carbon-14-labeled 6-(dimethyl-amino)-3,3-bis(4-(dimethyl-amino) phenoxazine color former. Some of therats prepared with bileduct and urinary bladder cannulae. Urineand bile samples for24 hr and assayed for carbon-14 activity.The animals were then sacrificed, and car - bon-14 activity was measured in the skin, skin dressing, and body. Selected animalswere sacrificed 2, 6, 24, or 96 hr afterapplication, and carbon-14 activity in the ex - creta, skin and dressings, and body was de - termined. Microhistoautoradiography was performed on the skins of some animals.Nearly all the CVL- or BLASB-derived car - bon-14 activity was retained in or on the skin. Only 2.6% to 3.4% of the CVL and1.0% to 2.1% of the BLASB doses were ab - sorbed. During the 12 to 24 hr after application, 0.02% of the CVL and 0.11% of theBLASB doses were eliminated in the urine andbile. The authors conclude that CVL and BLASBare slowly absorbed into the systemic circulationfollowing topical application to rat skin. The au - thors concluded that these results (if extrapolated to humans) suggest that percutaneous absorptionof these compounds should not be significant dur - ing normal handling of CCP. Wolkoff et al. 1988. Wolkoff et al. [1988] re - ported airway-irritating effects in mice ex - posed to CCP using sensory irritation techniques [Alarie 1973]. Four mice were ex - posed for 10 min to emissions from CCP and emissions from crushed and compressed virgincopy papers. One CCP suspected of causingcomplaints decreased the respiratory rate sig - nificantly more than did a second CCP used without adverse effects. This result suggests ir - ritation. Because the CB layer of the first CCP produced only negligible irritation, the authorsconcluded that neither the solvent nor the colorformers caused the irritation. The authors sug-gested that the irritation was due to one or moreof the following: the evolution of formalde-hyde or other unidentified irritants in the paper,the evolution of irritant solvents from the paperand their transfer to the hands of the users, andthe transfer of irritant particulate matter fromthe paper to the hands. The authors concludedthat it would be beneficial to minimize the freeformaldehyde content of the paper, eliminatevolatile irritants from the CCP, and minimizethe transfer of irritant particulates or solventsto the skin. Anderson 1992. Anderson [1992] used stan - dard method ASTM E 981 [ASTM 1984] an adaptation of the Alarie [1973] method (whichevaluates respiratory irritation) in mice to as - sess the offgassing of CCP and determine its effects on sensory irritation (upper airway) andpulmonary irritation (deep lung). Using groupsof mice, the author concluded CCP to be a de - monstrable irritant for both upper and lower airways, causing a greater than 50% change inrespiratory rate. The type or composition of theCCP was not given except that it was4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 101commercially purchased. No other detailswere provided.4.3.2 NIOSH Docket SubmissionsMost information submitted to the NIOSHdocket concerned animal testing of CCP or itscomponents in extensive, widely accepted tox - icology test procedures. The coded submis - sions did not allow specific identification ofchemicals or formulations. Each of the approx - imately 1,500 animal studies submitted to thedocket was reviewed independently by aNIOSH toxicologist. Most materials had beentested in a series of protocols such as inhalationLC 50, cutaneous and/or oral LD 50, skin and/or eye irritation, and skin sensitization. Some ma-terials had been tested for mutagenesis, repro-ductive toxicity, or upper airway irritation. Notall materials were tested using every protocol.Most test results were negative; but positive re-sults that were reported during the NIOSH re-view summarized as follows: /c167The Mead Corporation sent summariesof eight reports to the NIOSH 1987docket. The material tested wascode 151 (chemical identification code),and all tests were negative except for a1980 study of acute dermal toxicity inrabbits that estimated the acute dermalLD 50to be greater than 2 g/kg body weight. However, slight to well-definederythema was noted in all animals ondays 1, 3, and 7; it continued in most ofthe animals through day 14. /c167 Hazelton Laboratories in Madison, Wis- consin, and Vienna, Virginia, submitteda series of 22 reports to the NIOSH 1987docket. Irritation was produced by someof the samples, but sensitization did notoccur. Inhalation experiments were neg - ative, but exposure concentrations werevery low in most cases./c167Biosearch evaluated CCP constituentsfrom Moore Business Forms, Inc., andsubmitted the results to the NIOSH 1987docket for acute oral toxicity, primaryeye irritation, primary skin irritation,and 5-day repeated dermal irritation. Allproducts tested were considered nontoxic,with LD 50s greater than 5 g/kg. None of the materials were classified by the Foodand Drug Administration's regulatorydefinition as primary eye irritants, pri - mary skin irritants, or dermal sensitizers.Several of the materials acted as mild ormoderate skin and eye irritants. /c167A series of toxicological test reports on avariety of CCP constituents were sub - mitted to the NIOSH docket and re-viewed. These test reports (Documents002 through 148) were originally pre-pared for the Monsanto Company inSt. Louis, Missouri. The tests had beenconducted between 1956 and 1980. Testmaterial and dermal and eyeirritation. They also included a few90-day feeding studies, mutagenesis as - says, and inhalation studies as well astwo aquatic studies with trout fry andmidge larvae. Most substances werenontoxic or exhibited mild toxicity.Some caused mild or moderate irritationto the skin or eyes. However, in mostcases, the low scores on the dermal orocular irritation assays resulted in theirclassification as ofthe tests (2/69 primary irritation assaysand 3/69 primary eye irritation assays)were graded as positive. From the othertests, NIOSH could infer that the productwould cause mild irritation in humans.However, it must be recognized that suchtesting of pure compounds may producemore exaggerated results than testing the4 HEALTH EFFECTS 102 Carbonless Copy Paperfinal CCP product, since less of the toxic component is available to consumers inthe finished product. In the brief com - ments noted below, substances identified as mild irritants were not classified as pri - mary irritants, even though some irritation occurred in more than one animal. Manyof the compounds caused diarrhea. Theseobservations are probably not relevant tohumans\u2014especially when animals weregavaged with a large volume of a slurry ofwhite paper. Also of questionable rele - vance was the liver damage caused by compound 043. This effect occurred whenanimals were exposed to 10,000 ppm for90 days. /c167In a NIOSH docket submission numberedDocument 050-EMI, a crystalline whitepowder was suspected to be relativelytoxic. Peer reviewers from the industrynoted that at full strength, this substancewas corrosive to the skin, severely irri-tating to the eyes, and acutely toxic byoral ingestion [Graves and Tardiff 1999].However, comments from the same peerreviewers noted that this component wasnever used in CCP production or offeredfor sale commercially. When the com - ponent was tested as part of a trial CCP, the paper was negative for acute and der - mal toxicity and eye and skin irritation. /c167Also of concern were a few studies in which compounds (033, 034, 036,038-TR-33 to TR-38) were tested byinhalation or dermal application. Al - though these compounds did not pro duce any deaths or pathological findings, expo - sures resulted in modified behavior. An - imals became hyperactive, salivated, became ataxic, and lost their righting re - flex. NIOSH concluded that low expo - sures to these compounds could produce comparable effects in humans. Peer re - viewers from the industry noted thatthese tests involved pure compounds, and that tests of the finished CCP prod - ucts containing these compounds were negative [Graves and Tardiff 1999]. Thechemical or component identificationwas unknown to NIOSH because oftrade secret claims by the industry. Thusconnecting the test results from purecompounds to finished products was notpossible. None of the mutagenicity stud - ies were positive, but not all substances were tested for mutagenicity. /c167Another NIOSH docket submissionfrom Monsanto is a series of 44 toxicityreports conducted by various testing lab - oratories on papers and dyes that were tested during the years 1978 to 1986.Each report consists of one to six toxic-ity tests that include oral and dermal tox-icity, skin and eye irritation assessment,mutagenicity testing, and skin sensitiza-tion testing in animals. Santosol 150 dye solution was tested more than any other product. Tests in-cluded a 90-day feeding study, develop-mental toxicity testing, and a series ofstudies in fish and midges. Unlike theother products tested in the Monsantoseries, an LD 50and a maximum tolerated dose were determined for Santosol 150.In general, this dye solution exhibitedlow toxicity. None of the products tested in the Monsanto series (including Santosol150) were mutagenic, but not all prod - ucts were tested for mutagenicity. None of the products were skin sensitizers inanimals or humans, but not all productswere tested for skin sensitization. Mostcompounds were not acutely toxic by theoral or dermal route. This conclusionwas based on the fact that they were notlethal at 5 g/kg (oral route) or 2 g/kg4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 103(dermal route). However, many of the products induced modified behavior (in - cluding lethargy, ataxia, and even paral - ysis) from which the animals recovered. At necropsy, some animals exhibitedmottled kidneys or livers. Diarrhea wasa common symptom. For example, rat sgavaged with a slurry of white paper ex - hibited white diarrhea for 1 to 2 days. The relevance of such exposures and ef - fects is questionable. One product (96 Solvent CB Paper Inter - nal Phase) was tested for developmental toxicity; it produced fetal malformationsat a concentration that was toxic to themother. None of the products were corrosive, and very few were classified as primaryirritants. However, some of the productscaused mild eye irritation and transitoryerythema and edema of the skin. Several paper products were tested for formaldehyde content, which rangedfrom 0.014 to <0.001 \u00b5g/g in the prod-ucts tested. Levels of detection for themethods were not noted. Overall, thematerials tested exhibited low or negli - gible toxicity. Some could act as mild ir - ritants. /c167The Mead Corporation submitted toxi - cology tests performed between March 3, 1987, and July 18, 1996. Tardiff [1997]reviewed the complete testing program ofthe Mead Corporation's evaluation ofCCP and of the ingredients used to man - ufacture Mead's CCP. (These same ma - terials were also submitted to and reviewed by NIOSH.) The Tardiff re - view encompasses 191 substances con - sisting of individual chemicals, mixtures used in the production of CCP, and vari - ous batches of CCP. The individual chemicals and mixtures includedvarious inks, dyes, powders, coatings, adhesives, and other materials. Theiridentities were not known because oftrade secret considerations by the com - pany. Ingredients were selected for test - ing to supplement information provided by the suppliers of the raw materials andto test chemicals considered for formu - lations that were sufficiently reactive to have the potential for producing syner - gistic reactions with other ingredients of CCP. The following is a list of assaysthat were selectively performed (basedon scientific judgment) with the test sub - stances: \u2014Eye irritation test in the rabbit \u2014Primary skin irritation test in the guinea pig \u2014Skin sensitization test in the guinea pig \u2014Acute oral toxicity test in the rat \u2014Acute dermal toxicity test in the rabbit \u2014Acute inhalation toxicity test in the rat \u2014Genotoxicity tests - icity assay and chromosomal aberra tion test) The toxicity studies summarized in Tardiff [1997] were evaluated using datainterpretation methods and guidelinesaccepted by the CPSC. Since thatcommission does not require the geno - toxicity testing mentioned above, Tardiff [1997] used conventional professionalpractice found acceptable by the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency andsupported by the National Academy ofSciences. To confirm the quality of thetoxicologic tests summarized in the re - port, each study was verified as having been conducted in accordance with the4 HEALTH EFFECTS 104 Carbonless Copy Papertesting requirements of the CPSC or the Organization for Economic Cooperationand Development. Each of the protocolsincluded stipulations for adhering togood laboratory practices. The following results were reported. Oral toxicity in rats was tested with84 chemicals and mixtures. Each pos - sessed an LD 50of >5 g/kg. According to CPSC criteria, these materials are nega - tive and unlikely to pose an acute hazard to humans by ingestion. Ocular irritationtests in rabbits were conducted with83 chemicals or mixtures; 55 producedno ocular irritation. According to Tardiff[1997], the 28 materials that tested posi - tive consisted of powders, liquids, and pastes. They produced a range of treat-ment-related effects, including iridaland/or corneal involvement and slight tomoderate conjunctival irritation (whichcleared within 24 to 72 hr of the test ma-terial administration). According to theauthor, these substances are unlikely tolead to positive results in humans ex-posed to CCP because the test results in-dicated only mild and transitory effectswith liquids, and end users would not beexposed to the liquids. Primary skin irritation tests in the guinea pigs were conducted with 86 chemicalsor mixtures. Each produced a skin irrita - tion score of less than 5. Tardiff [1997] states that based on CPSC criteria andthe primary irritation scoring data, thesematerials are negative and are unlikelyto cause primary skin irritation in hu - mans exposed to CCP. Acute dermal toxicity tests in rabbits were conductedwith 18 chemicals or mixtures. Each pos - sessed an LD 50>2 g/kg. On the basis of CPSC criteria, these materials are nega - tive for acute dermal toxicity. Skin sen - sitization tests in guinea pigs were performed with 95 chemicals or mix -tures. Eighty-seven were negative. Of the eight positive tests, treatment-relatedresults ranged from very faint to faint er - ythema reactions that cleared within 24 hr of the test material administration. Sixmaterials were tested as liquids\u2014whichdoes not represent normal usage of CCP.Therefore, Tardiff [1997] concludes thatthese reactions would not occur in hu - mans. The other two positive substances were tested as powders. Because the ex - posure is expected to be limited to \"min - ute\" quantities produced as CCP is cut, shredded, or torn, the doses encounteredwere considered insufficient by the au - thors to cause sensitization. Acute inhalation toxicity testing in rats was conducted with 44 chemical sub-stances or mixtures. Forty-three werenegative according to CPSC criteria.The only positive result came from a liq-uid mixture with an LC 50between 2 and 200 mg/L. Treatment-related effects in-cluded failure to gain expected body weight,respiratory distress, increased secretory re-sponses, other changes in hair coat, anddeath. Since exposure conditions with nor-mal use of CCP would not be in liquidform, Graves and Tardiff [1999] concludedthat the test material was unlikely to be anacute hazard to humans by inhalation. All 22 chemicals or mixtures tested for genotoxicity were negative for pointmutations and did not increase chromo - somal aberrations. These toxicity tests demonstrate that the tested CCP constit - uents are not mutagenic. 4.3.3 Summary After examining the toxicological animal stud - ies submitted to the NIOSH docket, NIOSH concludes that with a few exceptions, CCPconstituents are not acutely toxic by the oral,dermal, or inhalation route. A number of CCP4 HEALTH EFFECTS Carbonless Copy Paper 105constituents were shown to be mild irritants to the skin and eyes of experimental animals. Onestudy [Anderson 1992] stated that CCP froman unspecified source acted as both a sensoryand pulmonary irritant in mice. In summary, more than 300 substances and various combinations of materials were in - cluded in the animal studies. Of 238 tested for skin irritation, 8 were positive. In addition,some materials caused mild, transient irritation(25.2%; 60/238) but did not satisfy FDA's reg - ulatory definition of an irritant. In 129 dermal lethality tests, mild skin irritation was noted(17.8%; 23/129); however, the regulatory defi - nition is not based on this type of test. No pat - tern was observed to identify the CCP component responsible for the mild skin irrita-tion reported in humans. A total of 271substances were tested in the allergic contact dermatitis animal model, and 13 were positive.This result suggests that CCP infrequentlycauses allergic contact dermatitis in animals.Whether materials with positive toxicologicaloutcomes were actually marketed is unclear;but the general rationale for toxicity testing isto prevent the marketing of materials that mayharm users. Most of the toxicological data submitted to the NIOSH docket were coded by the manufactur - ers for proprietary reasons. Thus it was not possible to identify replicate tests or the natureof the test materials or their means of prepara - tion (dry, aqueous, neet, etc.). However, the animal toxicology results indicate only mildand transitory effects with liquids, and end us-ers would not be exposed to the liquids.4 HEALTH EFFECTS 106 Carbonless Copy Paper5 Summary and Conclusions Overall, the toxicologic, epidemiologic, and experimental studies reviewed in this document indicate that exposure to CCP hasbeen associated with the following adversehealth effects: irritation of the skin and mucousmembranes of the eyes and upper respiratorytract, allergic contact dermatitis (rarely), andsome systemic reactions (rarely). The evidenceregarding each of these possible health effectsis summarized in this Chapter. 5.1 Irritation of the Skin, Eyes, and Upper Respiratory Tract Evidence in the scientific literature indicatesan association between exposure to some typesof CCP and symptoms consistent with irrita-tion of the skin, eyes, and upper respiratorytract. The primary evidence for an associationcomes from human studies. Irritative symp-toms of the skin, eyes, and upper respiratorytract have been observed in numerous case re - ports and case series. Associations between irritative symptoms of the skin, eyes, and up - per respiratory tract and CCP exposure have also been generally observed in cross-sectionalepidemiologic studies of CCP-exposed work - ers. A potential source of bias in the epidemiologic studies is overreporting of symptoms by work - ers who are already aware of a possible associ - ation between CCP exposure and irritative symptoms of the skin, eyes, and upper respira - tory tract. This form of bias is often referred to as \"recall bias\" and is well recognized to be animportant factor in epidemiologic studies inwhich symptoms or exposures are identified byquestionnaires administered to the study sub - jects. The potential for recall bias may have been exacerbated by the use of leading ques - tions such as \"Do you think the paper makes you itch?\" (e.g., Menn\u00e9 et al. [1981]). A positive exposure-response relationship was observed between increasing CCP exposureand the prevalence of irritative symptoms ofthe skin, eyes, and upper respiratory tract in allof the studies that examined this issue; but thestrength and statistical significance of the ex-posure-response relationship varied dramati-cally from report to report. The studies thatexamined an exposure-response are summa-rized in Table 5-1. Less potential exists forsubjective report biases to influence adose-response relationship than for such biasesto influence an overall relationship with CCP.For subjective report biases to be important,study subjects with high CCP exposures wouldneed to report symptoms more often than thosewith moderate or low CCP exposures. Thoughsuch a scenario is possible, it is less likely thanfor people with any CCP exposure to reportsymptoms more often than people with no ex - posure. Selection bias is also a major concern in the cross-sectional studies that had low participa - tion rates, such as the study by Fristedt and Pettersson [1980]. It is possible that in thesestudies, subjects with symptoms would havebeen more likely to return the questionnairesthan were subjects without symptoms. Potential biases in the epidemiologic studies could also have led to an underestimation of Carbonless Copy Paper 1075 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 108 Carbonless Copy PaperTable 5-1.

In these cross-sectional studies, workers who reacted toCCP might have left the workforce and thuswould not have been included. In addition,since many of the researchers did not classifytheir subjects by exposure level, the overall ef - fect could have been diluted by the mix of workers with high and low potential for CCPexposure. The strongest evidence for an association be - tween symptoms and CCP exposure comes from the studies of indoor air posi - tive (and in several cases a statistically significant) association between CCP expo - sure and symptoms of skin, eye, and upper respiratory tract irritation (Table 5-2). Theseare the least susceptible to recall bias becausethey were not conducted in workplaces whereconcerns about CCP or other indoor pollutantsplayed a role in their selection for study. Also,none of the indoor air studies were designed primarily to address the CCP question; henceinvestigator bias is also less likely. These stud - ies used the most rigorous epidemiologic study designs, and the investigators were able to con - trol for a number of potentially confounding exposures when examining the association be - tween symptoms and CCP exposure. Determining whether associations observed in epidemiologic studies are causal is frequentlydifficult given the observational nature of thesestudies and the possible influence of confound - ers and other sources of bias. Such is certainly the case with the epidemiologic CCP literature.Hill [1977] has developed useful criteria forevaluating causality using all of the availabledata. Epidemiologists have widely adoptedthese criteria for evaluating the evidence ofcausality in the epidemiologic literature. Thecriteria include (1) the strength of the associa-tion, (2) the consistency of the association, Carbonless Copy Paper 109Table 5-2.

Thefollowing sections describe these criteria anduse them to evaluate the reported associationsbetween CCP exposure and irritation of theskin, eyes, nose, and upper respiratory tract. 5.1.1 Strength of the Association Associations that are large in magnitude are considered more likely to be causal, since theyare less likely to be explained by confoundingor other forms of bias. In the cross-sectional studies, weak to moder - ate associations were observed between CCP exposure and irritation of the skin, eyes, andupper respiratory tract. The odds ratios (ORs)reported in the cross-sectional studies summa-rized in Table 5-2 were approximately be-tween 1.1 (e.g., Zweers [1992]) and 2.3 (e.g.,Mendell [1991]). The strength of associationfor rate (or odds) ratios that are 1.2 to 1.5 and1.5 to 3.0 has been interpreted as being weakand moderate, respectively (see Monson[1980], p. 94). It should be recognized that thesize of the odds ratios are limited by the rela - tively high background rates of the symptoms studied. Many of the other cross-sectionalstudies (i.e., non-indoor air studies) did not in - clude an unexposed population, and thus it is difficult to judge the strength of association inthese studies. It is noteworthy that the preva - lence of symptoms among workers with ex - tremely high CCP exposures (i.e., /c361,000 sheets/day) was between 92% 100% in twoof the air cross-sectional studies(Table 5-1), which suggests a strong associa - tion among highly exposed workers. 5.1.2 Consistency Consistency refers to the repeated observation of similar findings in numerous study settings.The case studies and case series reports areconsistent insofar as they report similar symptoms involving the skin and mucosalmembranes of the eyes and upper respiratorytract. However, this apparent consistencymight be partly a reporting bias that occurs be - cause investigators have read previous case re - ports and are more likely to report findings that are similar to those previous reports. Perhapsmore convincing is the fact that thecross-sectional epidemiologic studies weregenerally consistent (see Table 4-3) in associ - ating skin, eye, and upper respiratory symp - toms with exposure to CCP. Associations of CCP with other symptoms such as headacheand fatigue have not been consistently ob - served in these studies. Overall, the epidemiologic studies are judged to be rela - tively consistent in reporting irritative symp- toms of the skin, eyes, and upper respiratorytract. 5.1.3 Specificity Specificity requires that an exposure be associ- ated with a single specific effect. Furthermore,if a disease has no other major risk factors (e.g.,asbestos and mesothelioma), the association isoften very credible and the studies are the leastsusceptible to recall bias. The irritative symptoms of the eyes, skin, and upper respiratory tract reported in CCPstudies are common effects with many riskfactors. Ocular and upper respiratory tractirritative symptoms in particular can be trig - gered by many exposures encountered in the indoor environment and are quite prevalent inmany office buildings. Thus the irritativesymptoms of the eyes, skin, and upper respira - tory tract that have been associated with CCP exposure are not specific to CCP. On the otherhand, the studies have been relatively consis - tent in reporting an association between CCP exposure and irritative symptoms of the eyes,skin, and upper respiratory tract. These symp - toms commonly occur together with exposures 110 Carbonless Copy Paper5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS to an irritant and thus should probably be viewed as a single effect and consistent withthe specificity criterion. 5.1.4 Relationship in Time (Temporality) Temporality requires that the exposure precede the disease and that the effects follow a coursein time that is physiologically plausible in rela - tion to the exposure. In the epidemiologic studies, it can be reason - ably assumed that the CCP exposures preceded the observed symptoms or signs. Furthermore,several of the case reports describe symptomsor signs of disease that subsided or disappearedafter the subject left work or after the CCP ex - posure was removed. Thus these human stud-ies meet the temporality criterion for the irritative symptoms of the eyes, skin, and up-per respiratory tract associated with CCP expo-sure. 5.1.5 Biological Gradient Biological gradient refers to evidence for a dose-response (or exposure-response) rela-tionship. A dose-response relationship isviewed by strongevidence for causality. A dose-response rela - tionship is less likely to be explained by report - ing bias or confounding than is an overall measure of association (i.e., a yes/no expo - sure). However, it is possible that such a dose-response relationship could be producedby confounding. A positive dose-response relationship between the frequency of handling CCP and the preva - lence of irritative symptoms of the eyes, skin, and upper respiratory tract was reported in thenine studies that examined this relationship(Table 5-1). Recall bias might explain theserelationships in some studies. However, it isunlikely to explain the relationships observedin the study by Skov et al. [1989], which wasone of the indoor air quality studies that was not conducted at a building with previous com - plaints related to CCP. Overall, these studies demonstrate a biological gradient by providing consistent evidence foran exposure-response relationship for irritativesymptoms of the eyes, skin, and upper respira - tory tract associated with exposure to CCP. 5.1.6 Biological Plausibility Biological plausibility exists when an associa - tion is consistent with what is known about the biology of the disease. The biological plausi - bility of the symptoms associated with CCP exposure is supported by the presence of sev-eral well-known irritants in amines,and kerosene). For example, in seven studies ofCCP and formaldehyde, nearly all exposuremeasurements exceeded the NIOSH REL (butnot the OSHA The bio - logical plausibility of the irritative effects is further supported by the similar effects ob - served in animal studies. Irritation of the skin or respiratory tract has been demonstrated inseveral studies of animals exposed to CCP orits components (e.g., see Certin and Zissu[1983]; Wolkoff et al. [1988]; Anderson[1992]). Irritation of the skin was reported in anumber of the industry-sponsored toxicologicstudies reported to the NIOSH docket, al - though these reactions did not indicate primary skin irritation according to the regulatorycriteria established by FDA. In addition, thepositive reactions observed in these studieswere generally due to exposures to CCP com - ponents in liquid form. Users of CCP are not exposed to these substances in liquid form, and Carbonless Copy Paper 111it is therefore unlikely that they would experi - ence such high levels of exposure. Understanding the mechanism by which an ex - posure causes a health effect adds credence to a causal association. The mechanisms involvedin the irritative symptoms of the eyes, skin, andupper respiratory tract associated with CCP ex - posure have not been established. In fact, it is unclear which of the CCP components mightbe responsible for these symptoms, although(as mentioned above) chemicals in some typesof CCP are known irritants. Few studies haveincluded ordinary bond paper as a control formechanical abrasion from handling paper orfor exposure to chemicals (such as formalde - hyde) that are contained in ordinary paper. However, in the few studies that comparedCCP with ordinary bond, the irritative effectswere clearly greater for CCP (i.e., Nilzen[1975], Norb\u00e4ck et al. [1983b], Morgan andCamp [1988], and Koenig [1988]). An understanding of the mechanism should not be required for inferring causality. As Hill[1977] suggested, \"What is biologically plau-sible depends upon the biological knowledgeof the day.\" In numerous examples, causal as-sociations have been identified well before theunderlying biological mechanisms were un - derstood (e.g., smoking and lung cancer). Overall, reasonably supportive evidence exists for the biological plausibility of the associationbetween CCP exposure and the irritative symp - toms of the eyes, skin, and upper respiratory tract observed in the epidemiologic studies. 5.1.7 CoherenceCoherence requires that the observed associa - tion not conflict with what is known about the natural history and biology of the disease. Thedistinction between this criterion and biologi - cal plausibility is a fine one. An example given by Hill [1977] is that the association betweenlung cancer and smoking is coherent with the temporal rise that has taken place in both vari - ables over the last century. The reports in the literature of an association between exposure to CCP and irritativesymptoms of the eyes, skin, and upper respi - ratory tract are not in conflict with current knowlege of the biology of these health ef - fects. One ap parently contradictory fact is that health-related inquiries to CCP manufacturershave reportedly decreased from 1987 to 1996,dropping from approximately 130 to 50 inqui - ries per year [letter to the NIOSH docket from Robert Tardiff, October 6, 1998]. This de - crease has occurred despite increases in the production of CCP from approximately 85,000to 100,000 tons/year over the same period.However, increases in production would notnecessarily lead to increased exposures in of-fices and other situations where CCP is used.Thus it is unclear whether the number of peo-ple exposed and the level of exposure havedropped or increased during this period.Changes in the formulation of CCP during thisperiod could also explain the decrease in com-plaints. Therefore, the coherence criterion con-tributes little to determining causality for theirritative symptoms of the eyes, skin, and up - per respiratory tract associated with CCP expo - sure. 5.1.8 Experimental Evidence Experiments can provide the strongest evi - dence for causality, but such information is rarely available for toxic effects in workers. Inthe case of CCP, a few experimental studies inhumans have demonstrated irritative symp - toms and signs with exposure to some types or components of CCP. Nilzen [1975] reported weak to moderate signs of skin irritation among atopic persons exposedto CCP with skin-prick testing, but the same re - actions were observed with exposure to5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 112 Carbonless Copy Paperordinary bond paper. Nilzen [1975] also re - ported symptoms consistent with nasal irritation in subjects exposed to vapors from CCP or bondpaper, but the CCP caused a stronger reaction.Another study measuring the effects of CCP onnasal passages reported signs consistent withnasal irritation and congestion [Morgan andCamp 1986; Koenig 1988]. In an indus - try-sponsored study, a high percentage of sub - jects (40%) demonstrated irritation of the eyes, skin, or nose when they used scissors to cut oneparticular type of CCP (Hill Top Research, Inc.,Report 83-0965-70), but not when they cutbond paper. Signs of dermal irritation (e.g. HillTop Research, Inc., Report 79-0085-73) wereobserved in some of the RIPT studies that weresubmitted to the 1987 docket. However, the useof the products tested in these studies has gener-ally been discontinued. Only very mild signs ofskin irritation were observed among subjects inthe more recent RIPT studies that tested CCPmaterials in current use and that were submittedto the NIOSH docket in 1997. Generally lessthan 2% of subjects demonstrated very mildskin irritation in these studies, but higher per-centages (e.g., >10%) were reported for some ofthe materials tested in two of the more recentstudies submitted to the docket (Hill Top Re-search, Inc., 1998 and 1999). However, thesetwo studies were not considered by the investi - gators to be positive for irritation. These experimental studies are not subject to the potential recall bias of the epidemiologicstudies, since they used objective tests. Also, itis very unlikely that the positive findings insome of these studies could be explained byother forms of biases or chance. The inconsis - tency between the findings in these studies may be explained by differences in the types ofCCP tested or other differences in study de - sign. It is unclear how relevant these experi - mental models are, since the exposure from patch testing is quite different from exposuresamong workers who use CCP in offices andelsewhere. These studies also have thepotential for a negative selection bias, since they generally involved healthy volunteers andcould thus have excluded sensitive persons. 5.1.9 Reasoning by Analogy Reasoning by analogy refers to making an analogy with the known health effects for asimilar exposure. For example, the fact that adrug has characteristics similar to Thalidomide(a known teratogen) provides support for acausal relationship between this drug and birthdefects. No useful analogies exist for CCP;thus this criterion is not useful for judging cau - sality in this case. 5.1.10 Summary In summary, the Hill criteria for consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient(dose-response), biological plausibility, andexperimental evidence support a casual associ-ation between CCP exposure and irritativesymptoms of the skin, eyes, and upper respira-tory tract. Because the associations observedin the epidemiologic studies were generallyweak to moderate, the evidence does not fullysatisfy the criterion for the strength of associ-ation. Although not all of the criteria are fullymet, Hill [1977] points out that none of thecriteria can provide absolute proof of acause-and-effect relationship, and none shouldbe used as an absolute requirement for proof ofa cause-and-effect relationship. Furthermore,not all of these criteria are equally important.The dose-response relationship observed andthe experimental evidence reported for someCCP exposures and irritative symptoms of theeyes, skin, and upper respiratory tract providethe strongest evidence for a causal association. 5.2 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Several authors have reported cases of allergiccontact dermatitis that appear to have been as - sociated with CCP or its components [Marks 1981; Kannerva et al. 1990a,b, 1993; Shehade5 Carbonless Copy Paper 1131987]. Development of sensitization to CCP or its components was also reported in a few per - sons in several industry-sponsored RIPT stud - ies (Report 77-512-70 and Supplemental Report 79-512b-70, Report 77-896-71, andReport 79-0085-73, all from Hill Top Re - search, Inc.; and Project SH-72-4, dated April 18, 1972, performed by the Shelanski HoldingCompany, Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, forMonsanto Co., St. Louis, Missouri). In 8 of 217test materials shown in Table 4-12, study in - vestigators indicated that skin sensitization oc - curred in some human subjects. However, these studies were mostly judged to be nega - tive for irritation by the investigators. Thus in a small proportion of the population, CCP or itscomponents appear capable of inducingcell-mediated (type IV) immune response andallergic contact dermatitis, particularly underthe intensive exposures associated with RIPTprotocols. Cases of allergic contact dermatitiswere reported only in RIPT studies from the1970s that were submitted to the 1987 NIOSHdocket; no cases were reported in the studiessubmitted to the 1997 docket. This fact indi-cates that the CCP component(s) responsiblefor the allergic contact dermatitis observed inthe early studies may have been removed fromthe more recent formulations of CCP. 5.3 Systemic Reactions Three patients with systemic reactions clini - cally suggestive of mast cell and/or basophil degranulation after cutaneous challenge withCCP or its components have been reported intwo published case reports [Marks et al.1984;LaMarte 1988]. One patient challenged byCCP handling became symptomatic approxi - mately 15 to 20 min after exposure and experi - enced swelling of the exposed hand, hives on the neck, changes in both the inspiratory andexpiratory limbs of the flow-volume loop (sug - gesting upper airways obstruction), and ele - vated circulating levels of several arachidonic acid metabolites. Skin-prick testing with CCPdust was reported to be negative [Marks et al. 1984]. One patient who was challenged by rub - bing 1% alkylphenol novolac resin dispersion onto the forearm became symptomatic approx - imately 15 min after exposure and developed hoarseness, wheezing, and angioedema of botharms. A subsequent challenge with this mate - rial was followed by hoarseness, wheezing, and angioedema at the challenge site. Videoendoscopy of the larynx was interpreted asshowing diffuse swelling and marked edema ofthe true vocal cords. Plasma histamine levelsobtained at the onset and peak of symptomswere sixfold higher than the prechallenge level[LaMarte 1988]. Finally, one patient who waschallenged by rubbing 1% alkylphenolnovolac resin onto one arm was reported tohave angioedema of the arm and hoarseness30 min after challenge [LaMarte 1988]. These reports suggest that some CCPs or their components can induce reactions clinicallycompatible with those caused by mast celland/or basophil mediator release. Immuno-logic sensitization was not adequately evalu-ated in these studies, and thus it is unclearwhether an immunologic mechanism underliesthese reactions. However, no additional reportswere located in the peer-reviewed literatureover the last 12 years. Thus, even if the re - ported reactions were referable to CCP expo - sure, systemic reactions of this type appear to be exceedingly rare. Furthermore, the rele - vance of these reports to current CCP expo - sures is uncertain. 5.4 Conclusions On the basis of a NIOSH review of the scien - tific literature and information submitted in re - sponse to its 1987 and 1997 Federal Register notices, NIOSH concludes the following: /c167The weight of the evidence supports theconclusion that exposure to certain typesof CCP or its components has, under5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 114 Carbonless Copy Paper5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS some conditions, resulted in symptoms of irritation of the skin and of themucosal membranes of the eyes and up - per respiratory tract. This conclusion is based primarily on in - terpretation of the evidence from the epidemiologic studies. Although themagnitude of the effects observed inthese studies was only weak to moder - ate, these studies were reasonably con - sistent in reporting an association and evidence of an exposure-response rela - tionship between CCP exposure and irritative symptoms of the eyes, skin,and upper respiratory tract. Theplausibility of the epidemiologic evi - dence is supported by the presence of known irritants in some types of CCP,toxicologic studies that demonstratemild irritation in laboratory animals ex-posed to CCP, and the evidence forrespiratory and skin irritation in some ofthe experimental laboratory studies inhumans. Some of the epidemiologicstudies may have been biased, particu-larly by overreporting from study sub-jects who were already concerned aboutthe potential effects of CCP exposure(i.e., recall bias). However, it is unlikelythat recall bias could explain the associa - tions observed between CCP exposure and irritative symptoms of the eyes,skin, and upper respiratory tract in theindoor air quality studies, since thesestudies were not conducted in an atmo - sphere of concern regarding the health effects of CCP. /c167Exposure to CCP or its components mayrarely cause allergic contact dermatitis. This conclusion is based on published case reports of allergic contact sensitiza - tion and results reported in several in - dustry-sponsored RIPT studies. Cases of allergic contact dermatitis were reportedonly in RIPT studies from the 1970s that were submitted to the 1987 NIOSHdocket; no cases were reported in thestudies submitted to the 1997 docket.This fact may indicate that the CCPcomponent responsible for the allergiccontact dermatitis observed in the earlystudies was removed from the more re - cent formulations of CCP. /c167Systemic reactions have occurred in a few persons exposed to CCP. This conclusion is based on the finding that three such cases have been reportedin the peer-reviewed medical literature.No cases have been reported in the last7 years, and thus there is no evidencethat current exposures to CCP present arisk for this health outcome. /c167Data are insufficient to evaluate claimsof other adverse health effects (such asneurologic effects and reports of MCS)that have been suggested in some of theclinical reports submitted to the NIOSHdocket. In conclusion, although the weight of the evi - dence indicates that exposure to CCP in the past has resulted in adverse health effects, it isuncertain whether current formulations ofCCP represent a significant risk to exposedworkers. Only a few cases of systemic reac - tions and allergic contact dermatitis have been reported in the United States or in Europe,which suggests that the risk of these seriousoutcomes is extremely low given the largenumber of people who have been exposed toCCP over a period of many years. Recentlyconducted experimental studies in humans(RIPT studies) suggest that the potential forskin irritation from exposure to current formu - lations of CCP is nonexistent, or at most slight. However, it is unclear how well these experi - mental studies simulate the exposures and Carbonless Copy Paper 115potential responses of CCP users\u2014particularly heavy users. Data from industry reportingsystems suggest no widespread problem and infact indicate a decrease in health-relatedcomplaints in recent years despite an increasein CCP production. However, these passivereporting systems are unlikely to capture all oreven most cases of CCP-related health ef - fects, and changes in publicity about CCP may have caused fluctuations in the reporting ofcases. Since the 1980s, no epidemiologic stud - ies have been conducted to determine irritativesymptoms among U.S. Workers exposed to CCP [Mendell et al. 1991]. A positive epi - demiologic study was conducted in Finland in 1991 [Jaakkola and Jaakkola 1999]. However,the relevance of these findings for U.S. work - ers may be limited because of differences be - tween the CCP products used in Europe and the United States. Thus information is lackingabout the prevalence of irritation of the eyes,skin, and upper respiratory tract among work - ers currently handling CCP in the United States. 116 Carbonless Copy Paper5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS6 Recommendations 6.1 Historical Recommendations in the Scientific Literature The earliest recommendations for eliminat - ing or reducing symptoms associated with CCP exposures originated in Sweden from theNational Swedish Board of Occupational Safetyand Health [1976]. These recommendationsand those that were echoed or byvarious Coun-cil for Offices and Administration [1988], theCornell University adequate condi-tions (including ventilation, tempera-ture, and humidity control) in office,paper storage, and filing areas. /c167Avoid ingesting CCP chemicals by min - imizing hand-to-mouth contact. /c167Do not rub eyes when handling CCP. /c167If symptoms occur, select a CCP with a different composition. /c167Substitute a mechanical-type paper(e.g., carbon paper) for a chemical-typepaper (i.e., CCP). /c167Limit contact with CCP by spreadingCCP-related work over a longer periodor by reducing the amount used and/or stored in the workspace. /c167Employ proper housecleaning and goodhand-hygiene procedures (including, oc - casionally, the use of protective gloves and/or hand creams). /c167Inform workers about the symptoms thathave been noted by workers who handleCCP. /c167If you are a CCP manufacturer or im-porter, give exact data about the sub-stances used and provide qualitycertificates for auxiliary substances, ad-ditives, and intermediate products usedfor each lot of CCP. The Danish Branch Safety Council for Offices and Administration [1988] also recommendeduse of the following checklist to evaluate com - plaints received when working with CCP: /c167Why do you think that the discomforts can be traced to CCP work? /c167How many persons suffer discomfort inconnection with work using this kind ofpaper? /c167Who suffers from the discomforts? /c167Have there been complaints in connec - tion with work with CCP? Carbonless Copy Paper 117/c167Has the paper quality been recently changed or has a new delivery of CCPbeen made? /c167Have any of the following discomfortsdeveloped: \u2014Irritation of mouth, eyes, nose, or throat \u2014Skin problems of the face, hands, or arms \u2014Headache, vertigo, or exhaustion /c167How long have the person(s) affected suffered from the symptoms? /c167Do the symptoms disappear duringweekends and/or vacations? /c167Do the symptoms develop especially incertain departments or at some specialfunction? /c167How much CCP is handled, separatelyor in total? /c167Does the consumption of CCP vary dur - ing the course of a month? /c167Is there any connection between the amounts of CCP and the complaints? /c167How long have you worked with theCCP that you believe to be the cause ofyour symptoms? /c167Have similar symptoms occurred amongfellow workers who do not work withCCP? /c167Is the indoor climate (temperature, rela - tive humidity, quality of the air, etc.) satisfactory?/c167What is the extent of cleaning? /c167Who produces the CCP? /c167Who prints the CCP? following work withCCP been reported? 6.2 NIOSH Recommendations NIOSH recognizes that it may occasionally benecessary to limit CCP exposure in certainworkers through administrative controls(such as job rotation). But in most cases, im - plementing normal precautions and recom - mendations for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality should be adequate to reduce oreliminate symptoms. Good industrial hygieneand work practices are likely to prevent symp-toms from potent irritants (such as formalde-hyde) that may be emitted from CCP. Theseinclude adequate ventilation, humidity, andtemperature controls; proper housekeeping;minimal hand-to-mouth and hand-to-eye con-tact; and periodic cleansing of hands. In addition, NIOSH recommends the follow - ing: /c167CCP manufacturers and their suppliers are encouraged to follow best practices,such as the Product Stewardship Codeof Management Practices [AmericanChemistry Council 2000]; they shouldalso consider enhancing their productguidance to reflect that published studiesindicate that irritative symptoms appearto increase with increasing exposure toCCP. /c167CCP manufacturers and their suppliersshould also consider how human testprocedures (e.g., RIPT) can be modified6 RECOMMENDATIONS 118 Carbonless Copy Paperby the use of standardized protocols that include proper controls (e.g., bondpaper), tests that mimic high-use situa - tions, and meaningful criteria for scoring and interpreting these tests to assesssafety from skin contact (e.g., ASTMD 6355-98) [ASTM 1999]. Current bestpractices in the field of product testingmay not be sensitive enough to identify mild skin irritants. /c167As part of ongoing surveillance, CCPmanufacturers and their suppliers maywant to evaluate the frequency andseverity of irritation in workers Carbonless A review of report Carbonless copying paper and health prob - lems by the Scandinavisk Biomedicinsk Institut.
