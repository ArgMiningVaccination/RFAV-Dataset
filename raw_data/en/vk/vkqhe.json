Alternative medicines, as defined by the panel of National Health, Bethesda, Maryland are, \"the healing powers that include all health systems and practices that are different from the dominant health system of a particular society or culture.\" This includes practices like ayurveda, herbal medicine, folk medicine, homeopathy, acupuncture, naturopathy, diet practices, chiropractic, music therapy, massage, etc. People whose body does not respond to the traditional allopathic medicines generally use the alternative or complementary medicines. For example, people suffering from AIDS, cancer, arthritis, and chronic back pain. Alternative medicinal therapies are included in the traditional medical practices only when their efficacy to cure diseases is proven by certain researches. One of the most popular examples of this is the chiropractors. The chiropractors, who earlier were not approached because of their being alternative and ineffective, are now recognized members of the medical fraternity. The increase in the number of people opting for alternative medicine is primarily because traditional medicines are of little or no use to them. While some physicians are trying to collaborate these alternative medicines with the conventional allopathic ones, others remain rigid in oppose of their use even after the benefits of the chemical compounds found in these medicines have been shown by various researches. While undergoing any doctor's treatment inform him completely about the other kind of medical approaches you have been undergoing. You should change your doctor of he is not comfortable with that form of treatment. By doing this your doctor will calculate any kind of future contradictions associated with your treatment and the best alternative medicine that would be effective for you.

But, during the past few years many educational institutes and universities have offered recognized courses of alternative therapies like homeopathy, ayurveda, siddha, unani, acupuncture and naturopathy. Summary: The popularity of these treatments can be known from the fact that people now demand better care than what was given to them through the traditional medicines. Moreover, people now do not have to undergo the pain and sufferings caused due to the healing techniques of the modern medicines. "}
