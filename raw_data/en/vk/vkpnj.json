I had been on my spiritual journey of awakening for several years prior to this. I was discovering who I was becoming and what my life purpose was. But, it seemed that no matter what I did or how much I healed, I kept hitting blockages. It was as if I had reached some kind of energetic ceiling to my personal growth. At this time in my life, no matter what I did to raise my vibration, I was still battling intense days filled with postpartum depression and anxiety attacks. I remember many times feeling emotionally depleted and physically exhausted. And, on top of that, I was dealing with loads of inflammation, chronic pain and frequent attacks on my immune system. I was stumped! I couldn't figure it out. I was doing twice a day [meditations](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/meditation), practicing yoga, working with healers, eating healthy, exercising, etc. But, no matter what I did, I just kept feeling energetically pulled downwards. My mind and emotions were all over the place and I was completely ungrounded, uncentered and disconnected. And, no matter how healthy my lifestyle was, I was always either sick or tired. It felt like I was on a never ending hamster wheel of continuous struggle! And, then, something happened that changed my life. A teacher introduced me to the role toxins and chemicals play in our overall health and well being. I was raised in a very traditional home. So, this was a brand new concept to me. With this new knowledge, I began to invest in a more natural lifestyle. I became more drawn to products that were safer and less toxic. Over the coming year, my medicine cabinet, cleaning supplies, skincare, makeup, fragrances and beauty products all received a healthier makeover as I became more sensitive and aware of the chemical impact on my body. It didn't take long for my energy and vibration to drastically increase. I began to gain clarity around the direction I wanted to take in my life. Within a year, my mental, physical and emotional states returned to balance. And, I began to feel like I was able to once again, move forward on my spiritual journey. There was something about this process that was so important to me, that I can't ignore it. I share this story with you, because I learned a really powerful lesson that year. I learned that the greater effort I made to reduce my toxic load, the higher my vibration was able to raise and the easier it was for me to come back home to myself. What Is Toxic Load? Toxic load is the build-up of toxins in your body from chemicals in your daily life. The strain that these chemicals place on your body is called \"toxic load.\" Most people are completely unaware of the amount of chemicals and toxins that they are exposed to daily. It's estimated that over 200 chemicals are found in a newborn's umbilical cord blood. In addition, humans are exposed to [700,000 different toxic chemicals](https://nervedoctor.info/daily-toxin-intake-how-many-toxins-are-you-accumulating/) on a daily basis. The impacts of chemical overload can have a devastating effect on your health. Most perfumes, fragrances and toxins found in your every-day products have been linked to: Hormone disruption Auto-immune diseases Reproductive issues / infertility Weight gain Allergies Headaches and migraines Skin problems Cancer DNA damage Anxiety, stress and depression Sleep troubles / fatigue Respiratory issues In addition, I've seen firsthand the kinds of energetic effects that overexposure to these ingredients have on our [auric field](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/aura-dilemmas). For example, someone whose body is burdened with toxins will often have very dark, dense and damaged energy fields. It seems to me like there is a direct connection between toxic load and our spiritual, energetic field. I've been working with clients recently whose bodily systems look completely overwhelmed. Of course, I'm seeing this in an etheric or spiritual kind of way. But usually the people that I see this with all report similar feelings: anxiety, stress, sleep troubles, worry, etc. When I ask for guidance, the information I often receive is that many of us could be more conscious of our toxic load. It often contributes to this overwhelming feeling on all levels of our being - physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. Plus, I have seen time and time again the way toxins have played a role in disconnecting us from our higher [intuitive wisdom](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/intuitive-abilities). They seem to muddy our [central column](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/why-is-everyone-talking-about-torus-fields) that connects us both to God and higher states of consciousness as well as our [connection to Earth](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/find-your-birth-element) and home. All of this is to say that it's critical that we learn to take small steps each day to purify our body, mind and Soul. I believe that one BIG way to do this is to begin by becoming more aware of the number of chemicals that we expose our bodies and homes to. Where Do Toxins Come From? Toxins come from many sources, including: Cleaning supplies Perfumes and colognes Lotions Laundry supplies Haircare products Soaps Beauty products and skincare Toothpaste and mouthwash Makeup Artificial fragrances Foods and drinking water 4 Main Areas of Detox There are four main areas in our life that we can reduce our toxic load to help achieve a better level of mind-body-spirit wholeness. 1) FOOD DETOX This includes increasing our intake of cleaner, natural ingredients and reducing our intake of processed and packaged foods and beverages. When possible, choose options that are organic and pesticide free. And, when you can't eat high-vibrational foods, be sure to [clear, program and charge your food](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/blessing-your-food-and-drinks) by blessing it before every meal. It's also a good idea to be mindful of how you cook and store your meals. Plastic food containers and non-stick cookware have been linked to reproductive problems and cancer in humans. A food detox should also include being mindful of other things we digest internally such as our vitamins, supplements and medications. It's wise to invest in high-quality products from brands you love and trust and to limit your exposure to over-the-counter medications and pharmaceuticals whenever possible. Finally, we want to drink as much clean, pure water as possible to help support the body's natural detox functions. Make sure you are filtering your drinking water and that it is free of chlorine and fluoride. Limit your use of plastic bottles and cups and opt for stainless steel or glass instead! 2) BEAUTY DETOX The average woman puts 168 chemicals on her skin a day via her skincare, grooming products and makeup. Reducing the toxic load in this category is all about choosing safer, natural, and non-toxic ingredients in our [bath](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/winter-bath-ritual) and body products, deodorants, hair care, perfumes, oral care and cosmetics. I utilize [EWG's Database](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) for a list of the safest cosmetics. There are also ways to support your body in naturally detoxing heavy metals and chemicals from these products. A few simple ways to detox include using bentonite clay to detox your feet or [armpits](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/32299322318180392/), [dry brushing](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/32299322318180383/) before your showers, and incorporating [detox teas](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/32299322318049362/) and waters into your everyday diet. At least once a month, I sit in [detox bath](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/32299322318165163/) for at least 20 minutes. Mix the following ingredients together in a warm bath and soak: 1 cup Epsom Salt 1 cup Baking Soda 1/3 cup Pink Himalayan Salt 1/3 cup Apple Cider Vinegar 5 drops of Lavender Essential Oil 5 drops of Cedarwood Essential Oil 3) SPIRITUAL DETOX For obvious reasons, this one is my favorite and most researched topics. A spiritual detox includes giving your Spirit time to unwind and unplug from the modern world. This can look like more time in nature, quiet time, journaling, prayer and [meditation](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/meditation). Too much technology and social media consumption can pull your energy out of alignment and fill your Spirit with loads of negativity. So a spiritual detox also includes reducing the amount of time you spend on social media and technology. In addition, a spiritual detox also includes monitoring the kinds of toxic behaviors, habits, thoughts, relationships and words that you allow into your field. Give yourself permission to say \"no\" and honor stronger boundaries. Finally, spiritual detox includes routine aura clearing and healing. This [tutorial](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/clear-your-energy) teaches you how to cleanse your aura with [sunlight](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/clear-your-energy#viewer-4i8il), [crystals](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/clear-your-energy#viewer-5ku62), [salt baths](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/clear-your-energy#viewer-5nu30) and [smudge](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/post/clear-your-energy#viewer-ardsq). 4) HOME DETOX A home detox starts by slowly trading or replacing your household cleaners and laundry supplies with safer alternatives. Some of the most harmful cleaning products in our homes include traditional toilet cleaners, disinfectants, stain removers, laundry detergents, fabric softeners and floor cleaners. In addition, new furniture, pillows and mattresses are loaded with chemicals and flame retardants. You also want to be mindful of clothing, towels, blankets and other textiles that come in contact with your body. You should aim to strip laundry and new products whenever possible or purchase organic. A home detox isn't just about switching out your surface cleaners... it's also about ensuring the AIR in your home is as pure and clean as possible. This means ditching traditional candles, potpourris, scent warmers, plug-ins and air fresheners and opting for [essential oils](https://www.kelseykuehl.com/essential-oils) and beeswax candles instead.
