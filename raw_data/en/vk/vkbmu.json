Take a minute to review the January issue of Counsel-ing Today to see why Charlotte is one of the hottest cities on the East Coast these days! And in this issue, read more about the dedicated leaders and members of the North Carolina Counseling Association (see p. 54), an ACA branch and cospon-sor of this year's Annual Conference & Exposition. You'll quickly understand why our colleagues in NCCA are so excited and proud for us to visit Charlotte. This year's conference offers a won- derful, inspiring location as well as new features that will add even more value. For the first time, you will be able to earn 20 continuing education credits at no ad-ditional cost \u2014 in other words, as part of your registration fee (just so you know, there is a nominal $15 certificate process-ing fee, however). By adjusting the sched-ule and reshaping some of the conference format, ACA staff was able to make this useful change. Moreover, you can add 18 more CE credits by enrolling in the preconference Learning Institutes. And I must say, the lineup this year is very, very impressive. With presenters such as Gerald Corey, Thomas Sweeney, Jane Myers, Jane Web-ber and many more, the Learning Insti-tutes offer a wonderful opportunity to gain intensive knowledge within a specific area. This year, there are 26 advanced-level sessions, including \"Advanced T echniques in Brief Solution-focused Counseling With Children, Adolescents, Parents and Schools\" by John Murphy and \"Advanced Private Practice T oolbox: Nuts and Bolts Ideas for Increasing Referrals, Working With Managed Care and Other Tools\" by Robert J. Walsh and Norman Dasenbrook. Among the 14 introductory-level Learn- ing Institutes are \"Cut It Out: Eating Disorders and Associated Self-injurious Behaviors\" by T rish Murray and \"Crash: Using Movies to Explore Postmodern Implications for Counseling\" by Jerry Mobley. These are just a few examples of the incredible learning opportunities you can participate in by signing up for one or even two of the Learning Institutes. I urge you to visit counseling.org/conference and scroll down to \"Preconference Learning Institutes\" to review all the titles, which are also listed on pages 49 and 50 of Counsel-ing Today's December issue. If you have already registered for the conference, you can still add a Learning Institute either online (log in and sign up) or by calling 800.347.6647 ext. 222. I am also very excited about this year's keynote speakers, Judy Shepard and C. Adolfo Bermeo. With all that is happening in our world and with our economy, I can't think of more appropriate speakers. These two individuals are all about positive change, human rights and social justice. They did not like the injustices they saw in the world, so they set out to achieve sig- nificant change that would positively affect people's lives. Their stories are dramatic, and I promise that you will be moved and inspired. Finally, I am very excited to announce this year's highlighted presidential sessions: Reflections on Access, Equity and Social Justice: A Conversation with Adolfo Bermeo, 60-minute program, Courtland C. Lee, University of Maryland, College Park, Md. The Conference is coming!

The registra-tion numbers are strong, the exhibitors are ready to show off their latest offerings, our preconference Learning Institutes will be led by top-notch presenters, the ACA Career Center is ready to roll, many of our best-selling books (and authors) will be available and many of our divisions have planned special sessions and events. We are anticipating a great deal of \"coun-selor energy\" when we gather. Now, all we need is you! Many of you who attended last year's event in Honolulu will remember the \"feeling\" of the conference \u2014 outstand-ing sessions balanced by enough time to connect with colleagues and have fun in the local area. This year will be no differ-ent in terms of professional opportunities and the chance to connect. And, quite frankly, after this past year, which included some fairly impactful events (politically, economically and so-cially), the chance to reenergize with col-leagues who are as dedicated to the coun-seling profession as you are is something that really cannot be missed! I encourage you to find a way to join with us as we convene our 58th annual gathering.American Counseling Association President Colleen R.

Mission Statement The mission of the American Counseling Association is to enhance the quality of life in society by promoting the development of professional counselors, advancing the counseling profession and using the profession and practice of counseling to promote respect for human dignity and diversity. At ACA, we know we need to bring you information, resources and com- mentary on those issues and projects that directly impact you as a counseling professional. For example, the recently launched ACA-ACES Syllabus Clearing-house (online at counseling.org) contains an incredible wealth of information for those looking to improve their own syl-labi or those who simply want to know what texts and resources are being used in contemporary counselor education. Go take a look. I want to personally thank all of the counselor educators who contrib- uted their time and materials to building the syllabus library. Talk about collabora- tive and committed to moving the profes-sion forward! Many of you also are aware that last month, ACA was finally able (after work-ing on this effort for many years) to offer a superior professional liability insurance program to its master's-level student members as part of their membership! You read that right. Our master's-level students, as a benefit of their membership in ACA, will now be covered by profes-sional liability insurance. In addition, other ACA members will soon receive up to a 10 percent discount on their liability insurance. Why did we go to extraordinary lengths to provide insurance to master's-level students and yet another deep discount to our professional members? Because we understand the financial challenges our members are facing, especially during these tough economic times. We want you to value your ACA membership, and we want you to know how much we value all that you do. I hope I will see many of you next month in Charlotte. If not, I still thank you for being a member of ACA, and my hope is that you will continue to take ad-vantage of all the association has to offer! I also hope you will contact me with any comments, questions or suggestions that you might have. Please contact me via e-mail at ryep@counseling.org or by phone at 800.347.6647 ext. 231.Thanks and be well. uWill I see you in March? Letters 8 | Counseling T oday | February 2009Jumping through hoops to become a counselor The fog of confusion and disappoint- ment is beginning to clear. Even though I have a newly minted master's degree in psychological counseling, a 4.0 grade point average and a sterling recommenda-tion from my internship adviser, I am not easily going to find a position in coun-seling. I get it now. Without a Licensed Professional Counselor credential and postgraduate experience counseling, few are willing to take a look at me as a new hire. Of course, to get the license, I must have hours of experience counseling, and to get the experience, I need a license. Hmmm ... As a director of one program told me, \"My dear, you can't get a good counseling position right out of grad school unless you know someone.\" There are exceptions, of course. I may be able to work with sex offenders. Some agencies that hire mobile therapists will take a chance on a new grad. But if, like me, you really want to work with adults ... too bad. There are also a few posi-tions available if you don't mind working every evening. One agency offered me a position working until 11:30 each night, but that involved only psychoeducational counseling for large groups. By searching and networking, I was able to locate a position in an agency providing individual drug and alcohol counseling and groups. The big catch is that there are no LPCs in the agency, so I will not be able to count my hours of experience toward getting a license. Of course, I can always pay for supervision \u2014 hundreds of dollars per month while I also pay for the additional four graduate courses. That will be tough because this is a fee-for-service position with a 50 per-cent no-show rate. It goes without saying that none of these positions pays well. The hoops I must jump through to be- come a licensed counselor are small, many and raised high off the ground. I talked to several people who graduated from my class. Several tried to start their own coun-seling business without a license (that's not working out too well because most clients want to use insurance as payment). Several who had excellent potential be-came discouraged and went back to their previous line of work after months of job searching. One man accepted a part-time position when he wanted a full-time spot. I am aware of only one individual who got a position she wanted, and that was because she was fortunate enough to be hired from her internship position. Some may think that I am whining, but I suggest there must be a better system for employing new master's degree graduates. Could we not, as most professions do, is-sue a license in counseling after earning a master's degree, serving an internship and passing a test? I sure hope we are not los-ing some good potential counselors who are tired of the hoops and the ringmaster.Colleen Ciavola Newtown Square, Pa.cciavola@verizon.net Career stories provide inspiration to aspiring teacher/counselor I wanted to write to personally thank Rebecca Daniel-Burke for recent articles in the Counselor Career Stories column. T wo recent ones that stood out were September 2008's focus on Debra Engel and December 2008's focus on Marvin Bornschlegl. These two articles, as well as similar ones, are personally meaningful to me because I am in the midst of a career change. I began working in finance nine years ago and continue to do so to this day. Over the last five years, I have worked part time toward completing New Jersey's requirements to become a Licensed Professional Counselor. I had always envisioned being involved in the education system in some capacity, as well as being part of a group practice to utilize my counseling background, so in early 2008 I began to investigate New Jersey's program to become a teacher using the nontraditional route. The idea was to replace my finance position with an even-tual full-time teaching position and then perhaps utilize my counseling license (when completed) to do some part-time work \u2014 approximately 10 hours per week as part of a group practice or in some other capacity.Throughout the past year as I investi- gated teaching more, there were various times when I felt lost and confused and wondered what I was doing from a career perspective. Reading Counselor Career Stories has been very beneficial in the sense that it has shown me other people have gone through this as well and have turned out to be successful. The confu-sion I felt earlier in the year recently has been replaced by a renewed enthusiasm for completing my career goals, and I have the Counselor Career Stories col-umn to thank for that in large part. Keith Lewkowitz Bayonne, N.J. Raising questions about ADHD I have great respect for Stephanie Sarkis' tireless work as an advocate and mental health counselor for people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder di-agnoses. Yes, these symptoms are real, but her article (The Top Five, \"Helping adult clients with ADHD,\" December 2008) perpetuates a number of potentially dam-aging myths and misnomers. Molecular geneticists have not found any genes (or any endophenotype) for ADHD. Yes, ADHD does appear to run in families, as do politics and religion. Moreover, existing family studies suffer from methodological problems (e.g., non-blinded diagnoses, researcher bias). It's impossible to disentangle environmental factors from \"genetic factors.\" Further-more, twin studies base their premise on the equal environment assumption, which is suspect (read Jay Joseph's The Missing Gene: Psychiatry, Heredity and the Fruitless Search for Genes). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (IV-TR) differentiates between ADHD/non-ADHD popula-tions by frequency of symptoms. All criteria begin with the word \"often.\" Joseph writes, \"Given these criteria, what type of ADHD 'endophenotypes' could we expect to find? If both 'normal' and 'ADHD' children exhibit ADHD symp-toms, albeit in differing degrees, how can a gene or biological marker know the dif-ference between 'normal' and 'often' in a given culture?\"February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 9 10 | Counseling T oday | February 2009Researchers/clinicians cannot distin- guish ADHD brains from normal brains on an individual basis. Functional mag- netic resonance imaging (fMRI) identifies correlation, not cause and effect. Psychi- atric fMRI studies must pull hundreds, if not thousands, of data sets to produce statistically significant findings. Also, psychostimulants change brain activity, which may account for the differences between groups. Sarkis' implication of dopamine reflects the fallacy of the chemical imbalance the-ory. Dopamine metabolite levels poorly predict psychiatric diagnoses, including ADHD. Not to mention that neurotrans- mitters are in a constant state of flux. Chemicals measured 60 seconds apart will result in two separate sets of data. Indeed, controversy surrounds psycho- stimulants. The Food and Drug Admin-istration released a report in 2006 stating that all psychostimulants have harmful effects (e.g., psychosis, visual hallucina- tions, suicidal ideation, aggression and violence), some of which Sarkis correlates to ADHD alone. Although the FDA and Sarkis identify Strattera as a nonstimu- lant, the World Health Organization identifies it as a centrally acting sympath- omimetic (psychostimulant). Strattera is so stimulating that some neurologists treat narcolepsy with it. Finally, the Drug Effectiveness Review Project (Oregon Health & Science University, 2007) found that psychostimulants did not re- sult in improved academic achievement despite popular claims to the contrary. Sarkis references the Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyper-activity Disorder (CHADD) website. CHADD receives substantial funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Such organizations fixate on the medical/ disease model and offer nothing in terms of psychosocial explanations and inter- ventions for these symptoms. In short, eight years have passed and the DSM-IV-TR's point holds true: \"There are no laboratory tests, neurologi-cal assessments or attentional assessments that have been established as diagnostic in the clinical assessment of ADHD.\" The American Counseling Association remains a professional home for me because it acknowledges that behavioral problems are best understood within the context of culture and relationships rather than the belief that clients are flawed by some genetic anomaly or neuro-deformity, especially when neither are shown to exist. I implore ACA to confront falsehoods regarding the etiology of emotional problems, especially given the ubiquitous nature of misinformation. Tom Murray Director of Counseling and Disability ServicesUniversity of North Carolina School of the ArtsWinston-Salem, N.C. murrayt@uncsa.edu Counseling, ecotherapy make for a natural fit I appreciated Jeffrey Borchers and G. A. Bradshaw's interesting and timely article on ecotherapy and the greening of psy- chology (\"How green is my valley \u2014 and mind,\" December 2008). At Prescott College, where our mission statement is about social justice and ecological stew- ardship, we are proud to offer graduate training in counseling psychology with an optional specialization in ecopsychology and ecotherapy. We also offer a post- master's certificate in these cutting-edge disciplines. Reconnecting our clients with their natural environment seems to be funda-mental to the realization of full healing and health. This is surely an important dimension to the future development of counseling psychology. Barnaby B. Barratt Director of Graduate Training in Counseling and Somatic Psychology Prescott College Prescott, AZ Be aware of potential privacy concerns with Google Apps As an information technology profes- sional married to a counselor, I have to take issue with the recommendation of Google Apps as an alternative to an on-computer office suite (The Digital Psy- way, \"Software on a counselor's budget,\" December 2008).

The American Counseling Association regularly sets, reevaluates and updates its policy goals. Some items have been on the list for many years; others are relatively new. This month, instead of reviewing these items as a \"to do\" list for ACA, we are describing them from the perspective of their place on the to do list of the entity that actually has the final say on how (or whether) they get done: Congress. Fol-lowing are highlights of how \u2014 and why \u2014 Congress should help the counseling profession and its clients. Increase support for school counselors and counseling. The average student- to-counselor ratio in America's public schools is 476 to 1, far above the ACA-recommended maximum ratio of one school counselor to every 250 students. The 111th Congress is expected to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA, also known as the No Child Left Behind Act). Lawmakers should pass legislation to help increase the number of school counselors in our nation's schools, whether as part of this reauthorization or separately. Several ACA-supported bills were introduced in the 110th Congress to expand access to school counseling and school-based mental health. ACA will continue to work toward incorporation of these bills into ESEA reauthorization legislation. Congress can support school counseling services through several different programs. First and foremost among these is the El-ementary and Secondary School Counsel-ing Program, but support is also provided through the Safe Schools/Healthy Students program, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools programs, the Grants for the Integration of Schools and Mental Health program and loan forgiveness assistance for school counselors as part of the annual education appropriations bill. These critical federal programs help increase students' access to professional counseling services in the schools. T oday's students face increasing challenges and difficulties; they need all the support we can provide. Studies have consistently shown that counseling services are effective in improving student well-being and academic achievement. Establish Medicare coverage of Licensed Professional Counselors. Medicare covers more than 40 million Americans, including older Americans and individuals with disabilities. Despite widespread recognition of the counsel-ing profession under private sector health plans, Medicare's out-of-date benefit pack- age doesn't recognize LPCs. As a result, the program's millions of beneficiaries are denied access to more than 100,000 quali-fied mental health specialists. The 111th Congress will pass major Medicare legisla-tion in 2009, and this legislation should include coverage of LPCs as independent outpatient mental health service providers. Previous Congresses have come close to adopting coverage of counselors. In both 2003 and 2005, the Senate approved leg- islation that included Medicare coverage of LPCs, and the House of Representa- tives did likewise in 2007. This year, both chambers should include LPC coverage in the Medicare legislation it sends to President Barack Obama for signature into law. Covering LPCs and marriage and family therapists (MFTs) \u2014 as would be accomplished under the legislation being promoted jointly by ACA, the American Mental Health Counselors Association and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy \u2014 would be a very low-cost way of increasing beneficiaries' access to needed mental health services. Implement the law recognizing counselors as mental health care providers within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Strictly speaking, this item should be on the to do list of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, not Congress. As with Medicare, ACA is working hand-in-hand with both AMHCA and AAMFT in pushing for implementation of the 2006 law, which added both LPCs and MFTs to the list of health care professionals recognized within the Veterans Health Administration. We have been in frequent contact with staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs, but so far, the agency has not issued regulations that would let VA clinics start hiring counselors for clinical and supervisory positions. ACA, AMHCA and AAMFT have worked with interested members of Congress on this issue to move things forward. As a result, leaders of the House Veterans Affairs Committee sent a letter to the VA urging swift action on recognizing the two professions. ACA, AMHCA and AAMFT have also been in frequent, coordinated contact with Senate staff on this issue. There is an undeniable need for more mental health professionals to meet veterans' treatment needs. The VA should move forward quickly to allow counselors and MFTs to begin working as independent mental health professionals within the VHA. ACA will also be working to push recognition of LPCs as independent practitioners within the military's TRICARE health care system, which is separate from the VA. These are only highlights of the ways Congress can increase support for counsel-ors through federal public policy. ACA will also be working to ensure that counselors are included in policy work on health care system reform, reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act and renewal of federal mental health and addictive disor-der agencies and programs.

This month is certainly no dif- ferent. I am the first to admit that I often feel intimidated and inadequate when it comes to the topic of conducting research within our field, and I believe many of my peers feel the same way. In this month's column, Cirecie West-Olatunji speaks to the core of this issue, providing us with five tips for making research in counseling more inclusive, impactful and tangible. Cirecie West-Olatunji is an assistant pro- fessor in the University of Florida Depart-ment of Counselor Education. Her pri-mary focus is working with children. She has been the creator of several clinically based research projects and is also known for both her consultation and training efforts in Japan, Singapore and Brazil. In recognition of her outreach work in com-munities along the Gulf Coast, Florida and in southern Africa, Cirecie received the 2007 Community Service Award from the Association of Black Psychologists. She is also the immediate past president of the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development, a division of the Ameri- can Counseling Association. w Cirecie West-Olatunji As we consider major challenges for the counseling profession, it is necessary for counselors to reconceptualize their research identities. In particular, counselors need to foster a more participatory and creative re- search environment to solve problems that plague our society today. This will involve reconceptualizing and deconstructing cur- rent views of research to form more inclu-sionary research practices. T o accomplish this, there are five critical tasks in which counselors need to engage. 1. Demystify research. I have found that students come into our programs with attitudes such as, \"I don't like research; that is why I am in counseling\" or \"I am afraid of research.\" In my role as instructor, I use a quote from Paulo Freire to demystify research. Roughly translated, he said that before humans had a formal language, we were reading the world. I interpret this statement to mean that all individuals have the capacity to interpret their environ- ment, formulate hypotheses and solve their problems. In this process, individuals in- vestigate, discover and explore, even when they do not have the words to articulate their investigations in the organized jargon of the academic world. In fact, people naturally use research in order to function in their cultural and social contexts. In counseling, it has been prior educa- tional experiences that have disallowed and eroded students' confidence and their ability to see themselves as people who have the innate capacity as human beings to create new knowledge. Thus, first and foremost of the five tasks, counselor educators need to facilitate and give stu-dents permission to reclaim their research identities. 2. See research as a collaborative process. In the United States, tenure-accruing faculty are evaluated on their abil-ity to generate knowledge independently \u2014 even autonomously. However, in other cultural contexts, research collaboratives are required. In Japan, for example, for scholars to be viewed as serious researchers, they must partner with practitioners. In other words, researchers are not viewed as having the necessary level of professional knowledge to theorize and understand the nuances about real problems in society. It is the combination of the well-honed research skills of a faculty member part- nered with the wealth of experiences of practitioners that creates research that has worth, merit, credibility and validity in the real world. This idea of looking at research as a collaborative process can actually engage community stakeholders, undergraduate/master's/doctoral-level students and col- leagues in other disciplines. As such, it becomes a much more pragmatic way of investigating phenomena, mirroring the messy, integrated environment of the real world. 3. Utilize more evidence-based practices. The idea is to encourage prac- titioners to self-reflect in order to increase their level of accountability when assisting clients. Reflection can aid in theorizing about what is known, what is known yet misunderstood and what is not known. Reflective theorizing also allows for dis- semination and replication of effective practices within a macrosytemic context. By reflecting and theorizing, counselors are able to deconstruct and process why an intervention is working so they can better assist clients in understanding the growth process. 4. View research as a form of libera- tory practice. Emancipatory research is another way in which we can exemplify so- cial justice in counseling. Viewing research as a liberatory action begins with looking at the purpose of our research, asking our-selves about issues of systemic oppression and seeing ourselves as active agents of change within a social context. One example of this perspective is the collaborative work of the Association for Multicultural Counseling and Develop- ment and the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision in their out- reach endeavors to southern Africa in which they explore the relationship be-tween disasters and systemic oppression. The use of research to explore not only why individuals experience challenges to self-actualization but how the environ- ment impacts that ability is key. Moreover, it is important to ask ourselves, \"What are some effective interventions that are not only system-based but also culture- centered?\" Counselors need to think about ways in which research can serve as a tool to bet- ter understand social phenomena that are The Top Five - With Mark Reiser Reconceptualizing research in counselingCirecie West-OlatunjiFebruary Recovery\u00ae Certification Training Program Learn The Action Program for Helping Grievers Deal with Loss column editor for The T op Five and a doctoral student in the University of Wyoming Counselor Education Department. Contact him at reiser@uwyo.edu to comment on this column or to recommend other counseling professionals he could feature in upcoming issues. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orglinked to bias and oppression. Counselor educators need to think about ways in which we can step outside of our offices and use our skills to advance change and transformation within communities. The work of Gargi Roysircar-Sodowsky, Zarus Watson, Fred Bemak and Rita Chung is exemplary of this idea. The role of coun-selors in advancing liberatory science and emancipation is part and parcel of our social justice ideals. 5. Understand research as social location and positionality. I began this essay discussing the elitist nature of research whereby students position them-selves as outsiders. This essay ends with a discussion of how individuals from so-cially marginalized groups, such as women and people of color (to name a couple), are often pushed to the margins. The idea that research is a mediator for privilege begins long before gradu- ate education. Very recently, I received a grant from the National Science Founda-tion with two of my female colleagues to explore this concept of positionality for African American schoolgirls. For some segments of the population of learners, such positioning is evident in their early K-12 schooling experiences. So, a task for counselors is to first become aware of their own positioning and then reframe what it means to be within and without circles of research. Everyone can be a part of the matrix. Everyone can be, and is, a researcher. I believe that if we can accomplish these five key tasks for reconceptualizing research in counseling, counselors will be able to exponentially influence the mental health discipline, impact the larger research community and play a critical role in the transformation of society as a whole. u16 | Counseling T oday | February 2009 Bonnie Biondolillo called me one day to discuss some private practice issues. The question she had was about confidentiality and counseling in a small town. I heard a bit of her story and knew I wanted to learn more. She is another amazing person who changed her life midcourse. Read her story; you may recognize yourself in some of the details. Rebecca Daniel-Burke: Tell me about your current counseling position. Bonnie Biondolillo: I have had a private practice for about 10 years. I also work for a local community agency. In both settings, I do all kinds of counseling, including individual, couples, families and groups. At the community counseling agency, I do groups for parent effectiveness training and grief and loss groups for divorcing adults, as well as couples counseling. RDB: But before becoming a counselor you were a nurse. Is that correct? BB: Yes, I was an RN (registered nurse) and worked part time as a nurse until a few months ago. RDB: How did you come to be a nurse? BB: As a little girl, I knew intuitively that I wanted to be a nurse. I liked the idea of taking care of patients and learning about medicine and nursing. I worked in the intensive care unit, in the post-anesthesia care unit and in other areas of the hospital, eventually becoming a nurse manager and a coordinator of nursing systems. As part of my nursing career, I developed a pain management clinic that addressed the physical, emotional and spiritual sides of healing the patient. RDB: Are you still an RN?BB: Yes, I am an RN, a National Certified Counselor and a Licensed Professional Counselor in both New York and Pennsylvania. RDB: What made you move more toward counseling and away from nursing? BB: I felt I had done all I could do at the hospital. I had become increasingly interested in the holistic point of view and wanted to do something different. I looked at quite a few counseling programs and settled on Gannon University in Erie, Pa. RDB: Is there anything else you preferred about counseling versus nursing? BB: I didn't want to work all the shifts in a hospital. I wanted a private practice and/or agency counseling where I could be home on nights, holidays and weekends for the most part. RDB: How did you choose your master's program in counseling? BB: I made an appointment and went to interview the director of the program. His name is Robert Nelson. He became a mentor of mine. RDB: How did your agency work and your private practice evolve after your master's program? BB: I completed my practicum and internship at the same community counseling agency where I still work today. I wanted a private practice because I wanted to try new things. I wanted to be flexible and try on different modalities to see what fit me. I wanted to be in charge of my future. At the agency and in private practice, I am comfortable with family counseling, marital work, teenagers, adults and children over 5 years of age. I especially like working with women's issues. I have an office mate now at my private practice who is also an LPC. She and I are starting a group for perimenopausal and menopausal women. We will begin as an educational model/program. This is where my medical knowledge is very helpful. If they want to continue after the group, they can come into individual work with me or my office mate or anyone else they choose. RDB: So you work in a small town?BB: Yes, I work in a small city with a population base of 20,000 and live on a lake in a village in New York state. RDB: How is village or small town counseling different? BB: When I attended graduate school in Erie, there was a lot of cultural diversity. There is far less in a small town. Other than that, it is similar. RDB: How do you handle running into your clients in a small town? BB: I tell my clients when they enter counseling with me that I will not say hello to them in town unless they say hello to me. I don't want them to have to explain how they know me to the person with them. I also tell them that I will greet them if they say hello but will not engage in talk about our work together because that would become a boundary issue. They understand because it is stated clearly up front. This is very important in a small town. RDB: How did you determine what area of counseling you are passionate about? BB: Couples and marital counseling came natural to me, as I enjoy the dynamics of this kind of counseling. Another area I am passionate about is eating disorders. My medical background helps a lot with eating-disordered clients. I speak with them about healthy eating. I never call it a diet; they have spent their lives \"dieting.\" Sometimes I send them to a nutritionist or a dietitian because I am accustomed to working in The nurse who would be a counselorCounselor Career Stories - By Rebecca Daniel-Burke Bonnie BiondolilloFebruary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 17interdisciplinary teams in hospitals. I have a good knowledge of medications, and that helps a lot when I treat depression. I know how to read and understand the PDR (Physicians' Desk Reference). RDB: What else are you passionate about in our profession? BB: I like Carl Rogers and his person-centered therapy approach. Being empathic and holding a client in unconditional positive regard are important skills to have. I think it is through Carl Rogers that I became comfortable with silence. I don't fight silence in a session. I let the silence take a place in the room. I became comfortable with silence over time. RDB: What mistakes have you made along your career path? And more important, what lessons did you learn from those mistakes? BB: I probably stayed too long at one employer. The lesson is this: If things really aren't going the way you want them to, if you aren't getting what you need or want, it's time to move on and try something different. Another mistake, in the beginning I thought someone always had to be talking in the session. The lesson is that, as I said previously, silence is OK. RDB: Was there someone who saw something special in you early on? BB: My mother. She was always there if you needed something. She worked full time and still always had time for me. My father traveled so much for work that he was rarely home. It was as though my mother was a single parent, yet she cooked dinner every night and baked on the weekends and still had time when I had questions. I also had a special girlfriend. She became a nurse too, and when she lost her mother, my mother took her under her wing. RDB: Do you have a theoretical hero, a theorist who inspires you? BB: Aaron Beck inspires me with the cognitive side of counseling. I like his theory that how a person thinks largely determines how that person feels and behaves. I use cognitive behavioral therapy with many of my clients. Also, I use the Beck Depression Inventory. I like his ideas on reframing thoughts and his ideas on cognitive distortions. Regarding family therapy, I am fond of Murray Bowen's approach. I like his ideas on differentiation of self, family sculpting, triangles, projection and the emotional cutoff (someone who cuts off from his or her family with little to no contact). I like to use the genogram to explore the multigenerational transmission process in a family. RDB: How do you take care of yourself with all of your work at the agency and in private practice? BB: I lead a prayerful life. I process things such as therapy questions with a supervisor, my office mate and a peer group. I live on a lake, so we go out on the lake in our boat. I love the water. We go bike riding in our little village. Also, we love to travel, especially to Florida. I love the ocean and the white sands, which I find particularly soothing and comforting. RDB: Is there anything I haven't asked that you want readers to know about your career story? BB: I became a counselor at the age of 50. I have always felt like I wanted to improve myself, meet goals that I set for myself. I remember quite a few years ago, the vice president of nursing at my hospital kept asking me why was I doing this \u2014 getting a master's degree in counseling at my age. I told her I have always had a vision of myself accomplishing my goals. Without the support of my husband while I was completing my master's degree and working full time, it would have been much more challenging than it was. My life's work, whatever I am doing or have done in the past, has always been important to me. I have always wanted, and strived for, positive outcomes for my clients and for myself! w The American Counseling Association values the opportunity to honor the career paths of working counselors with Counselor Career Stories.

Answer: The 2009 American Counseling Association Con-ference & Exposition. Next month, counselors from across the nation and across the seas will gather in Charlotte to get their fill of the three F's \u2014 fellowship, fun and food for thought (meaning education and professional development). This year's event features more than 500 Education Sessions in areas ranging from child and adolescent counseling, to career development, to marriage and family counseling, plus the potential to earn as many as 20 continu- ing education credits (make that 38 if you attend two full days of the preconference Learning Institutes). Add to that the rare opportunity to meet world-renowned counseling professionals and to network with thousands of peers from various settings. There are also opportunities to receive consultations on job searches, ca- reer planning, ethics, licensure and private practice. And don't forget the ACA Expo! While many established counseling professionals eagerly anticipate the con-ference's kickoff, some students and new professionals might cringe at the thought of it, feeling too small for such a big event. If you fit into the latter category, read on. This column features the per- spectives of a conference newcomer, an \"old pro\" and ACA's director of confer- ence and meeting services. n Kristy Gerke is pursuing her master's degree in counseling at Oakland Uni- versity in Rochester, Mich. She will be attending her first ACA Conference. n Amy McLeod is an assistant professor at Argosy University's Atlanta campus and the 2008 recipient of the ACA Glen E. Hubele National Doctoral Student Award. She is also a four-time conference attendee (2005-2008).New Perspectives - With Donjanea L. Fletcher n Robin Hayes is the director of conference and meeting services for ACA. What does the ACA Conference offer students and new professionals? Robin Hayes: There will be even more activities for graduate students this year. The \"For Graduate Students and New Professionals Only\" series brings highly regarded professionals in counseling to speak on topics that graduate students and new professionals have identified as critical to their success. The series will be presented by some of the best-known names in the counseling professions, such as Gerald Corey, Jane Myers, Courtland Lee and Chris Moll. Also of particular interest to students and new professionals are the First-Timers Orientation and Mentoring Luncheon, the ACA Career Center, the Graduate Student Center and the Inter- national Student Panel and Reception. These events are well attended by stu- dents and new professionals. Amy McLeod: Attending the ACA Conference is a great way to build your professional counseling identity. You can connect with other professionals, learn more about the ACA divisions and in- crease your knowledge regarding topics of interest to you within the field of counsel- ing. The ACA Conference also provides an excellent forum for presenting research and sharing creative counseling approach- es with others. So students and new professionals can present at the ACA Conference and share knowledge? RH: Yes, but the opportunity to pres- ent in 2009 has passed. The deadline for proposal submissions was June 3, 2008. If students wish to present in 2010, they would have to go through the submission process. The proposal submission for the 2010 conference will open March 30, 2009, and close June 3. What is your most memorable experience at an ACA Conference? AM: The first ACA Conference I at- tended was in Atlanta in 2005. Dr. Irvin Yalom was the keynote speaker. I was really excited to hear such an influential person in the field speak. How cool to be face-to-face with such a legendary helper! As a first-time conference attendee, what motivated you to come to Charlotte? Kristy Gerke: I am counting down the days until Charlotte! With graduation looming ever closer, plus my practical work with clients as a graduate assistant in (my university's) adult career counsel-ing center, it seems even more important that I gain as much information and ex- pertise as I can. To me, the conference is a one-stop extravaganza for obtaining these goals. I love information, so the Education Ses-sions are the biggest draw. However, as I browsed the list of Education Sessions, I found myself circling so many of them. I quickly realized I would not be able to attend them all. The other key factor in my decision to attend is the ability to network. I am not simply talking about job networking. I look forward to meeting graduate students from across the globe and hearing their stories. I also hope to meet some of the professionals I have only read about in my textbooks. I just hope I am not rendered speechless during our introductions. Inevitably, the information I learn from the Education Sessions and by meeting other students and professionals will en- ergize me as I return to finish up the last of my course work and prepare for my future as a professional counselor.February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 19 Often, when students or new professionals attend a national conference such as this one for the first time, they feel confused about how to make it both beneficial and fun. What advice would you give to those in this situation? AM: One idea for making the confer- ence manageable and beneficial is to spend some time looking through the conference program guide and planning what sessions and activities you would like to attend. ACA hosts events specifi- cally designed for first-time conference attendees and events specifically designed for having fun! Going to the conference with a colleague also helps. What tips would you give for profes- sional networking? AM: The counseling profession is actu- ally a very small world. If you are inter- ested in making a professional connection with a particular person or organization, start by asking the counselors you already know if they can help you. You might be surprised to find out who already knows the person you want to meet! Joining specific divisions of ACA and attending their meetings at the ACA Conference is another great strategy for networking. Finally, many students or new professionals may not have their own business cards. You can order free busi- ness cards from several websites. Keep multiple business cards with you at the conference so you can easily exchange contact information with the people you meet. RH: One piece of advice I would give is to sign up for the ACA First-Timers Orientation and Mentoring Luncheon. The cost is an extra $40, but it's worth the money. You will have an opportunity to meet and mingle with leaders and hear presentations on how to maximize learn- ing and networking experiences while in Charlotte. Are there opportunities to save money while attending the conference? RH: For students interested in receiv- ing a registration discount, we have the Graduate Student Volunteer Program. In exchange for their time and commitment, ACA will waive one-half of the registra- tion fee. The deadline to apply is at the end of January each year. Please keep this in mind for the 2010 conference in Pittsburgh. ACA also offers new profes-sional and student conference rates that are cheaper than the rate for regular ACA members. All this information and more about the conference is available on the ACA website at counseling.org/conference. KG: I have been able to keep the costs down by registering to volunteer at the conference. I am also using hotel \"frequent stay\" points to cover my lodg-ing, so that is not costing me anything. Granted, it is not one of the conference hotels, but it is a short walk/trolley ride away from all the activities. I am hoping to find a cheap flight to Charlotte but am also willing to fly into another airport and share a ride into Charlotte with an- other attendee. It takes effort to find and apply for these savings, but it is worth it. AM: Share a hotel room with two to three colleagues. Also, some universities offer funding for student travel support- ing the mission of student organizations such as Chi Sigma Iota. Finally, plan ahead! ACA offers discounted early registration rates, and flights are usually cheaper when purchased in advance. Any last words from a newcomer's perspective for those thinking about attending the conference? KG: I understand that some new pro- fessionals and students might be on the fence about attending the conference. However, I recently attended the Michi-gan Counseling Association conference and found it to be an invaluable and exciting experience. I was able to take back relevant information and witness the passion of my future colleagues. This kind of experience cannot be replicated anywhere else. u Donjanea L.

Walsh and Norman C. Dasenbrook In our December column, we asked readers to tell us which versions of billing software and electronic billing work well for them. Our first re-sponse came from American Counseling Association member and Licensed Profes-sional Counselor Philip Koestler: \"I have used a combination of Office Therapy and QuicDoc made by Docu-T rac Inc. (quicdoc.com/) for almost two years now. My setting is a small outpa- tient mental health clinic. I did a consid- erable amount of research before purchas-ing them. I found that Office Therapy is full-featured office management software, and QuicDoc is full-featured case man- agement software. \"Office Therapy does an excellent job of tracking insurance companies, pay- ments and prior authorizations, filing claims and providing numerous reports. It does well with printing client bills and HCFA 1500 forms, allowing flexibility for NPI (National Provider Identifier) and other needed modifications. It tracks referral sources, types of referrals, etc. Scheduling is included. Electronic bill-ing and payment by credit card are also available. \"Before I purchased the software, I carefully weighed the benefits versus cost. I purchased the software as a bundle and paid under $1,000. DocuT rac requires a yearly maintenance fee, but I will tell you that it is nominal (a couple hundred dol-lars) for what you get. Updates come on a fairly regular basis. I have been extremely impressed by the support that I received from DocuT rac. The technicians are knowledgeable and friendly. \"In conclusion, I would recommend anyone looking to purchase office and case management software to check DocuT rac out. I have barely touched on the functionality of the software. I tried their demo before purchasing the software. DocuT rac also has similar software for significantly larger organizations. While this software does not make coffee, it does just about everything else.\" We also received a response about direct online billing. A counselor's office man-ager offered information on her efforts to direct bill the nation's largest managed care company, United Behavioral Health (ubhonline.com), with 44 million people covered. Following United Behavioral Health's online registration information, she set up an initial account for the office and received a user ID and password. She found the process very easy to complete and user friendly. Counselors must be on United Behavioral Health, United Healthcare or OptumHealth provider panels to use this service. Information for joining United Behavioral Health or any other managed care network is available on ACA's website. The newly researched managed care, insurance and employee assistance program list has been updated and is available at counseling.org/Counselors/TP/ PrivatePracticePointersMembers/CT2.aspx. w Q: I would like to start taking credit/ debit cards at my practice. I have re- searched merchant accounts (an ac-count that allows for the processing of credit cards) and found one that seems to charge reasonable fees. How do I handle this payment option with my clients? I hear some counselors are having their clients sign a release so that unpaid balances (after insurance pays) are then charged to the client's credit card, or a credit card is kept on file and billed as needed. Is this ethical and OK? A: We have written about the option of credit card payments before in this column. By and large, we recommend it. But you must remember that if you have a contract with any managed care company, you cannot \"balance bill\" \u2014 that is, col-lect money other than the copay and the payment the insurance company offers. Younger clients rarely use checks, and it seems most clients don't want to pay in cash. Offering many payment options provides your clients with flexibility. Moreover, in tough economic times, credit card payments make sense for some clients. In our own practices, we have seen increased use of credit cards for copays. You raise a good question about billing a client's credit card, however. While it is essential to include fees and payment information in your informed consent document, we think more consent may be required to charge a client's credit card for anything beyond a copay at the time of service. We consulted our friend Joshua Rosen- thal, president of TherapyMatch LLC, which offers merchant account services through its website (therapymatch.com). He recommended a separate form to spell out how you may charge the client's cred-it card \u2014 for example, for the amount of copay only, for all sessions for a designat- ed period of time with a \"not to exceed amount\" per session or for a weekly/ monthly charge for unpaid balances resulting from insurance deductibles or denials. Reaching agreement on all fees and payment options before therapy begins makes for satisfied clients and happy counselors. We are currently researching merchant accounts and will be providing more information in our column, so stay tuned. w Counselor alert! Are we dealing with a counseling 'urban myth'?

Stop by and say hi! u22 | Counseling T oday | February 2009 Essential Topics for the Helping Professional By Sheri Bauman, 2008, Allyn & Bacon, 336 pages, $51.33, ISBN 0-205-41401-X Essential Topics for the Helping Professional is an extraordinary addition to the genre of texts available to graduate students, new professionals and counselor educators as they strive to become truly helpful professionals. The motivation behind Sheri Bauman's book is to bridge the chasm between being a great student and becoming a great therapist. Many counselors experience profound feelings of panic and incompetence when they enter their first professional jobs. Suddenly, even A-plus students realize the insufficiency of theoretical orientation and the holes in their case conceptualizations and recognize that while some theories are more elegant than others, none adequately prepares them for actual full-time work in therapy! Bauman acknowledges this fear and, without espousing any particular theoretical orientation, provides informative ideas and suggestions, as well as thought- provoking questions, to assuage these uncertain feelings. Particularly impressive is how the author illuminates developmental issues and patterns in ways that allow student counselors to glimpse how these issues affect and are affected by life stages; this is a feature missing in most texts. In covering eight essential topics, Bauman includes sections on counselor issues and ethical concerns and also provides exercises. Arguably, these sections create the most teachable moments. The \"counselor issues\" section offers information on potential concerns that only experience can reveal. Used in conjunction with this section, the exercises pose several questions that can turn students and new counselors inward for introspection and self-directed learning. The resulting discussions can promote intrapersonal growth, expand theoretical understanding and encourage a deeper, richer awareness of what makes therapy effective. Bauman also covers unanticipated topics such as sexual minority populations among the elderly, types of grief and mourning rituals, and trauma in the military. Essential Topics for the Helping Professional is a wonderful text for students or educators. It goes well beyond diagnosis and theory and could serve as a most valuable addition in practicum and group counseling courses. The book might also remind counselors-in-training and new therapists why they entered this profession in the first place: to be helpful in meaningful, effective ways.Reviewed by Char Skovlund, counselor in private practice, Sioux Falls, S.D. Coming Out, Coming In: Nurturing the Well-Being and Inclusion of Gay Youth in Mainstream Society By Linda Goldman, Routledge, 2007, 368 pages, $29.95 (paperback), ISBN 978-0-415-95824-0 Coming Out, Coming In can be considered a starter kit for building an inclusive environment. Anyone interested in promoting a safe and supportive setting for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people will benefit from reading this book. Grounded in personal stories, the book dispels myths about homosexuality, explores the coming out process, examines obstacles that emerge and addresses the role of environment. Author Linda Goldman also challenges readers to update and redefine traditional notions of family and community. Goldman dedicates sections of the book to parents of LGBT children, as well as to teachers and counselors, and sensitively discusses how the coming out process can affect relationships. The information will be useful, however, to anyone wanting to promote a more accepting, affirming environment for LGBT populations. Parents are encouraged to seek support groups such as PFLAG (Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) to help them learn more about the issues that affect their children and how to create loving, supportive homes. Teachers are urged to cultivate a safe classroom oasis that offers growth and learning to all students. Professional training on LGBT issues for educators and staff can enhance the development of supportive services and a more inclusive curriculum. For counselors, the text offers two lessons. First, counselors must understand that homophobia is a societal dilemma. With this in mind, counseling should include helping LGBT youth to process their feelings about gender identity and sexual orientation. Second, counselors must attempt to create secure homes, schools and communities for all students. This entails working closely with other members of the community. Coming In, Coming Out also underscores the importance of schools creating a safe space for LGBT individuals so they can become healthy, valued people in society. Moreover, Goldman argues that society as a whole has a responsibility to LGBT youth and to ensuring a beneficial, shared existence for all. Our actions and behaviors affect one another and, therefore, each of us has an obligation to be sensitive to the Resource Reviews - With Ruth HarperFebruary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 23 needs of others. The book concludes by offering relevant and practical resources on LGBT issues and LGBT support organizations for youth and adults. Those looking for effective teaching aids for educational programs with teachers, parents, school administrators or counselors-in-training have a great resource in Coming Out, Coming In.

Lindsey, who worked for several years as a mental health counselor in a cardiac rehabilitation program. He learned that a stress-filled life is a factor in the development of heart disease. Furthermore, he says, \"It seems that some clients truly received greater mental clarity and awareness as they practiced the heart-healthy components of regular exercise, eating a wholesome diet and engaging in relaxation and reflective activities.\" Others incorporate mind-body wellness techniques into their counseling practices after first using the techniques themselves and witnessing personal growth. \"Mindfulness practice has been the focal point in my own evolution,\" says counselor William F . Mies. \"If the mind-body is not treated, we have missed the point. Each only exists in relationship to the other.\" Geri Miller explains that mind-body wellness has always been a part of her clinical work \u2014 particularly the spiritual component \u2014 from the time she entered the helping professions in her 20s. \"Mindfulness has really helped me personally and professionally,\" she says, \"and it has really helped my clients.\" Counseling Today asked Lindsey, Mies and Miller, as well as four other American Counseling Association members, to de-scribe how they use mind-body wellness techniques and concepts in counseling. Describe what mind-body wellness encompasses. Abby Seixas: It is based on the recognition that the mind affects the body and vice versa, and that both mind and body are interrelated parts of a whole. It involves using techniques to enhance the mind's influence on the body to improve how people feel \u2014 mentally, emotionally and physically. Mind-body wellness often implies and includes the spiritual dimension as well. So, it recognizes that all of these human dimensions \u2014 body, feelings, mind and spirit \u2014 are interrelated. Charles V. Lindsey: I think it is easy to fall into the trap of believing that mind- body wellness is a destination point \u2014 a place where one arrives and then doesn't have to work or struggle with as much intensity. In simple terms, I share with my clients that mind-body wellness is a journey, and something that has to continuously be practiced. I explain that mind-body wellness truly involves being a steward of one's own mind and body. It means being more aware of the interrelationship between what we think and what we feel and of how our care, or lack of care, for our bodies affects the way we think and how we behave. Ultimately, mind-body wellness involves a deeper awareness of self that enhances possibilities of operating in daily life with a greater sense of intentionality and purpose. William F. Mies: Mind-body wellness is the healthy person functioning in a healthy way because he or she is in touch with the most fundamental aspects of human nature. Ultimately, this involves love, compassion, wisdom, joy and equanimity. The healthy body is an expression of the flowering of the mind and heart. This state can become evident through mindfulness practice. Jeanmarie Petrino: Mind-body wellness integrates Western and Eastern psychological, medical and alternative therapies. Its goal is to facilitate mental, emotional, spiritual and physical healing in clients presenting a wide variety of issues and conditions.February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 25 Explain how your counseling practice touches on mind-body wellness. Stuart Bonnington: How we live in relation to our body is of prime importance. I think it is our primary relationship. I focus a lot on emotional regulation. Body states often overwhelm cognitive processes. I help people recognize subtle shifts in their bodies that cue them into what is going on emotionally. I have taught a number of people energy psychology techniques such as emotional freedom techniques. This is a meridian-based approach that really helps people deal with blocked energy. I find that strong negative emotions are almost always accompanied by energy blocks. Keeping the energy flowing in the body is a large part of what wellness is all about. Abby Seixas: In my practice, that translates into not just using talk therapy. Although I do use talk therapy, I also draw from a variety of other techniques and modalities, including guided imagery, relaxation techniques, inner dialogue and EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing), which is an integrated method of psychotherapy used originally for healing trauma. I also help clients work with their feelings through body awareness, tuning into physical symptoms or sensations as a way of helping them gain access to and understanding of their emotions. Jeanmarie Petrino: In my individual practice at the Mind Body Health Center, I integrate cognitive behavioral therapy with Reiki energy therapy. Reiki energy therapy is one of the many alternative treatments known as \"energy medicine.\" Acupuncture, tai chi, qigong and yoga are some other forms of energy medicine. Energy therapies influence the body's flow of life energy, or chi, to promote health and well-being. A Reiki treatment works with the body's chi to induce a state of deep relaxation. In this state, a client can be guided by a professional counselor to release emotional, physical and/or spiritual pain that blocks chi and creates energy imbalance. How is mind-body wellness related to stress management? Katlin Hecox: I developed a paradigm that I call \"Restoration,\" and it is based on the understanding that we are energy. Negative thoughts are a form of energy that depletes us. Sometimes these thoughts are held in the body. Anyone who does massage for a length of time will experience a client having body memory and, often, the massage provides a release. Our field is now very aware that reactions to high-stress situations may be \"freezing,\" where the trauma experienced gets lodged in the mind-body. When the experience and the thoughts it created are shifted, wellness becomes stronger. Positive thoughts can result in the ability to get through stressors with grace and health. Stuart Bonnington: I expose students, clients and mental health professionals to qigong. Qigong is a discipline that has arisen out of the early folk wisdom of China. Many of the techniques and practices are thousands of years old. It comes out of the Daoist tradition. There is a concept in that tradition that talks about \"right action\" or \"right energy.\" Basically, what is the correct amount of energy to use when doing anything, whether it is just sitting quietly or doing something physically or mentally taxing? What is the right amount of energy to use? Not too much or too little; what is the right amount? If I am overly stressed, I most likely have not been using my energy in the right amount in the right way. William F. Mies: Stress is a manifestation of the mind and body being out of sync. When the mind, heart and body are not aligned, friction or stress arises. Mind-body wellness stands in a reciprocal relationship with stress management. As the mind-heart-body becomes more in alignment, stress reduces; as stress reduces, the mind-heart-body finds even deeper wellsprings of happiness and freedom within. How can counselors maintain their own mind-body wellness? Katlin Hecox: This is a wonderful question and a critical one! If you agree with the energy paradigm, then you understand the importance of the level of positive energy a therapist brings to a session. Therapists need to be aware of their own energy. Are you energized or depleted by your client? If you are being depleted, you need to act to restore yourself. This may mean doing things out of the session that increase your energy. T o read additional perspectives on mind-body wellness from these ACA members, access the unabridged version of this article at the CT Online section of the ACA website (counseling.org).26 | Counseling T oday | February 2009It may mean learning a practice such as meditation, prayer, tai chi or Donna Eden's energy tune-up. Stuart Bonnington: There ought to be a question on counselor license renewal forms: \"Explain in detail what you do to maintain your own well-being.\" To be mindful of others, we have to be mindful of ourselves. I believe that counselors are wise to maintain some type of wellness practice that includes a focus on the body and spirit. I firmly believe that my energy field affects the energy fields of others. When I am mindful of keeping a good energy flow in my body and its surrounding energy field, others can benefit from that. Carl Rogers taught us about being attuned to our clients. For me, that had to do with the flow of energy within and among people. We know that infant/caregiver brainwaves can synchronize when there is secure attachment. That is attuned energy. All thought/action is energy. Abby Seixas: I think that's a really important question because as counselors, we are attending to others' needs a lot, and we really need to be able to recharge and renew ourselves. One of the fundamental practices in my book is the practice of taking \"time-in,\" which is stepping away from attending to other people, cutting down on distractions, stepping away from the to do list and centering ourselves. The effect of this practice is not just renewal; taking time- in is also one of the primary ways to contact the deeper currents within us, what I call the \"deep river within,\" where we can tap into our inner resources of patience, compassion, wisdom and other qualities we need to live our lives well, with intention and meaning. How can counselors advise their clients to maintain mind-body wellness? Katlin Hecox: There are many great ways to maintain mind-body wellness. What makes sense to one individual will be different from another client. The first thing is to make sure that clients understand that their thoughts and actions will impact their state of wellness. The second step would be to have clients become aware of their energy level. If the task at hand depletes them, they need to do something that will at least restore them to a healthy level. to learn meditation, or I will give them a jump-start on how to meditate, or I will encourage them to go to a class or a retreat for meditation. Geri Miller: The same kind of thing that I would say to counselors, I say to clients. Find out what fits that person. Me, I'm into hula hooping; others might be into something else. This is where the therapeutic relationship and having trust with each other comes in. We can brainstorm together. Why not just try something once? It may take some trial and error for us to find something that really gives us hope about living, about ourselves. What is it that keeps your spirit alive? I encourage clients to think of themselves as vessels; what are they putting into themselves? The folks that I counsel don't have much money, time and energy, so we really look at what they can do that has the least cost and still gives them hope and encouragement. Jeanmarie Petrino: Counselors can educate clients regarding mind-body wellness, encourage them to explore various modalities and teach them how to incorporate wellness into their lives. Counselors can suggest exercise, adequate sleep, healthy diet and any of the many alternative therapies, including but not limited to Reiki, tai chi, qigong, yoga, meditation, prayer, self-hypnosis, self- relaxation techniques and biofeedback. What are some current trends in the mind-body wellness field? Abby Seixas: One thing I've noticed is the proliferation of mindfulness techniques and practices. Mindfulness was sort of an unheard of term 10 years ago, and now it has come into the mainstream. For most of us, our daily lives are so filled with distraction and interruption that there's a great need for mindfulness, for opportunities to focus our attention and come into the present moment. The other thing affecting the field is the ability to study the brain. Richard Davidson at the University of Wisconsin has studied people's brains while meditating. His research is showing that systematic training of the mind can significantly shift people's level of happiness. The understanding of the brain's neuroplasticity, or ability to adapt and change, and other subjects of current and future neuroscientific research are Stuart Bonnington: There is a lot of good, reliable information out there on mindfulness approaches. I strongly suggest counselors learn about these approaches. I have been talking with an Iraq war veteran who has complications due to multiple concussions. His emotional states have been all over the place. His limbic system has been on overdrive. I introduced him to some very basic qigong and gave him a book on meridian-based approaches that he could use on himself. The results from his self-reports have been very positive. Wellness to me comes down to what are you doing to take care of and nurture yourself in \"bodymind\" and spirit? Abby Seixas: Obviously, some of the same things that we might do for ourselves. It really depends on the client and their individual style, needs and life situation. For some clients, I do a relaxation tape using my voice. For others, I recommend keeping a journal. For others, what's most important might be doing something fun, giving themselves a break. It really depends on the client. I often encourage people February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 27going to be very important factors in mind-body wellness trends. Charles V. Lindsey: A number of strategies have gained additional ground or have emerged within the past 10 years. Among these are mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy. The terms \"mindfulness\" and \"wellness\" are also receiving much greater use and attention in the helping professions as evidenced by the amount of recent literature and research utilizing these terms. While the use of a variety of mind-body wellness interventions in the counseling field is gaining traction, there continues to be a debate surrounding the empirical support for such interventions, how they might most appropriately blend with other approaches and whether third-party payers should reimburse for mind-body-based counseling approaches. Jeanmarie Petrino: A recent trend in the mind-body wellness field that I am pursuing is incorporating Reiki energy therapy with grief and loss counseling. How is mind-body wellness related to spirituality? Stuart Bonnington: Spirituality is an integral aspect of wellness. Spirituality is our relationship to that which permeates all of us and is greater than the whole. As we all know, spirituality does not have to be limited to religion. Spirituality is about transcending our alienation, our sense of separateness. Spirituality is realizing that human systems are not closed systems. Energy/life force permeates all creation, however you might want to conceptualize that. Harm comes when we close our systems, when our flow of energy becomes blocked. Abby Seixas: Mind-body wellness is a potential doorway to spirituality. I don't think it is a given that progressive relaxation or other mind-body techniques will open the door to the spiritual realm. Part of what these techniques do is to slow people down so that they become aware of more subtle energies and they listen to themselves. That brings them naturally to a place of depth within themselves, where they may connect with something larger than themselves. William F. Mies: Spirituality is the heart of mind-body medicine.

Rather, we now accept that the physical and external worlds are a reflection of our grounding in the world of the spirit. I define spirituality as our innate capacity of love, compassion, wisdom, joy and equanimity, together with the activities that promote this evolution. Jeanmarie Petrino: Mind-body wellness naturally enhances spirituality by encouraging daily practice of meditation, prayer and/or breathwork. How is mind-body wellness related to creativity? Katlin Hecox: When we are mindful, when we are full of our own energy flowing, when we are appreciating the connection and beauty of that connection to all, we express our full selves. When this happens, creativity is its ultimate expression. Stuart Bonnington: The term \"flow\" has been around for decades. When we feel truly creative, it feels effortless; the energy is flowing. I have had the good fortune of knowing many highly creative musicians and songwriters in my life. I have heard many of them say that when that burst of creativity comes along, it feels like it is in the air. They merely grab hold of it and let it flow through them. Charles V. Lindsey: I help clients to identify and explore their \"centers,\" or the place within them that is \"grounded.\" There are a number of mind-body approaches that might be utilized in helping to reach this inner place \u2014 yoga, relaxation training, meditation and tai chi, to name but a few. It was T.S. Eliot who said that \"at the still point of the turning world ... there the dance is.\" I have seen a number of clients respond in highly creative and innovative ways as they infuse mind-body interventions into their lives, and I have felt the personal creative benefits of working toward this \"dance\" in my own life. Jeanmarie Petrino: Mind-body wellness can release emotional, mental and spiritual blocks to creativity, thus allowing creativity to flow freely. Is mind-body wellness a necessary thing for people? Stuart Bonnington: The leading causes of death are related to behavior, of not \"Counseling for Wellness is a book of particular value to counselors espousing a developmental, preventative approach to maximizing human potential, and seeking to empower clients to make deliberate, conscious choices that embrace a healthy lifestyle reflected in their work, love, and friendships.

I teach a course called Health Psychology in which my students get a very healthy dose of information on wellness. One of the assignments I give them is to study the chronic diseases that run in their families. In many cases, it is the stuff that will shorten their lives. Many don't have to look much further than their parents. I have seen some pretty dramatic positive changes in personal wellness activities as a result of this project. Geri Miller: I don't know that mind- body wellness is necessary, but it is helpful for living because there is a thoughtful focus. It is helpful for people to have a mindfulness practice, such as yoga or breathwork \u2014 anything that slows them down. This practice can make them aware that their mind and body are connected so they then can live a more integrative life that expresses what they value. That flow, that wordless dialogue, is just a part of our life. So spirituality, then, is seamless with our life. It is fused. Then we can express our spirit. Mindfulness makes you more of who you are. Jeanmarie Petrino: Mind-body wellness is extremely necessary for everyone in the 21st century. Our fast-paced lives are not conducive to wellness. Mind-body wellness forces people to slow down and center themselves in a hectic world and makes self-care a priority in all our lives. Is the thought of seeking help for mind-body wellness less threatening to people than the thought of seeking counseling? Abby Seixas: When the focus is not on \"what's wrong with\" but rather on wellness, perhaps that's less threatening. But I also think that counseling is becoming more accepted in our culture. Geri Miller: It might be. When I go over to the wellness center, for example, I don't see people walking in there with shame or fear. Mind-body wellness might be an avenue for people to do counseling in a more acceptable way. Charles V. Lindsey: I believe that it is. As an example, I work at a community mental health clinic and also consult at a \"wellness\" center that is affiliated with a gym in my community. There are a couple of clients I work with through the wellness center who have told me directly that they didn't want to be associated with a mental health clinic, but they were completely open to consulting a counselor affiliated with a wellness center. Do you focus on mind-body wellness with all your clients as a regular part of counseling? Are there certain clients who need help with this more than others? Abby Seixas: Yes, there are certain clients who need help with it more than others. But it really depends on the needs of the client. The client takes the lead, and I will often look for openings to suggest where these practices might be helpful for them. Not everyone is receptive. But I wouldn't say that I always focus on it. What's important is not my agenda; it's the client's agenda. Geri Miller: One of the areas in which I've worked a fair amount is addictions and habitual patterns of behavior. I see mindfulness as very helpful in terms of people breaking out of habitual patterns. If, for example, I have someone who is addicted to cigarettes, I have them slow down their mind and get aware of what's going on with them. What usually happens with habits is that we just get caught in them. It's like a movie going at fast speed; we need to slow it down frame by frame. That's where wellness can be a side benefit. If someone can slow down enough to find out what triggers them to crave a cigarette, then they can make a choice not to act on the craving. If we can go frame by frame and make different choices, healthier choices, it really is a tool. I'm inviting someone to be as alive as they can be in the present moment, and then they can carry that into their lives to make some choices. Charles V. Lindsey: In one way or another, I do emphasize mind-body wellness with all of my clients. Sometimes it's more overt than at other times. It really depends on the client and the relationship we are developing. As an example, there are some clients who really gravitate toward the idea of mindfulness activities and examining the relationship between their own mind and body. With other clients, I might take a less direct approach but still utilize techniques such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation during our sessions. I have found mind-body wellness approaches particularly helpful in working with ADHD, anger, anxiety disorders, adjustment disorders, stress and burnout, pain and other medical conditions, and crisis situations. What made you decide to emphasize mind-body wellness as part of your counseling practice? Stuart Bonnington: It has been an evolution for me. I almost did not become a counselor. I had a severe chronic stuttering problem all of my early life until well into my master's program. I almost quit because of my dysfluency. 30 | Counseling T oday | February 2009 ACA BOOKSTORE March 20, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm March 21, 10:30 am - 6:00 pmMarch 22, 10:30 am - 6:00 pm The ACA Bookstore will be open during all exposition hours.

I learned to not tense up \u2014 to basically not block my energy flow. I learned to relax. I have since learned that our natural state according to the ancient Daoist is one of relaxed alertness. That is what I continue to aim for and return to when I start blocking my own energy and getting stuck in my negative anxious head. I, like most of us, teach what has profoundly worked for me. Abby Seixas: Definitely my own ex- perience with the benefits of meditation, the benefits of yoga and the benefits of journaling. The other thing is my train- ing in psychosynthesis, which is a very holistic understanding of the psyche and approach to therapy. So that's a base and an orientation that I work from, even though I've added lots of other things to my toolbox. Charles V. Lindsey: During my own life journey, I have had the good fortune of being exposed to various mind-body wellness approaches. For me, these approaches have always fit incredibly well with the way I conceptualize the counseling process. My primary mission as a counselor is to assist people in living more productive, fuller, more aware and healthier lives. Simply put, I see mind- body approaches as having the potential to serve as powerful nutrients in the process of change. Jeanmarie Petrino: While I was in graduate school, I started practicing yoga for stress relief and relief from a chronic illness. My yoga teacher was a Reiki master who introduced me to Reiki, meditation and other Eastern modalities. This piqued my interest in integrative medicine. As I saw the benefits of mind- body wellness in my own life, I realized that I wanted my counseling practice to also educate clients in mind-body wellness. u \"As an instructor, I am delighted to see a text that is adaptable to beginning and advanced career counseling contexts, that addresses contemporary work issues and challenges, and that attends to the concerns and strengths of diverse clients.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org32 | Counseling T oday | February 2009 A reality too horrible to consider T orture survivors are increasingly making their way to the United States, but their presence is largely overlooked, even by those who can help them restore their lives By Jonathan Rollins Kathi Anderson has grown accus- tomed to the often-involuntary reaction that many people have upon hearing that she works with survi-vors of torture. \"The word torture sticks in people's minds more so than survivor,\" says Anderson, a National Certified Counselor and member of the American Counseling Association. \"They step back from me like it's a disease, so can you imagine what it must be like for a survi-vor to reveal that to someone?\" Even in a post-9/11 world, the promi- nence of politically motivated torture is too awful or seems too far removed for most Americans to consider, and the thought that more than a handful of torture survivors might be living in the United States is to most, well, a \"foreign\" concept. But according to government estimates, the number of torture survivors residing in this country approaches half a million. \"This continues to be a virtually invis- ible population \u2014 very, very marginal- ized,\" says Anderson, who, along with Rev. William Radatz and Rev. George Falk, founded Survivors of Torture Inter-national (notorture.org) in San Diego in 1997. She serves as executive director of the nonprofit organization, which pro-vides a holistic program of psychological, medical, dental, legal and social services. \"What I have learned is that with thera- peutic interventions, survivors can and do heal, which minimizes the possibility of the trauma being transmitted to subse- quent generations,\" says Anderson, who has a bachelor's degree in international relations and a master's in counseling. \"Many counselors to this day don't con-sider the possibility that the clients they are serving may be torture survivors and, as a result, aren't as effective as they could be. Torturers oftentimes tell their victims that no one will care or that no one will believe them when they are released. We, as counselors, have an opportunity to both counteract the torturers and assist the survivors who are in need of our services.\" Coming to America Worldwide, individuals are tortured because of their ethnicity, political or reli- gious affiliations, sexual orientation, gen-der or involvement in causes opposed by ruling powers. Many survivors of torture are exiled from their home countries and separated from their families. For some, escape is the only option, even if they possess only the vaguest notion of where or what they might be escaping to. Anderson recounts the story of an Afghan woman who was a teacher. When the Taliban took power, she was no longer permitted to work because of her gender. She lost not only part of her identity but, being unmarried, her means of support-ing herself. Several of her neighbors asked her to continue teaching their daughters in secret in her home because the Taliban had also outlawed the education of girls. The Taliban eventually found out what was happening and raided the woman's home. She was incarcerated, tortured and released back into the community to serve as a visible example of what would happen to those who disobeyed the Tali-ban's orders. To show their gratitude for the woman and because they didn't want to see her life further put at risk, her neighbors col-lected money, gave it to her and encour-aged her to escape. She took a circuitous route from Afghanistan to San Diego (pre-9/11), finally crossing the porous border into the United States. Upon see-ing a taxi driver who had emigrated from Afghanistan, she presented him with the address she had been given \u2014 an address that happened to be for a city on the East Coast, on the other side of the country. Fortunately, the taxi driver called his sister and told her the woman needed a February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 33 \u00da\u0000$IGITAL\u00006ISIONING \u0000)NC WWW\u000e$IGITAL6ISIONING\u000eCOM 0ERSONALITY\u0000AND\u00002ELATIONSHIP\u0000!SSESSMENT !S\u0000EASY\u0000AS\u0000FLO ATING\u0000ON\u0000AIR\u000e WWW\u000eI\"E-IS\u000eCOM place to stay. The sister took the stranger into her home without question and al- lowed her to stay until she was granted asylum. Today, the woman is once again teaching, helping Afghan children who are growing up in the United States to learn the customs and native tongue of their mother country. Kerstin Palmer, an LPC, tells similar stories about the asylum seekers who come to Denver's Rocky Mountain Survivors Center (rmscdenver.org), where she serves as director of therapeutic counseling. She talks about a young Ethiopian woman who was tortured before a group of people raised money and bought her a plane tick- et to South America. For the next three months, she rode in the back of a pickup truck, slowly making her way north. After being smuggled into Mexico, she finally crossed the river into the United States, where she was promptly picked up by the Border Patrol. Housed in a detention facility for several months, she had little idea of what might happen to her next because she couldn't speak English and most of her fellow detainees spoke only Spanish. She was released only after an attorney engaged in asylum work volun-teered to help her. She eventually moved to Colorado and obtained assistance from the Rocky Mountain Survivors Center. \"These survivors are amazingly coura- geous and resilient people,\" says Palmer, who has specialized in the treatment of trauma throughout her career, including working with abused children and their families. \"Being an immigrant myself (she moved from Sweden to Colorado in 1983), I understand what it's like to change countries, and even under the best of circumstances, it's hard.\" In fact, she says, helping torture survi- vors deal with issues centered on identity change is no less important than work- ing through issues of trauma and grief. \"We have to help this population with social reconnection as they struggle with becoming a different person in a different land,\" she explains. Anderson says torture survivors often experience nightmares, night terrors, sleep deprivation, intense anxiety and other symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder. Depression is another common struggle. \"The psychological scars from being tortured take much longer to heal than the physical scars,\" she says.Some effects of torture aren't necessarily visible to the eye but potentially are more debilitating, Palmer says. \"Survivors of torture often feel like failures and can be- come preoccupied with 'Why didn't I do something differently?'\" she says. \"They often feel like they're dirtied somehow. Their shame issues are high, and they sometimes feel contagious. As counsel- ors, when you hear what they have gone through, you have to be careful of your reaction to the severity of the trauma, or they might think, 'Even my therapist can't handle this. Now I've made her feel bad, too.'\" Survivors' assessment of the \"conta- giousness\" factor aren't necessarily off base if the aftereffects of torture are left un- checked. According to Anderson, research shows that if torture survivors don't receive therapeutic interventions, their children and grandchildren have higher incidences of mental health disorders and face greater risk of school failure and fam- ily violence. \"Torture has a ripple effect on families and even communities,\" she says. \"It can be toxic.\" As Palmer explains, survivors of torture often live their lives on edge. This sense 34 | Counseling T oday | February 2009of unease can easily transfer to their fami- lies if left untreated. \"There is more fear present in the room with survivors, in part because they are so hypervigilant,\" she says. \"They are constantly geared to- ward fight or flight. It is a different opera- tion for them to concentrate or to simply do boring things because they never feel totally safe.\" Both Palmer and Anderson say that, thankfully, therapeutic interventions can decrease the anxiety levels experienced by survivors and help them to restore their sense of self-worth, dignity and hope. Multicultural competence While counselors should have training in trauma work before treating torture survivors, practicing with multicultural competence is also a must. When she helped to found Survivors of Torture International, Anderson assumed the majority of its clients would come from Latin America, given the organization's location in San Diego. In actuality, most hail from African and Middle Eastern na- tions. Overall, the organization has served approximately 800 clients from nearly 60 countries. A hallway at Survivors of Torture In- ternational features a map that indicates the country of origin of each of its clients. That visual aid helps clients realize that, \"'Oh my gosh, it's not just me' or 'It's not just my country,'\" Anderson says. \"It makes their experience a lot less isolating.\" Offering therapeutic groups is another consideration, both for helping survivors to normalize their experience and to show sensitivity to their cultural norms. \"When working with people from diverse cultures, one-on-one work can be foreign to them,\" Anderson says. \"In many cases, doing group work makes much more sense to them and makes them feel more comfortable.\" Likewise, counselors may have to take steps to decrease survivors' suspiciousness of therapeutic services and entice them to participate. \"As care providers, it's really incumbent on us to meet them more than halfway,\" Anderson says. For example, her organization doesn't publicize its physical address (using a P .O. box instead) and is located away from a main street so clients can guard their privacy. In addition, her organization rarely uses the term \"mental health\" in describing its services. Many torture survivors already are burdened with a sense of shame or guilt, she explains, and in most of their countries of origin, a strong stigma is attached to mental health services. \"So when providing counseling services to this population,\" she says, \"we might just call it 'help' or even 'going on a nature walk to talk.'\" The Rocky Mountain Survivors Center is also careful about the way it presents available services to clients \u2014 asylum seekers who otherwise receive absolutely no services from other sources. \"Most of the world doesn't have counseling as it is practiced in the United States,\" Palmer says. \"Many of (our clients) don't know what counseling is, so we explain it to them in simple language that makes sense. But they do know about 'insane asylums' and that those people are never accepted back into society in their culture, so they fear anything labeled 'mental health.' We present ourselves as people others can come and safely talk to about what has happened to them, much like the role elders serve in their culture. We try to describe their condition as being more like an injury instead of an illness that we are going to help them 'heal' from.\" Palmer has learned a couple of other interesting cultural lessons while working at the nonprofit survivors center. First, she says, some clients, particularly those from Africa, regard anything offered for free \u2014 including legal representation, health care or psychosocial services \u2014 as being \"bad,\" or at the very least view the offer with suspicion. Palmer also noted that clients from Af- rica were more likely to accept offers for help but then not show up to take advan- tage of the services. She finally had an Af- rican client tell her, \"We are 'yes' people.\" He explained that people from his culture automatically answer \"yes\" to any offer, whether they want to accept or not; to decline the offer in front of the person is considered rude. From this encounter, Palmer learned to give clients from Africa specific options. For example, instead of asking, \"Would you like to come in for an appointment?\" she will now ask, \"Would you like to have your appointment in a week, in two weeks, or would you like to call me when you are ready?\" When it comes to multicultural com- petence and sensitivity, Palmer says, \"There are two key words to remember: respect and curiosity. Be respectfully cu- rious about the person.\" She also gives counselors another piece of advice: Don't have preconceived notions about what is \"right\" or \"wrong\" based on an exclusive-ly Western point of view. She admits this is sometimes easier said than done. Palmer recalls one instance in which a 63-year-old woman from Sudan arrived at the survivors center. She had been in slavery and had been tortured (\"The fact that she reached age 63 is a miracle,\" Palmer says as an aside). Fellow villagers had raised money to help her escape and reunite with her daughter, who was mar- ried and living in Denver. The therapists and other service providers at the survi- vors center ran into a roadblock, however, when they tried to help the woman. \"In her culture,\" Palmer explains, \"women cannot speak until the man tells them they can. We don't like that thought here in the West.\" Palmer respectfully asked the son-in- law if she could meet with the woman one-on-one, but the woman said she would refuse to speak unless her son-in-law was present. The initial session eventually was carried out with a therapist asking the son-in-law for permission each time before the woman spoke. \"It didn't seem like a big power trip,\" Palmer says. \"It just seemed like, 'This is how we do it in our culture.'\" After that first session, the woman was comfortable enough to meet with a male therapist and an interpreter by herself. \"Because she had been a slave and been tortured, we were trying to teach her self- empowerment,\" Palmer says, \"but we first had to understand that we weren't start-ing from the same point culturally.\" Meeting needs When treating survivors of torture, \"therapy\" can take many forms, much of it extending beyond the traditional realm of counseling, says Anderson. She points to a cooking class that Survivors of Torture International offers its clients. \"This is a nontraditional approach,\" she says, \"but everybody likes food, so you can pull a lot of people and a lot of cultures in. It's therapeutic because they are preparing and eating a meal together, reestablishing human connections, laugh- ing and having joy. But it's also practical Continued on page 37February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 35 The six-hour workshops are facilitated by either Catherine Rains, (formerly Catherine Holmes), M.S.; Sherrie six-hour workshops are designed for career counselors and academic advisors who support college and high school students, as well as all practitioners who help adults with career decisions.

If you are seeing immigrants and refugees in your clinic, school or workplace, then most likely you are seeing some individuals who have survived torture. Though most will never mention their torture experience, it may be affecting their physical and mental health, education, work performance or personal and family relationships. Possible indicators include: n Refugee, immigrant or asylee status n From a country experiencing civil war or widespread repression n Reluctance to talk about experiences in their country of origin n Physical evidence of trauma n Symptoms of psychological distress, fearfulness, agitation, conflict or withdrawal \u2014 probably affecting functioning n Reported problems with sleep n Somatic symptoms Children-specific presenting behaviors: n Aggression or acting out aggressive experiences n Isolation or social hesitancy, fear or mistrust of others n Regressive behaviors associated with a child of a younger age n Constant need for attention or validation n Daydreaming, dissociation or a blank look when other children are engaged and animated n Exaggerated startle reflex, \"jumpy\" or on guard n Unable to recall details from the past n Signs of sleep deprivation (lethargy, napping in class, chronic fatigue) Other questions to consider: n Is the child a newcomer from a coun- try known to be embroiled in civil unrest or war? n Was the family resettled as refugees or granted asylum? n Has the child or parent shared that they were ever in detention or prison in their home country? n Is the child or parent defensive or protective of the family's ethnicity, religion or language?

Normally, no hands go up. \"So I tell them, 'I bet you have and you just didn't know it,'\" Anderson says. \"In fact, it's very likely that counselors have come across this population without knowing it. It's a matter of just opening up our minds to the possibility.\" Anderson, a member of ACA who cofounded Survivors of Torture International, speaks from experience. \"I had resettled refugees, served on the board of Amnesty International, been in private practice and was teaching graduate courses in multicultural counseling, but I wasn't aware of the thousands and thousands of torture survivors residing in the United States. Someone else had to point it out to me. It was pre-9/11, and we just weren't thinking along those lines at the time.\" The following information is adapted from a fact sheet developed by Survivors of Torture International to raise awareness among helping professionals that they might be providing services to torture survivors. Kathi AndersonFebruary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 37because they are learning how to cook for themselves, which many of the men don't necessarily do in their cultures. We try to meet our clients where their needs are. As they learn to trust us through these expe- riences, they often open themselves up to other kinds of therapy.\" The best treatment/intervention tech- niques vary from person to person, An-derson says. She sees similarities between working with survivors of torture and individuals who have been raped because both groups have had their sense of con- trol taken from them. For that reason, she says, counselors should collaborate with torture survivors on their treatment plans, both to restore some sense of control to them and to ensure the plan is a good fit. \"We're also not proponents of these survivors having to tell their entire story to be healed,\" Anderson says. \"They may reveal pieces of it little by little, and that's OK. As counselors, we have to go at their pace.\" She has found torture survivors to be extremely appreciative of counselors and therapists who can help them put the feelings they have been carrying around inside of them into words. This process is aided greatly by mak- ing survivors feel safe in their sharing. For example, Anderson says, when her organization does an intake with a client and takes down the person's history, \"We make it more of a conversation rather than an interview because we don't want them to feel like they are going through an interrogation again.\" Likewise, all the offices have windows that open so survi- vors won't have flashbacks to when they were confined by their torturers. \"We try to make the environment as warm and inviting as possible for them,\" Anderson LOCATION & DATES OF WORKSHOPS February 19, 20, 2009 - Daytona Beach, FLMarch 5, 6, 2009 - Savannah, GAApril 16, 17, 2009 - Wenatachee, WAOctober 1, 2, 2009 - Daytona Beach, FL The National Board of Forensic Evaluators (NBFE) is the only forensic mental health counselors credential- ing body recognized and endorsed by the American Mental Health Counselors Association (AMHCA).

She is also a proponent of cognitive therapy, but, like Anderson, believes each treatment plan must be individualized. Palmer says one of the major steps in treating torture survivors is to help them stabilize by assisting them in identifying their strengths and coping skills and understanding why trauma af-fects them in the way that it does. Once again, this often involves normal- izing the client's experience. Palmer refer- ences one client who had been a mathe- matician for a foreign government before being tortured and exiled. When he came for treatment, he expressed deep-seated worry that he no longer seemed capable of doing even simple math. Palmer tried to help him understand that his body and mind were reacting very naturally to the traumatic events he had endured. \"I told him, 'You can't stop and do math when a tiger is chasing you.' For torture sur- vivors, it is extremely tough for them to wind down and stop running from that tiger. We have to let them know that, giv-en their circumstances, their symptoms are normal; they are not going crazy.\" The Rocky Mountain Survivors Center also employs a variety of groups in treat-ing torture survivors, including trauma and grief groups, meditation groups and groups designed to strengthen coping mechanisms through the creative arts. The groups also serve the purpose of helping survivors rebuild their sense of community and trust. Among the treat-ment goals these clients most often voice, Palmer says, are to feel safe, be confident in their ability to manage their symp- toms, sleep better, worry less, identify the good things in their lives and dare to reach out to other people. Family therapy is another important component of working with torture sur- vivors, Anderson says. In some instances, children of survivors haven't been told or don't really grasp what happened to their parent. Those who don't understand sometimes feel abandoned or resentful that the parent wasn't providing for the family. Anderson says counselors also need to help family members understand that the symptoms the survivor is exhibit-ing or feeling are normal based on what happened to them. The good news, Anderson says, is that the proper treatment allows torture survivors to heal from their trauma and resurrect their hopes and dreams. \"These people are true survivors,\" she says. \"They have survived torture. They have survived getting to this country. They have survived adapting to a new culture. They walk through our door a shell of who they once were. Through treatment and interventions, they can become who they were before they were tortured and contribute again. It's amazing just how resilient and successful these survivors are. These are the type of people who make any country strong.\" u Jonathan Rollins is the editor-in- chief of Counseling Today. Contact him at jrollins@counseling.org. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org38 | Counseling T oday | February 2009 Finding hope after losing a job Helping clients confront the mental and emotional aspects of job loss By Jenny Christenson Most experts agree that the United States is now enduring its toughest economic climate since the Great Depression of 1929. Hand-in-hand with that grim outlook is the current job market. The national unemployment rate in November was 6.7 percent, up from 4.7 percent one year earlier. According to a December report published on CNNMoney.com, 2008 appeared as though it would finish as the worst year since 1982 in terms of job losses based on data from the Bureau of Labor statistics. And some economists are predicting the unemployment rate could near 10 percent by the end of 2009. Losing a job is unquestionably a life- changing event, both practically and psychologically, says Ed Colozzi, director of Career Development and Counseling Services in Winchester, Mass. \"Work is necessary for survival. Food, rent, mortgage expenses and other personal and family expenses are dependent upon it. Because of that, work is critical in our lives. In addition, our work involves our skills and talents. We get paid because we add value, and we tend to develop a set of personal beliefs around these things.\" When people lose their jobs, they often develop low self-efficacy, questioning their ability to accomplish anything, says Colozzi, a member of the American Counseling Association. \"They actually lose belief in their ability to find a job,\" he says. \"Psychologically, they are depressed.\" What's more, people's relationship with the outer world changes, says Bob Chope, president of the National Employment Counseling Association, a division of ACA. \"Suddenly, you can't maneuver the world the same way because you've lost your sense of self-esteem, you've lost your income, you feel you've lost the respect of other people,\" he says. \"So there's a tendency to isolate oneself, to feel sorry for oneself, rather than to attempt to do things differently.\" Sue Pressman, who has a private consulting practice in Virginia and is the president-elect of NECA, says people who lose jobs often go through a cycle similar to the five stages of grief (denial/ isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) described by psychiatrist Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross. According to Pressman, the effects of this grief cycle can include: n Loss of identity n Loss of a sense of control n Loss of security and status n Loss of a sense of belonging (no longer \"belonging\" to an organization) n Self-doubt n Uncertainty about the future Chope, who maintains a private practice in San Francisco called the Career and Personal Development Institute, says he has noticed some women seem to adjust more readily to job loss than men. He believes this is due to the \"in and out\" phenomenon. \"In the past,\" he explains, \"women, rather than men, have been called on more frequently to take time off from work to raise small children or to care for elderly family members.\" Regardless, says Chope, a professor of counseling at San Francisco State University, all people tend to feel a sense of shock and personal shame over losing a job. \"There is a loss of security, loss of relationships and loss of one's own predictability,\" he says. In Ofer Zur's experience, the effect of job loss on people is vastly different depending on their economic/social class, personality and gender. Zur maintains a private practice in California and is the director of the Zur Institute, which offers online courses to counselors and February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 39therapists. He recently saw a client \u2014 a successful businesswoman \u2014 who had lost a stock portfolio. She was more distressed than another client of Zur's who had lost his job. Zur points out the differences not only in the two clients' coping skills but also in the ways they identified with their careers. \"For her, money means security, but for the man, who is working class, he has a strong sense of survivability,\" Zur says. \"He's been through recovery, and he's a survivalist. So losing a job doesn't mean the end of the world to him.\" Given the recent economic downturn, job loss can seem particularly traumatic right now, Chope says, especially because layoffs are happening rapidly and without much forewarning, meaning people aren't prepared mentally or financially for such a drastic change. \"There's also fear about where you work next,\" he says, \"because you don't know if the company is going to survive. That affects one's confidence about how to make choices about where to work.\" Colozzi notes another major shift in how people are reacting to job loss that started more than a decade ago and continues to this day. During the mid-1990s, he says, people increasingly began expressing a desire to discover and pursue career paths with more purpose and meaning rather than simply retooling quickly to land that \"next job.\" Colozzi created the term \"career/life\" to describe this outlook (which, he says, coincided with Donald Super's use of the term \"life/ career\" in his writings in the mid-1970s). \"The career/life paradigm is sensitive of the whole person, taking into account the set of roles that people have and finding a career that is supported by the roles,\" Colozzi says. This shift in thinking about \"Counselors need to have a resource tool kit.\" Another helpful tactic is to assist people in exploring new or unthought- of alternatives upon losing a job, Chope says. For example, clients might pursue what Chope dubs a \"tryout\" job, in which a person asks a company to try them out, even if a position hasn't been advertised. Another alternative that many clients have never considered, he says, is pursuing a \"portfolio career\" \u2014 essentially working several types of jobs for different employers and using different types of skills in the process. Counselors need look no further than their own profession for an example of The Association for Counselors and Educators in Government invites you to attend its Professional Development Institute.Theme: Supporting and Advocating for Our Servicemembers: Pre, In, and Post Service 19-20 March 2009, Westin Hotel Sample topics: Overview of the New GI Bill, When Vets Transition to School, Navigating Legal Issues Related to Veterans' Disability, Combat Stressors Affecting Military Personnel and Their Families - How Counselors Can Help, PTSD and Its Effect on Servicemembers and Their Families, Navigating the Federal Job System (EARN CEUs) Special Workshop: Combining the MBTI and Strong for Career Development (can register for this only) Registration information and program details can be found at http://www.dantes.doded.mil/Dantes_web/organizations/aceg/PDI-text.htm Program Sponsors: Capella University, Grantham University, CPP, US Army Recruiting Command, USMEPCOM, DANTES work includes having balance among work, family and other life roles. Providing a different perspective There are a number of ways counselors can help people who have lost a job. Showing compassion and care may seem obvious, but this approach is often forgotten when counselors are overloaded with clients or dissatisfied with their own careers, according to Colozzi. Counselors should also be careful to address not only clients' career needs, but also their life-issue needs, he says. \"For example, discuss their relationship issues, such as their marriage or their relationship with their parents,\" he explains. \"Some people in their 30s or 40s have to move back in with their folks. Those kinds of issues go into career-life counseling. It's not just about doing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\" Counselors can also encourage clients to reflect, Colozzi says. \"Be a catalyst for touching their hope button. Find their meaning and purpose and calling,\" he says. As part of the career/life paradigm, he suggests counselors \"get into discussions about what people's hobbies and interests are. Do a mini 'career CAT scan' and discover what their roles in life are. If every counselor did that, then we could change the approach to counseling.\" To facilitate the counseling process, it is first important to establish trust, Pressman says, \"because there's anger that goes on when there's job loss.\" In addition, she says, counselors need to take quick, targeted action when assisting people who have lost their jobs. \"This means quick goal setting, quick establishment of the relationship and use of at-hand resources,\" Pressman says. 40 | Counseling T oday | February 2009how this might work, Chope says. Many counselors generate multiple sources of income and tap into different parts of their skill sets by maintaining a private practice, teaching at a university, writing books for publishing houses and so on. Zur believes counselors also must help clients look beyond the immediate goal of finding a new job. Financial difficulties during times of job loss are the \"elephant in the room,\" he says. \"Don't avoid talking about it.\" While counselors are better trained in clinical issues such as depression, he says, they can assist clients who are struggling financially by being empathic and very pragmatic. If a client who has lost a job doesn't bring up the topic of personal finances, Zur says, the counselor should. \"Let them know the sky is not falling, even though the crisis is very big,\" he says. \"Reduce their sense of helplessness.\" Zur suggests that counselors help these clients analyze their budgets and reach decisions on what can be eliminated or deferred. \"You go over (budgets) item by item and ask, for example, 'How necessary is this item?'\" Zur also advises counselors to be sensitive if these clients inquire about reducing their number of counseling sessions because of financial concerns. \"Don't try to convince the clients to stay in therapy,\" he says, \"because you're going to lose them altogether.\" A challenging economy Counselors certainly aren't immune to difficulties during times of financial crisis. Zur strongly encourages counselors to deal with their own anxieties and fears by seeing a therapist or participating in wellness activities such as meditation or a regular exercise program. Counselors also risk getting caught up in their clients' loss of hope and can put too much pressure on themselves to \"rescue\" clients from their circumstances. \"You are a resource, not the person with all the answers,\" he reminds his fellow counselors. \"T ry not to fix everything for them. Instead, empower them to go within themselves to deal with some of the issues.\" He also suggests that counselors stay focused on the many good resources available rather than allowing themselves to be overwhelmed by the media's portrayal of the difficult economic climate. It is often hard to predict how clients may react to losing a job and a steady source of income. Sometimes, the accompanying anxiety and depression can boil over. \"The hardest thing for counselors will be the potential acting out by people who have lost their jobs,\" Chope says. \"They may engage in abusive behavior toward others or even suicidal behavior.\" Chope also reminds counselors that the current poor economic and employment climates aren't limited to the United States \u2014 these issues are global. \"I traveled to China recently, and with the recent employment downturn there, their suicide rate is now double that of the United States,\" he says. \"That's the material you address initially in a crisis intervention type of way.\" A question that remains to be answered is whether, given the high rate of unemployment, more people will be seeking out career, employment and mental health counselors or, given the financial crisis, whether these same people will attempt to employ a \"do-it-yourself\" approach now and in the months ahead. Pressman says people who have lost jobs have been contacting her office in increasing numbers. \"While people may have been reluctant in the past, they are now looking for career counselors who can help them,\" she says. These new clients may not understand that career counselors don't work at job placement, she cautions, so career counselors might need to explain that they focus on helping clients discover resources. \"We are just swamped,\" says Chope about his Career and Personal Development Institute. He and his staff are meeting with many former high-level executives, many of whom are in their early to mid-50s. \"I can't say that we are sitting there with silver bullets either,\" Chope says. \"The people contacting us are looking for some kind of inculcation of hope.\" Colozzi concurs that people are looking for assistance with issues beyond just finding a job. \"While their presenting issues often relate to needing a new job and income, especially in the past year, most clients will indicate their desire for assistance dealing with issues such as anxiety, fear, confusion, sadness, feeling overwhelmed, and are very open to discussing these topics.\"Zur, however, questions whether growing numbers of people who have lost jobs are actively seeking help in the form of counseling, or at least questions the immediacy with which they seek that help. \"I think that when people lose jobs, they are not likely to seek counseling unless it affects family, parenting and marriages, because then you'll have somebody else who will say, 'You need some help.'\" T ools to use There are many techniques counselors can use to assist people who have lost jobs during these difficult economic times. Colozzi suggests counselors dedicate time for clients to reflect and talk or to complete written exercises, keep a journal, meditate or pray. He also advises counselors to use a specific formula, such as the formula found in his life/ work paradigm, that addresses clients' universal needs for self-knowledge and work knowledge (see his 2008 workbook Creating Careers With Confidence and his website lifeworkps.com/edwardc). Counselors might also provide strategies to help clients with work and family life balance roles, he says. In addition, while it is important to encourage clients to look within themselves during times of job loss, make sure they are also looking outside themselves for sources of support, Colozzi says. These sources might include friends, job fairs, Internet blogs (both reading and writing them) and support groups. Chope agrees that joining a group is one of the best suggestions counselors can provide to clients. \"T rying to counsel everyone individually is too much for counselors,\" he says. \"What is most effective is groups or job clubs with reinforcement for people to engage in work-related activities.\" Counselors should maintain regular telephone contact with job-loss clients \"to inculcate hope and show them that there is light at the end of the tunnel,\" Chope says. He also suggests getting clients' families involved in the job search process, including using family members as sources for networking. Counselors should also encourage clients to establish a daily routine while out of work.

Also tell them to take some time off from the job search to enjoy themselves during the week,\" he adds. Helping an individual who has lost a job isn't the exclusive domain of career counselors. \"Both career counselors and non-career counselors are good listeners,\" Chope emphasizes. \"The non-career counselor can address a number of issues, such as family issues, potential dysfunction, potential breakup and potential abuse.\" He adds that all counselors can address emotional issues related to job loss. Colozzi says the website of the National Career Development Association (ndca.org), a division of ACA, offers good resources for all counselors who are assisting clients with job searches. Especially during these times of economic hardship, it's important for counselors to be proactive in reaching out to people who have lost their jobs. Colozzi suggests giving free talks at schools, colleges, parent-teacher organizations and community events. \"I've discussed the career/life paradigm when talking to high school teachers, then I've given a presentation to parents who were interested in it for their own careers,\" he says. Pressman provides links to free job search tools on her website (pressmanconsulting.com) to provide resources to the public. \"I have categorized sites that people can go to so that they have a starting point,\" she says. \"It doesn't cost anyone anything to go to my website and discover tools. Any counselor who has a website can do that for people. I think we have a responsibility to do those types of things.\" Chope has appeared as a guest on many radio talk shows because he believes it is an effective way to get information out to job seekers. He is also a proponent of counselors speaking to community groups. In addition, some of his career counseling students provide pro bono r\u00e9sum\u00e9 work at homeless shelters. Providing these types of community outreach activities often benefits the counselor as well, Chope says. \"This will pay off for those looking to enhance their practices.\" Jenny Christenson is a staff writer for Counseling Today. Contact her at jchristenson@counseling.org. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgLooking for a silver lining Although all of his clients have negative feelings associated with job loss, Colozzi says, approximately 10 percent also display a certain sense of excitement, anticipation or hope at being presented with an unexpected opportunity to change their career. In fact, counselors can be integral in helping job-loss clients reframe their current circumstances to focus on the potential rewards. \"These (financial crises) tend to happen every 25 years, and in these periods, new industries start,\" Chope observes. \"Whole new jobs will be created that don't exist today.\" This is something for counselors to keep in mind as they strive to maintain perspective while counseling those who are caught between jobs, he says. Also important, according to Colozzi, is \"to ask the right questions that will become a catalyst for clients' reflection, and then work with them where they are. That's how to make progress with a client.\" Job loss is unquestionably difficult, yet it is helpful for counselors and clients alike to remember that times of struggle also tend to yield great internal growth. Zur, for one, believes there are many \"blessings in disguise\" in the current financial crisis. For example, he says, we may all find it imperative to develop better priorities and more clearly define what is important in our lives versus what is unnecessary, while at the same time gaining a deeper appreciation of loving connections. From a financial perspective, he says, more people may get into the habit of sharing, borrowing, reusing and creating rather than buying on first impulse. Chope offers similar thoughts on suc- cessfully coping with job loss, saying that after the period is over, \"People will not take things such as family for granted, and they will slow down and reflect on the things they missed before.\" u42 | Counseling T oday | February 2009 The little concept of nanotechnology holds revolutionary promise and the potential for planet-altering consequences. As such, the discipline of counseling has a professional obligation to be involved and fully engaged in the ethical debate surrounding nanotechnology. Humans are using their innate investigative natures to explore the smallest parts of matter that can be manipulated. The nanoscale measures between one and 100 nanometers or about 1/180,000 the thickness of a human hair. Proposed nanotechnology uses range from drug delivery and nanorobots to nanosensors and new manufacturing applications. Designing in the nanoscale is already having a major worldwide impact in the areas of medicine, engineering and computer science. Optimists predict that nanotechnology will significantly change the world for good. They claim all diseases will be eradicated and all the world's people will be fed. Proponents tout improved understanding of nature, increased productivity, better health care, extension of human potential and sustainable development. These are laudable goals. However, the real danger lies in the invisible, undetectable nature of nanotechnology and the unstable and unpredictable nature of reactions on the nanoscale. T raditionally, counseling's role, in part, has been to empower and educate individuals and groups on how to ef- fectively respond emotionally to societal and technological challenges. We propose a rationale for involving the counseling profession in the ethical debate surround- ing nanotechnology and having the pro-fession serve as a major player in helping to shape our collective futures.Impact and global trends Science is working with the fundamen- tal building blocks of matter to recon- figure and create structures not found in nature. As a result, as a species, we may no longer be passive victims to the laws of nature. There are already plans to inte- grate nanotechnology into living organ- isms. The human prototype is forecasted to live longer and be able to perform all human activities better and longer in a 24/7 existence. You could potentially customize your body and brain, creating a hybrid and diminishing the barriers between life and nanorobots. Nanotech researchers eventually could possess the power to turn humans into mere tools to be manipulated, with capabilities for achieving in nonhuman ways. We don't believe that scientists should have free rein to alter genetic blueprints and dic- tate human development. Nanotechnology, with its vast range of applications, poses daunting challenges for regulation and public safety. This invisible technology is hard to explain and detect, and at this point, its safety cannot be guaranteed. Scientific evidence continues to demonstrate that certain nanotech materials cause toxic harm to humans and the environment. These materials can be absorbed into the body and cross into tissues and organs. Nanomaterials are extremely under- regulated, both in the United States and worldwide. An estimated $3 billion of public tax monies are being invested in nanotechnology research worldwide, but there is minimal allocation of funds for the regulation and testing of human and environmental risks. More than 600 consumer products are already manufactured with nanomaterials, but there is little to no research on product safety. U.S. government agencies estimate that nanotechnology will be used in almost half of all new products in the next five years. Unfortunately, regulation does not ensure compliance and adherence. More than 50 countries have nanotechnology research programs, and the U.S. Department of Defense is the second largest agency recipient of nanotechnology dollars. It is frightening to think about what terrorists potentially could do with nanoweapons of mass destruction and nanobioterrorism. A nanotech arms race is a possibility, potentially resulting in significant destabilization of international relations. Humans need to confront the daunting character and complexity of nanotechnology to fully comprehend, react and legislate its future impact on society. Recruiting counselors to the debate The counseling profession should recognize its unique position and ethical obligation to enter into the debate because nanotechnology truly has the potential to dramatically alter and shape our communal futures. So far, the fields of science and philosophy have dominated the debate. Part of what defines the counseling profession is the value it places on prevention and early intervention, as well as its development of a seasoned and mature ACA Code of Ethics. Additionally, counseling is particularly well equipped to respond to future events because of its adaptive and proactive nature. By combining these strengths with the American Counseling Association's core goals of building professional identity and unity while promoting client welfare and engaging in advocacy, the counseling profession can position itself as a strong force to impact the growing field of nanotechnology. Historically, the helping professions Counseling in the nanotechnology frontier of the futureReader Viewpoint - By Liz Johnson and John R. CulbrethFebruary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 43 have been virtually absent from the national and international debates over the societal changes that take place as the result of new technologies being introduced. We believe that counseling's advocacy approach could help to fill some of the gaping holes in the current ethical debate surrounding nanotechnology. Rationale for counseling defining nanotechnology ethics There are compelling arguments for recruiting the counseling profession into the nanotech debate. First, there appear to be no barriers for entry into the ethics blueprint. The National Science Founda- tion has taken the lead on the debate, encouraging a multidisciplinary approach across science and the humanities. The counseling profession has a proven re- cord as it relates to developing ethics and places special emphasis on personal in- tegrity and uniqueness of the individual. Counselors serve as competent and val-ued intermediaries in society and should entertain how they can best advocate for humans as individuals and as a group in this debate.Counseling is the appropriate and necessary discipline to make a case for what humanness is and should continue to be. The counseling profession's perspective can help balance the focus between how experts think humans can be fixed and how the value of humanness might potentially be degraded. Other disciplines have made attempts to define humanness, but they seem to fall short in applicable humanistic, theoretical structures of empathy for the dignity and potential of all humans. Unless the counseling profession gets involved in the debate, a serious threat exists that cookie-cutter technological ideals of what human beings should be will come to define the nano-human nature debate. Counseling's participation will ensure that the debate includes respect for the inherent wisdom in each unique human and encouragement of the nurturing, dynamic development of self- actualization that enhances life. The optimal solution to the ethical dilemma surrounding nanotechnology will require collaborative leadership among scientists, ethicists and counselors alike. The preamble to the 2005 ACA Code of Ethics states that its members are \"dedicated to the enhancement of human development throughout the life span\" and \"recognize diversity and embrace a cross-cultural approach in support of the worth, dignity, potential and uniqueness of people within their social and cultural contexts.\" This type of respectful language toward the individual and individuality is currently missing from the ethical debate over nanotechnology. The counseling field does not assume pathology or that humans need to be \"fixed.\" Counselors do not view themselves as external fixers or manipulators, but rather proactive facilitators of strategies for human movement toward health and wellness. This is a critical perspective and approach to incorporate into the growing debate over nanotechnology. The ongoing development of nanotechnology presents the counseling profession with an opportunity to proactively define who counselors are globally and to enter the ethical debate advocating for the value of all humans and their potential. We believe the counseling profession has an ethical duty 44 | Counseling T oday | February 2009 February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 45 to promote these professional values and to persuade the public of their importance. The profession can serve as a moral compass and a voice of reason to protect the integrity of the human species. Recommendations for action With those ideas in mind, we propose the following recommendations for action. 1. In spirit with the 20/20: A Vision for the Future of Counseling effort, ACA should establish a task force to explore how the profession might get involved in the nanotechnology ethics debate through: n Reevaluating the profession's role in the future and how to meet the demands of future technology n Planning for education, training and language adaptation to face the challenges and the impact of future technology 2. The proposed task force should con- sider the nanotechnology ethics issue as an opportunity to incorporate core values from the 20/20 framework, including: n Building counselors' professional identity within the debate n Developing and implementing a comprehensive public relations plan on the local, state and national levels to promote professional principles on human development in relation to nanotechnology n Unifying all professional counseling groups to craft a collective message and action plan for how best to capi- talize on the profession's strengthsn Promoting client welfare and advoca- cy through development of a project management approach that strategizes the possible impact of, and profes- sional response to, nanotechnology 3. ACA should consider meeting with the National Science Foundation to explore how an effective partnership might be developed. This partnership could begin with: n Official recognition of nanotechnol-ogy as an important initiative by the ACA Governing Council, develop-ment of an official ACA policy or position statement on the counseling profession's role in nanotech devel- opment and establishment of an as- sociation subcommittee for nanotech involvement n Official attendance by ACA sub-committee leaders and members at national and international nanotech- nology conferences and policy meet- ings, with follow-up reports to the counseling profession through print and electronic media n Support and guidance for counseling researchers to be involved in grant proposals and projects as nanotech-nology ethicists Conclusion So far, no one has predicted a nanotechnology utopia. This very fact should galvanize the discipline of counseling into collective action. We believe the counseling profession already has the tools to help ensure that humans will survive and flourish. Proactively, the profession needs to acknowledge how nanotechnology may manipulate our lives in the future. Next, there needs to be a sense of urgency to recognize that the time for getting involved and educated on possible nanotechnology implications is now. Then the profession needs a focused measure of compassion to recognize that humanity is in this together and that it is absolutely imperative we get this right. Finally, counselors need to begin taking action, because once the nanotech revolution gets moving at full speed, there will be no turning back to what we were before as humans. There is a real danger that as nanotechnology advances, mankind may lose sight of the fact that it is our natural gifts \u2014 and our imperfections \u2014 that are essential to our humanness. With its strong focus on human relationships, human interactions and human dignity, the counseling profession can help us retain our humanity as we move forward into this uncharted territory. We may eventually conquer the world with nanotechnology, but we also run the risk of losing our humanity in the process.

Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org46 | Counseling T oday | February 2009Imagine my surprise upon learning that I belonged to a special \"cultural\" group \u2014 a culture I didn't even know existed until I began working on my master's degree in school counseling. A culture on which school systems and agencies spend thousands of dollars to educate and train their school counselors, teachers, administrators and social service staff. A culture I hid away and was ashamed to be a member of. A culture I did not feel emotionally safe in sharing until I was pursuing a doctoral degree. A culture I lived in for many years. A culture to which my family still belongs. Growing up, I had no realization that my circumstances allowed me \"membership\" in the culture of poverty. I did come to understand that society had low tolerance for me and others like me who came from families that struggled financially and emotionally based on our economic status. This dominant and oppressive system showed disgust when we needed assistance, sending a clear message of disregard and disdain. It was a system that neglected our medical and dental needs. I also experienced a society that frowned on my family for its low educational attainment (I am the only person in my family to have graduated from high school, let alone go on to get an advanced degree). Growing up in poverty, I learned some hard lessons about life. These lessons were taught to me not by my family but rather by system \"helpers.\" I learned that being poor offended people. I learned people had rage and anger toward me and others like me. I learned that people thought being poor equated to lacking intelligence, creativity, motivation and desire. I learned that people felt sorry for me. In the process, I also learned to be weary (and wary) of helpers.Growing up, I experienced feelings of guilt and shame because of my economic status. Based on the treatment I received from system helpers, it became clear to me that something was \"different\" or \"wrong\" with me. Perhaps it had to do with how I dressed, where I lived or the fact that I was on the free lunch program and served by migrant services. The dominant attitude I encountered was, \"Why invest time, energy and resources in the daughter of a farm laborer?\" These attitudes were pervasive, subtle, real and painful. Throughout my middle and high school years, I felt I was a nuisance to the school and social services system. Rarely did any teacher, counselor or helping professional take the time to get to know me. I spent many hours in school with my head on my desk wishing to be elsewhere \u2014 someplace that afforded me unconditional respect, acceptance and dignity. School and agency counselors are in a unique position to advocate for students and families living in poverty. Yet the relationship I had with my school counselor and other system helpers was nonexistent. The only memory I have of speaking to my school counselor was the time I was beckoned to his office and asked, \"What are your plans for your life?\" I replied, \"I don't know.\" He responded by saying, \"People like you do really well in the Army.\" At that moment, as a child, I heard the message loud and clear that I had little meaning, possessed low potential and, at some level, was expendable. As a junior in high school, I began pursuing what I had been led to believe was my only option \u2014 the military. When I share my story with students, families and colleagues, they seem surprised that I have gone from \"government cheese\" to a Ph.D. They often inquire how I was able to accomplish this given my background and experiences. I believe it was luck \u2014 luck that people with true understanding of living in poverty reached out to me at just the right times in my life. One high school teacher intervened upon hearing my school counselor's advice to join the Army. With great tolerance and patience, he mentored me and insisted I had worth. He encouraged me and believed in me even though I did not believe in myself. Regardless of my grades and attitude, he persisted in getting me to apply to college. Two beloved professors, one in my undergrad program and one in my doctoral program, also mentored me. When I sat in class feeling inadequate and unworthy of being in a doctoral program, one of these professors encouraged me and reinforced my sense of belonging. These authentic individuals took time to listen to me, to know me, to understand me and to show me I belonged. People sometimes comment how I must have been more driven and motivated than my siblings and parents were. I disagree. I was lucky to have mentorship from individuals who dismissed all judgments and preconceptions regarding my and my family's economic status. My siblings and parents, who were just as bright and motivated, did not receive the same opportunities, sense of acceptance or guidance to help them shine in their own right. Having myself been a school and agency counselor in high poverty areas and having worked with low-income, first-generation students and families (both first generation in this country and in attending college), it is quite Focus on 'culture of poverty' misses the markReader Viewpoint - By Mary Amanda GrahamFebruary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 47clear to me that these individuals are still sorted and belittled by the system. Many school and agency counselors, teachers and school administrators continue to adopt punitive attitudes toward students and families living in poverty. These system helpers spend a great amount of time criticizing and judging in lieu of listening, learning, empowering and building relationships. I remember dreading the thought of having my parents come to my school or enter a social service agency because I knew they would be judged on their economic, educational and employment status. Even though the school and other social service systems labeled them as noninvested and unencouraging, my parents loved and cherished me and wanted the best for their children. But my parents had little understanding of their rights in relationship to the school system or society. Often, schools and social service systems send messages that are unwelcoming and intolerant of those living in poverty. These students and families are made to feel inferior for asking questions and seeking assistance. There is a conspicuous belief within many school and social service systems that students and families in poverty need to accept anything given to them because, after all, anything is better than nothing. In every workshop I have facilitated on issues of poverty with school, mental health and social service counselors, I have heard comments such as, \"It makes me so mad that people in poverty have cell phones, cable TV, nice cars ...\" and \"If they worked harder, they could get ahead\" and \"They are just lazy\" or \"Why work when you get all that money from welfare?\" These comments are being made by individuals identified as front- line advocates for students and families in poverty. It seems counterintuitive that these helpers are functioning from a punitive attitude and perpetuating biases, stereotypes and rage against the individuals for whom they are supposed to be advocating. In workshops focusing on the culture of poverty, school and social service systems spend a great deal of time and resources attempting to learn about \"what people in poverty do,\" \"the rules \"This informative and all- inclusive text underscores the complex and comprehensive nature of counseling multiple heritage individuals, couples, and families.

Based on biases prevalent within many schools and agencies, it is evident that systemwide changes are necessary. A dialogue regarding issues of classism and bias should begin with potential counsel- ing students interviewing for graduate programs. Counselor educators should consider infusing discussions about clas- sism throughout the entire curriculum. Counseling students should be encour- aged to participate in service-based learn- ing with students and families in poverty in settings that will help them examine the human condition and develop rela- tionships, understanding and uncondi- tional regard. Counselors entering the field should be equipped, both through education and training, with the skills to identify and address classism within their work structure and with colleagues. In lieu of workshops that provide a laundry list of the traits and attributes of individ-uals belonging to the culture of poverty, counseling programs, school districts and agencies should consider requiring all students and staff to attend experiential poverty simulator workshops that help participants gain a better understanding of living in poverty. It is no longer sufficient \u2014 nor was it ever \u2014 to discuss the issue of classism in a single training, class or staff meeting. We in the counseling profession have made some progress and have maintained a continuing dialogue related to other \"isms\" such as sexism and racism, but we have made little progress toward the elimination of classism. The ism surrounding class remains more accepted and tolerated. There are many caring and accepting school counselors, community counselors, social service providers, teachers and administrators who work with students and families in poverty. But there are also many so-called helpers who do not exhibit these attitudes. As system change agents, school and agency counselors have the responsibility to address classism and oppression and assist in removing barriers placed by colleagues and students alike. Students and families living in poverty deserve treatment that communicates their worth and dignity, as do individuals from every socioeconomic background. In some ways, studying the \"culture of poverty\" instead of the \"culture of classism\" further divides an already divided system, reinforcing the boundaries between those who have and those who have nothing. u Mary Amanda Graham is an assistant professor in the counseling and school psychology department at Seattle University. She is also a certified school counselor and has worked throughout her career with students and families living in poverty. Contact her at grahamm@seattleu.edu. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.org50 | Counseling T oday | February 2009 ACA Publications Committee creates values statement By Maureen C. Kenny and Paul Peluso In 2007, the ACA Publications Committee drafted a Statement of Publication Values of the American Counseling Association, which the ACA Governing Council later approved. The goal of the values statement is to ensure that ACA and its field editors, editorial board members and authors are adhering to best practices in publishing so that ACA remains a highly regarded publisher and source for cutting-edge research in the field. The process of publishing manuscripts and scholarly work is a major aspect of our work as counselors. Most counselors and counselor educators are involved with publications in some way, whether by contributing scholarly articles to journals, serving as editors or reviewers or consuming these products and using them in daily practice. For those of us in academia, publishing research is vital to our careers, and the value of this research is evaluated partially by the journal in which it is published. Journals are judged based on independent analyses of impact, peer review and the number of times that other authors cite articles. Because research and journal publications guide the field of counseling, this is an area of work that is of utmost importance. The ACA Code of Ethics provides important guidelines for how to proceed professionally and responsibly, but it pays little attention to ethical behavior related to the process of publication. The Code contains a section on \"Research and Publication\" that primarily addresses authorship, appropriate citation of work and submission of articles. However, Standard G.5.h., \"Professional Review,\" specifically states, \"Counselors review article submissions in a timely manner and based on their scope and competency in research methodologies.\" Although the ACA Code of Ethics makes an effort to address this issue, many behaviors that may constitute unethical or, at a minimum, unprofessional behavior are not addressed. For example, the word timely is open to interpretation. Published work is critical in guiding our practice, theory and future direction as counselors. Yet, the process involved in publication is often given scant professional attention. Failures in the publishing process Counselors who publish cite many examples of the frustration often involved in getting a manuscript accepted. \"L.L.,\" an associate professor of counselor education at a large minority-serving institute, shared how her manuscript was accepted with minor revisions for publication. She and her colleagues worked hard on the revisions and resubmitted a few months later. Nine months went by without any communication from the journal. L.L. finally e-mailed the editor, only to be told that he had tried to contact her (but could not produce the e-mail) and that the article was now no longer being considered but had to be resubmitted as a February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 51 This new action method can be applied to all aspects of recovery Workshops and/or training 2009 Treasure Island, Florida *AN\u0000\u0012 \u0014\u0000\u0000\u0011\u0015\u0000#%\u0000(OURS Houston, Texas stops aggravated and upset by this process. Delays in getting feedback from a journal are not uncommon. This is particularly concerning for faculty working to publish prior to tenure decisions. Another counselor, \"M.A.,\" reported that she submitted an article to a prestigious journal and it took longer than seven months to get feedback. When she questioned the timeliness of the editorial board reviews, the editors informed her that this was an unusual situation and difficulties had been encountered in getting the reviews back on time. T wo years later, when submitting another article to the same journal, she again waited more than seven months to receive feedback. When she questioned the editor again, she was informed that the delay was \"highly unusual,\" the result of extra work associated with attending the national conference. Although editors assign deadlines (gen- erally two months) when giving reviewers manuscripts, these deadlines often pass without a review being returned. When this amount of time is taken for an initial review, authors get concerned about the timeliness of their publications. New re- search on a topic could be published or a similar article appear in another journal while the author is held captive, unable to submit elsewhere, awaiting an editorial decision. This time lag also causes dif-ficulties for academics who must report on their publication progress each year, which can be particularly distressing when a professor is on the path to tenure and promotion. Changes in editorial board positions can cause unforeseen delays as well. For example, \"J.K.,\" an associate professor of mental health counseling, reported his frustration at having a paper accepted for publication with revisions, only to be told upon resubmitting it that a new journal editor had taken over in the interim. The paper was not \"in line\" with the new editor's vision for the journal, and the new editor did not agree with the previous editors' decision to publish the article. J.K. had no recourse and was forced to accept this decision. Although J.K. felt this was unethical behavior, the ACA Code of Ethics does not mention this type of situation, essentially deeming the behavior professionally acceptable. Another area with which authors struggle is in receiving feedback on manuscripts. The generally accepted standard for manuscripts is three reviewers. \"G.A.,\" a counselor trying to publish a paper, explained that two of three reviewers made suggestions but gave her manuscript a favorable review and recommended its publication, while the third was quite antagonistic and recommended rejecting the manuscript. The editor declined to accept the paper, leaving G.A. confused. How did the editor decide to reject it when two of the three reviewers' comments were positive? Additionally, reviewers' comments often range from thoughtful, helpful analyses of manuscripts, including excellent suggestions for improvements, to comments that are primarily grammatical or technical rather than content oriented.52 | Counseling T oday | February 2009Editors' perspectives The struggles authors often endure with the publication process are also experienced at times by journal editors. Editors report that delays in getting feedback to authors are often due in part to the failure of some editorial board members to return manuscripts on time. W. Bryce Hagedorn, former editor of the Journal of Addictions & Offender Counseling, says delays generally occur when reviewers don't communicate their needs. \"The biggest problem was when reviewers didn't tell me they couldn't do a review,\" he says. This delays feedback to the author, even if the other reviewers have submitted their work on time. To assist with the professional requirements of being a reviewer, Hagedorn created guidelines for members of the editorial board. This \"contract\" clearly outlined expectations and responsibilities and cited how a reviewer's unprofessional behavior could result in removal from the editorial board. Scott McGowan, a former two-term editor of the Journal of Counseling & Development, also struggled at times with reviewers. He noted the delicate balancing act in putting pressure on editorial board members to return their work in a timely manner, while also understanding that they are performing this work on a volunteer basis and are oftentimes busy with other priorities. Reviewing a typical manuscript can take several hours depending on its complexity and content. Publications Committee reaction The ACA Publications Committee is a standing committee responsible for the oversight of ACA publications, including journals published under its imprint, and the approval of all texts published by ACA. Because of the mandate given to the committee, its members felt a special obligation to address concerns in the acceptance process for journal articles. At the 2007 ACA Annual Conference in Detroit, the Publications Committee, then chaired by Maureen Kenny of Florida International University, took up these issues. Specifically, it discussed the responsibility that all participants \u2014 journal editors, reviewers, publishers and authors \u2014 share in maintaining a publishing process of the highest integrity. This extended from the timeliness of reviews, to citing the most up-to-date research, to the use of recent data sets. The Publications Committee believes implied ethical obligations exist for all parties involved in publication, even though there are no explicit ethical directives stemming from the ACA Code of Ethics. Therefore, the committee put together a task force (which included Kenny and current committee chair Paul Peluso of Florida Atlantic University) to solicit input and draft a statement of values related to the publishing activity of ACA and its members. In gathering information, Kenny and Peluso were surprised to find that no similar professional association \u2014 either with or without in-house publishing branches \u2014 had created any published statements regarding the obligations of its members involved in the publishing process. A draft of the Publication Values of the American Counseling Association was presented to the Publications Committee and the ACA Council of Editors for journals in the summer of 2007. Feedback was solicited and incorporated. In fall 2007, the ACA Governing Council approved the final version that is reprinted below. (The values statement can also be downloaded from the ACA website at counseling.org/publications.) Publication Values of the American Counseling Association The goal of scholarly and professional writing is to advance the profession through the dissemination of new research, knowledge and information to counselors and consumers. Consistent with this goal is the idea of providing accurate, authentic, unduplicated material in the most expedient manner possible so that it might be incorporated and implemented by counselors. In order to accomplish this, all counselors involved in the publication process must commit to the highest standards of professionalism. Specifically, this means that: n Editors and publishers create and ad- here to processes that are fair, profes-sional and timely for the production of journals, books and other published materials. n Editorial board members and review- ers provide feedback that is thorough and impartial in order to provide authors with the means to publish the highest quality material. Central to this process is providing reviews within the time span outlined by the editor or publisher. n Authors present information or data that is current, timely and relevant, as well as in compliance with the policies set forth in Section G of the ACA Code of Ethics for the publication of material. n Authors should address ACA's target audience \u2014 counselors \u2014 and use the terms counselor and counseling throughout their publications in keep- ing with ACA's mission of advancing the counseling profession. n Counselors apply the information or knowledge in a way that is either con- sistent with the original intent of the author, or modifies the information or knowledge in a way that advances the profession by creating new opportuni- ties for growth. Best practices for publishing in an ACA journalEditors: In order to expedite the review process, editors are encouraged to \"pre-screen\" all manuscripts and reject those that do not appear to meet minimum scholarly standards for publishing (e.g., not in APA format, poor methodology, not scientific). Editors are encouraged to remind editorial board members when the deadline for a review is approaching (i.e., automated e-mail) in order to ensure compliance with the time line. Manuscripts that are accepted with revisions should be given a return date for resubmission. This would serve as a deadline for authors to return the manuscript so that timeliness of information can be observed. Editors should be able to communicate a reasonable time line to authors withFebruary 2009 | Counseling T oday | 53 GetaMaster'sin APPLIED ATLYNNUNIVERSITY INBOCARATON, FLA. Choose from intended publication date of their work. Editors are encouraged to provide feedback to authors within a timely manner (e.g., three months) in order to keep the literature current and to allow authors to work on revisions or resubmissions if necessary. Editors should generate a yearly report including the number of manuscripts received and the disposition of those manuscripts (e.g., rejected, accepted with revisions). The average publication time, from acceptance to publication, should also be included in this report. This information should be available to the public. This report could also include a listing of citation indexes for the journal, indicating the frequency of citation for the journal (i.e., the Impact Factor) if known. Editors are encouraged to publish a time line for articles that are accepted at the end of the article. These dates would include the date received, the date the revision was received and the date of publication. Editors are encouraged to ask authors to update citations and the reference list in terms of any new key publications relative to their topic after a manuscript is accepted. It is recommended that this request be sent to authors at least two months prior to the submission of a complete, final issue to ACA so that authors have time to respond. This procedure will ensure that despite the lapse of time between acceptance and publication, manuscripts cite the most current literature possible. Updated articles submitted after the editor's deadline will not be accepted if the final issue has been sent to ACA. Editorial board members: Members of an editorial board, or guest reviewers, are encouraged to sign a commitment letter whereby they agree to complete reviews in a timely manner (e.g., one month) or suffer potential removal from the board. Editorial board members should provide comprehensive and clear written feedback, both positive and constructive to authors, in order to facilitate understanding of the editorial decision. This will also assist authors in improving their work for future publication and improve the scholarship of the field in general. Editorial board members should only accept those manuscripts for review for which they are competent to review, indicating a relative expertise in that area. Authors: Authors are advised to produce manuscripts that provide current reviews of the literature. Authors are encouraged to become familiar and adhere to guidelines for submission for the journal in which they seek publication. Adherence to guidelines set forth by the editors will greatly facilitate the submission and acceptance process. The publication values statement is to be used with all peer-reviewed publications of ACA, and all counselors are encouraged to adopt the spirit of the values as they pursue publication of their scholarly work or participate in the publication process as editors, reviewers or consumers. \"I fully support the ACA Publications Committee values statement,\" McGowan says. \"Some of the requirements will cause extra work for editors, already overburdened, but the payoffs outweigh the effort that this will entail.\" It is also hoped that the values statement will inspire our colleagues in related professions to consider adopting similar statements and putting them into practice to ensure the best work is presented in a rigorous and timely fashion for counselors, clients and the profession at large. w Note: The names of authors and journals have been withheld for reasons of privacy and professionalism. u Maureen C.

NCCA hired a management company three years ago as the association's membership grew and its responsibilities to the increased membership grew. Ami Parker: My initial involvement in NCCA came about because I attended the ACA Legislative Institute and then became the government relations member-at-large for NCCA. In the time I have been involved, we have been working on increasing our member services, specifically advocacy efforts and providing professional development. What significant challenges and/ or accomplishments has NCCA experienced in the last year or over the last several years? Terry Robinson: As an umbrella orga- nization that gives support to members of 15 divisions representing 15 different areas of counseling, NCCA faces the on- going challenge of addressing the needs of many types of counselors \u2014 school coun- selors, career counselors, mental health counselors, counselor educators, etc. Our challenge has been and continues to be supporting the profession of counseling in North Carolina, not just a single area of counseling. Ami Parker: In the last few years, we have started a professional journal. This journal gives counselors an opportunity to share their research with others. The editors are Henry Harris and Freida Brown. North Carolina is rich in counselor expertise, and it is a blessing that many accomplished counselors serve on the board of the journal. What are some of the issues that NCCA is focusing its efforts on at this time? Terry Robinson: Advocacy efforts, improving services and support to divisions, creating public awareness about the counseling profession, improving the NCCA website and providing educational opportunities for NCCA members and counselors throughout North Carolina. NCCA is sponsoring a variety of Education Sessions at the Charlotte conference. Would you care to highlight or comment on any of these offerings? Terry Robinson: NCCA leadership was excited to partner with ACA in choosing presenters for Education Sessions as well as for preconference Learning Institutes. Our goal was to identify a diverse range of topics as well as to present topics that address the needs of today's clients \u2014 for example, substance abuse, play therapy, family issues, military topics and grief, to name only a few. Ami Parker: We are excited about the high caliber of the Education Sessions sponsored by NCCA. I don't think I could select just a few to highlight. However, several of the presenters have presented at NCCA conferences in the past or the sessions are extensions of previous sessions. Based on the strong positive feedback from our conferences, it is an asset to offer these presentations to counselors nationwide. What does holding the ACA Conference in Charlotte mean to NCCA and to counselors throughout North Carolina? Terry Robinson: Holding the ACA Conference in Charlotte provides NCCA the opportunity to showcase the counseling profession in North Carolina as well as to network with counselors in North Carolina who are not currently NCCA members. It provides counselors in North Carolina and surrounding states the opportunity to experience a national conference and network with ACA leaders as well as the leadership of ACA national divisions. Ami Parker: To me, holding the ACA Conference in Charlotte is an opportunity to draw public attention to the counseling profession in North Carolina. Also, counselors in the state are given the opportunity to attend a conference with so many diverse professional development opportunities in a convenient location. NCCA is proud to cosponsor this event and thankful to ACA for its support as we plan for an incredible conference. What might counselors be surprised to know about NCCA, the state of North Carolina and/or the city of Charlotte? Ami Parker: I think many counselors, especially those in North Carolina, may be surprised that NCCA is celebrating its golden anniversary. Of course, we believe North Carolina is a beautiful state and that Charlotte is the best \"little\" big city in the United States. Charlotte is growing and adding mass transit but maintaining its commitment to hospitality and cleanliness. Here are some interesting tidbits about Charlotte: n It was the site of the country's first gold rush. n It is the second largest banking center in the nation behind New York City. n It has the highest per capita level of donations to the arts and art programs in the entire country. n It has a tremendous greenscape. T ree preservation is a top priority of city leaders, and Charlotte has one of the most extensive tree canopies of any large city. Terry Robinson: Another thing counselors might be surprised to know about NCCA is that unlike other counseling organizations in North Carolina, such as the North Carolina School Counselor Association or Licensed Professional Counselor Association of North Carolina, NCCA represents all counselors throughout the state, not just one type of counselor. We advocate for counselors to define themselves first as a \"counselor,\" then as a substance abuse counselor or a school counselor, for example. Any parting words? Terry Robinson: We are excited to partner with ACA in hosting this national conference. We welcome counselors from throughout North Carolina and from around the nation to Charlotte. w The ACA Annual Conference & Exposition, cosponsored by NCCA, will take place in Charlotte from March 19-23.

Counselors offered shovels, rakes, water, gloves and, perhaps most important, a compassionate presence. A counselor helped a woman riddled with guilt because her home was still standing to realize that it could provide a place for neighbors to support one another, share lunch or even just use the bathroom. Was the presence of counselors in the midst of the wildfire devastation an unusual situation \u2014 one unlikely to be experienced by most counseling professionals? Or was it an indication of emerging expectations on the profession \u2014 a reflection of the growing need for counselors to be prepared to provide emergency mental health assistance to any community following a natural or manmade disaster? Skills in the provision of disaster mental health services were not on the agenda in 2004 when the board of the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs established a Standards Revision Committee (SRC) to undertake development of standards that would define the counseling profession's knowledge base, skill sets and identity for eight years, reaching to July 2016. The CACREP Board charged the SRC with developing standards that would strengthen the identity of the counseling profession as well as prepare students to meet the current and future needs of consumers. SRC members committed themselves to a standards revision process that included the distribution of two drafts, presentations at numerous conferences and the review of hundreds of feedback forms. They met frequently to consider the potential impact of each draft standard on the resources of institutions, the objectives of program specialty areas and the time and financial obligations of students. The SRC planned to deliver a final draft for CACREP Board approval in June 2007. Then a complication presented itself in the form of the federal government. In July 2006, CACREP received an unexpected call from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) located in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ASPR serves as the HHS secretary's principal advisory staff on the protection of the civilian population during times of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. It was ASPR's task, assigned by the Office of the Vice President, to find a way of sustaining consistency and collaboration in emergency preparedness education across all health care disciplines, including mental health. Previous attempts, in the form of federal grants to a few major universities, had resulted in disparate outcomes with no staying power. Frustrated, some government officials were on the verge of creating curriculum requirements and imposing them on all programs that prepared health care workers. The ASPR staff, recognizing that such government heavy-handedness likely would heighten tensions between the federal government and higher education, sought another solution. In collaboration with Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, ASPR developed public health accreditation guidelines consistent with the National Response Framework. ASPR sought to achieve consistency and uniformity in preparedness education by encouraging educators from each health care discipline to follow these guidelines in developing disaster preparedness standards specific to their professions. ASPR invited CACREP to participate in its effort to hardwire consistent emergency preparedness standards into mental health care training and encouraged CACREP to apply for a grant that would support the development and promulgation of draft emergency preparedness competencies. CACREP paused. Was it appropriate for the government to impose its presence in this way? Did the issue of emergency preparedness merit delaying the final revision of the CACREP Standards? CACREP staff and Board members discussed the pros and cons of working with ASPR. The final decision to accept the grant reflected CACREP's vision statement that commits the organization to \"developing standards and procedures that reflect the needs of a dynamic, diverse and complex society.\" Grant negotiations went smoothly. CACREP respected the appropriateness of the federal government's role in establishing nationwide consistency in emergency preparedness education. In return, ASPR respected the autonomy of CACREP's protocol in promulgating draft standards. It was clear to both parties that CACREP would develop and disseminate but not promote the draft language, nor would CACREP commit to the inclusion of any emergency preparedness competencies in the final draft of its standards; feedback from the counseling community would determine the fate of the promulgated competencies. Research, interviews with government agencies and input from counselors who had been seasoned by multiple disaster deployments guided development of the draft standards. Experienced counselors stated emphatically that being \"willing and able\" was not enough; they emphasized that although many of the skills counselors possess would underpin their efforts as responders, additional knowledge and skills were required. To be of service, they said, counselors must understand the chain of command and communication mechanisms of New CACREP Standards frame counselors' skills in disaster responseCACREP Perspective - By Carolyn Beckett February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 59 Carolyn Beckett is the special proj- ects manager at CACREP . Contact CACREP at cacrep@cacrep.org. Letters to the editor: ct@counseling.orgthe interagency response team. In disaster settings, counselors must be intentional in strengthening individual and community resilience. In addition, counselors must be skillful in utilizing assessment, diagnosis and treatment strategies that are unique to emergencies and very different from clinical skills that are appropriate in an office setting. Experienced counselors also stressed the importance of employing self-care strategies to avoid compassion fatigue, burnout and secondary traumatization. CACREP received feedback on the draft standards through multiple venues. At regional and national conferences, every audience included constituents who were eager to relay their experiences as disaster mental health providers. Professors also related their students' interest in classes that addressed counselors' roles as responders. Members of every counseling specialty area voiced support for preparedness competencies in their program area standards. At the 2007 conference of the American Association of State Counseling Boards, Charles Figley, president and founder of the Green Cross Academy of T raumatology, praised the draft standards, publicly awarding CACREP an A plus for taking a proactive approach to the escalating frequency and magnitude of disasters. As feedback supporting the draft competencies mounted, so did the number of local, regional and global catastrophes. Deployed counselors assisted families displaced by flash floods in north Texas and Maine and by devastating tornadoes in Florida, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Georgia. They comforted families who lost loved ones when a major bridge carrying rush- hour traffic collapsed in Minneapolis. They provided pro bono services to students attending Northern Illinois University and Virginia Tech, respectively, in the months following campus shootings. To this day, counselors are offering services to the poorest and most vulnerable families along the Gulf Coast. In July 2008, the CACREP Board voted on the final version of the standards. Emergency preparedness competencies were included in both the core curriculum and program specialty area standards. The new standards will go into effect July 1, 2009. As institutions seek first-time or renewed CACREP accreditation, their applications will address their efforts to meet the new emergency preparedness standards. In this way, over time, CACREP-accredited counseling programs will graduate students who have integrated the knowledge and skills of emergency response into their professional identities. They will be prepared to serve on interdisciplinary response teams, including, according to Figley, deployment with the Green Cross Assistance Program in the United States and throughout the world. u (Carlos, use the logo you created) Celebrate your Branch's success by joining your colleagues at the 2009 Branch Awards Ceremony and Reception at the 2009 ACA Annual Conference & Exposition, Saturday, March 21 st at 3:00 p.m. Awards will be given in the following categories: Best Community Outreach Project/ ProgramAwards will be given in the following categories: n Best Community Outreach Project/Program n Best Leadership Development Program n Best Membership Service n Best Membership Recruitment Campaign n Best Journal n Best Newsletter The ACA Branch Awards Ceremony recognizes those branches that signifi cantly advance and enhance the counseling profession through excellent programs, increased membership, quality communications, and community involvement.

Holland Introduced personality types as critical component of career counseling John Holland, professor emeritus in the Department of Sociology in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University and a giant in the field of career counseling, died Nov. 27, 2008, at age 89. Holland, a member of the American Counseling Association and the National Career Development Association, developed a widely influential vocational classification system to help people better understand themselves and to better fit themselves to careers. Colleagues used such words as \"elegant\" and \"ingenious\" in describing his life work to classify vocational personality types and work environments. \"One would be hard-pressed to identify a person who has had a greater impact on career counseling theory and practice than John Holland,\" said Spencer Niles, codirector of the Center for the Study of Career Development and Public Policy, professor and department head of counselor education, counseling psychology and rehabilitation services at Penn State University and editor of the Journal of Counseling & Development. \"He created a system for organizing complex occupational structures and personality types into useful categories for career decision-making. His theory provided the raw material for a substantial number of researchers, and his measures provided the core tools used by an even greater number of practitioners.\" Holland's concept was to base vocational guidance on a client's resemblance to six distinct personality prototypes, known as RIASEC types (standing for Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising and Conventional), which became known as the Holland Codes. He theorized that once people identified their combination of personality types, they would be more likely to find a better career fit and would thus be happier workers. Holland identified himself as a mixture of artistic, social and investigative components, saying, \"I've got a relatively flat profile, actually. That makes you more versatile, complex and quite a bit confused.\" Holland's career was laced with his sense of humor, as noted by Mark Pope, a past president of both ACA and NCDA. \"I interacted professionally and personally with John Holland over the course of 20 years. He was a quick-witted, funny curmudgeon who led the modern evolution of Frank Parsons' and E.G. Williamson's trait-factor models for career counseling. His theory of types has been used by career counselors, vocational psychologists and the popular media to organize the basic human personality, career interests and work environments,\" said Pope, recipient of the NCDA Eminent Career Award in 2008. Added Brooke B. Collison, another past president of ACA, \"John Holland was the first person to put career development theory into a usable language that made sense for counselors and clients. He provided us with a great tool for dialogue with people of all ages.\" In a quote published in the Johns Hopkins newspaper The Gazette, Mark Presnell, director of the career center on the Johns Hopkins Homewood campus, said, \"Dr. Holland's theory and related research defined career counseling and interest assessment as practiced today. His work is utilized daily by many career counselors in academia, government and private practice. As a graduate student, I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Holland. In addition to being a brilliant academic, he was a warm individual who was willing to share his knowledge with new professionals.\" Holland was born in Omaha, Neb., in 1919. He earned his bachelor's degree in psychology, French and mathematics at the University of Omaha in 1942. He later received his doctorate in psychology from the University of Minnesota. In 1969, Holland became a professor at Johns Hopkins University, as well as director of the Center for Social Organization of Schools. He retired in 1980, yet kept working on his research. In 1997, he revised a third edition of his 1959 book, Making Vocational Choices: A Theory of Vocational Personalities and Work Environments. Holland received numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including the Extended Research Award from ACA and the Eminent Career Award from NCDA. He was also the recipient of the American Psychological Association's Award for Distinguished Scientific Applications of Psychology and the APA Award for Distinguished Professional Contributions to Knowledge. Holland's colleagues assert that his influence on the career counseling field will remain indelible. \"His ingenious formulation of vocational personality types and work environments brought the person-environment model for career counseling to its apex,\" said Mark Savickas, professor and chair of the Department of Behavioral Sciences at Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine. \"Furthermore, his typology strengthened the career counseling community by providing a textual tradition. The RIASEC knowledge system offers a vocabulary with which clients can articulate who they are and what they seek through working. Furthermore, Holland's hexagonal arrangement of the six types stands as an elegant simplifying taxonomy for organizing occupational information and for generating hypotheses for counseling and research. Although Holland has left us, we will speak his language for decades to come.\" Holland is survived by his children, Kay Sindoni, Joan Holland and Robert Holland; his grandchildren, Bianca Sindoni, Joey Sindoni, T ed Samuels, Eric Samuels and Lisa Samuels; his brother, Dick Holland; and his sister, Jean Holland. His wife, Elsie, and his brother, Bill Holland, predeceased him.

Esco Oberman. He served in the U.S. Navy and was stationed on the USS Des Moines in the Mediterranean. Richardson, a member of the American Counseling Association dating back to the early 1960s, was a professor at the University of North Texas for 19 years in the School of Community Service. He was also a licensed psychologist dedicated to bettering the lives of disabled individuals. Richardson received many national research awards in the area of rehabilita-tion counseling throughout his career. In 1997, the University of Iowa honored him with its Distinguished Alumnus Award. A prolific writer, Richardson also served as president of the Southern Association of Counselor Education and Supervision in 1989-1990.

EB-ACA Learning Institute covers conflict resolution in recoverySubmitted by Diana Pattillodpattillo1@hotmail.com The Learning Institute \"Romancing the Brain: Conflict Resolution in Recovery\" was held at the European Branch of ACA Annual Conference Nov. 8-9, 2008. Cynthia Moreno T uohy's presentation was a balanced mix of instruction, group discussion and structured and spontaneous role-play situations. All participants were involved in the process, which contributed to the overall success of the Learning Institute. Based on the cycle of violence, conflict resolution skills, communication styles and problem solving skills, this course is designed to break cycles of conflict to help guide clients to a point of self-sufficiency and healthy relationships. These skills can be utilized in parenting and intimate partner relationships, friendships and relationships that are work-related.division, region & Branch News February 2009 | Counseling T oday | 63We were introduced to the different functions of the limbic system, the seat of our instinctual behaviors and our \"fight or flight\" center. While this system is absolute centered, the cortex is creative centered. We learned how the brain works in conflict, how nurturing impacts problem solving and the importance of reworking the brain so that one works from the cortex. \"Romancing the brain\" is the process of moving ourselves and/ or others from the limbic system to the cortex where more thoughtful responses and activities reside. T uohy's \"chronogram,\" similar to the familiar time line, was introduced as a way to chart feelings. It identifies events, age at the time of events and feelings associated with the events. This tool is utilized to help develop an \"anger or conflict inventory,\" leading to creating paths to make changes. The goal is to get to win-win situations.

At the summer 2008 ACCA Leadership Retreat, the Executive Council reworked the ACCA mission statement to be more succinct. We are proposing the following new mission statement: \"The mission of the American College Counseling Association is to be the interdisciplinary and inclusive professional home that supports emerging and state-of-the-art knowledge and resources for counseling professionals in higher education.\" What is the current mission statement? \"ACCA is an association for those persons in higher education, to include colleges, universities, community and technical college settings, whose professional identity is counseling and whose purpose is fostering students' development. ACCA strives to support and enhance the practice of college counseling, to promote ethical and responsible professional practice, to promote communication and exchange among college counselors across service areas and institutional settings, to encourage cooperation with other organizations related to higher education and college student development, and to provide leadership and advocacy for the profession of counseling in higher education.\" Long and detailed, the Executive Council determined much of the current mission falls under our vision, goals, objectives and strategies \u2014 hence, the effort to develop a parsimonious statement.

Nevada, which became the 49th state to license counselors in June 2007, notified the first three Licensed Clinical Profession-al Counselors (LCPCs) in December that the Board of Examiners had accepted their applications for licensure. This means the state has now passed the point of licensing counselors in theory and has begun licens-ing them in practice, which is a big win for the entire counseling profession. The American Counseling Association and the American Mental Health Counsel-ors Association would like to thank all the individuals who worked to make this pos-sible and also extends its congratulations to the first LCPCs in Nevada. Counselors who would like more information about gaining licensure in Nevada can visit mar-riage.state.nv.us/ . California remains the only state yet to license counselors.
