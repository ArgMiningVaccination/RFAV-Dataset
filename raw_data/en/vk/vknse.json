Vaccines are approved for use in healthy animals. Health is the level of functional and metabolic efficiency of a living being. Any use of vaccines in animals with a recent history of disease must be considered extra-label use and requires a prescription. If you animal friends have had any kind of infection or inflammation in the past 6 months, they may not be considered healthy. Inflammation is a complex response to environmental stimulus.
