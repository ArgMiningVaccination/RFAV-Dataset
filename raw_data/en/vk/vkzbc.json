The role of complementary therapy in this instance is to help manage a client's symptoms that they may be experiencing from the aggressive cancer treatment. In 2000 Hodgson found using 12 patients who were in the palliative stage of cancer that there was 100% improvement in many areas of the lives of the participants within the group who were given reflexology, whereas the participants within the placebo group only reported an improvement of 67.6% within the same categories. The categories included their general mood, pain, mobility, tiredness, constipation, concentration and nausea. 2. Understand the role of complementary therapies in relation to orthodox treatment 3.

The reader will find that Buddhism is more of a philosophy than a religion that focuses on the mind as being the creator of illness and health. The reader will also find that Judaism, Baha'i, and Christianity are all religions that believe in one God, the creator of all. This paper lists various components that each of these faiths may use at one time or another to effect healing including prayer, meditation, chanting, the use of healers, etc. This paper also defines what is important to people Reflexology What is reflexology Reflexology is the theory that the human body can be healed from disease or imbalance through pressure to specific points on the hands, feet, and ears (http://www.doubleclickd.com/reflexology.html). This alternative form of healing is doubted by many, although there are studies that support its theory. Meditation is very difficult to describe and can only truly be explained once experienced. It is the practice of mental concentration leading ultimately through a sequence of stages to the final goal of spiritual freedom, nirvana. The purpose of Buddhist meditation is to free ourselves from the delusion and thereby put an end to both ignorance and craving. The Buddhists describe the culminating trance-like state as transient; final Nirvana requires the insight of wisdom. The exercises that are meant to develop wisdom involve meditation on the true nature of reality or the conditioned and unconditioned elements that make up all phenomena. The goal of meditation is to develop a concept in the mind. Two twenty-four minute Reiki sessions were completed at the children's home. In conclusion, decreased mean scores for outcome measures indicate the reiki therapy did decrease pain, anxiety, heart rate, and respiratory rate, but small sample size deterred statistical significance. This work suggests that complementary methods of treatment such as reiki may be beneficial to support traditional methods to manage pain and anxiety in these children. However, more research should be done to further validate the claims (Thrane et al., 2017, p. On a typical day, Jeff says he sees about 30 patients and they change around every 15 minutes. Everything in life is about balance. If you have a passion for something you must learn how to balance everything you're doing and be sure you are doing it well. We were given a small history lesson about Western and Eastern medicine. In the chiropractic world, Western medicine (what we use in the U.S.) believes when something is in pain the reason for the pain is the general area of where the pain originates. Conversely, in Eastern medicine (used everywhere else in the world) believes that pain is caused in harmony with the body. For example, in Eastern medicine, if someone is having pain in their knee, a chiropractor approaches the treatment as if the pain were originating from the neck on down to the knee and even below the knee to the person's feet. The second large topic of Jeff Varner's speech was acupunture. Acupuncture is a system of medicine that involves pricking the skin or tissues with needles, used to alleviate pain and to treat various physical, mental, and emotional conditions. Currently, an acupuncture is used to treat depression and stress. There are over 400 acupuncture sites located throughout the Reiki is an ancient healing art that has recently been re-discovered in Japan. With the resurrection of Reiki in this age of mass and almost instantaneous communication, word of its power is quickly gaining the attention of the mainstream world. The mode of transmission of Reiki energy from a Reiki practitioner to a recipient was originally believed, by those interested in this art, to be limited by physical proximity. The Reiki practitioner would place their hands gently on, or a few inches above the Reiki recipient's body. Upon further exploration of the potential of Reiki, \"sending\" the energy to the recipient or situation has proven to be just as beneficial as Reiki \"hands-on\" sessions. In fact, those who are too busy to carve out the time for a Reiki session can now go about their business while receiving the energy. Reiki Masters, such as myself, have directed Reiki energy to boardrooms, pets, surgical procedures, courtrooms, business offices, plants and even sporting events. Reiki distance energy One of the most important arms of the reiki is to make a person efficient, effective and energetic. In short I have discovered that touch therapies have great potential to result in significant cost savings to patients due to the fact that touch therapy is less expensive than pharmaceuticals and it is safe in comparison to prescription medicines in that contraindications such as drug dependency, allergic reaction, and long term side effects could be significantly diminished or totally eliminated. Therefore, this investigation has explored the use and benefits of various touch therapies throughout the human life span and has also examined research from wide-spread geographical regions which includes the development of touch modalities originating from several cultures. As a result, the healing modalities of healing touch, therapeutic touch, reiki, emotional freedom technique, acupressure, massage and others have been examined in detail. In addition succinct description of energetic anatomy of humans has been included, when appropriate, to bring clarity and deeper understanding as to how the touch therapies work. In order to fulfill the required University Outcomes, ethical considerations, social and global relevance, and Health and Wellness principles around the touch therapies have also been integrated into this A wide range of treatments exists under the umbrella term of 'complementary therapy'. Each treatment has its own unique theory and practice, which makes it difficult to offer a The workshop was conducted by Janna Moll, MA, Healing Touch Certified Practitioner, and President of Energy Medicine Specialist from Highland Ranch, CO. This workshop is endorsed by the Healing Touch Program, approved by the California Board of Registered Nursing for 19.5 hours of continuing education, and also awards a certificate of completion for non-nursing HT students such as myself. During this four day session, I was privileged to learn and also practice new techniques, which consisted of color therapy, sound therapy, aromatherapy and crystal/stone therapy applied in conjunction to HT techniques. For purposes of this study, I elect to omit aromatherapy, crystal/stone therapy, color therapy and sound therapy in order to focus more deeply on the therapeutic benefits of touch in the broader sense. This weekend of learning is my inspiration for the content of this study. Consequently, literature explores the uses and benefits of therapeutic touch throughout the human life span, in particular the more commonly known touch therapies such as healing touch, therapeutic touch, reiki, and limited number of touch therapies uncommonly known. This literature briefly explores the significance of touch during everyday human interaction and more importantly to me The Reiki Level 1 attunement was initially given in four separate attunements. There are some Reiki Masters who still teach using this method. However, many Reiki Masters provide the Level 1 attunement in one single attunement. Many experience physical symptoms of energy in their palms after the first attunement \u2014 including tingling, coolness or heat. Typically the Level 1 course also includes an overview of the history of Reiki, hand placements and self and group This process results in deactivation of the sympathetic nervous system, reducing the body's overall state of stress and excitability, and improving the patient's sense of well-being\" (Hamlin 2017). Aromatherapy causes the release of endorphins and serotonin and can potentially have an effect on every system in the body. A common essential oil that has been effective in reducing pain is lavender. Aromatherapy can be used in a variety of routes including inhalation, topical application or diffusion. Music therapy has many therapeutic effects including decreasing anxiety, improving mood, decreasing heart rate as well as blood pressure, and decreasing the perception of pain. Using the technique of guided imagery, the patient should focus on positive images to distract themselves from their pain. The process of acupuncture is invasive, and patients may shy away from it because of this. In acupuncture, specific points are stimulated in order to unblock a persons 'qi' or chi (Hamlin 2017). Acupressure is similar to What I Believe Reiki is not a belief system. Anyone who gets the full Reiki initiations can use the Reiki energy "}
