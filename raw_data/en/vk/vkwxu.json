Your immune system defends against external invaders\u2014think bacteria, viruses, and parasites\u2014and it patrols your body for internal troublemakers, such as cancer cells. It also regulates your level of tolerance to potential environmental triggers, such as allergens (including pollen, bee stings, grasses, wheat, peanuts, soy, and corn). When your immune system performs these two functions optimally, it helps keep you healthy. However, when your defenses don't do their job, or your body's tolerance level is too low or becomes overwhelmed, it makes you more vulnerable to [infections](https://amenclinics.com/conditions/lyme-disease/), cancer, and autoimmune disorders, as well as increasing your risk for [depression](https://amenclinics.com/conditions/depression/), [anxiety](https://amenclinics.com/conditions/anxiety-and-panic-attacks/), and even [psychosis](https://amenclinics.com/conditions/psychosis-and-early-psychosis/). Your immune system performs its important mission in 4 ways: - Identifies external invaders or internal cells or tissues that are misbehaving - Recruits your white blood cells to attack the bad guys - Tags and decimates external and internal problems - Remembers invaders and troublemakers in case they return The 4 Primary Immune System Functions - against the external environment: If it fails, you get an infection. - against the internal environment: If it fails, you get cancer. - against the external environment: If it fails, you get allergies. - against the internal environment: If it fails, you get an autoimmune disease. Immune disorders fall into one of 5 categories, all of which impact your brain health/mental health: 1. Immunodeficiency disorders: These disorders can either be present from birth or result from an illness, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which damages your immune system. [People with HIV](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/hiv-aids/index.shtml) are twice as likely to experience depression, and they also have an increased risk of anxiety and cognitive disorders, including dementia. 2. Allergies: When your immune system views neutral environmental \"visitors,\" such as pollen or pet dander, as enemies, it can lead to allergies, asthma, eczema, or even life-threatening consequences. In a [2018 study](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00133) including over 186,000 people, those with asthma, hay fever, and eczema were 66% more likely to develop psychiatric disorders compared with those without allergies. And [asthma](https://jech.bmj.com/content/69/2/123) has been shown to [increase the risk](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236137897_Chronic_Obstructive_Pulmonary_Disease_and_Asthma_and_the_Risk_of_Mild_Cognitive_Impairment_and_Dementia_A_Population_Based_CAIDE_Study) of dementia by 30%. 3. Cancers of the immune system: Leukemia and lymphomas are the most common forms of cancer affecting the immune system. Cancer of any kind has long been associated with detrimental changes in emotional health, and [research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pon.3372) shows that cancer patients are more likely to have a mental health issue than people without the disease. In fact, as many as [25% of cancer patients](https://doi.org/10.1093/jncimonographs/lgh026) have clinical depression. 4. Autoimmune disorders: When your immune system mistakes your own internal tissues for troublemakers and attacks them, it can create an autoimmune disorder. I typically refer to this as \"friendly fire.\" 5. Persistent infections: When you experience recurring infections, it may be an indicator of a compromised immune system.
