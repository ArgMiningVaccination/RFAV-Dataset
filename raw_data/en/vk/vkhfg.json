E.7Executive Summary Mathematica\u00ae Inc. xiii Executive Summary of the Early Assessment Report for the RETAIN Demonstration A. Introduction 1. Overview of RETAIN The Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network (RETAIN) demonstration is a collaborative effort between the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) to help workers with recently acquired injuries or illnesses remain in the labor force. The goal of RETAIN is to implement and build evidence on the effectiveness of early stay at work and return to work (SAW/RTW) interventions to help those who develop a potentially disabling condition. DOL and SSA awarded cooperative agreements to f ive state agencies to expand programs they began in Phase 1 of RETAIN. Each state's RETAIN pro gram model centered on early coordination of health care and employment -related services and supports to help injured or ill workers remain in the workforce . The RETAIN states differ ed in how they implement ed these services and supports to account for differences in their intended populations and the services available to support program outcomes. 2. Purpose of this report This report assesses the initial implementation of the RETAIN programs in five state-specific chapters. Each state began enrollment at a different time between November 2021 and March 2022. Our assessment of initial implementation covers the period through June 2022. The findings focus on (1) program partnerships and the environment surrounding RETAIN implementation and service delivery, (2) recruitment and enrollment of eligible workers, and (3) RETAIN implementation and service delivery during the initial months of enrollment and service delivery. It also identifies areas for continued monitoring and evaluation technical assistance. B. Data sources and analysis methods Data sources. We combin ed qualitative and quantitative data sources and methods to conduct the early assessments and generate the findings presented in this report. The qualitative data sources included program documents (states' Phase 2 applications and quarterly progress reports); published indicators; and semistructured interviews with RETAIN program administrators, staff, and partners conducted during virtual site visits. The quantitative data sources include d state-submitted enrollment and program service use data. Analysis methods. We developed a data abstraction template to guide the systematic review of each state's Phase 2 grant application and quarterly progress reports. We developed a structured template that aligned with our research questions to guide the analysis of the site visit data. For each state, we used the structured template to synthesize notes on specific topics from our interviews. To analyze the enrollment data, we generated descriptive statistics on enrollees' characteristic s. To analyze the service use data, we produced descriptive statistics on variables reflecting treatment enroll ees' receipt of RTW coordination services and other RTW services. Executive Summary Mathematica\u00ae Inc. xiv C. Findings 1. RETAINWORKS Program partnerships. The Kansas Department of Commerce was the lead agency for the state's RETAIN program (RETAINWOR KS). The program catchment area is the entire state of Kansas, including 105 counties, organized into five workforce development areas. The lead health care partner, Ascension Via Christi, led enrollment and provide d RTW coordination services to all treatment enrollees who live d in the pilot workforce development area. The lead workforce partner, Workforce Alliance of South -Central Kansas, support ed enrollment and provide d workforce and social services to treatment enrollees who lived in the pilot workforce de velopment area. At the time of the site visit, enrollment and service delivery took place only in the pilot workforce development area. The lead partners helped health care and workforce partners launch RETAIN services in the other workforce development areas across the state. Three employer partners helped develop outreach messaging and employer education. The lead partners faced challenges developing partnerships across the multiple workforce development areas, which slowed the statewide implementation of RETAINWOR KS. These challenges included building relationships with additional partners and completing paperwork to formalize partners' roles in RETAINWOR KS. Program leaders and staff expressed a strong commitment to mentor ing new partners and holding frequent meetings to support communication across the partners. Early enrollment. The intended population comprise d adults ages 18 to 65 who were employed or currently in the labor force and ha d experienced the onset or worsening of one of the following (work- or non-work -related) conditions: a musculoskeletal injury , a mental health disorder, a chronic disease, or another newly diagnosed illness or injury that affected their employment . During the first nine months of enrollment, RETAINWOR KS enrolled 39 workers, which is 1 percent of the program's goal of enrolling 4,000 workers. In addition to the slow statewide implementation of the program, a key enrollment challenge was the lengthy informed consent process, which might discourage workers from enro lling. The primary sources of referrals we re Ascension Via Christi medical providers and other occupational health providers. Program leaders expected enrollment to increase as RETAIN WOR KS launche d in additional workforce development areas across the state. If the program's enrollment continues at the current level, however, there is a high chance the evaluation will fail to detect a true effect that is large enough to be important to policymakers. As expected, treatment and control enrollees have similar baseline characteristics. The average age of the treatment enrollees was 4 1. Most treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition (about 72 percent). Treatment enrollees had an average of 39 days between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrollment. Most treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment (89 percent) , with the highest proportion of treatment enrollees holding a production, transportation, or material moving occupation (39 percent) . Many last worked within one month of enrollment (78 percent), and most last worked within three months of enrollment (95 percent). RETAINWORKS implementation and service delivery. Many treatment enrollees received RETAINWOR KS services beyond enrollment. RETAINWORKS reported treatment enrollees received employment services and did not report any workplace accommodations. Program staff reported most Executive Summary Mathematica\u00ae Inc. xv treatment enrollees request ed financial support to augment lost income while taking time off from work rather than employment services. RTW coordinators and employment counselors worked as a team to provide medical, social, and employment -related support to treatment enrollees. They faced initial challenges understanding their roles in the processes involved in delivering RTW coordination services. An in-person meeting held in April 2022 helped RTW coordinators and employment counselors better understand their roles and the processes for enrolling and delivering RETAINWOR KS services. Enrollees' reluctance to permit RTW coordinators to communicate with their employer s might limit the contrast between services to the treatment and control groups. Treatment enrollees expressed concerns about being fired if the employment counselor reache d out to their employer to discuss their need for a workplace accommodation or alternate work assignment. Lack of coordination with enrollees' employers could have limited the implementation of workplace accommodations that support their staying at or returning to work. Program staff described challenges engaging providers in completing the required medical provider training. They also noted RTW coordinators received delayed communication from providers. Despite these challenges, program data from RETAINWORKS indicated all treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators communicated with their medical providers at least once. The rate of completion of medical provider training was not clear. A delay in medical provider training could have resulted in low use of best practices in occupational medicine early in their treatment of a patient who had an injury or illness , which could prove to be a barrier to their staying at or returning to work. This could, in turn, reduce the impact of RETAINWOR KS. 2. RETAIN Kentucky Program partnerships. The Kentuck y Office of Vocational Rehabilitation was the lead agency for RETAIN Kentucky (RETAIN KY). Two lead health care partners, UK Healthcare and the University of Louisville, supported enrollment. The lead workforce partner, the University of Kentucky Human Development Institute, led enrollment and provide d RTW coordination services to all treatment enrollees and employment services to those who were unemployed or seeking a job transition. RETAIN KY partnered with four organizations to encourage referrals. The program catchment area wa s the entire state of Kentucky, including 120 counties. The lead agency and lead workforce partner had a long -standing relationship and met regularly to coordinat e. Early enrollment. The intended population comprise d workers who ha d an injury or illness that was not work -related, who were employed or who ha d been employed within the p ast 12 months, and who made at least $1,000 in one of those months. This focus complemented Kentucky's workers' compensation system, whi ch support ed SAW/RTW for workers with work -related injuries or illnesses. During the first nine months of enrollment, RETAIN KY enrolled 200 workers, which was 6 percent of its goal of enrolling 3,200 workers. Enrollment challenges included reaching potential enrollees to confirm their eligibility, determining whether it was too early in a potential enrollee's recovery to benefit from RETAIN KY, and convincing potential enrollees of the benefits of RETAIN KY. Clinical support staff (such as nurses and social workers) at the two lead health care partners we re the primary sources of referrals. Program staff and partners expect ed referrals and enrollment to increase after Executive Summary Mathematica\u00ae Inc. xvi the health care partners embedded a referr al to RETAIN KY into the electronic medical record, which would enable clinical support staff and medical providers to refer patients during appointments . If the program's enrollment continues at the current level, however, there is a high chance the evalu ation will fail to detect a true effect large enough to be important to policymakers. As expected, treatment and control enrollees had similar baseline characteristics. The average age of the treatment enrollees was 4 5. Nearly half of treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a condition that did not fall under RETAIN's four identified primary diagnosis categories. RETAIN KY implementation and service delivery. Most treatment enrollees established an RTW plan. Fewer, about one -third, received employment services, and 20 percent received a workplace accommodation. Program staff reported RTW coordinators referred many treatment enrollees for unmet social needs that prevent ed them from staying at or returning to work, such as mental health conditions, substance use, food insecurity, and homelessness. RTW coordinators received intensive ongoing training on an evidence -based vocational case management approach and br ought a diverse set of personal and professional backgrounds to their roles. They regularly consult ed one an other and other experts, such as an assistive technology specialist, a peer mentor, and a mental health consultant who was an expert on mental health and substance use disorder s. RTW coordinators held weekly case reviews with provider champions. Treatment enrollees' reluctance to sign release-of -information forms permitting their RTW coordinator to access their medical record s and communicate with their employer s and medical provider s might limit the contrast between services to the treatment and control groups. Program staff reported treatment enrollees were hesitant to sign the releases because of concerns about providing the RTW coordinators with access to their medical records and identity the ft. In some cases, RTW coordinators established trust with the enrollee over the first few meetings, so the enrollee agreed to sign the release. If enrollees did not agree to sign the form, the RTW coordinators coached them to advocate for themselves. The approval process required for offering continuing medical education credits for completing the training delayed the medical providers' training. Despite this delay, RTW coordinators communicated with a medical provider at least once for many treatment en rollees. The delay in medical provider training might have resulted in low use of best practices in occupational medicine early in their treatment of a patient who ha d an injury or illness , which could prove to be a barrier to their staying at or returning to work . This could, in turn, reduce the impact of RETAIN KY. 3. Minnesota RETAIN Program partnerships. The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development was the lead agency for Minnesota RETAIN (MN RETAIN). The lead health care partner, the Mayo Clinic, led enrollment and provide d RTW coordination services to all treatment enrollees. The lead workforce partner, Workforce Development Inc., provide d job transition services and financial support to treatment enrollees as needed. MN RETAIN had one employer champion who provide d transitional work opportunities to treatment enrollees and promote d MN RETAIN among employees and other employers . The program catchment area was the entire state of Minnesota, including 87 counties. At the time of the virtual site visit, MN RETAIN was establishing contracts with three medical provider organizations and one workforce development service provider to expand services across the state. Executive Summary Mathematica\u00ae Inc. xvii Program partners faced initi al coordination challenges resulting from different organizational missions and cultures and not having established relationships before working together to implement MN RETAIN. Program leaders, staff, and partners described a shared commitment to MN RETAIN and a meeting structure that support ed program -wide communication as helping to overcome coordination challenges. Early enrollment. The intended population comprise d adults ages 18 and older who were employed or currently in the labor force and ha d exper ienced the onset or worsening of an injury or illness (work- or non-work -related) that affect ed their employment. This include d workers who had an invasive procedure (including surgery) within the past 12 weeks or who anticipat ed one within 8 weeks. Durin g the first seven months of enrollment, MN RETAIN enrolled 283 workers, which was 9 percent of its goal of enrolling 3,200 workers . A key enrollment challenge was that eligible workers frequently d id not attend their first scheduled appointment to complete enrollment. MN RETAIN's continuous quality improvement committee focused on overcoming this challenge. The Mayo Clinic had a patient registry used by designated recruitment staff to identify potentially eligible patients; this was the primary source of referrals. P rogram leaders and staff expect ed referrals and enrollment to increase as a result of the time and resources they invested in engag ing medical providers, employers, and diverse communities throughout the state . If enrollment continues at the current pace, however, it is likely the evaluation will fail to detect a true effect large enough to be important to policymakers. As expected, treatment and control enrollees had similar baseline characteristics . The average age of the treatment enrollees was 44. Most treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition (67 percent). Treatment enrollees had an average of 32 days between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrollment. M ost treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment (92 percent) , with the highest proportion of treatment enrollees holding a management, professional, or related occupation (42 percent). Many treatment enrollees last worked withi n one month of enrollment (69 percent), and almost all last worked within three months of enrollment (97 percent). MN RETAIN implementation and service delivery. All treatment enrollees received MN RETAIN services beyond enrollment, and almost all received employment services. MN RETAIN did not report any workplace accommodations. Program leaders and staff described the RTW coordinators as having diverse backgrounds and working closely with one an other to deliver services . The RTW coordinators met daily to discuss cases and brainstorm solutions to challenges, and they communicate d throughout the day to provide one another with support as needed. RTW coordinators refer red enrollees to an employment counselor at the lead workforce development partner if they identif ied that the enrollee had a need for workforce development services or financial support. Program staff reported RTW coordinators and the employment counselor received positive feedback from treatment enrollees about their experiences in MN RETAIN. Program staff noted RTW coordinators faced challenges engaging treatment enrollees' employers. Most enrollees g ave RTW coordinators permission to communicate with their employers, but when an RTW coordinator call ed an employer to tel l them their employee had enrolled in MN RETAIN, most employers expressed a preference for communicating directly with their employee rather than through the RTW coordinator. Program leaders and staff described a comprehensive strategy for engaging employers, which might improve their willingness to communicate with the RTW coordinator. Executive Summary Mathematica\u00ae Inc. xviii Program leaders reported engaging providers in the medical provider training w ent slower than planned. At the time of the site visit, no medical providers had completed the training. In addition, only 10 percent of treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators communicated with their medical providers at least once. L ack of provider participation in MN RETAIN training and communication with treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators m ight have resulted in low use of best practices in occupational medicine early in a medical provider's treatment of enrollees who ha d an injury or illness , which could have been a barrier to their staying at or returning to work. This could , in turn, reduce the impact of MN RETAIN. 4. Ohio RETAIN Program partnerships. The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services wa s the lead agency for Ohio RET AIN (OH RETAIN) . The lead health care partner, Mercy Health, led enrollment and provide d RTW coordination services to all treatment enrollees. The lead workforce partner s, the Local Workforce Development Boards , provide d career and retraining services to treatment enrollees as needed. Another workforce partner, Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities , provide d vocational rehabilitation services to referred treatment enrollees and consult ed with employers on work accommodations for treatment enrollees as needed . The program catchment area wa s three regions in Ohio : Youngstown, Toledo, and Cincinnati. Program leaders and staff were overwhelmingly positive about partner coordination. OH RETAIN benefitted from the lead agency and workforce partners having long-standing relationships. Program partners said establishing a memorandum of understanding between partners, having open lines of communication, establishing clear workflows (such as intra -agency referral processes), and drawing on partners' areas of expertise helped coordination efforts. Early enrollment. The intended population comprise d adults ages 18 to 65 who were employed or in the labor force and ha d experienced the onset or worsening of a non-work -related musculoskeletal or cardiovascular injury or illness in the past three months. In addition, they must have had a medical provider employed by the lead health care partner who had completed OH RETAIN training . During the first six months of enrollment, OH RETAIN enrolled 61 2 workers, which was 18 percent of its goal of enrolling 3,500 workers. Program leaders and staff cited a clear division of responsibilities among staff involved in the screening and recruitment process that worked well in contributing to increasing the enrollment rate. This process included a dedicated severity review during which nurses who ha d clinical expertise identified patients who were most likely to be good candidates for the program, thereby increasing the enrollment rate. The primary source of referrals wa s a set of reports program s taff generated from the electronic medical record listing patients with specified musculoskeletal or cardiovascular conditions who had an office visit the previous day. The nurses who conduct ed the severity review generated these reports daily and reviewed listed patients' medical records to assess eligibility. As expected, treatment and control enrollees had similar baseline characteristics. The average age of the treatment enrollees was 45. Most treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a muscu loskeletal condition (93 percent). Treatment enrollees had an average of 30 days between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrollment. Many treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment (81 percent) , with the highest proportion of treatment enrollees holding a service occupation (43 percent). Many treatment enrollees last worked within one month of enrollment (71 percent), and most last worked within three months of enrollment (86 percent). Executive Summary Mathematica\u00ae Inc. xix OH RETAIN implementation and service delivery. Many treatment enrollees received OH RETAIN services beyond enrollment, but OH RETAIN did not report employment services for any treatment enrollees. About 15 percent of treatment enrollees received a workplace accommodation. Program leaders and staff noted RTW coordinators' experience, training, and communication facilitate d delivery of RTW coordination service s. All RTW coordinators were experienced case managers who previously worked in fields ranging from behavioral health to hospice to extended care. The RTW coordinator team dr ew on this diversity of case management experience and the different areas of coordinators' expertise. In addition, OH RETAIN had a dedicated social work team for addressing treatment enrollees' social needs. According to program leaders and staff, medical provider training went as planned. For workers to be eligible for OH RETAIN enrollment, their medical provider must have been enrolled in OH RETAIN, meaning the ir provider agreed to participate in the program and received OH RETAIN training. All treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators communicated with their medical providers at least once. Workers must have given permission to RTW coordinators to communicate with their medical provider s and employer s to enroll in OH RETAIN. Many treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators communicated with their employer s at least once, and program staff reported employers were receptive to discussing SAW/RTW plan options with RTW coordinators. OH RETAIN experienced low treatment enrollee engagement with workforce services. Although treatment enrollees were willing to receive referrals to these services, after workforce partners contacted them, they often indicate d they were not ready to participate in these services while they focused on adjusting to the impact of their injury or illness on their life . Program partners suggested enrollees' readiness for workforce services m ight take more time than the OH RETAIN service delivery period allow ed. 5. Vermont RETAIN Program partnerships. The Vermont Department of Labor was the lead agency for Vermont RETAIN (VT RETAIN). OneCare Vermont, the lead health care partner, recruited primary care practices to participate in the clustered random assignment evaluation. Dartmouth Health support ed enrollment and provide d RTW coordination services to all treatment enrollees. VT RETAIN d id not have a separate lead workforce partner. The Vermont Dep artment of Labor planned to hire staff to provide VT RETAIN employment services. The program catchment area wa s the entire state of Vermont, including 14 counties. Program staff described initial coordination challenges, including clarifying roles and reporting structures, communicating across different professional backgrounds , and making decisions across partners. They noted the benefit of having program staff dedicated to supporting coordination across partners and organizing program staff into focused w ork groups that track ed progress on implementation milestones and report ed monthly to a leadership committee. Both strategies helped overcome the initial coordination challenges. Early enrollment. The intended population comprise d adults ages 18 and older who were employed or currently in the labor force and ha d experienced the onset or worsening of an injury or illness (work- or non-work -related) that affected their employment. Executive Summary Mathematica\u00ae Inc. xx During the first four months of enrollment , VT RETAI N enrolled 3 8 workers, which was 2 percent of its goal of enrolling 2,040 workers. Distinct from other RETAIN programs, VT RETAIN used a cluster random assignment model. In this model, Mathematica assign ed participating primary care practices to the treatm ent or control group. The burden of the COVID -19 pandemic on participating practices led them to delay implementing recruitment and screening of potential enrollees. Enrollment will have to increase significantly to have enough enrollees to draw conclusion s about the impact of the program on the treatment enrollees. The primary source of referrals wa s patient self -screening at participating primary care practices. Practices alerted patients to the screening by placing VT RETAIN promotional materials (such as posters, postcards, and fact sheets) in waiting and exam rooms. VT RETAIN provided materials for practices to implement the pre -screening method of their choosing, including collecting paper self -screeners, prompting patients to pre -screen on tablets, or including QR codes on promotional materials to enable patients to access the pre- screener on their phones. VT RETAIN d id not have electronic medic al record agreements with practices that would allow recruitment staff to use the record to review patients' medical records for a more active screening approach. As expected, treatment and control enrollees had similar baseline characteristics. Just under half of treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition (44 percent) . The average age of the treatment enrollees was 48. Treatment enrollees had an average of 80 days between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrollment. Many treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment (61 percent) , with the highest proportion of treatment enrollees holding a service occupation (28 percent) . Just under half of treatment enrollees were currently working or worked within one week of enrollment (45 percent). VT RETAIN implementation and service delivery. VT RETAIN provide d RTW coordination services to all treatment enrollees and referrals to employment and social services as needed. About 60 percent of treatment enrollees received VT RETAIN services beyond enrollment. VT RETAIN reported 50 percent of treatment enrollees received workplace accommodations and 17 percent received employment services. RTW coordinators had access to recorded trainings on a range of topics, such as Vermont's economic conditions, the state's electronic data capture system, and the resources available to support treatment enrollees. Program leaders and staff described RTW coordinators' diverse professional backgrounds and interpersonal skills as facilitating RTW coordination service delivery. In addition to their caring dispositions, R TW coordinators benefited from a mix of expertise on the team, including backgrounds in nursing, employment services, and social work. RTW coordinators attended weekly case review meetings that provide d an opportunity to consult a multidisciplinary RTW exp ert team that included a range of medical specialists and social service providers. The contrast between workforce services that will be available to treatment and control enrollees is not yet clear. At the time of the site visit, VT RETAIN planned to hire workforce development staff to focus on engaging employer s and integrating employment services into VT RETAIN. Though treatment and control enrollees have access to the same workforce development services, RTW coordinators can help ensure treatment enrollees connect to appropriate services. The health care lead deliver ed in-person and live online trainings to participating primary care practices to increase awareness of VT RETAIN, the importance of work for health, and how to implement screening into practice workflows. Through conversations with participating practices, program staff learned Executive Summary Mathematica\u00ae Inc. xxi medical providers were eager for information about referrals, resources, and best practices to support patients , as well as opportunities to receive continuing medical education credits. D. Conclusion Our assessment of states' experiences with the initial implementation of the RETAIN programs shows the progress states made and the complexities of the demonstrations. Most notably, enrollment was low in four of the five states. In addition, three states were slow to engage medical providers in training. Three states revealed potential concerns with the service contrast and ensuring that treatment enrollees receiv ed interv ention services that were distinct from the services received by control enrollees. Two states reported challenges applying eligibility criteria. This page has been left blank for double -sided copying . Chapter I. Introduction Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 1 I. Introduction Each year , more than 2 million workers in the United States leave the labor force, at least temporarily, because of a medical condition or illness (Hollenbeck 2015). Many of these workers fall through the cracks in the current support system and exit the workforce permanently. Exits from the workforce can lead to subsequent adverse effects on standard of living (Ben-Shalom and Burak 2016; Schimmel and Stapleton 2012) and well -being ( Ben-Shalom et al. 2018; Michaud et al. 2016 ). Without steady income from employment, these workers and their families m ight turn to public supports such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicare, and Medicaid. The Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network (RETAIN) d emonstration is a collaborative effort between the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) to help workers with recently acquired injuries and illnesses remain in the labor force. The goal of RETAIN is to implement and build evidence on the effectiveness of e arly stay at work and return to work (SAW/RTW) interventions to help those who develop a potentially disabling condition. The interventions in the RETAIN demonstration sought to influence the following outcomes of workers: Employment: to increase employment retention and labor force participation of individuals who acquired or were at risk of developing disabilities that inhibited their ability to work Reliance on disability programs: to reduce long-term work disability among program participants, including the need for SSDI and SSI To influence these outcomes, DOL and SSA awarded cooperative agreements to five state agencies to continue and expand programs they began in Phase 1 of RETAIN . The ultimate purpose of the demonstration is to validate and bring to scale evidence-based interventions that support ed injured or ill workers in remaining at or returning to work. A. Purpose of the e arly assessment r eport This report presents findings that address research questions related to the initial implementation of the RETAIN programs, included in five state-specific chapters. These findings assess early implementation focused on (1) program partne rships and the environment surrounding RETAIN implementation and service delivery, (2) recruitment and enrollment of eligible workers, and (3) RETAIN implementation and service delivery during the initial months of enrollment and service delivery . The process analysis report, to be submitted in December 2023, will provide summative implementation findings after the states have had time to fully implement their RETAIN programs. B. The RETAIN program All RETAIN pro gram models focus ed on early coordination of health care and employment -related supports and services to help injured or ill workers remain in the workforce . The RETAIN states differ ed in how they were implementing these supports and services to account for differences in their intend ed populations and services available to support program outcomes. Nonetheless, certain services and supports were central to all state RETAIN programs . Chapter I. Introduction Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 2 1. Program model The RETAIN program model builds on key features of the Washington State Center for Occ upational Health and Education (COHE) model, for which prior evaluations demonstrated positive impacts (Wickizer et al. 2011 , 2018 ; Franklin et al. 2015) . The key components of the COHE model include care coordination, occupational health best practices, r egular provider training and performance feedback, provider incentives, and community outreach (Wickizer et al. 2004). In addition to the care coordination and provider training components, RETAIN emphasized access to employment- related services and suppor ts. This include d providing support for workplace -based interventions and assistance with retraining and rehabilitation if a treatment enrollee c ould no longer perform their job. The RETAIN programs follow ed a core program model (Exhibit I.1). Program comp onents central to the model include d medical provider services and RTW coordination services. Other components of the model could vary by program or treatment enrollee. Exhibit I.1 . RETAIN program components Service category Program component Definition Medical provider services Training medical providers Training delivered to medical providers cover ed occupational medicine best practices and alternatives to opioids for pain management. Incentivizing medical providers The program p rovided incentives to medical providers for using occupational medicine best practices and alternatives to opioids for pain management. RTW coordination services Coordinating RTW services The program c oordinat ed the delivery of medical and employment services, including developing and implementing a n RTW plan. An RTW coordinator usually led the coordination of RTW services. Communicating among parties involved in RTW plan This component involved communicating among all RETAIN parties about the treatment enrollee returning to work. This communication should have occurred early in delivering RETAIN services to support the treatment enrollee in returning to work as soon as possible. Monitoring treatment enrollee s' progress This component involved t racking and monitor ing the treatment enrollee s' medical and employment progress. Other RTW services Supporting workplace- based interventions These services accommodated the treatment enrollees ' return to work. This might include modifying their duties and adjusting their schedules, tasks, and physical worksites. Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees These services involved retraining or rehabilitating the treatment enrollees when they c ould no longer perform their primary jobs or suitable alternate work.

Introduction Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 3 2. Program partners DOL and SSA expect ed successful RETAIN programs to provide services through coordinated partnerships between state and local workforce development entit ies, health care providers, and other partners. The RETAIN cooperative agreement required the three types of entities shown in the text box to coordinate efforts to support RETAIN implementation and service delivery. DOL and SSA gave the lead agency flexibility to choose other partners to provide expertise or services relevant to the state's intended population and specific program goals. Entities required to form partnerships under the RETAIN cooperative agreement 1. State department of labor, state workforce development agency, or an equivalent entity responsible for labor employment and workforce development. DOL expect ed this entity to lead RETAIN implementation. 2. Workforce development boards. DOL expect ed workforce development boards to play a vital role in providing expertise on RTW and employment -related services, coordinating with health care providers to address treatment enrollees' health -related needs, and engaging employers in the RETAIN program. 3. Health systems prac ticing coordinated care and population health management. DOL expect ed health care systems to play a vital role in delivering services to improve SAW/RTW outcomes among the intended population. 3. Intended population Although the COHE model focused the population of interest on people with work -related injuries or illnesses, RETAIN expand ed the intended population to include those with non-work -related injuries, as long as they were employed or in the labor force when the injury or illness first occurred . The RETAIN cooperative agreement specified minimum eligibility criteria that the intended populations in each state must meet (additional details regarding the required minimum eligibility criteria are available in the following text box). Minimum eligibility criteria under the RETAIN cooperative agreement 1. Individual ha d either (a) a n existing disability or chronic condition; or (b) a new injury or illness or worsening of an existing condition, such as reduced functional capacity due to low -back pain. 2. Individual was employed, or at a minimum in the labor force, at the onset of the injury, illness, or condition (work -related or non- work -related) for which they enrolled in RETAIN . 3. Individual m ight not have an application for SSDI or SSI b enefits pending or might not already receive such benefits at the onset of the injury or illness. DOL and SS A expect ed treatment enrollees to receive RETAIN services for six months. States had to enroll 80 percent of enrollees within 12 weeks of their work disability onset and ideally bega n providing services to treatment enrollees immediately upon enrollment. If a treatment enrollee required medical care and employment services after enrolling in RETAIN for six months, or if the enrollee need ed services beyond the scope of the RETAIN program, states should have referred the treatment enrollee to other available services, such as vocational rehabilitation (VR) , and discharge them from RETAIN. Chapter I. Introduction Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 4 C. Research questions guiding this report Each of the five state-specific chapters is organized around three research topics and related research questions guiding the early assessment, as well as the process and participation studies we will conduct in the future. 1. Program partnerships and the environment surro unding RETAIN implementation and service delivery a. Program partnerships The quality, coordination, and nature of the program partnerships established under RETAIN could affect the implementation and delivery of RETAIN services in ways that influenced program implementation and demonstration outcomes. To guide our understanding of the program partnerships established to support the RETAIN programs, this report addressed the following research questions : What entities did the agency leading implementation (lead agency) partner with to implement and deliver RETAIN services? What were the different partners' roles on RETAIN? How d id program partners work together to achieve program goals? What were the facilitators of and c hallenges to involving partner s in RETAIN ? b. Environment surrounding RETAIN implementation and service delivery The employment and policy environments surrounding RETAIN implementation in each state could have affected the implementation of the RETAIN pro gram components in ways that influence d the outcomes of the demonstration. In addition, the ongoing coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic could have affected RETAIN implementation and outcomes. To guide our understanding of the environment surrounding RETAIN implementation and service delivery, we addressed the following research questions in this report: What were the characteristics of the employment and pol icy environment s surrounding RETAIN implementation that could influence RETAIN's service delivery and impact outcomes? What was each state's experience with the COVID-19 pandemic? How did the COVID-19 pandemic influence RETAIN's service delivery , and what was the potential impact of the pandemic on outcomes? 2. Recruit ing and enrolling eligible workers Assessing how states defined , recruit ed, and enroll ed eligible workers wa s critical to ensuring the RETAIN programs reach ed the intended populations and effe ctively enrolled eligible workers who would benefit from the intervention. To guide our understanding of recruit ing and enroll ing eligible workers in RETAIN programs, we addressed the following research questions in this report: How d id each state screen, recruit, and enroll eligible workers into RETAIN? What challenges did states face collecting and reporting enrollment data? Chapter I. Introduction Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 5 What were the characteristics of RETAIN enrollees? How did the characteristics of treatment enrollees compare to control enrollees? 3. RETAIN i mplementation and service delivery Assessing how program partners implemented an intervention is critical to understanding where and why agencies and partners adapted the intervention during implementation. Understanding adaptations enable d us to accurately document how agencies and partners delivered intervention services in practice and how they compared to the intervention as planned. In addition, describing the imple mentation experience s of program partners was central to understanding the implementation process and lessons learned for future implementation efforts . Finally, the degree to which an intervention condition and a comparison condition differed lays a foundation for understanding intervention impacts. To guide our understanding of RETAIN implementation and service delivery, we addressed the following research questions in this report: How did the lead agency and its partners implement the RETAIN program comp onents? To what extent did service providers ad apt or deviat e from implementing the RETAIN program components as planned at the start of Phase 2? To what extent d id treatment enrollees receive RETAIN services? What factors (facilitators and barriers) enhanced or hindered RETAIN implementation? What was the contrast between the program's services and the counterfactual (that is, the services available to the control enrollees)? This page has been left blank for double -sided copying .

Data sources and methods As described in the Evaluation Design Report (Berk et al. 2021), we used a combination of qualitative and quantitative data sources and methods to conduct the early assessments and generate the findings presented in this report. We describe these data sources and methods below . A. Data sources We mapped the data sources to the early assessment research questions in Exhibit II.1 and describe each source in the sections that follow. The qualitative data sources include program documents (states' Phase 2 applications and quarterly progress reports); published indicators; and semi -structured interviews with RETAIN program administrators, staff, and partners conducted during virtual site visits. All site visit data collected for this report is considered Round 1 data; a seco nd round of site visits to be conducted in 2023 will inform later reports. The quantitative data sources include state -submitted enrollment and program service use data. Exhibit II.1.

Program document s We reviewed two types of program documents to solidify our understanding of states' plans for Phase 2 implementation of RETAIN and their implementation progress: (1) the Phase 2 state awardees' grant applications and (2) the states' quarterly progress repo rts submitted to DOL (Exhibit II.2). Exhibit I I.2. RETAIN program documents Program documents Description States' RETAIN Phase 2 grant applications These documents describe states' plans for implementing each RETAIN program component and their proposed strategies for enhancing implementation in Phase 2. They include information on program inputs such as the environment in which the program would be implemented, the program partners, key program staff, intended populations, and geographic area. States ' quarterly progress reports for DOL These reports include documentation of states' major activities over the prior quarter, their program implementation progress, their challenges and accomplishments, deviations from their plans for implementation, and their planned activities for the following quarter. DOL = U.S. Department of Labor ; RETAIN = Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network . b. Virtual site visits and interviews To learn about states' implementation progress, barriers, and facilitators, we conducted semi -structured interviews with each state's RETAIN program administrators, staff, and partners four to six months after Phase 2 enrollment began (Exhibit II.3). We al so interviewed American Institutes for Research (AIR) technical assistance providers. We transcribed all interviews. Chapter II. Data sources and methods Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 9 Exhibit I I.3. RETAIN virtual site visit activities Site visit activity Description Interviews with program administrators, staff, and p artners Program administrators include program directors and managers and medical directors leading the implementation of RETAIN in their states. Program staff include grant coordination staff, recruitment and enrollment staff, and RETAIN coordination serv ice delivery staff. Program partners include representatives from organizations on states' RETAIN leadership teams, such as workforce partners, government agency partners, or other partners who provide consultation. Interview topics included program partnerships, recruitment and enrollment activities, implementation of program components, technical assistance needs, and the counterfactual service environment. Interviews with AIR technical assistance providers AIR technical assistance providers work with st ates to identify and support strategies for improving the implementation of the RETAIN program. Interview topics included states' implementation-related technical assistance needs and states' strategies for improving program implementation. AIR = American Institutes for Research; RETAIN = Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network . 2. Quantitative data sources a. Published indicators To contextualize the program environment in each state, we identified published data on states' unem ployment rates and employment rates among working-age people with and without disabilities. We also identified published data on states' COVID-19 vaccination rates. The sources of this data include the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the University of New Hampshire Institute on Disability/ University Center for Excellence in Disability, and the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. b. Enrollment data To document states' enrollment outcomes and the characteristics of RETAIN treatment and con trol enrollees, we drew from enrollment data from October 2021 through the end of June 2022 provided by each RETAIN state. These data include baseline information on enrollees' demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, the injury or illness that quali fies their eligibility for RETAIN, their employment status, and whether they have received SSDI benefits in the past. All states but Vermont submit enrollment data to Mathematica through the Confirmit system, while Vermont submits enrollment data on a mont hly basis to SSA. c. Service use data We used service use data from October 2021 through the end of June 2022 to quantify treatment enrollees' receipt of RTW coordination services, communication among RETAIN parties involved in treatment enrollees' return to work, and treatment enrollees' receipt of other RTW services. States submit these data in quarterly evaluation reports to SSA. Chapter II. Data sources and methods Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 10 B. Analysis methods 1. Qualitative data analysis We developed a data abstraction template to guide the systematic review of each state's Phase 2 grant application and quarterly progress reports. This template enabled us to organize application information that described each state's program inputs and plans for implementing the RETAIN program components. We then used the template to guide our review of states' quarterly progress reports, focusing on identifying relevant information about how states were implementing program components and what facilitators and barriers to implementation they were experiencing. We developed a structured template that aligned with our research questions to guide the analysis of the site visit data. For each state, we used the structured template to synthesize notes on specific topics from across respondent interviews. This enabled us to identify key facilitators and barriers to implementation of each RETAIN program component, which included program -level factors as well as the broader program environment surrounding the RETAIN program (including the state's employment environment and the COVID-19 pandemic). We referenced the interview transcripts as needed for additional detail and to clarify respondents' comments. We shared summaries of our site visit findings with SSA in state-specific site visit summaries. We elaborated on our findings and identified areas for continued monitoring and evaluation technical assistance for this report. 2. Quantitative data analysis To help contextualize the employment environment in each state, we identified published data on state s' unemployment rates, as well as their e mployment rates among working-age people with and without disabilities, and compared these state -level indicators with national indicators. To analyze the enrollment data, we generated descriptive statistics on enrollee characteristics (Exhibit II.4). We conducted statistical tests of difference to compare treatment and control enrollee characteristics. We used chi-square tests for categorical variables and t -tests for binary and continuous variables. To analyze the service use data, we produced descriptive statistics on variables reflecting treatment enrollees' receipt of RTW coordination services and other RTW services. We coded free text response variables as binary values to include in the quantitative analysis. Exhibit I I.4.

Chapter II. Data sources and methods Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 11 C. Limitations Our early assessment of RETAIN program implementation has several limitations, some of which relate to the virtual site visits. The site visits occurred four to six months after states began enrollment, and most states were still early in their implementation. Some states had low enrollment at the time of the site visits, and therefore in some cases, staff did not yet have much experience with some of the processes we were asking them about. For instance, some RTW coordinators we interviewed were not yet working with any treatment enrollees, so their perspectives around implementation barriers and facilitators were limited. In addition, because we were only able to interview a selection of RETAIN stakeholders in each state, the perspectives we heard may not fully represent the experiences of all stakeholders in those states. The main limitation of the quantitative data analysis is related to some states having low enrollment in the early months of program implementation. Therefore, the analysis of treatment enrollees' use of services may be limited in some states. This page has been left blank for double -sided copying . Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 13 III. RETAINWOR KS Key findings The need to develop multiple partnerships across multiple regions (workforce development areas) slowed RETAINWORKS's statewide expansion beyond one workforce development area (Area IV) . Program leaders and staff mentor ed local teams in other workforce development area s to help them prepare for implementation. Most referrals were from the lead health care partner, Ascension Via Christi providers in workforce development area IV, and other occupational health providers in the area. During the first nine months of enrollment (October 2021 through June 2022) , RETAIN WOR KS enrolled 39 workers, 1.0 percent of its enrollment goal, which was lower than expected. A lengthy informed consent process might have discouraged potential enrollees from enrolling. Program leaders expect ed enrollment to increase as RETAIN WOR KS launche d implementation in additional workforce development areas. Most treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition. Treatment enrollees had an average of 39 days between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrollment. Most treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment, with the highest proportion of treatment enrollees holding a production, transportation, or material moving occupation. Many treatment enrollees received RETAINWOR KS services beyond enrollment. RETAINWORKS reported treatment enrollees received employment services and did not report any workplace accommodations. Many enrollees ha d not allowed employment counselors to contact their employers, and the extent of medical provider s' participation in training was unclear . Services we re delivered in only one workforce development area. RETAINWOR KS collect ed and report ed data using multiple inputs, including a manual data collection tool and the state workforce system's management information system (KANSASWORKS) . Program staff launch ed a secure web application (REDCap) to replace the manual tool and reduce missing and inconsistent information. However, employment counselors must still enter information about other RTW services from KANSASWORKS into REDCap. A. Overview of RETAINWORKS The Kansas Department of Commerce (Commerce) is the lead agency for the state's RETAIN program (RETAINWOR KS). The intended population includes adults who are employed or seeking employment and hav e a work - or non-work -related injury or illness. The injury or illness must be one of the following: (a) a musculoskeletal injury , (b) a mental health disorder, (c) a chronic disease, or (d) another newly diagnosed illness or injury affecting the individua l's employment. RETAINWOR KS provides RTW coordination services to all treatment enrollees. For treatment enrollees interested in workforce services or who are experiencing social needs, RTW coordinators refer them to RETAINWOR KS employment counselors. The program catchment area is the entire state of Kansas, including the five local workforce development areas that make up the state across 105 counties. Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 14 This chapter documents recruitment, enrollment, and program operations roughly eight months after enrollment began and presents findings about the initial implementation of RETAIN WOR KS.1 B. RETAINWORKS established partnerships to support enrollment and service delivery As the lead agency for RETAINWOR KS, Commerce brings together a range of partners to support implementation (Exhibit III .1). The partners support implementation across five regions (local workforce development areas ) that make up the state. 2 Commerce received signed letters of commitment to support RETAINWOR KS from the lead health system, all five local workforce development boards, and other organizations before submitting its Phase 2 application (Appendix A Exhibit A .1). In this section, we describe these partner organizations and their roles supporting RETAINWOR KS. 1. Lead h ealth care partner The lead health care partner, Ascension Via Christi (AVC), is located in the Wichita, Kansas, area in workforce development area IV. 3 In Area IV, it oversees (1) recruiting and engaging medical providers and connecting them with online training; (2) recruiting, training , and managing RTW coordinators; and (3) screening and recruiting referred workers. AVC staff in Area IV support the launch of implementation in other local workforce development areas. Program leaders and staff said it was helpful that the referral and en rollment lead and one RTW coordinator continued from Phase 1, bringing their knowledge of RETAINWORKS to implementation and service delivery and to mentorship of other local workforce development areas. The medical director at the lead health care partner acts as a provider champion in Area IV and mentors local health care partners in the other local workforce development areas. The director is especially effective at connecting with providers in the lead health system due to his longstanding professional relationships with those providers. The RTW coordinators engage providers during in- person lunch-and - learn meetings with practice office managers and emphasize that RETAINWOR KS will help providers and not create more work. Providers are generally supporti ve of RETAINWOR KS goals of helping patients outside of what they can accomplish during patient visits. Program staff reported that the biggest challenge to recruiting medical providers has been the letter of agreement, a contract AVC requires practices to sign to participate in RETAINWOR KS. The contract describes practices' role in RETAINWORKS and allows practices to receive incentive payments. 4 Program staff said legal staff are often involved in executing the contract. The legal review has sometimes slowed medical provider participation in RETAINWOR KS by four to six weeks or prevented participation altogether. Another challenge to provider participation is providers' limited time, energy, and staff due to burnout from the COVID -19 pandemic. Program staff reported that it was especially challenging to gain providers' attention remotely. These factors have contributed to a slow ramp -up of referrals. 1 RETAINWOR KS enrolled the first worker on October 22, 2021. We collected qualitative data about implementation experiences during semi -structured site visit interviews six months after the start of enrollment. We collected program data through nine months after the start of enrollment (through June 2022). 2 Each workforce development area has a corresponding local workforce development board. 3 AVC is also the local healthcare partner in workforce development areas II (Manhattan) and V (Pittsburgh). 4 The payments are for providers' time spent completing paperwork supporting treatment enrollees' RTW coordination, including activity prescription s and RTW plans. Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 15 Exhibit III .1. RETAINWOR KS organization chart Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 16 2. Lead workforce partner The lead workforce partner, the Workforce Alliance of South-Central Kansas (Workforce Alliance), is the local workforce development board in Area IV. Workforce Alliance provides expertise on workforce services, such as career training and job search resources. It oversees implementation by (1) engaging employers in workforce development area IV; (2) recruiting, training, and managing employment counselors; and (3) enrolling eligible workers. Program leaders and staff said it was helpful that two of the same workforce development staff (e mployment counselors) continued from Phase 1, bringing their knowledge of RETAINWOR KS to implementation and service delivery and supporting the launch of implementation in the other local workforce development areas. Program leaders and staff conduct targeted outreach to employers to encourage them to refer workers. Workforce Alliance staff members periodically present to one of the state leadership partners, the Kansas Society for Human Resource Management, to share information about RETAINWOR KS. Program s taff also present about RETAINWOR KS at local Chamber of Commerce meetings. At least one employer has responded with interest in RETAINWOR KS, which could lead to future worker referrals. In addition, an employment counselor works with the local area IV workforce development board's business services team to inform employers about RETAINWOR KS. 3. Other partners The need to develop multiple partnerships across workforce development areas has slowed RETAINWOR KS expansion beyond workforce development area IV, the location of the lead health care and workforce partners. In each local workforce development area, Commerce has one workforce partner 5 and at least one health care partner. Developing agreements with ea ch of the local implementation partners has taken time; they require building relationships and completing paperwork to establish subrecipient contracts. In addition, the local health care partners have struggled to hire RTW coordinator s due to hiring freezes and job posting restrictions that prioritize COVID-19 operations . As of May 2022, only workforce development area IV was fully staffed and operational. Program leaders rely on partners to educate employers about RETAIN WOR KS and encourage referrals. The governor, along with the Kansas Department of Administration and program staff , are working to make the State of Kansas government an employer partner so that RETAINWOR KS will be available to all state employees. Three employer partners (Kansas Business Group on Health, Mid-America Coalition on Health Care, and Society for Human Resource Management) assist in developing outreach messaging and employer education. 4. Coordination of program partners Program leaders and staff expressed a strong commitment to RETAINWOR KS and a desire to help new partners launch RETAIN services. Staff in the lead workforce development area IV mentor other local implementation teams. This mentorship helps local implementation teams onboard staff to the complex program structure and understand how they can implement RETAINWOR KS within the context of their unique organizational processes. To support communication across partners and roles, program leaders hold frequent meetings. Each local workforce development area's implementation team (the workforce 5 Each local workforce system partner is a local workforce development area board, which is associated with multiple workforce centers. Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 17 and health care partner) also meets regularly. Program staff said that an in -person meeting in April 2022 was especially helpful to building relationships and clarifying roles and processes. C. Program environment surrounding RETAIN WORKS 1. Employment and policy environment Compared with national rates, the unemployment rate in Kansas is lower and the employment rate of people with disabilities is higher (Exhibit III.2). Prominent industries in Kansas include aviation manufacturing, agricultural manufacturing, health care, cybersecurity, and call centers. Program staff said that one important barrier to work among people with disabilities is a lack of health insurance, which can prevent them from seeking needed medical care. Kansas did not expand Medicaid under the Aff ordable Care Act , so workers who lack insurance coverage through their employer are uninsured unless they purchase their own coverage. Exhibit III .2.

RETAIN = Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. 2. COVID-19 pandemic The COVID- 19 vaccination rate in Kansas is 61 percent, which is lower than the 67 percent vaccination rate nationwide.6 Program leaders said the COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges to health system and provider capacity for RETAINWORKS . Several health systems have experienced hiring freezes, limiting partners' ability to hire RTW coordinators to provide RTW services in additional workforce development areas. Provider s have expressed having limited time to spend on RETAINWOR KS given staffing pressures. Program staff said clinic restrictions to prevent potential COVID transmission meant they could not distribute hard copies of program materials or meet with providers face-to -face. Program leaders and staff said the COVID-19 pandemic also had mixed effects on work opportunities for RETAINWOR KS enrollees. While there are many open jobs, some people have less interest in working because they are reevaluating their prioriti es, receiving support from new multigenerational living arrangements, or must spend time caring for family. 6 Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center , 2022 . Available at III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 18 D. RETAINWORKS's enrollment is slow but expected to increase as additional workforce development areas launch implementation RETAINWOR KS seeks to enroll workers with a work - or non-work -related injury or illness. The program encourages medical providers, employers, and local workforce centers to refer workers to RETAINWOR KS. At the time of the site visit, m ost referrals were coming from providers a ffiliated with the lead health care partner, AVC , in workforce development area IV. The recruitment and enrollment process involves RTW coordinators and employment counselors . It includes the following steps : (1) a participating medical provider completes a referral form and sends it to the RTW coordinators; (2) a n RTW coordinator contacts the potential enrollee and if the enrollee is interested, the RTW coordinator completes informed consent and alerts the potential enrollee they will be contacted by an employment counselor ; (3) the employment counselor contacts the potential enrollee to collect paperwork confirming eligibility and then conducts random assignment. A summary of the recruitment and enrollment process is included in Appendix A (Exhibit A.2). 1. Early enrollment outcomes During the first nine months of enrollment (October 22, 2021, through June 30 , 2022), RETAINWOR KS enrolled 39 workers, or 1 percent of the program's goal of enrolling 4,000 workers. The first nine months of enrollment represent about one -third (28 percent) of the 32-month enrollment per iod. About 46 percent of all enrollees were treatment enrollees and 54 percent were control enrollees (Appendix A , Exhibit A .3). 2. Referral sources The primary source of referrals is medical providers affiliated with the lead health care partner, AVC, in workforce development area IV.7 Some referrals came from non-AVC occupational health providers in the same workforce development area, in response to outreach from the referral and enrollment lead and RTW coordinator staff. The program has received a limited number of referrals from local workforce centers, which inform their clients if they are potentially eligible for RETAIN. 8 Program staff and partners expect referrals to increase after implementation begins in the other four workforce development areas. 3. Outreach strategies RETAINWOR KS staff conduct s outreach to potential enrollees, medical providers , and employers using the program website, outreach materials, and presentations. The outreach materials include one -pagers about RETAINWOR KS, a poster, and flyers that partners can disseminate physically or electronically. Staff provide physical packets of information about the program for medical providers to share with their patients. In a ddition, staff developed a video about RETAINWOR KS in English and Spanish that health care partners can air in their waiting rooms. 9 Program staff are developing social media content to highlight enrollee success stories and organizing a committee to ensure alignment of marketing and outreach efforts across partners. RETAINWORKS 's upcoming outreach plans include dissemi nating newsletters to partners and hosting educational webinars for employers. 7 Each local implementation area will receive referrals from its local healthcare partner organization, shown in Exhibit III.1. 8 The workforce system automatically checks applicants' eligibility for RETAIN. 9 Partners in workforce development area IV are currently showing the video. Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 19 Program leaders and staff noted that workforce development areas outside area IV have not been fully ready to focus on outreach efforts. Another challenge is that program partners often have their own preferences for how they like to share messages; to address this, the RETAINWOR KS team created outreach materials that partners can ada pt with their own branding. 4. Strategies for recruiting underserved populations RETAINWOR KS staff plan s to focus several future outreach efforts on underserved communities. Program staff said it plans to target social media content about the program to people living in low- income communities, identified as federal opportunity zones . In addition, staff plan to rely on existing relationships between workforce partners and local community partners to identify trusted leaders in underserved communities who c ould share information about RETAINWORKS with their networks. Finally, RETAINWOR KS plans to establish a subrecipient contract with the K ansas Clinical Improvement Collaborative , which is a group of medical providers focused on efforts in w estern Kansas (a less populated area of the state). The subrecipient contract will allow RETAINWOR KS to recruit medical providers and hire additional RTW coordinators to provide RETAINWOR KS services in this more rural region. 5. Screening for eligibility The RETAINWOR KS program enrolls people who have a work - or non-work -related injury or illness. The injury or illness must be one of the following: (a) a musculoskeletal injury, (b) a mental health disorder , (c) a chronic disease, or (d) another newly diagnosed illness or injury affecting the individual's employment. Enrollees must be employed or seeking employment, ages 18 to 64, and liv ing or work ing in Kansas. They also must have a valid S ocial S ecurity number and be legally authorized to work in the United States. Program staff said a main challenge to recruiting potential enrollees is reaching them and gaining their trust to share the personal information needed to confirm eligibility. RTW coordinators call potential enrollees to review eligibility and initiate enrollment within three days of receiving a referral. If a potential enrollee does not answer, then the RTW coordinators follow up by text message or email (if available). However, program staff have heard that the text messages RTW coordinators send to follow up with potential enrollees are similar to a scam circulating in the state. To build trust and rapport, the RTW coordinators send a welcome flyer with their photos and brief information about themselves. Potential enrollees are reportedly more trusting after receiving this information. In addition, program staff noted that having providers give a physical packet of RETAINWOR KS information to patients (which clinic restrictions prevented earlier in the pandemic) has increased credibility when a n RTW coordinat or contacts a potential enrollee . Another challenge to recruiting potential enrollees is the lengthy informed consent process , which some potential enrollees do not complete . There are four documents the RTW coordinator must review with the potential enrollee and complete, including a 9-page informed consent form that can take up to 45 minutes to review. Program staff noted that the lengthy documentation contributes to potential enrollees' hesitation to enroll, and some never complete the forms. Several pro gram staff expressed frustration with random assignment, noting that this made the program difficult to explain to enrollees and added Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 20 complexity to the informed consent process. To make the process less overwhelming, RTW coordinators email the forms before meeting with the potential enrollee, so they have a chance to review the information and form a general understanding of RETAINWOR KS ahead of time. \"The control treatment is incredibly frustrating because we will have a really great participant that we think can be helped through the program and then they'll be put in the control group. . .It's hard enough sometimes to get people to take advantage of the program because there's sometimes mistrust of the government that then when we add an element like this, it 's again difficult on our staff and frustrating to the customer.\" Program Staff 6. Recruitm ent After filling out the enrollment forms, one challenge to completing enrollment is the additional contact the employment counselor must make with the potential enrollee to verify eligibility and complete random assignment. For example, program staff said that o ne employment counselor's work telephone number appears as spam to some potential enrollees,10 potentially discouraging them from answering t he call. At the stage of random assignment, employment counselors initially struggled to collect the documentation required to verify potential enrollees' identity and their authorization to work in the United States. Program staff said that m any potential enrollees had trouble locating the documentation (for example, a physical Social Security card) and providing it to employment counselor s who complete random assignment. This prevented their enrollment. In April 2022, the program adopted the same documentation requirements as the state's workforce centers, allowing greater flexibility in necessary documentation. Only 11 percent of referred workers enroll into RETAINWOR KS. Program staff explained that this is because some referred workers fail to complete enrollment and others decline to enroll. Workers who declined to enroll reportedly did not trust the program enough to provide their personal information or thought they did not need the help. Other potential enrollees were already back at work and did not see a benefit to participating in RETAIN WOR KS. For example, program staff said that potential enrollees referred from occupational health providers were often able to return to work after healing from their injuries without additional help. In Ma y 2022, program leaders were meeting with referring providers in area IV to identify ways to increase the enrollment rate among referred workers. 7. Treatment enrollee characteristics We used enrollment data submitted by RETAINWOR KS to assess demographic characteristics for the 18 people who enrolled during the first nine months of the enrollment period ( October 2021 to June 2022) and were assigned to the treatment group (Appendix A, Exhibit A.4). Many treatment enrollees were female (61 percent). The average age of the treatment enrollees was 4 1. 11 Just over half were White, non - Hispanic ( 56 percent), and the others were similarly distributed across the remaining racial and ethnic groups (Exhibit III.3). Half of the treatment enrollees had at least a high school diploma, GED, or certificate of completion (50 percent) , and all preferred English (100 percent). 10 Program staff reported that potential enrollees whose wireless carrier is T -Mobile said that phone calls from program staff appeared as spam. 11 We are not able to report the percentage of treatment enrollees who were ages 50 years or older because of how few there were and the need to avoid disclosing information about specific people.

Note: We s uppressed the \"More than one race\" category to avoid disclosing information about particular people, which is why the percentages do not add up to 100. RETAIN WOR KS = Kansas Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network We also used the enrollment data submitted by RETAINWOR KS to assess illness and injury characteristics for the same 18 treatment enrollees described above (Appendix A, Exhibit A.5). Most treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a non-back musculoskeletal condition (72 percent) (Exhibit III.4). RETAINWORKS enrolls people with work- and non-work -related conditions, and 61 percent of enrollees reported their injury or illness was work related. Although people with a pre -existing condition are eligible, most treatment enrollees reported their illness or injury was a new condition at the time of enrollment (83 percent) and that their condition was a result of an accident or injury (8 9 percent). Treatment enrollees had an average of 38 days between their onset of primary diagnosis (either a new condition or a worsening of a chronic condition) and their enrollment in RETAINWOR KS.

Note: We s uppressed \"\" Musculoskeletal, back \" and \"Other\" to avoid disclosing information about particular people, which is why the percentages do not add to 100 percent. Note: We classify ICD -10 codes into five Musculoskeletal, back; Musculoskeletal, non-back; Long COVID; Mental; and Other. These groupings build on previous studies of return to work among injured or ill workers. We include the mapping of ICD -10 codes into these categories in Appendix A, Exhibit 5. ICD = International Classification of Diseases; RETAIN WOR KS = Kansas Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network We also used the enrollment data submitted by RETAINWOR KS to assess recent work histories for the same 18 treatment enrollees described above (Appendix A, Exhibit A.6). All RETAIN programs must enroll workers who are employed or in the labor force , and for RETAINWOR KS, most treatment enrollees were employed (89 percent) at the time of enrollment. Many last worked within one month of enrollment (78 percent), and most last worked within three months of enrollment (95 percent) (Exhibit III.5). On average, treatment enrollees were employed full time (41 hours per week) before the onset of their injury or illness. Many treatment enrollees worked at their current or most recent job for less than two years (61 percent), and just over a quarter held this job for more than five years (28 percent). Over the last year, many treatment enrollees earned at least $1,000 per month (78 percent). The highest proportion of treatment enrollees held a production, transportation, or material moving occupation (39 percent) (Exhibit III.6). Other treatment enrollees held occupations in service (28 percent), management, professional, or related occupations and sales and office occupations. 12 12 We suppressed the percentages of treatment enrollees who held management, professional, or related occupations, and sales and office occupations to avoid disclosing information about particular treatment enrollees.

RETAIN WOR KS = Kansas Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 24 We also used enrollment data to compare treatment enrollee characteristics to control enrollee characteristics. As outlined in the Evaluation Design Report, we expected treatment and control enrollees to have similar baseline characteristics because each state has a random assignment design (Berk et al. 2021) . We found no significant differences between treatment and control enrollees in the characteristics examined (Appendix A, Exhibit A.4, Exhibit A.5, and Exhibit A.6). E. RETAINWORKS's early service delivery is going as planned in one of five workforce devel opment areas but several factors might limit the program's success At the time of the interviews in May 2022, program staff were delivering RTW services as planned in workforce development area IV. Several factors might limit the program's service delivery success. Program staff said it was unclear what percentage of medical providers had completed the training at participating practices because they share the invitation through a central point of contact. In addition, the majority of enrollees do not want the employment counselor to contact their employer, in contrast to program design. Finally, services have not yet launched in the other four workforce development areas, in part due to low enrollment and challenges hiring RTW coordinators. 1. Medical provider services Lead health care partner staff connect practices with information on the required RETAINWOR KS training and manage payments to practices for the time that providers and office staff spend on RETAINWOR KS paperwork (Exhibit III.7). The health care partner will play this role in each of the local workforce development areas. Exhibit III .7. RETAIN WOR KS medical provider services Program component Description Training medical providers Providers at participating practices must complete a 4- hour, self -paced online training on (1) RETAIN WOR KS and its benefits, (2) the COHE model, and (3) the opioid crisis. RETAINWORKS is developing training for providers via the University of Kansas's Project ECHO. This training will offer continuing medical education credits. Incentivizing medical providers Practices that have signed a letter of agreement with RETAINWOR KS receive the following on behalf of providers: - $100 for completion of referral form for successful referral to RETAINWOR KS - $50 for submitting an activity prescription for the enrollee - $25 for making or answering RETAIN -related phone calls - $100 for completing an RTW plan for the enrollee - $100 for completing a 30-day risk assessment for the enrollee RETAIN WOR KS = Kansas Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; COHE = Center for Occupational Health and Education; ECHO = Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes; RTW = return to work. Program staff described challenges engaging providers in completing the medical provider training. Program staff do not communicate directly with providers about the training. Instead, they work with each participating practices' central point of contact to invite individual providers to complete the training. In addition, there is often a four -to-six-week lag between the time when providers are invited to take the training and the time when they are able to create a username and password to take the training. At the time of the interviews, program staff were uncertain about the percentage of medical providers Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 25 who had completed the training. Program staff are notified when a provider completes the training. However, they do not have easy access to a list of all the providers in each participating practice. Therefore, they must follow up with each participating practice to identify providers who have not completed the training. In addition, program staff noted that the 90-day timeframe to complete the training constitutes a significant portion of the six-month RETAINWORKS service period for early enrollees and could result in a limited period to influence medical providers' care for enrollees. Program staff are setting up optional training for participating providers on SAW/RTW principles using the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes model of peer mentorship. The model is a learning framework in which participants engage in a virtual community of peers where everyone teaches and learns. 13 The training will convene groups of medical providers to attend 15-minute lectures and discuss case studies. Staff anticipate this approach will be helpful to creating provider peer support in the many rural areas of the state where providers are otherwise isolated. Program staff are waiting for more providers to participate in RETAI NWOR KS before launching the optional training. Providers and practice staff are reportedly appreciative of payments for their time spent on RETAINWOR KS. Program staff said that providers are grateful that their time is valued. However, they noted that providers' motivation to spend time on RETAINWOR KS paperwork is driven by an interest in caring for the patient, more than an interest in the compensation for their practices. 2. RTW services Two RTW coordinators in Area IV provide RTW coordination services to treatment en rollees (Exhibit III.8). RTW coordinators provide treatment enrollees with work activity prescriptions, based on restrictions identified by participating medical providers. Coordinators work with enrollees to develop an RTW plan identifying progressive steps to returning to work a nd meet weekly with the treatment enrollee. The RTW coordinators work closely with two employment counselors who provide social and employment supports to treatment enrollees. Employment counselors complete an individualized employment plan for interested enrollees to identify needed follow -up services, such as employment services or other supports. 14 If permitted, the employment counselor s communicate with employers about accommodations or alternate work assignments. RETAINWORKS offers incentive payments to treatment enrollees for reaching a series of milestones, including finalizing an RTW plan, meeting with the RTW coordinator and employment counselor, and returning to work. Services from RTW coordinators services and employment counselors end after six m onths or after the enrollee returns to work for eight weeks with no restrictions , whichever comes first. 13 See https://hsc.unm.edu/echo/what- we-do/about -the-echo -model.html . 14 For example, a workforce coordinator could put together a resume to connect someone with training or another job, pay for a work accommodation, and fund support services to help a treatment enrollee return to work ( for example, getting their car fixed if it is their source of transportation to work). Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 26 Exhibit III .8. RETAINWOR KS RTW coordination services Program component Description Coordinating RTW services RTW coordinator provides the treatment enrollee with work activity prescriptions, ongoing support , an RTW plan, and a 30-day risk assessment after returning to work . Communicating among parties involved in RTW plan RTW coordinator and employment counselor work as a team to provide medical , social, and employment -related supports to the treatment enrollee. They communicate frequently and meet weekly to discuss cases and service coordination. RTW coordinator communicates with medical provider to develop an activity prescription, which outlines work restrictions, and an RTW plan, which documents what an enrollee is able to do when they are ready to return to work without restrictions. Monitoring treatment enrollee progress RTW coordinator meet s with treatment enrollee weekly to assess their medical progress, identify potential accommodations, and conduct a 30-day risk assessment if the enrollee has not yet returned to work. If a treatment enrollee returns to work, the RTW coordinator continues to check in at regular intervals (2, 4, and 8 weeks after RTW). RTW coordinator updates the RTW plan every 30 days or as needed. RETAIN WOR KS = Kansas Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work. One initial challenge to implementing RTW coordination services has been the complexity of roles and processes, some of which have changed over time. Program staff said an in - person , two -day meeting in April 2022 helped RTW coordinators and employment c ounselor s better understand their roles in carrying out RETAI NWOR KS services. They noted that the meeting and discussion brought clarity to existing tools, such as a workflow that documents the steps in enrollment and service delivery, and the staff who are responsible for each step. In addition, program staff said that one-on-one training and observation have helped newer staff learn the RTW coordination roles. They noted that webinars covering topics such as medical p rovider engagement are also helpful. \"Everyone across the state attended [the meeting in April 2022]. And so that was very very helpful just to have dialogue of \"Well, how do you actually do this? I see the policy on paper or the instructions on paper, what does that look like?\" -Program sta ff a. Coordinat ing RTW services Program data submitted by RETAINWORKS indicate that most treatment enrollees (89 percent) received RETAINWOR KS services, including RTW coordination services or other RTW services (Exhibit III.9). Many treatment enrollees (67 percent) had an established RTW plan. An average of about 26 days elapsed from enrollment to establishment of an RTW plan for treatment enrollees enrolled in RETAINWOR KS. As of the end of June, about 33 percent of treatment enrollees exited RETAINWOR KS. Treatment enrollees who exited received services for about 20 days. Chapter III.

RETAIN WOR KS = Kansas Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work . Program staff noted that RTW coordinators and employment counselors have characteristics and experiences that help them deliver services effectively. Several staff have continued from Phase 1, including by changing employers to stay with the program. They have developed accumulated knowledge of RETAINWORKS and have demonstrated a dedication to the program. Program staff observed that being outgoing, friendly, and empathetic, with experience establishing trust with clients, has helped them develop rapport with enrollees during enrollment and service delivery. RTW coordinators have used their nursing skills and backgrounds during monitoring check-in meetings to assess enrollees' medical situations and encourage them to seek follow-up medical care when needed. For example, RTW coordinators encourage enrollees to contact their provider if they are showing signs of infection. b. Co mmunicating among parties involved in enrollee return to work In Exhibit III. 10, we list the possible avenues of communication among RTW coordinators and others involved in enrollees' RTW plans and the percentage of reported communications that occurred w ith each, as reported in the program data submitted by RETAINWOR KS. Based on these data, RTW coordinators communicated with a medical provider at least once for all treatment enrollees (100 percent). The data reflecting RTW coordinators' communication with an employer and with a workforce professional were not available to include in this report. Exhibit III .10.

RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 28 Despite all treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators' communicating with their medical provider at least once, program staff noted delayed communication from medical providers as a challenge to delivering RTW coordination services. Medical providers are sometimes slow to complete forms related to the activity prescription and RTW plan, which can delay the completion of these ste ps with enrollees. The RTW coordinators coordinate closely with their counterpart employment counselors to support treatment enrollees. RTW coordinators use a warm handoff to introduce a treatment enrollee to an employment counselor by identifying the workforce staff and the types of supports they can provide. RTW coordinators share notes from their weekly meetings with the enrollee with the employment counselors via KANSASWORKS, the workforce management information system. These shared notes, the ability to view employment counselor's notes about a treatment enrollee, and regular meetings between the RTW coordinators and employment counselors support their collaboration to support the enrollee. c. Monitoring treatment enrollee progress Program staff said standard assessment questions about a treatment enrollee's medical situation (for example, level of pain, provider interactions, transportation issues, medication changes, taking medications as prescribed) are helpful to monitoring the enrollee's progress. These questions often lead to a discussion of employment progress. RTW coordinators connect with employment counselors to handle enrollees' employment or social support needs. The primary challenge to providing RTW services and monitoring progress is reaching treatment enrollees for weekly monitoring check-ins. Program staff explained that after treatment enrollees return to work, they often become busier and more difficult to r each. This poses a challenge for RTW coordinators to completing weekly monitoring check-ins with the working enrollee at two, four, and eight weeks after returning to work. Program staff noted that even before returning to work, some enrollees are difficult to reach. RTW coordinators offer to conduct some check -in meetings over email by sending the assessment questions in writing. However, the RTW coordinators make a point of meeting with enrollees for real - time monitoring check-ins at least every other week. \"Sometimes people will enroll and then they'll fall off and stop responding. They're like, oh I'm back at work, I don't really need you anymore. But we need those follow up calls to know if we need to do anything else before we let [them] go.\" -Program Staff 3. Other RT W services Two employment counselor s provide employment services to treatment enrollees in A rea IV (Exhibit III.11). Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 29 Exhibit III .11. Other RETAINWOR KS RTW services Program component Description Supporting workplace- based interventions Employment counselor develops IEP with interested enrollee, which enables the counselor to assess enrollee's needs and provide follow -up services . Employment counselor communicates with the RTW coordinator to identify interventions that are recommended by the treating provider. When needed and permitted by the treatment enrollee, the employment counselor contacts the enrollee's employer to discuss workplace interventions, such as work schedule modifications and physical accommodations. Employ ment counselor follows up with the enrollee after 2 weeks and again after 30 days to assess any changes that could affect the enrollee's ability to perform work duties and updates the IEP accordingly. Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees RTW coordinator refers treatment enrollee to the employment counselor to determine needs for work accommodations, short -term or work-related training, registered apprenticeship programs, and other community services. If a treatment enrollee must seek a new career, the employment counselor refers the enrollee to all Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act programs for which the enrollee is eligible. RETAIN WOR KS = Kansas Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network ; IEP = individual employment plan; RTW = return to work. a. Supporting workplace -based interventions The primary challenge to providing workforce services is that most treatment enrollees do not want the RTW coordinator to contact their employer. Treatment enrollees who do not permit contact with their employer can still receive RTW coordination and workforce services that do not involve the employer. Program staff said treatment enrollees withhold permission for the contact because they are worried they will be fired. In one of the few cases in which the coordinators were permitted to arrange a work accommodation, the enrollee was a senior employee. Program staff indicated that when an enrollee's employer is engaged, supporting workplace -based interventions goes smoothly. RETAINWORKS did not report any workplace accommodations in the service use data (Exhibit III.12). The discrepancy between the program data submitted by RETAINWOR KS and the information shared during the site visit interviews could be a result of the challenges RETAINWOR KS faces reporting program data for the evaluation, which we discuss in more detail below.

RETAIN WOR KS = Kansas Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 30 b. Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees The current program data on workforce services is limited. To avoid disclosing information about particular treatment enrollees, we suppressed the percentage of treatment enrollees who received job search services (Exhibit III.13). RETAINWOR KS did not report any other retraining or rehabilitation services for which programs submit data. Program staff said most treatment enrollees are seeking support services (such as support paying bills) to augment lost income while taking time off from work, and that type of service is not included in the required program data. Although they appreciate the workforce services, many treatment enrollees work physically demanding jobs and are reluctant to return to work when injured or ill. Exhibit III .13.

RETAIN WORKS does not provide transitional work opportunities to treatment enrollees. n.a. = not applicable; RETAIN WOR KS = Kansas Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network ; RTW = return to work. 4. Service contrast There is a clear distinction between treatment and control services. After randomization, employment counselors refer control enrollees to workforce center services available to the community. Neither the RTW coordinators nor the employment counselors have further contact with control enrollees. All enrollees (including control enrollees) are offered a Dynamic Athletic Research Institute motion scan, which provides information about their mobility and musculoskeletal risk factors. If the enrollee receives the scan, the results can serve as a baseline for medical providers to assess an enrollee's recovery. Treatment enrollees receive a follow-up scan when they return to work; control enrollees do not. RETAINWOR KS offers unique RTW services relative to those available outside of the program. Workers injured on the job receive workers' compensation, which might cover physical therapy or include case management; however, services covered by workers' compensation benefits range widely by employer. Those with identified disabilities may receive services from VR. Any community member can seek employment services at a workforce center. None of these services are as individualized and frequent as what is offered in RETAINWOR KS, nor do they help people navigate the health system, bridge the gap between the workforce and medical systems, or offer incentives for engaging in RTW activities. Chapter III. RETAINWOR KS Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 31 5. Collecting and reporting program data RETAINWOR KS faces challenges reporting program data for the evaluation because it lacks a single management information system. Employment counselors use KANSASWORKS , the management information system for the state's workforce centers. However, KANSASWORKS does not align with the data elements required for the independent evaluation of RETAINWORKS . As a result, employment counselors populate an Excel data collection tool using manual data entry of information they pull from structured fields and ad -hoc searches for information in case notes. Another challenge is that KANSASWOR KS is not compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. As a result, RTW coordinators enter non -medical information into KANSASWOR KS to coordinate with the employment counselors, but they enter medical data manually into the Excel tool. Program staff recently incorporated drop -down menus into the Excel tool to reduce the errors and missing information associated with free-text data entry fields. Overall, the current process is time consuming, risks errors and duplication, and requires repeated data entry of information contained in KANSASWOR KS. Program staff said the low number of enrollees keeps the process manageable. Program staff are working to launch REDCap, a secure web application, to replace the manual data collection tool. However, employment counselors will still need to enter information from KANSASWOR KS into REDCap. F. Areas for continued monitoring and evaluation technical assistance Our analysis of the interview data collected in May 2022 and enrollment data collected through July 1, 2022 , raised several issues that could affect the impact evaluation. The Mathematica team will continue to monitor these issues and provide e valuation technical assistance as needed. Early enrollment is low relative to the goal of 4,000 enrollees. As of July 1, 2022, RETAINWOR KS reached 1 percent of the target, while it is 28 percent through its 32-month enrollment period. If the program's enr ollment continues at the current level, there is a high chance that the evaluation will fail to detect a true effect that is large enough to be important to policymakers. As of the virtual site visit conducted in May 2022, RETAINWOR KS was not yet implementing the program model in four of the five workforce development areas. This has limited enrollment. As additional local workforce development areas begin to enroll workers, it will be important to monitor whether the components are delivered as planned. Workforce development areas outside Area IV did not pilot the program in Phase 1. As of May 2022, it was unclear what percentage of medical providers at participating practices had completed the required training, because the invitation is shared through a central point of contact at each provider office and not directly from program staff to individual providers. If training completion is limited, then providers may not apply SAW/RTW best practices in their medical care for enrollees (and all patients) as intended in the program model. This could reduce the impact of RETAINWOR KS. RETAINWOR KS faces challenges reporting program data for the evaluation because it lacks a single management information system. In May 2022, program staff had incorporated structured drop-down fields into a manual data reporting tool and were planning to launch REDCa p, a secure web application, to replace the manual reporting tool. However, even after launching REDCap, some workforce data reporting will still require ad-hoc searches through case notes, which could contribute to missing information.

RETAIN Kentucky Key findings RETAIN KY emphasize d building partnerships and identifying champions to promote and sustain systems changes that support ed early SAW/RTW strategies . The COVID -19 pandemic reduced medical providers' and employers' capacity to prioritize RETAIN and had mixed effects on work opportunities for enrollees . The two lead health care partners, University of Kentucky HealthCare and the University of Louisville, were the primary source of referrals. During the first nine months of enrollment (October 2021 through June 2022), enrollment in RETAIN KY was lower than expected. Program staff and partners expect ed referrals and enrollment to increase after the health systems embed ded a referral to RETAIN into the electronic medical record (EMR) . Many treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment, with the highest proportion of treatment enrollees holding a service occupation. Most treatment enrollees established an RTW plan. Fewer, about one- third, received employment services and 20 percent received a workplace accommodation. There could be a low contrast between RTW services provided to treatment enrollees and the limited services provided to control enrollees. Some treatment enrollees hesitat ed to sign release forms that enabled the RTW coordinator to communicate with employers, medical providers, and others. Just over 10 percent of treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators communicated with their employer s at least once and 18 percent of their RTW coordinators communicated with a workforce professional as part of their RTW plan. The approval process required for offering continuing medical education credits for completing the training delayed the medical provider s' training . Despite this delay, RTW coordinators communicated with a medical provider at least once for 67 percent of treatment enrollees. RETAIN KY's case management data system (CMDS ) work ed effectively to c ollect and report the data elements required for the evaluation. P rogram staff resolved initial challenges to providing unemployment insurance (UI) wage data to support the RETAIN evaluation in Phase 2. Several potential issues present ed opportunities for continued monitoring and evaluation technical assistance. Enrollment was low and might have include d workers unlikely to benefit from RETAIN. Some intervention components were not yet implemented as planned: medical provider training was temporarily delayed and there might have been limited contrast between the RTW services provided to the treatment and control groups. A. Overview of Kentucky RETAIN The Kentucky (KY) Office of Vocational Rehabilitation (OVR) is the lead agency for RETAIN Kentucky (RETAIN KY). RETAIN KY provides RTW coordination services to all treatment enrollees. For treatment enrollees with social needs that affect work, RTW coordinators provide referrals to support services. For treatment enrollees who are looking for work, RTW coordinators provide job development Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 34 and placement assistance, workplace accommodation planning, and transferable skills analysis. The program catchment area is the entire state of Kentucky, including 120 counties. This chapter documents recruitment, enrollment, and program operations roughly eight months after enrollment began and presents findings about the initial implementation of RETAIN KY.15 B. RETAIN KY established partnerships to support enrollment and service delivery As the lead agency for RETAIN KY, OVR brings together a range of partners to support implementation (Exhibit IV.1). OVR received signed letters of commitment to support RETAIN KY from health systems, workforce agencies, and other organizations before submitting its Phase 2 application (Appendix B Exhibit B.1). In this section, we describe these partner organizations and their roles supporting RETAIN KY. Exhibit IV.1 . RETAIN Kentucky organization chart 15 RETAIN KY enrolled the first worker on October 18, 2021. We collected qualitative data about implementation experiences during semi -structured site visit interviews six months after the start of enrollment. We collected program data through nine months after the start of enrollment (through June 2022). Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 35 1. Lead health care partner Both lead health care partners are large health systems. They support implementation by recruiting eligible patients and staff for enrollment into RETAIN KY . Three health care co -leads are embedded across the health system s and act as provider champions for recruiting medical providers to take the RETAIN KY training and refer patients. 2. Lead workforce partner The lead workforce partner, University of Kentucky Human Development Institute, provides expertise on services for people with disabilities . It oversees implementation by (1) recruiting, engaging, and training medical providers; (2) engaging employers and workforce organizations; (3) enrolling referred workers; and (4) recruiting, training, and managing RTW coordinators who deliver SAW/RTW service s. Program staff attributed the smooth implementation of medical provider outreach to the referral and enrollment lead. Program staff described how she leverages her professional networks to forge connections and has longstanding relationships with health systems and knowledge of how they operate, which helps her to explain to health system leaders the value of RETAIN. She oversees two RTW liaisons, each of whom is dedicated to recruiting and engaging medical providers from one of the lead health care partners. The RTW liaisons also meet with clinical support staff, such as social workers and nurses, to provide ongoing education and engagement to promote patient referrals. Program staff and partners described emphasizing the benefits of RETAIN as helpful to medical provider outreach . They noted that health system leaders appreciate that RETAIN offers medical providers and clinical support staff training about SAW/RTW best practices. This in turn increases the appeal of the health system to employers who engage them in value -based contracts (and who prefer their employees be treated using SAW/RTW best practices). Medical providers appreciate that RETAIN is a resource for supporting their patients, instead of adding to their workload. Medical providers also respond to RETAIN KY's goal of improving equity and inclusion for people with disabilities in the workforce. \"RETAIN really handles an area that's not in a physician's wheelhouse. They are very focused on getting the individual. They get them well physically, but when there are things that are preventing that physical recovery, whether it's mental, whether it's barriers, social barriers, whether it's something related to their job, the physician feels like that's kind of outside their wheelhouse.\" Program leader 3. Other p artners The state leadership team includes partners who advise RETAIN KY on systems -level improvements that will support sustainability. These partners include statew ide and local workforce agencies, the state public health agency, and consultants in workforce policy and mental health. Members of the state leadership team help identify potential solutions to program challenges and promote RETAIN with in professional networks. RETAIN KY partnered with four additional organizations to encourage referrals to RETAIN. The Chamber of Commerce helps program staff engage with employers who can refer their employees. Two additional medical providers, CHI St. Joseph Medical Group and Frazier Rehabilitation Institute, both refer potentially eligible patients and staff. Unite Us is an online platform for social support organizations. Participating organizations can use the platform to refer clients to RETAIN KY. Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 36 Program leaders are focused on promoting and sustaining systems changes that support SAW/RTW. They established the Inclusive Work Health Leadership Network, which includes medical professionals, public health leaders, and employers who collaborate to identify best practices and policy priority areas for building a workforce inclusive of workers with disabilities or at risk of developing a disability. They worked with the University of Kentucky to develop an RTW certificate to expand workforce capacity and understanding of SAW/RTW principles among students in medicine, public health, nursing, health sciences, education, business and economics, law, and pharmacy. 4. Coordination of program partners The lead agency and lead workforce partner have a longstanding relationship and stay coordinated through regular meetings. The project leadership team, made up of staff from the lead agency and lead workforce partner, meets regularly to review the work plan from their approved Phase 2 proposal, assess progress on goals and identify ri sks to accomplishing them timely, and discuss operational challenges and potential solutions. During this meeting, the lead RTW coordinator shares challenges and feedback from the RTW coordinators, including how the management information system (the case management data system, CMDS) could better support service delivery. C. Program environment surround RETAIN KY 1. Employment and policy environment In Kentucky, about one-third of working -age people with disabilities were employed in 202 1, a rate lower than the national average (Exhibit IV .2). Kentucky recently became an Employment First State, meaning that employment is the first and preferred option for people with disabilitie s. Program leaders view this development as providing momentum for RETAIN and supporting its long-term sustainability. Program staff and partners described a range of barriers to work for people with disabilities, including lack of transportation, employer stigma around disability, and local cultural expectations of applying for SSDI benefits instead of returning to work. Exhibit IV.2.

COVID-19 pandemic The COVID- 19 vaccination rate in Kentucky is 58 percent, which is lower than the 6 7 percent vaccination rate nationwide.16 16 Johns Hopkins Unive rsity April 28, 2022. Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 37 Program leaders and staff described mixed effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic on RETAIN KY. In Phase 1, the program shifted to virtual recruitment of referral sources and RTW service delivery. Most recruitment and service delivery remain in a virtual format in Phase 2, which poses challenges to forgin g connections and conducting assistive technology assessments for activities of daily living and work accommodations . However, virtual outreach and service delivery enable the program to have a statewide reach. At the same time, the pandemic has reportedly contributed to burnout among health care providers, employers, and workers, who struggle to prioritize RETAIN with other demands on their time . Program leaders and staff said the COVID-19 pandemic also had mixed effects on work opportunities for RETAIN enrollees. It has reportedly increased remote work opportunities and employers' acceptance of remote work. This alleviates some barriers to work, such as transportation and the need for certain accommodations. However, they said it has made some enrollees experience greater stress and anxiety about work, including concerns about exposure to COVID -19 in a job setting. P rogram leaders and staff also described the pandemic as having adverse effect s on mental health, substance use, and domestic violence in Kentucky . D. RETAIN KY's enrollment is slow but expected to increase after partner health systems embed referrals into the electronic medical record The primary sources of referrals are from clinical support staff at the two lead health care partners, University of Kentucky HealthCare and University of Louisville. RETAIN KY seeks to enroll any worker with illness or injury who comes into contact with various referral sources or program outreach materials. This focus has not changed since the start of Phase 2 enrollment. A summary of the recruitment and enrollment process is included in Appendix B (Exhibit B.2). 1. Early enrollment outcomes During the first nine months of enrollment (October 18, 2021, through June 30, 2022) , RETAIN KY enrolled 200 workers, or 6 percent of its goal of enrolling 3,200 workers. The first nine months of enrollment represent about one -third (28 percent) of the total 32-month enrollment period. Approximately 51 percent of all enrollees were treatment enrollees and 49 percent were control enrollees (Appendix B Exhibit B.3). 2. Outreach strategies RETAIN KY uses a combination of outreach materials and events to engage potential enrollees and referral sources, including medical providers, employers, community organizations, and workers. Program staff described the materials as using non -stigmatizing language, being available in multiple languages, and including a quick response (QR) bar co de that links potential enrollees to screening questions and an opportunity to request outreach. The lead workforce partner regularly engages with employers to encourage them to refer workers to RETAIN. Program staff host a virtual monthly employment seminar series to build awareness of RETAIN among employers and reinforce SAW/RTW best practices. Staff also meet with employers and workforce groups to educate them about RETAIN and encourage them to refer workers. For exampl e, program staff said the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce created an opportunity for them to present to more than 260 employers. Program staff reported that employers viewed RETAIN as beneficial. Program leaders said direct supervisors of enrollees appreciate that RETAIN facilitates their conversations with human resources staff Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 38 about an enrollee's job functions and SAW/RTW best practices. Employers are interested in learning about how to support workers with long COVID symptoms and see RETAIN as an opportunity to do so. 3. Strategies for recruiting underserved populations Program staff conduct outreach to organizations that serve underserved populations. They have provided outreach materials to Family Resource Centers, which are located in public schools th roughout the state and provide support to students and families in need. Program staff have also outreached to the Kentucky Rural Health Association, which focuses on equitable access to health care for people who live in rural underserved areas. In addition, program staff have worked with other entities \u2014including University of Kentucky extension offices, libraries, and police departments\u2014to disseminate the outreach materials to local communities and vulnerable populations. To date, these efforts have generated a limited number of referrals. 4. Referral sources Clinical support staff (for example, nurses and case managers) at the two lead health care partners are the primary sources of referrals. Providers also refer patients. Program staff and partners sai d providers and clinical support staff offer patients program materials that include a QR code to self-refer to the program. Program staff and partners expect referrals to increase after the health systems embed a referral to RETAIN into the EMR, allowing providers and staff to refer patients to RETAIN during medical appointments. 17 5. Screening for eligibility The RETAIN KY program enrolls workers with an injury or illness unrelated to work. Intake coordinators review referral information to screen for eligibility. Eligible workers must be employed within the last 12 months with earnings of $1,000 or more in at least one month and live in Kentucky. This focus complements Kentucky's workers' compensation system, which supports SAW/RTW for workers with work -related injuries or illnesses. In early 2022, DOL allowed the state to enroll workers who applied for or were already receiving SSDI benefits. 18 One program partner explained that the time between an individual's application for SSDI benefit s and SSA's decision (the claim adjudication period) is lengthy, and it is possible to help someone stay at work or return to work during that period. However, one program staff person noted that RETAIN is designed to help workers early in the onset of dis ability to potentially prevent applications for SSDI or receipt of SSDI. Enrolling workers who already applied for or are receiving SSDI could affect the program's impact on future applications for SSDI and receipt of SSDI. The primary challenge with confi rming eligibility is that it can be difficult for intake coordinators to reach potential enrollees . For example, some potential enrollees are still in the hospital and have limited follows up with the referral source for other contact information. Program staff said it is helpful that intake coordinators are persistent in trying to reach potential enrollees in multiple ways through multiple contact 17 University of Louisville Health added this feature into its EMR in March 2022, allowing providers to refer patients to RETAIN during medical appointments. U niversity of Kentucky Health Care will also embed a referral into its EMR this summer after delaying the change due to shifting priorities, including COVID -19 response. 18 DOL updated the guidance to states in May 2022 to exclude workers who applied for or were already receiving SSDI benefits. As of June 2022, 7.9 percent of treatment enrollees were receiving SSDI or SSI and 21.8 percent had applied for or received SSDI or SSI in the past three years. Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 39 attempts, and they ask potential enrollees for their availability to speak with them about RETAIN. Intake coordinators use a script to help them explain RETAIN and its benefits to potential enrollees . Another challenge to screening potential enrollees is determining whether it is too early in their recovery to benefit from RETAIN. The eligibility criteria do not address medical readiness for work. Program staff described enrollees who had been referred too early in their recovery to benefit from RTW services (for example, those who experienced traumatic brain injury, stroke, or amputation). 19 Program staff and partners said it is helpf ul to have the potential enrollee and their referring provider determine if it is a good time receive RETAIN services. \"[Some] individuals who have been referred to us are still in the hospital and receiving therapy. . . Sometimes the challenge is reaching those people, and catching them at a time that works for them to spend a few minutes. . . explain[ing] the program. . . I think [the challenge is] catching people at the time when we can most benefit them and telling them how we can help them.\" Program Leader 6. Recruitm ent Some workers are reluctant to agree to be referred to or enroll in RETAIN KY. Program staff and partners said that some potential enrollees did not want to be part of a research study. Others were uncomfortable about the possibility they could be assigned to the control group because RETAIN is a research study and not a program. To address these concerns, program staff have adapted the messaging to encourage reluctant workers and avoid the term \"control group\" and instead describe expedited services. Other workers simply were not interested in RETAIN services. Program staff reported that some potential enrollees thought they ha d the resources they need ed to stay at work/return to work or preferred to avoid viewing their illness or injury as a disability due to perceived stigma. Other potential enrollees were not interested in returning to work. They said some workers preferred to avoid returning to work because of the stress and anxiety they experienced working during the pandemic. Some workers reportedly followed peers or family members who applied for and received disability benefits, instead of returning to work. Referrals from trusted sources are helpful for enrollment. Program staff and partners said that patients tend to follow up on a referral to RETAIN when it comes from a trusted provider. In addition, workers who hear about RETAIN from a family member or someone else who has benefited from RETAIN are likely to enroll. 7. Treatment enrollee characteristics We used enrollment data submitted by RETAIN KY to assess demographic characteristics for the 101 people who enrolled during the first nine months of the enrollment period ( October 2021 to June 2022) and were assigned to the treatment group (Appendix B , Exhibit B.4). A little more than half of the treatment enrollees were male (51 percent). The average age of the treatment enrollees was 4 5, and 41 percent were age 50 or older. Most were either W hite, non -Hispanic ( 57 percent) or Black, non-Hispanic (23 percent) (Exhibit IV.3 ). Most of the treatment enrollees had at least a high school diploma, GED, or certificate of completion (9 2 percent) , and almost all p referred English (97 percent). 19 Intake coordinators invite people not ready for RTW to call back in the future.

RETAIN KY = Kentucky Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network . We also used the enrollment data submitted by RETAIN KY to assess illness and injury characteristics for the same 101 treatment enrollees (Appendix B, Exhibit B.5). The RETAIN KY program enrolls workers with an injury or illness unrelated to work, but 4 percent of enrollees reported their injury or illness was work related. Nearly half of treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a condition that did not fall under RETAIN's four identified primary diagnosis categories (Exhibit IV.4). About one - quarter of enrollees reported that their primary diagnosis was a mental condition (27 percent). People with a new or pre-existing condition are eligible for enrollment. For RETAIN KY, half of enrollees reported their illness or injury was a new condition at t he time of enrollment (50 percent). Many of the RETAIN KY enrollees reported primary conditions that are not a recent diagnosis. Treatment enrollees reported an average of about five years (1,868 days) between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrol lment in RETAIN KY. 20 Even among enrollees with a new condition, the average time between diagnosis and enrollment exceeds a year. 21 20 In all, 38 of the 101 treatment enrollees (38 percent) in RETAIN KY reported that the onset of th eir primary diagnosis occurred before 2020. RETAIN KY confirmed that this finding is a result of a data entry error that was corrected in July 2022. The enrollment data submitted by RETAIN KY before June 2022, which is included in this report, was not retr oactively corrected. 21 New conditions in the RETAIN KY enrollment data include onset of primary diagnosis dates from 2002 to 2022.

Note: We s uppressed the Long COVID category to avoid disclosing information about particular people, which is why percentages do not add to 100. Note: We classify ICD -10 codes into five Musculoskeletal, back; Musculoskeletal, non-back; Long COVID; Mental; and Other. These groupings build on previous studies of return to work among injured or ill workers. We include the mapping of ICD -10 codes into these categories in Appendix B, Exhibit 5. ICD = International Classification of Diseases; RETAIN KY = Kentucky Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. We also used enrollment data submitted by RETAIN KY to assess recent work histories for the same 101 treatment enrollees described above (Appendix B, Exhibit B.6). All RETAIN programs must enroll workers who are employed or in the labor force , and, for RETAIN KY, many treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment (69 percent). A little less than half of treatment enrolle es worked within one month of enrollment (44 percent), and many last worked within three months of enrollment (71 percent) (Exhibit IV.5). On average, treatment enrollees were employed close to full-time (37 hours per week) before onset of injury or illnes s. A little more than half of enrollees worked at their current job or most recent job for two years or less (52 percent), and 29 percent worked at their current job for more than five years. In the year before enrollment, many treatment enrollees (74 percent) worked at a job that paid at least $1,000 per month. The highest proportion of treatment enrollees held a service occupation (35 percent) (Exhibit IV.6.). Other treatment enrollees held occupations in management, professional, or related (26 percent); production, transportation, or material moving (26 percent); natural resources, construction, or maintenance (5 percent); or sales and office (9 percent).

R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 43 We also used enrollment data to compare treatment enrollees' characteristics with control enrollees' characteristics. As outlined in the Evaluation Design Report, we expected treatment and control enrollees to have similar baseline characteristics because each state has a random assignment design (Berk et al. 2021) . We found no significant differences between treatment and control enrollees (Appendix B, Exhibit B.4, Exhibit B.5, and Exhibit B.6). E. RETAIN KY's early service delivery is going as planned with the exception of a delay in the availability of medical provider training At the time of the interviews in April 2022, program staff were implementing RTW coordination services as planned in the RETAIN KY program model. Enrollee reluctance to sign release of information forms might be limiting the contrast between services to the treatment and control groups, but the extent of this issue is not yet clear. Program staff were providing outreach about RETAIN to medical providers, but training emphasizing SAW/RTW practice s was delayed in review to be approved for continuing medical education credits. 1. Medical provider services Lead workforce partner staff provide outreach to medical providers about RETAIN (Exhibit IV.7). They share the benefits of providing SAW/RTW coordination services to workers who are injured or ill and information about how they can refer patients to the program. Exhibit IV.7 . RETAIN KY medical provider services Program component Description Training medical providers Practitioner will be able access in-person and/or online training covering SAW/RTW best practices and the RETAIN program (such as referral processes). The University of Louisville Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation physicians' group will train residents to offer alternative treatments to opioids to all patients, including RETAIN treatment and control enrollees. Incentivizing medical providers The lead workforce partner will offer compensation to practitioners who complete post - training surveys on knowledge of occupational health best practices and satisfaction with training: $100 for post -survey 1 and $50 for post -survey 2 (60 days later). RETAIN KY = Kentucky Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network ; RTW = return to work; SAW = stay at work. The planned medical provider training on SAW/RTW best practices is in review to be approved for continuing medical education credits .22 Lead workforce partner staff revised the training used in Phase 1 and sought approval to offer continuing medical education credits as an incentive to complete the training. The program will offer incentive payments to medical providers who also complete two surveys after completing the SAW/RTW best practices training. The surveys will gather feedback on the training and assess how medical providers use the information in their practice. To date, RETAIN KY has not provided any incentive payments but expects to do so when the training is approved for continuing medical education credit. 22 Program staff introduce RETAIN KY to medical providers as part of other forums, such as grand rounds and larger training events. Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 44 2. RTW coordination services Nine RTW coordinators provide enhanced services to treatment enrollees (Exhibit IV.8) . Enhanced services include developing an RTW plan and communicating with the enrollee's employer, medical provider, and others to coordinate their SAW/RTW services as needed. Enhanced RTW services end after six months or when the treatment enrollee returns to work with a completed RTW plan, whichever comes first. Exhibit IV.8 . RETAIN KY RTW coordination services Program component Description Coordinating RTW services RTW coordinator engages with the treatment enrollee and reviews their medical information and work restrictions to develop an individualized RTW plan. The plan outlines the steps for the treatment enrollee to maintain employment, including an RTW date and services needed. RTW coordinator communicates with treatment group member weekly using individual's preferred contact method. RTW coordinator assists the treatment enrollee with addressing social needs that may pose barriers to their participation in RETAIN or RTW (such as housing, rent, food, transportation, child care, clothing, and mental health services). Communicating among parties involved in RTW plan RTW coordinator contacts the treatment enrollee's employer, medical provider, and others involved in their RTW plan. RTW coordinator communicates with short - and long- term disability insurance carriers on behalf of the treatment enrollee. RTW coordinator trains the treatment enrollee on self -advocacy skills and encourages them to communicate with others involved in their RTW plan. The RETAIN database includes flags to alert RTW coordinators of any communication or information- sharing issues among others involved in a treatment enrollee's RTW plan. Monitoring treatment enrollee progress RTW coordinators monitor treatment enrollees' progress through weekly communications . The coordinator asks the enrollee a list of questions about recent medical appointments and the status of steps the enrollee has been working on. RTW coordinator records every interaction with treatment enrollee, their employer and medical provider (such as requests for job descriptions, the enrollee's paid time-off or leave status, work restrictions, workplace accommodation needs, and the enrollee's eligibility for returning to work or rehire) into the CMDS . RTW coordinator uses t he CMDS to track modifications to RTW plans, accommodations, and concerns about the enrollee's safety. CMDS = case management data system; RETAIN KY = Kentucky Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work. Program staff said that the opportunity for RTW coordinators to take ongoing trainings helps foster a growth-oriented environment. RTW coordinators receive intensive training on an evidence -based vocational case management approach called the Crux model. 23 Ongoing trainings cover a range of topics including the CMDS, inclusive communication, universal design, interacting with the criminal justice system, long COVID, and managing mental health and s ubstance use challenges in the workplace. Trainings have given RTW coordinators and other program staff an opportunity to connect. At the same time, the virtual training format sometimes makes it more difficult for staff to engage in the content. 23 The Crux model is centered on the worker's needs and interests and has been used for about 30 years since being developed by staff at the lead workforce partner. Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 45 a. Coordinating RTW services Program data submitted by RETAIN KY indicate that most treatment enrollees (90 percent) received RETAIN KY services, including RTW coordination services or other RTW services (Exhibit IV. 9). Most treatment enrollees (89 percent) had an established RTW plan. An average of 3.9 days elapsed between enrollment to establishment of an RTW plan for treatment enrollees in RETAIN KY. As of the end of June 2022, about 43 percent of treatment enrollees had exited RETAIN KY. Treatment enrollees who exited the program received services for about 64 days (about two months). Exhibit IV.9 .

The RTW coordinators' diverse personal and professional backgrounds reportedly help them understand enrollees' unique situations and the barriers they face in returning to work. The coordina tors come from multiple races , ethnicities , and language backgrounds and have past roles in social work, VR, and occupational therapy. Program leaders said that these backgrounds help RTW coordinators provide services that appeal to a diverse set of enrollees. \"Teaming up with [enrollees], and helping them ... helps to build that rapport, and ... once they are able to feel at least comfortable in talking with us, and that trying to get some of these programs in place to assist them with their rent or the utility bills, then we can move forward with the other issues which is how are things going with the job, what do you need to be able to do to get back to work, communicating, getting information about their position, about their work.\" Program Staff RTW co ordinators work to establish trust with enrollees. Program staff said they build trust by expressing a sincere desire to help, offering support without judgment, and explaining their goal is to empower the enrollee to be successful after their involvement with RETAIN KY services ends. Program leaders and staff observed that trust builds as enrollees see the RTW coordinator listening to them and prioritizing their needs. Establishing trust with enrollees reportedly helps RTW coordinators to achieve a deeper understanding of the enrollee's situation, needed services, and progress. RTW coordinators connect enrollees with resources to address social needs as a necessary complement to support ing their work -related needs. According to program staff, many treatment enrollees experience unmet social needs that prevent them from staying at work or returning to work, such as mental health Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 46 conditions, substance use disorders, food insecurity, and homelessness. Program staff said the Unite Us platform helps RTW coordinators make these referrals.24 Program staff reported that RTW coordinators were well-supported in delivering services. Program staff said RTW coordinators regularly consult with each other and other experts, such as an assistive technology specialist, a peer mentor, and a mental health consultant who is an expert on mental health and substance use disorders . They hold weekly case reviews with provider champions from the partner health systems to present challenging cases. Provider champions reportedly share their insights with RTW coordinators on what they might be missing about the case or could be doing better. Program leaders and staff said both RTW coordinators and provider champions benefit from this dialogue, which deepens their mutual understanding of the many issues involved in s taying at work or returning to work. \"These coordinators...talk about their cases, and they brainstorm, and they reach out to each other, and so ...there's always going to be somebody who can chime in and be helpful.\" Program Leader b. Communi cation among parties involved in enrollee return to work In Exhibit IV.10, we list the possible avenues of communication among RTW coordinators and others involved in enrollees' RTW plans, namely the employe r and medical provider. We also list the percentage of reported communications that occurred in each as reported in the program data submitted by RETAIN KY. Based on service use data from RETAIN KY, RTW coordinators communicated with a medical provider at least once for 67 percent of treatment enrollees, with a workforce professional at least once for 18 percent of enrollees, and with an employer at least once for 12 percent of enrollees. Exhibit IV.10 .

RETAIN KY = Kentucky Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work. Before RTW coordin ators can communicate with employers and medical providers, treatment enrollees must sign release of information forms, but some treatment enrollees were hesitant to sign these releases. 25 For example, some enrollees were uncomfortable providing access to their medical records and others were concerned about identity theft. The enrollee can electronically sign different releases and update their releases at any time; releases for mental health care require a wet signature. Several program staff said that some initially hesitant treatment enrollees provided permission after establishing trust with the RTW coordinator over the first few meetings. However, another staff person estimated that more than 24 Unite Us is an online platform for referrals from community agencies to RETAIN and from RTW coordinators to community agencies. 25 Enrollees receive an email with a link to a release of information form stored securely in the CMDS . The form contains separate releases for each person the RTW coordinator may want to contact. Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 47 half of treatment enrollees d id not sign the release at any point. In these cases, program staff said RTW coordinators work with enrollees to advocate for themselves. Once enrollees sign release of information forms, RTW coordinators have reportedly encountered only minor challenges in communicating with others involved in enrollees' RTW plans. Program staff said once RTW coordinators receive a completed release form from the enrollee, they contact the employee's employer, medical provider, or workforce professional and introduce themselves. For example, the RTW coordinator might contact the medical provider for information on the enrollee's health situation that informs expectations for the enrollee's RTW. Some RTW coordinators found employers to be hesitant about the costs, effort, or legal implications involved in SAW/RTW for their enrollees. These RTW coordinators reportedly avoid using legal terms and instead emphasize how they can partner with employers and show how RETAIN benefits them. The RTW coordinators also seek permission to contact decision makers within the employer organization, such as the human resources department, and not just an enrollee's direct supervisor. RTW coordinators value a written resource on job accommodations to supp ort communications with employers. Staff at the lead workforce partner developed a resource, called the \"Win -Win Approach to Reasonable Accommodations,\" before RETAIN. 26 Program staff said the resource is helpful to framing conversations when they communicate directly with an employer on behalf of an enrollee, join the enrollee and the employer on a conference call, or coach enrollees to speak with their employer. c. Monitoring treatment enrollee progress Program staff said features in the CMDS are helpful for tracking and assessing enrollee progress. CMDS includes checklists and helps RTW coordinators organize notes and document their contacts with enrollees. It also provides a one -page snapshot of recent, relevant information about each enrollee and sends RTW coordinators notifications to remind them of follow -up steps related to the enrollee's RTW plan. 3. Other RTW services Designated RTW coordinators provide employment services to treatment enrollees (Exhibit IV.11). Three of the nine RTW coordi nators ( called senior RTW coordinators) are assigned to treatment enrollees who are unemployed or seeking a job transition. RTW coordinators infrequently refer enrollees to OVR for services during the six -month enrollment period. They make these referrals when an enrollee needs services that cannot be paid for by RETAIN, such as a driving evaluation or power wheelchair. RTW coordinators refer enrollees to OVR at the end of the six -month intervention period if they need longer -term services. Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 48 Exhibit IV. 11. RETAIN KY other RTW services Program component Description Supporting workplace- based interventions RTW coordinator can refer to a part -time assistive technology specialist at the lead workforce partner who supports enrollees who experienced a loss of functioning (for example, loss of vision or use of hands). RTW coordinator and assistive technology specialist engages with treatment enrollee's employer, consult s on physical requirements of their job, reviews workplace accommodations and assistive technology, and assists with reassignment to other positions or temporar ily modified dut ies and how to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees Senior RTW coordinators provide treatment enrollees looking for work with job development and placement assistance, workplace accommodation planning, and transferable skills analysis. State -specific services: p eer mentor support RTW coordinators refer all interested treatment enrollees to a peer mentor employed at the lead workforce partner. The peer mentor draws on lived experience with a disability to support treatment enrollees with the psychosocial aspects of experiencing a disability. RETAIN KY = Kentucky Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Netw ork; RTW = return to work. a. Supporting workplace -based interventions RTW coordinators help treatment enrollees request job accommodations using the Job Accommodation Network. Program staff said RTW coordinators offer a Job Accommodation Network referral to treatment enrollees who identify work activities that would be difficult to perform with their health conditions but have not developed a solution with their employer. Depending on the enrollee's preference, the coordinator contacts the employer, joins a c onference call between the enrollee and the employer, or advises the enrollee on how to self -advocate with the employer. Program staff noted several challenges to providing this service, such as when employers believe they are already providing adequate support without RETAIN (for example, through human resources or employee assistance programs). They also noted that some enrollees prefer to advocate for themselves with their employer because they are concerned that the RTW coordinator's involvement will cr eate unintended challenges with their employer. Service use data from RETAIN KY indicated that 21 percent of treatment enrollees received a workplace accommodation. Exhibit IV.12 .

Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees Three of the RTW coordinators served treatment enrollees facing unemployment. The coordinators provide d services such as resume building and help finding a job. Service use data from RETAIN KY indicated that about 20 percent of enrollees received job search services. Enrollees also received training services (16 percent), and some participated in a transitional work opportunity (7 percent) (Exhibit IV. 13). Exhibit IV.13 .

Note: Among the 101 treatment enrollees, 19 of them (18.8 percent) received more than one of the four services listed and 11 of them (10.9 percent) received only one of the four services. a A transitional work opportunity is a time-limited job at a new employer during an enrollee's recovery period to meet the enrollee's work restrictions until their employer is able to provide work accommodations. RETAIN KY = Kentucky Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network . 4. Service contrast Two RTW coordinators dedicated to serving only control enrollees provide an expedited version of RTW coordination services to control enrollees for a two -week period.27 Expedited services consist of two meetings that include a work experience survey, development of an RTW plan, guidance on self - advocating with their employer , and referrals to other services. Treatment enrollees receive the same set of services over a longer period ( six months) , and the RTW coordinator communicates on the enrollee's behalf with the medic al provider, employer, and others (if permitted). The challenges of treatment enrollees not signing information release forms described above could lead to a low contrast between enhanced RTW services for treatment enrollees and expedited services for cont rol enrollees. Specifically, RTW coordinators cannot communicate with medical providers or employers about treatment enrollees who decline to sign information release forms; instead, they provide guidance to the enrollee on advocating for themselves. In these situations, the main difference between expedited and enhanced services is the duration. However, the extent to which this issue diminishes the treatment contrast is unclear. Beyond expedited services, control enrollees have access to other work -relat ed services available in Kentucky to people with disabilities. Program staff described several entities that provide work-related services to people with disabilities in the state. The Kentucky Career Center provides employment services that are reportedly less individualized and less comprehensive than RETAIN. Like RETAIN KY, OVR provides individualized services to workers with injuries or illnesses unrelated to work. However, program staff said it can take months to receive services from OVR, in contrast to the early intervention 27 Program leaders said the presence of the expedited services for control enrollees helps promote referrals to the program; it provided reassurance that any referral who enrolled could receive at least some services. Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 50 offered by RETAIN . RETAIN services include more coordination and are more comprehensive, and RTW coordinators carry smaller caseloads than OVR counselors, according to program staff. RTW coordinators provide referrals to OVR for l ong-term services after an enrollee's six months with RETAIN ends. 5. Collecting and reporting program data The CMDS is working effectively to collect and report the data elements required for the evaluation. The lead workforce partner developed the CMDS for Phase 2. Program staff continue to refine the CMDS based on user feedback. The intake coordinators must enter a limited amount of duplicate information into CMDS and Confirmit (for random assignment into RETAIN); however, they have not found this overly burdensome. Program staff uniformly describe the system as user -friendly for delivering RTW services and recording information. RETAIN KY initially was unable to provide complete unemployment insurance (UI) wage data on schedule to support the RETAI N evaluation in Phase 2. These data come from the Kentucky Education and Workforce Development Cabinet. Program staff said that due to staff turnover in the Cabinet and among RETAIN KY staff, they devoted time and effort to educating the new state Cabinet staff on the process and the need for the data. The Cabinet and RETAIN KY staff have successfully submitted one- quarter of the data and are working on a second. F. Areas for continued monitoring and evaluation technical assistance Our analysis of the int erview data collected in April 2022 and enrollment data collected through June 2022 raised several issues that could affect the impact evaluation. The Mathematica team will continue to monitor these issues and provide evaluation technical assistance as needed. Early enrollment is low relative to the goal of 3,200 enrollees. As of June 30, 2022, RETAIN KY reached 6.3 percent of the target, while it reached 28 percent of the target through its 32 -month enrollment period. If the program's enrollment continues at the current level, there is a high chance that the evaluation will fail to detect a true effect that is large enough to be important to policymakers. RETAIN KY might have enrolled some workers unlikely to benefit from RETAIN because they have already applied for or currently receive SSDI benefits. The program is designed to prevent applications for and receipt of SSDI benefits. The extent to which the program enrolls workers who have applied for or are already receiving SSDI benefits will reduce its im pact on this outcome. In May 2022, DOL provided guidance that the program should no longer enroll workers who have applied for or currently receive SSDI benefits. The evaluation team will continue to monitor enrollments for this situation moving forward. RETAIN KY is not yet implementing provider training or RTW service coordination as planned. As of April 2022, provider training associated with continuing medical education credits was delayed but expected to be available soon. RTW service coordination was underway, but a substantial portion of treatment enrollees had not provided a release of information allowing RTW coordinators to communicate with medical providers and employers. This was preventing RTW coordinators from providing all planned coordinati on services to treatment enrollees and could limit the contrast between the RTW services provided to the treatment and control groups. These changes to the program model could reduce the impact of RETAIN KY. Chapter IV. R ETAIN Kentucky Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 51 RETAIN KY may be enrolling more people with a lo ngstanding primary diagnosis than expected for an early intervention program. As of June 30, 2022, treatment enrollees had an average of about five years (1,868 days) between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrollment. We could not deduce the reason treatment enrollees had an unexpectedly high number of days between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrollment using the data we collected so far. The evaluation team will continue to monitor enrollments for this situation moving forward. 28 28 In addition, RETAIN KY provided training to staff to improve the accuracy of information about the onset of enrollees' primary diagnosis. This page has been left blank for double -sided copying . Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 53 V. Minnesota RETAIN Key findings Program partners shared a commitment to MN RETAIN that helped them overcome coordination challenges early in Phase 2. Program leaders and staff said a dedicated grant coordinator and a meeting structure that support ed program -wide communication a nd subcomm ittees facilitated coordination. Recruitment staff at t he lead health care partner, the Mayo Clinic, used a patient registry to identify potentially eligible patients; this was the primary source of referrals. They faced challenges engaging Mayo Clinic and external medical providers to make referrals. During the first seven months of enrollment (December 2021 through June 2022), MN RETAIN enrolled 283 workers, 9 percent of its enrollment goal, which was lower than expect ed. A key enrollment challenge was that eligible workers frequently did not attend their first scheduled appointment with the RTW coordinator to complete enrollment. MN RETAIN's continuous quality improvement committee focused on overcoming this challenge. Program leaders and staff expect ed program referrals and enrollment to increase as a result of their ongoing efforts to engage medical providers, employers, and diverse communities throughout the state. Most treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition. Treatment enrollees had an average of 32 days between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrollment. Many treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment, with the highest proportion of treatment enrollees holding a management, professional, or related occupation. All treatment enrollees received MN RETAIN services beyond enrollment, and almost all received employment services. However, MN RETAIN did not report any workplace accommodations. RTW coordinators and the employment counselor received positive feedback from treatment enrollees about their experiences in MN RETAIN. At the time of the interviews, 23 of about 90 treatment enrollees had returned to work. Lack of medical provider participation in MN RETAIN training and communication with treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators might have result ed in low use of occupational medicine best practices early in a medical provider's treatment of enrollees. This could have reduce d the impact of MN RETAIN . A. Overview of Minnesota RETAIN The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development is the lead agency for Minnesota RETAIN (MN RETAIN). The intended population comprises employed adults ages 18 and older who have a diagnosis of an injury or il lness (work - or non- work -related) that affects their employment. MN RETAIN provides RTW coordination services to all treatment enrollees and job transition services and financial support to treatment enrollees as needed through referrals from the RTW coord inators. The program catchment area is the entire state of Minnesota, including 87 counties. Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 54 This chapter presents findings about the initial implementation of MN RETAIN. It documents recruitment, enrollment, and program operations roughly seven months after enrollment began.29 B. MN RETAIN established partnerships to support enrollment and service delivery As the lead agency for MN RETAIN, the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development obtained signed memoranda of understanding and lette rs of commitment from several organizations to support MN RETAIN implementation prior to submitting its Phase 2 application (Exhibit V.1). In this section, we describe these partner organizations and their roles on MN RETAIN. Exhibit V.1 . MN RETAIN organization chart 1. Lead h ea lth care partner The lead health care partner, Mayo Clinic, is a large health system. It supports implementation by providing expertise in occupational medicine and oversight of (1) recruiting, engaging, and training medical providers ; (2) recruiting, trainin g, and managing RTW coordinators; and (3) screening, 29 MN RETAIN enrolled the first participant on December 23, 2021. We collected qualitative data about the program implementation experiences of leaders, staff, and partners in April 2022 and quantitative data about enrollment through June 2022. Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 55 recruiting, and enrolling eligible workers. Two provider champions promote MN RETAIN across the state's medical providers by attending various meetings to share information about MN RETAIN. Through the subrecipient contracts with medical providers, MN RETAIN aims to expand RTW coordination service delivery across the state. MN RETAIN designated funding within the overall budget to ensure it could provide subrecipients with sufficient staffing to support the program, including, recruitment staff to recruit and enroll patients and RTW coordinators to deliver RTW coordination services. Program leaders proposed two possible staffing models for subrecipients. Subrecipients wi ll either staff these roles or contract with staff employed and trained by the lead health care partner, Mayo Clinic. If the subrecipient contracts with staff employed by the lead health care partner, the subrecipients would ideally give those staff access to their EMRs to facilitate patient recruitment and communication between RTW coordinators and enrolled patients' medical providers. Program leaders planned to work with individual subrecipients to determine the appropriate staffing model. To recruit subrecipients, the lead health care partner sent postcards to 4,000 individual providers and 400 provider organizations throughout the state soliciting them to become a subrecipient on MN RETAIN. At the time of the interviews, MN RETAIN received applications from three medical providers to become subrecipients. These three providers include a small medical practice in the state's southeast region, a large health care provider in the central region, and a chiropractic network with about 100 practices throughout the state. The provider champions held outreach meetings with tribal leaders and medical providers who serve Native American communities in an effort to recruit them as subrecipients. The tribal leaders and medical providers were receptive to the goals of MN RETAIN . However, due to a lack of employment opportunities in Native American communities, they perceived the program would not benefit members of those communities. \"...that's part of our strategy and the way we've looked at [promoting RETAIN] both with patients and with providers is that it's ongoing marketing or education, depending on how you look at it, a challenge you can never really let up. So you can't just, \"Oh well, we'll do a webinar and that's it.\" It's all of the above, you know, it's a webinar, it's phone calls, it's at a conference, it's at a community event [...] we have to keep getting the word out.\" -Program Leader Prog ram leaders acknowledged that provider engagement in MN RETAIN will involve a commitment to ongoin g marketing and education. Provider champions know that they are competing with other improvement initiatives seeking providers' attention. They described plans to continue to present via webinars, conferences, and community events to promote MN RETAIN amo ng medical providers. They also are asking medical providers who had positive experiences with having patients enrolled in MN RETAIN to share their experiences with their peers; one program leader believed that this was the most effective provider recruitment method. 2. Lead workforce partner The lead workforce partner, Workforce Development, Inc., provides job transition services and financial support to treatment enrollees through referrals from the RTW coordinators. The lead workforce partner is establishing a subrecipient partner contract with Goodwill -Easter Seals Minnesota to expand workforce development service capacity and the availability of in-person workforce development services to treatment enrollees throughout the state. Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 56 3. Employer partners Program leaders and staff hope to grow the presence of MN RETAIN among employers across the state by recruiting a coalition of employer champions. The employer champion's role involves supporting work accommodations for injured or ill employees , making the program a visible resource for employees, providing transitional work opportunities to treatment enrollees, and promoting MN RETAIN among other employers . MN RETAIN has one employer champion who is the chief executive officer for a network of senior living communities , Crest View Senior Care. Program leaders and staff said MN RETAIN has two additional employers interested in acting as employer champions, and at the time of the interviews, they had a meeting scheduled with another large employer interested in this role. To engage employers in MN RETAIN, the lead agency , the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, conducted a needs assessment of employer s, hired an employer engagement specialist, and started tracking the industries that employ enrollees . The employer engagement specialist is drawing on his experience and contacts from his previous employer engagement role, and findings from the needs assessment to connect with employers across the state. He is also working with Minn esota's regional employer engagement specialists who have a framework for connecting with different employers throughout the state and ensuring that the state's workforce development network knows that MN RETAIN is available. Program staff noted that the e mployer engagement specialist brings knowledge of work accommodations, has been proactive, and has made a lot of employer contacts in the short amount of time he has worked on MN RETAIN. Despite the comprehensive strategy, program leaders and staff described employer engagement in MN RETAIN as slow. They reported that because of the state's tight labor market, employers are prioritizing filling permanent full-time positions over accommodating treatment enrollee's work restrictions or providing transitional work opportunities to enrollees . Program leaders see this as an opportunity to promote MN RETAIN as a program that can improve employee retention. Program staff hope that in the long-term they can engage employers who have experienced the benefit of having an employee who has been helped by MN RETAIN and , through this experience , has a better understanding of work accommodations. 4. Other partners The MN RETAIN advisory board includes two state agencies. The Minnesota Department of Health provides statewide occupational health data to support implementation, including a list of medical providers in Minnesota that program staff used for provider recruitment. The Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry provides guidance to ensure that MN RETAIN does not imp ede workers' compensation law. 5. Coordination of program partners Program leaders, staff, and partners described a shared commitment to MN RETAIN that helped them overcome coordination challenges early in Phase 2. These challenges resulted from partners' different organizational missions and cultures and not having established relationships before working together to implement MN RETAIN. Program leaders and staff noted that this, along with lengthy hiring efforts for the lead agency, initially slowed implementation efforts. However, program leaders, staff, and partners expressed appreciation for the time it took to achieve a shared vision around MN RETAIN and worked to overcome coordination challenges. Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 57 Program leaders and staff described communication as being facilitated by a dedicated grant coordinator and a meeting str ucture that supports program -wide communication as well as focused subcommittees. These meetings include a biweekly leadership meeting with program leaders from the lead agency and the lead health care partner, a monthly meeting with all partners and staff focused on program deliverables, a monthly continuous quality improvement committee meeting, a biweekly communications committee meeting to coordinate community outreach, weekly RTW coordination meetings to discuss individual treatment enrollees' needs, and weekly data management meetings to review data-related issues. C. The program environment surrounding MN RETAIN supports a healthy workforce 1. Employment and policy environment In Minnesota, a lmost half of working-age people with disabilities were em ployed in 2021 , higher than the national average (Exhibit V.2). According to program leaders, compared to other states, Minnesota has a relatively large amount of funding appropriated for employment and training programs seeking to engage different communi ties across the state. Program leaders described state leaders as being committed to supporting a healthy workforce that contributes to the state's economy, including ensuring that workers have access to training and employment services. Program staff described social needs, such as a lack of child care, transportation, and housing, as being the most common barrier to people returning to work. Exhibit V. 2.

RETAIN = Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. 2. COVID-19 pandemic The COVID- 19 vaccination rate in Minnesota is 70 percent, which is higher than the 67 percent vaccination rate nationwide.30 The biggest challenge MN RETAIN faced related to the COVID-19 pandemic was engaging medical providers, employers, and members of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities. Program leaders and staff noted that, in general, MN RETAIN is well -received by medical providers; howeve r, surges in COVID variants created a strain on providers while they were already experiencing staff burnout and turnover. Therefore, medical providers believe they lack the capacity to manage work restrictions. Program leaders and staff said that employer s are also dealing with turnover and are therefore prioritizing filling full-time positions rather than accommodating treatment enrollee's work restrictions or providing transitional work opportunities to enrollees . Program leaders and staff described BIPOC communities as being overwhelmed with the amount of outreach related to public programs that emerged during the pandemic . On the other hand, program staff reported that the pandemic has not negatively 30 Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center , 2022 . Available at Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 58 affected service delivery , and one program leader not ed that the pandemic has increased awareness of the importance of work for health and well -being. D. Program leaders and staff expect enrollment to increase as a result of their efforts to engage medical providers, employers, and diverse communities throughout the state MN RETAIN seeks to enroll workers diagnosed with an injury or illness (work- or non-work -related) . The primary source of referrals is generated from a review of a patient registry maintained by the lead health care partner, Mayo Clinic . Both the lead agency, the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, and lead health care partner are working to expand referral sources. A summary of the recruitment and enrollment process is in Appendix C (Exhibit C.2). 1. Early enrollment outcomes During the first seven months of enrollment (December 2021 through June 2022), MN RETAIN enrolled 283 workers, 9 percent of its goal of enrolling 3,200 workers. The first seven months of enrollment represent about 24 percent of the total enrollment period. Approximately 50 percent of all enrollees were treatment enrollees, and 50 percent were control enro llees (Appendix C, Exhibit C.3). 2. Referral sources The primary source of referrals is a report that program staff generate from a registry maintained within Mayo Clinic's EMR, referred to as the social determinants of health (SDOH) report. Patients of t he Mayo Clinic must answer SDOH screening questions at least once a year. MN RETAIN dedicated resources to adding employment status to the SDOH screening questions and developing an automated algorithm that categorizes patients into low-, medium -, or high-risk classifications based on their responses to the employment status questions. Low risk indicates that the patient is working, medium risk indicates that the patient has not been working for a short period of time, and high risk indicates that the patient has not been working for a while. The recruitment staff generate the SDOH report daily and reach out to potentially eligible medium - and high-risk patients to confirm their eligibility and assess their interest in enrolling in MN RETAIN. Program leaders and staff overwhelmingly cited the addition of employment status in the SDOH screening questions to categorize patients' risk of unemployment as a facilitator in identifying potentially eligible patients. The secondary source of referrals is an o rthopedi cs report, which includes Mayo Clinic patients who have an upcoming orthopedics appointment . The recruitment staff review these patients ' medical records t o determine if they are potentially eligible for MN RETAIN and then reach out to those patients to co nfirm their eligibility and assess their interest in enrolling . Program leaders reported that, at the time of the interviews, MN RETAIN had received just one patient referral from a medical provider. As the provider champions work to engage medical providers across the state, they anticipate that medical providers will become a larger referral source. 3. Outreach strategies MN RETAIN is doing outreach to broaden referral sources to medical providers, employers, and diverse communities across the state. As discussed above, the lead health care partner is recruiting subrecipient medical providers to expand RTW coordination service delivery across the state, which should increase Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 59 referrals of eligible patient s. The employer engagement specialist is also engaging employers in offering MN RETAIN as a resource to employees, which should increase worker self -referrals. In addition to these efforts, program staff work to promote MN RETAIN at community events, such as job fairs and community resource expos. Program leaders and staff described their plans for an MN RETAIN booth at the Minnesota State Fair. The fair operates for 11 days in the late summer , and they expect 100,000 people per day to pass by the booth. Program leaders and staff described their efforts to develop strategies to quickly convey information about MN RETAIN at these events. Multiple program staff (including an RTW coordinator, the employer e ngagement specialist, and the community engagement specialist) attend these events, which program leaders said was an effective strategy, having multidisciplinary representation to answer attendees' questions about MN RETAIN. Program staff are developing a tool to collect names and contact information during these events so they can follow up with people afterward to provide them with more information and potentially enroll them in MN RETAIN \u2014rather than making people stand at the booth for a while to learn about MN RETAIN and confirm their eligibility. In addition, program staff are refining MN RETAIN's social media strategy to ensure that they are regularly updating information about MN RETAIN so program partners can reshare it on their social media outlets. 4. Strategies for recruiting underserved populations The lead agency conducted a needs assessment to inform its strategies for recruiting underserved populations and hired a community engagement specialist dedicated to recruiting underserved populations. Program leaders and staff described their approach to recruiting underserved populations as being intentional to meet the goal of enrolling at least 15 percent of all enrollees from BIPOC communities. They learned from the needs assessment that different communities obtain information in different ways, such as by attending church gatherings, listening to ethnic radio, or reading community newsletters, and they are using these outlets in some communities. Program leaders reported that the community engagem ent specialist is making progress in establishing relationships with leaders of faith - based, immigrant, and racial and ethnic organizations and communities to gain access to these groups. Her efforts include forming a community advisory board that comprise s community leaders who advise on MN RETAIN's equity goals and statewide expansion of the program. Program leaders and staff described intentionally recruiting community advisory board members who were representative of the state's population and respected leaders in their communities. Program staff reported that MN RETAIN may not resonate with BIPOC communities because, for many people in these communities, English is their second language . MN RETAIN does not have staff who can speak the range of languages spoken in the state who can further explain the program . MN RETAIN provides translated materials and recruitment staff , and RTW coordinators have access to a telephone interpreter line . In addition, program staff reported that many people in BIPO C communities are unfamiliar with the Mayo Clinic , which is currently the only MN RETAIN provider , and may therefore be hesitant to participate . 5. Screening for eligibility The MN RETAIN program enrolls workers diagnosed with an injury or illness (work - or non -work - related) that affects their employment. This includes worsening of pre -existing conditions or having had an invasive procedure (including surgery) within the past 12 weeks or anticipating one within eight weeks. Individuals must be employed or in the labor force, age 18 or older, and living and working in Minnesota. Workers with legal representation or an assigned Qualified Rehabilitation Consultant due to a workers' compensation medical condition are ineligible. Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 60 The lead health care partner recently added two recruitment staff whose sole responsibility is to support worker screening and recruitment. Program leaders and staff noted that adding these recruitment staff dramatically increased enrollment, mainly because the recruitment staff could devote more staff hours to identifying and screening patients. Adding the recruitment staff also took the burden from the RTW coordinators of having to review the SDOH and o rthopedics reports to identify and screen patients in addition to completing enrollment and delivering RTW coordination services. The recruitment staff are responsible for reviewing the two reports and calling patients to confirm their eligibility for RETAIN and interest in enrolling. After verifying eligibility, recruitment staff schedule the eligible worker with an RTW coordinator to complete enrollment, often within 24 hours of confirming the worker's eligibility and interest in enrolling. 6. Recruitment Program leaders and staff described the main challenge in enrolling eligible workers into MN RETAIN as getting workers to attend the appointment , during which an RTW coordinator completes their enrollment. At the time of the interviews, 62 workers who were confirmed as eligible and interested in MN RETAIN did not attend the appointment with the RTW coordinator to complete enrollment. The continuous quality improvement committee is focused on overcoming these enrollment challenges and considering various strategies to increase enrollment. These strategies include sending automated letters through the patient portal or mail to patients who meet the s creening criteria before recruitment staff will reach out to them to confirm eligibility and assess their interest in enrolling . Program staff hope that if potentially eligible patients have received information about MN RETAIN before they receive a call f rom recruitment staff, they will be more likely to understand the program and complete enrollment . The letters will be translated into several languages. MN RETAIN started using an online form to collect information from eligible workers while completing enrollment. 31 RTW coordinators previously used a PDF file that they entered information into and then sent to the eligible worker via email for electronic signature during the enrollment call. According to program staff, this change has significantly sped up the enrollment and consent process. 7. Treatment enrollee characteristics We used enrollment data submitted by MN RETAIN to assess demographic characteristics for the 142 individuals who enrolled during the first seven months of the enrollment period (December 2021 through June 2022) and were assigned to the treatment group (Appendix C, Exhibit C.4). Many treatment enrollees were female (57 percent). The average age of the treatment enrollees was 44, with 37 percent being age 50 or older. Most were White, non-Hispanic (83 percent), followed by Hispanic ethnicity of any race (6 percent). The remainder of enrollees were similarly distributed across the remaining race and ethnic groups (Exhibit V.3). Almost all of the treatment enrollees had at least a high school diploma, GED, or certificate of completion (97 percent) and preferred English (97 percent). 31 The form accessible online is supported by REDCap an online platform developed specifically to support data collection for research.

Note: Suppressed \"Other, non-Hispanic\" to avoid disclosing information about particular individuals. Therefore, percentages do not add to 100 percent. MN RETAIN = Minnesota Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network . We also used the enrollment data submitted by MN RETAIN to assess illness and injury characteristics for the same 142 treatment enrollees (Appendix C, Exhibit C.5). Most treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition, with 59 percent reporting a non-back musculoskeletal condition and 9 percent reporting a musculoskeletal back condition (Exhibit V.4). MN RETAIN enrolls people with work- and non-work -related conditions, and 13 percent of enrollees reported their injury or illness was work -related. Although people with a worsening of an existing condition are eligible, most treatment enrollees reported their illness or injury was a new condition at the time of enrollment (61 percent). Less than half reported their condition was a result of an accident or injury (43 percent). Treatment enrollees had an average of 32 days between the onset of their primary diagnosis (either a new condition or a worsening of a chronic condition) and their enrollment in MN RETAIN. Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 62 Exhibit V.4. Primary diagnosis characteristics of treatment enrollees (percentage) Source: MN RETAIN enrollment data through June 30, 2022. Note: We classify ICD -10 codes into five categories: Musculoskeletal , back ; Musculoskeletal , non-back ; Long C OVID; Mental ; and Other. These groupings build on previous studies of return to work among injured or ill workers . We include the mapping of ICD -10 codes into these categories in Appendix C, Exhibit 5. ICD = International Classification of Diseases; MN RETAIN = Minnesota Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. We also used enrollment data submitted by MN RETAIN to assess recent work histories for the same 142 treatment enrollees described above (Append ix C, Exhibit C.6). All RETAIN programs must enroll workers who are employed or in the labor force, and, for MN RETAIN, many treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment (92 percent). Many treatment enrollees last worked within one month of enrollment (69 percent), and almost all last worked within three months of enrollment (97 percent) (Exhibit V.5). On average, treatment enrollees were employed full time (41 hours per week) before onset of injury or illness. Over a quarter of enrollees (27 percent) worked at their current or most recent job for less than a year, 30 percent worked at this job between one to five years and the remainder (43 percent) held this job for over five years. In the year prior to enrollment, most treatment enrollees (90 percent) worked at a job that paid at least $1000 per month. The highest proportion of treatment enrollees held a management, professional, or related occupation (42 percent) (Exhibit V.6). Other treatment enrollees held occupations in service (28 percent), production, transportation, or material moving (15 percent), natural resources, construction, or maintenance (11 percent), or sales and office (5 percent).

MN RETAIN = Minnesota Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network . Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 64 We also used enrollment data to compare treatment enrollee characteristics to control enrollee characteristics. As outlined in the Evaluation Design Report, we expected treatment and control enrollees to have similar baseline characteristics, because each state has a random assignment design (Berk et al. 2021) . We found no significant differences between treatment and control enrollees in the characteristics examined (Appendix C, Exhibit C.4, Exhibit C.5, and Exhibit C.6). E. MN RETAIN's early service delivery is going as planned except that no medical providers have taken the training At the time of the interviews in May 2022, program staff were delivering RTW coordination services and other RTW services as planned in the MN RETAIN program mod el. But no medical providers had completed the medical provider training. There was a contrast between treatment and control services. 1. Medical provider services MN RETAIN is advertising the medical provider training to providers affiliated with the lead health care partner, Mayo Clinic, and external medical providers (Exhibit V.7). Program staff sent two rounds of emails to Mayo Clinic providers and postcards to external medical providers advertising MN RETAIN and the opportunity to obtain CME credits by attending a webinar about occupational medicine best practices. Program staff also alert Mayo Clinic medical providers about the training if one of their patients enrolls in the treatment group. The lead health care partner created the MN RETAIN training modules . The modules focus on establishing a vision for providers to incorporate occupational medicine best practices early in their treatment of a patient who has an injury or illness that may impede the patient's ability to stay at or return to work. Exa mples of these best practices include understanding what patient s do at work and not assuming that because patient s say they cannot do their job, they cannot be accommodated. Exhibit V.7. MN RETAIN medical provider services Program component Description Training medical providers Program staff alert providers to take the MN RETAIN training when one of their patients enrolls in the treatment group. Providers can access online, on -demand, brief, educational modules. The educational modules focus on (1) including work as part of a patient's physical and mental health; (2) using evidence -based work restrictions; (3) communicating among employers, patients, and health care providers; and (4) avoiding unnecessary or prolonged use of opioids in pain management . RTW coordinators offer providers just -in-time education on evidence- based work restrictions. Providers can access consultations from RTW coordinators and occupational medicine providers for writing effective work restrictions. Incentivizing medical providers Program staff offer providers a $100 gift card for completing the education modules within 30 days of one of their patients enrolling and being assigned to the treatment group. This incentive is offered to a provider for every patient enrolled and assigned to the treatment group. Providers can receive continuing medical education credits for completing the education modules. MN RETAIN = Minnesota Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network ; RTW = return to w ork. Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 65 Program leaders reported that engaging medical providers in the training was going slower than planned. At the time of the interviews, no medical providers had completed the training. Program leaders noted that in addition to challenges related to the pandemic, providers receive many emails asking them to participate in surveys and many junk emails. They continue to identify strategies to draw providers' attention to the training, including recruiting additional provider champions to use peer pressure to engage their colleagues. In the meantime, program staff described how the RTW coordinators can deliver the RTW coordination services to treatment enrollees to support their return to work without the providers' involvement. 2. RTW coordination services Two RTW coordinators and one RTW coordinator lead provide RTW coordination services to treatment enrollees (Exhibit V.8 ). The RTW coordinator lead is temporarily providing services due to one RTW coordinator's departure. The RTW coordination services include developing an employment plan and an RTW plan; meeting regularly with the treatment enrollee; and communicating with the enrollee's medical provider, employer, and others as needed to coordinate the employee's SAW/RTW. RTW coordinators work with each t reatment enrollee until they return to work without restrictions, return to work with permanent restrictions, or participate in the program for six months. RTW coordinators do not work with a treatment enrollee for more than six months. Exhibit V.8. MN RETAIN RTW coordination services Program component Description Coordinating RTW services RTW coordinators engage with treatment enrollees to develop an individualized employment plan and an individualized RTW or SAW plan. RTW coordinators and treatment enrollees must communicate at least twice a month. RTW coordinators provide guidance to treatment enrollees regarding appropriate medical care and work restrictions. RTW coordinators provide support to medical providers on recommendations for appropriate treatment and work restrictions. RTW coordinators document work restrictions in the Occupational Case Management software platform. Communicating among parties involved in RTW plan RTW coordinators use standardized procedures to communicate with treatment enrollees , their medical provider, and their employer to optimize the provision of work accommodations. RTW coordinators document employment -specific interactions in the Occupational Case Management software platform . Monitoring treatment enroll ee progress RTW coordinators monitor treatment enrollees' progress through weekly or biweekly contacts and for one month after enrollees return to work. MN RETAIN = Minnesota Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work; SAW = stay at work. a. Coordinating RTW services RTW coordinators first interact with a treatment enrollee when they are completing their enrollment into MN RETAIN, after which they interact weekly or biweekly until the enrollee completes the program. During the first interaction, the RTW coordinator and enrollee work together to develop an employment Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 66 plan to document the enrollee's background, their goals for employment, and if they need workforce development services. Then they wo rk together to develop an RTW plan to document the enrollee's employer information and work restrictions and accommodations. Program data submitted by MN RETAIN indicate that all treatment enrollees received MN RETAIN services, including RTW coordination services or other RTW services (Exhibit V. 9). Almost all treatment enrollees (99 percent) had an established RTW plan. MN RETAIN expects RTW coordinators to engage with treatment enrollees to develop a RTW plan during the initial enrollment call. This engagement is observed from the average number of days (0.2) that elapsed from enrollment to establishment of an RTW plan for treatment enrollees. As of end of June, about 36 percent of treatment enrollees exited MN RETAIN. Treatment enrollees who have exited received services for about 121 days (about four months). Exhibit V.9 .

MN RETAIN = Minnesota Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network ; RTW = return to work. Program staff noted that RTW coordinators face challenges keeping in touch with some treatment enrollees while they are enrolled in the program. RTW coordinators encourage enrollees to keep in touch, confirm the next appointment whenever they interact with an enrollee, and accommodate the enrollee's preferred mode of communication. At the time of the interviews, they did not have many enrollees who were lost to follow -up. Program leaders and staff described the RTW coordinators as having diverse backgrounds and working closely with each other to facilitate service delivery. One RTW coordinator is a registered nurse, one has a background as an employment counselor in workforce development, and one recently hired RTW coordinator is a social worker. Program leaders said they are intentional about hiring staff with diverse professional backgrounds to offer more services to treatment enrollees. The RTW coordinators meet daily to discuss cases and brainstorm solutions to challenges, and they communicate throughout the day using instant messaging to provide one another with support as needed. Program leaders and staff described the positive feedback RTW coordinators received from treatment enrollees about their experiences in MN RETAIN. Enrollees expressed appreciation for the RTW coordinators helping them navigate their medical care, preparing them to have conversations with their employer about their needs and plans for returning to work, and being supportive so the enrollee can concentrate on their health. At the time of the interviews, 23 of about 90 treatment enrollees had returned to work. Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 67 b. Communicating among parties involved in enrollee return to work Exhibit V.10 lists the possible avenues of communication among RTW coordinators and others involved in enrollees' RTW plans (namely, the employer and medical provider) and the percentage of reported communications that occurred with each as reported in the program data submitted by MN RETAIN .

MN RETAIN = Minnesota Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work. Despite the high percentage of treatment enrollees whose RTW coordinator communicated with their employer at least once (62 percent) (Exhibit V.10), program staff noted that they face challenges engaging treatment enrollees' employers. Most enrollees give RTW coordinators permission to communicate with their employers.32 Yet p rogram staff noted that when an RTW coordinator calls employer s to let them know their employee is enrolled in MN RETAIN, most employers express a preference for communicating directly with their employee rather than through the RTW coordinator. Nonetheless, a few employers engaged with the RTW coordinator to support their employee's return to work. Program staff reported that RTW coordinators were not communicating with medical providers . This can be observed in MN RETAIN's service use data: only 10 percent of treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators communicated with a medical provider (Exhibit V.10). When a Mayo Clinic provider has a patient enrolled in the treatment group, they receive an automated email explaining MN RETAIN. Program staff described this as the primary communication with medical providers about MN RETA IN. Some providers complained about the emails because they amounted to additional paperwork, so program staff are trying to identify a more efficient way to contact the provider about their patient being enrolled in MN RETAIN. RTW coordinators have full a ccess to treatment enrollees' medical records if the enrollee is a patient at Mayo Clinic, so they can review their clinical notes and communications between the provider and the patient. The RTW coordinators do not , however, document case notes in the EMR, which is accessible by the providers, because of the Cures Act effective in July 2022. The Cures Act will require any information documented in the EMR to be made available to the patient. Program staff noted that not all the information documented in ca se notes should be available to the patient, so the RTW coordinators are not documenting as much in the EMR as they planned. 32 Program staff noted that the treatment enrollees who do not give permission to the RTW coordinator to contact their employer had employment situations where such contact might create confusion for the employer (for example, the enrollee did not have an established relationship with their employer). Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 68 c. Monitoring treatment enrollee progress RTW coordinators monitor treatment enrollees' progress by maintaining close contact wit h most treatment enrollees during the weekly or biweekly contacts. Program staff noted that the close contact enables RTW coordinators to track enrollees' work restrictions, communications with their medical providers, and other needs to support their RTW plans. RTW coordinators determine when a treatment enrollee can return to work on a case -by-case basis. After the enrollee's medical provider has cleared them to go back to work, the RTW coordinator will discuss with the enrollee if they feel safe returning to work. If the medical provider documented work restrictions, the RTW coordinator ensures that the employer can make the appropriate work accommodations. Once the enrollee has returned to work without restrictions, the RTW coo rdinator will continue the weekly or biweekly contact with the enrollee for one month to ensure they have a successful return to work and do not need additional work restrictions. \"[Returning to work] varies on each individual person, dependent on what's going on. For some that are dealing with mental health, it's a little bit different, from those that have had to have the surgery. Usually, those are a little more black and white...\" -Program Staff 1. Other RTW services RTW coordinators reach out to employers to support workplace-based interventions , and the lead workforce partner provides workforce development services or financial support to tre atment enrollees (Exhibit V.11). Exhibit V.11. MN RETAIN other RTW Program component Description Supporting workplace-b ased interventions RTW coordinators assist employers with developing work accommodations when treatment enrollees have restrictions. Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees RTW coordinators refer treatment enrollees to the lead workforce partner, Workforce Development, Inc., to be connected to alternative employment, transitional work opportunities, training services, and financial support if their employer is not able to provide work accommodations. Treatment enrollees may work in transitional work opportunities that meet their work restrictions until their employer is able to provide work accommodations. An employment counselor works with treatment enrollees to identify their goals and barriers to achieving those goals and develop an individual service strategy. The employment counselor must communicate with treatment enrollees at least once a month (and more frequently as needed). RTW coordinators regularly engage with the employment counselor assigned to a treatment enrollee to connect the enrollee with retraining or identify transitional work opportunities. RTW coordinators do not make referrals to rehabilitation services. MN RETAIN = Minnesota Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network ; RTW = return to work. Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 69 a. Supporting workplace -based interventions RTW coordinators can support workplace -based interventions through their involvement in developing workplace accommodations. Program leaders and staff are considering how to give feedback to medical providers to improve their documentation of work restrictions. Program leaders noted that medical providers are usually prompted to document work restrictions based on a patient's request. They also noted that too frequently the work restrictions state that a patient is unable to work until they are completely recovered. RTW coordinators can offer medical providers suggestions for translating activities of daily living into work restrictions. For example, the RTW coordinator can learn from treatment enrolle es whether they can go to the grocery store and lift a gallon of milk, which is 10 pounds. With such information, the RTW coordinator can suggest that the medical provider revise the work restrictions to allow an enrollee to return to work and not lift more than 10 pounds. MN RETAIN did not report any workplace accommodations (Exhibit V.12), but program leaders and staff noted that RTW coordinators may be well positioned to support employers with work accommodations. When employers do not support work accommodations, the RTW coordinators can try to discuss potential work accommodations with them, such as flexible shifts or equipment that supports the employee in completing work tasks.

MN RETAIN = Minnesota Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work . c. Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees Almost all treatment enrollees received employment services (Exhibit V.13). Based on the observation that almost all treatment enrollees received employment services, RTW coordinators are likely providing career counseling in addition to referring treatment enrollees to the lead workforce partner, Workforce Development, Inc. The RTW coordina tors make such a referral if they identify that the enrollee has a need for workforce development services or financial support . The employment counselor, employed by the lead workforce partner, helps treatment enrollees with a range of employment services, including resume review and training if the enrollee is looking to transition to a different job, financial support (such as h elp paying for rent or utilities) if the enrollee is unemployed during recovery, and access to paid transitional work opportunities that align with the enrollee's work accommodations.

MN RETAIN = Minnesota Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work . The employment counselor and RTW coordinators focus on individual treatment enrollee's needs and work closely to coordinate service delivery to meet those needs. They meet weekly to coordinate services for individual enrollees and share information they obtain from enrollees to ensure they have a comprehensive understanding of their cases. They maintain a spreadsheet to track the progress of treatment enrollees referred for workforce development services. One of the RTW coordinators was previously an employment counselor, and the program staff noted that it was helpful to have the counselor's firsthand experience with workforce development services on the RTW coordinator team. Program staff indicated that treatment enrollees are typically unaware that the services provided by the lead workforce partner are available. Wh en they receive the services, they often express appreciation for the help in finding other job options when they cannot return to their previous job. Treatment enrollees also are grateful for the financial support when they have lost their income and cannot pay for necessities (such as rent or utilities), because this reduces the stress of having to go back to work before they feel fully healed. Program staff noted challenges in finding paid transitional work opportunities for treatment enrollees. They said that it is difficult for the workforce development partner to find an employer willing to employ a treatment enrollee in an accommodated role (for example, sitting down for most of a shift). Even with many companies facing staffing shortages in the stat e's tight labor market, they do not engage in supporting treatment enrollees' work accommodations and would prefer to fill permanent positions. \"[Treatment enrollees] are just in awe. I think sometimes people don't believe that we have all these additional resources and so they're always super appreciative of all the support. ...they're worried \"I have this injury, I have something going on with me and I know I'm not going to be able to go back to work,\" and we have that additional support, we can find them something different. We can help pay for ... their schooling ... and the financial support has been huge for people that don't have a lot of income and they can't pay for food or need some help with some payments and stu ff just to know that that's there to help support them has really been just so appreciated.\" -Program Staff 2. Service co ntrast Control enrollees receive standard care, which m ight include services available through thei r employer or workforce development agencies. After completing enrollment, RTW coordinators explain to control enrollees that they will not have further contact with MN RETAIN. RTW coordinators provide the control enrollees with a list of resources, including the Dislocated Worker Program, American Job Centers, CareerOne, and other resources that are available to the general public through workforce development Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 71 agencies and employers. The RTW coordinator tells control enrollees that they can access these resources independently. In Minnesota, coordination between medical providers, employers, and workforce development services to support staying at or returning to work is not routinely provided to individuals with an injury or illness unrelated to their emp loyment. Further, medical providers in Minnesota do not have a defined process for monitoring patients' RTW progress. 3. Collecting and reporting enrollment data MN RETAIN uses a management information system, Workforce One (WF1), maintained by the lead agency, which uses it for other state programs. The lead agency built an MN RETAIN module within the WF1 system. One challenge program staff noted about using WF1 is that it was developed to support state programs and cannot be used to record Protected Healt h Information, so they must enter data and track information in multiple locations. Program staff described how RTW coordinators need first to enter enrollment data into the REDCap online platform when completing the enrollment application. Then, they ente r the enrollment data into Confirmit to randomize the enrollee into the treatment or control group. Once the enrollee is confirmed to be in the treatment group, the RTW coordinator enters the enrollee's data into WF1. Program staff had mixed perceptions on whether having to enter enrollment data in multiple places was a challenge. All agreed that the change from using PDFs to using REDCap significantly reduced the time it takes RTW coordinators to collect enrollment data. Program leaders noted that evaluation data submission is going smoothly. By creating the MN RETAIN module in WF1 in Phase 2, program staff are able to write a script to automatically pull together data for reports rather than manually collating the data as they did in Phase 1. The RTW coordinators, workforce staff, and data analysts meet weekly to review data errors requiring correction in WF1. Program staff noted that the technical assistance provided by Mathematica and the Office of Disability Employment Policy has been particularl y helpful in resolving data reporting issues. Program staff found workarounds to access data needed for the reports, such as the UI wage data, which is currently under legislative lockdown. F. Areas for continued monitoring and evaluation technical assistance Our analysis of the interview data collected in May 2022 and enrollment data collected through June 2022 raised issues that could affect the impact evaluation. The Mathematica team will continue to monitor these issues and provide evaluation technical assistance as needed. Early enrollment is low relative to the goal of 3,200 enrollees. As of June 30, 2022, which is 24 percent through its enrollment period, MN RETAIN reached 9 percent of the target enrollment. In the early months of Phase 2, MN RETAIN invested time and resources in recruiting additional medical providers to recruit patients and community outreach to recruit workers across the state. MN RETAIN also devoted two additional recruitment staff to identifying and recruiting enrollees. Program leaders and staff expect these efforts to increase enrollment. However, if enrollment continues at the current pace, it is likely that the evaluation will fail to detect a true effect that is large enough to be important to policymakers. Chapter V. Minne sota RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 72 As of the virtual site visit, conducted in May 2022, no medical providers had taken the MN RETAIN medical provider training. In addition, program leaders and staff noted that medical provider engagement in documenting practical work restrictions for treatment enrollees and MN RETAIN in general was low. The lack of medical provider engagement in MN RETAIN training may result in low use of occupational medicine best practices early in a medical provider's treatment of a patient who has an injury or illness that may be a barrier to their staying at work or returning to work. The lack of provider engagement in documenting practical work restrictions could delay enrollees' returning to work for longer than necessary if the RTW coordinator does not intervene and suggest to the provider how the work restrictions could be revised for an enrollee's earlier return to work . Both the medical providers' lack of engagement in medical provider training and documenting practic al work restrictions could reduce the impact of MN RETAIN.Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 73 VI. Ohio RETAIN Key findings Program leaders and staff described a focus on continuous quality improvement. They monitor ed worker, provider, and employer recruitment data and collaborat ed to identify areas for improvement, implement changes , and reassess goals. OH RETAIN focuse d on implementing the program within Mercy Health , its only health care partner at the time . The Mercy Health EMR facilitate d many aspects of implementation, including identifying, screening, and recruiting Mercy Health patients ; streamlining data management ; and supporting care team communication. During the first six months of enrollment (January through June 2022), OH RETAIN enrolled 613 workers, 18 percent of its enrollment goal. OH RETAIN was on track to meet its enrollment goal of 3,500 enrollees. Most treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition. Treatment enrol lees had an average of 30 days between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrollment. Many treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment, with the highest proportion of treatment enrollees holding a service occupation. Many treatment enrollees received OH RETAIN services beyond enrollment; however, OH RETAIN did not report employment services for any treatment enrollees. Many treatment enrollees established a n RTW plan, and about 15 percent received a workplace accommodation. For workers to be eligible for OH RETAIN enrollment, their medical providers must have enrolled in OH RETAIN, meaning these providers agreed to participate in the program and received OH RETAIN training. Workers had to allow RTW coordinators to communicate with their medical providers and employers to enroll in OH RETAIN . All treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators communicated with their medical provider s at least once, and about two -thirds of treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators communicated with their employer s at least once. OH RETAIN experienced low treatment enrollee engagement with workforce services, such as retraining and rehabilitation. Although treatment enrollees were willing to receive referrals to these services, when workforce partners contact ed them, they often indicated they were not ready to participate in these services. P rogram p artners suggested enrollee s' readiness for workforce services m ight take more time than the OH RETAIN service delivery period allow ed. A. Overview of Ohio RETAIN The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) is the lead agency for Ohio (OH) RET AIN. The intended population comprises employed adults ages 18 to 65 who have experienced the onset or worsening of a non-work -related musculoskeletal or cardiovascular injury or illness in the past three months. OH RETAIN provides RTW coordination services to all treatment enrollees and social work and career services as needed through referrals from RTW coordinators. The program catchment area is three regions in OH: Youngstown, Toledo, and Cincinnati. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 74 This chapter documents recruitment, enrollment, and program operations roughly six months after enrollment began and presents findings about the initial implementation of OH RETAIN.33 B. OH RETAIN established partnerships to support enrollment and service delivery The lead agency , ODJFS, brings together a range of partners to support implementation (Exhibit VI. 1). The lead agency established a memorandum of understanding with all program partners before submitting its Phase 2 application (Appendix D, Exhibit D.1). In this section, we describe these partner organizations and their roles supporting OH RETAIN. Exhibit VI.1. OH RETAIN organization chart 1. Lead health care partner The lead health care partner, Mercy Health , is the sole health system implementing OH RETAIN. The lead health care partner supports implementation by identifying and recruiting eligible patients, recruiting and training medical providers, and delivering RTW coordination services. The lead health care partner also conducts employer outreach in coordination with the lead workforce partner s. The lead health care partner draws on its EMR to facilitate identifying, screening, and recruiting patients ; streamlining data management ; and supporting care team communication. To enhance internal program processes, lead health care partner staff direct continuous quality improvement efforts. 33 OH RETAIN enrolled the first worker on January 19, 2022. We collected qualitative da ta about implementation experiences during semi -structured site visit interviews four months after the start of enrollment. We collected program data through six months after the start of enrollment (June 2022). Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 75 Recruitment staff conduct outreach to medical providers employed by the lead health care partner to recruit them to participate in OH RETAIN. Outreach efforts focus on providers with the most potentially eligible patients identified in EMR reports ; program staff noted that these providers tend to be specialist s rather than primary care providers . Recruitment staff educate providers about the benefits of OH RETAIN in practice-wide lunch-and -learn meetings or individual meetings. Several provider champions participate with program leaders and staff on an OH RETAI N advisory board that meets quarterly. The role of the provider champions is to advise program staff on provider outreach strategies (for instance, helping identify providers to engage for recruitment), to e ncourage their peers to participate in OH RETAIN, and to provide feedback on how using SAW/RTW best practices with patients and documenting in the EMR are going for OH RETAIN providers. Providers must complete online trainings to participate in OH RETAIN. Once providers complete these trainings, staff en roll the se providers in the program, and they can refer their patients to OH RETAIN. Program s taff described how medical providers' limited time poses challenges to engaging them in OH RETAIN. They noted that it can be c hallenging to find time to meet wit h medical providers, but it helps to coordinate with office managers to present at existing practice-wide meetings and have providers sign up to enroll in OH RETAIN during these meetings rather than asking them to sign up afterward. Program staff noted that some providers express initial concerns that OH RETAIN participation will require additional time and changes to their workflows. To assuage these concerns, program staff emphasize that medical provider participation requires minimal time and fits with existing clinical and EMR documentation workflows. Staff also find that providers are sometimes more receptive when staff have already identified their patients who are eligible. Program leaders noted that peer outreach by provider champions has been effective; they plan to identify additional champions and expand upon this provider peer- outreach approach going forward. To make employers aware of OH RETAIN services and engage them in the program, the lead health care partner's recruitment staff work with the lead workforce partners to conduct employer outreach through individual employer meetings and networking events, focusing on employers located in low -income opportunity zones. Staff invite employers to sign an Inclusive Employer pledge as part of enrollment in OH RETAIN. Program leaders have started meeting with state legislators and the lead health care partner's government relations team to engage employers in their networks. Recruitment staff also reach out to employers whose employees have been assigned to the treatment group to encourage them to enroll as OH RETAIN employers and sign the pledge. Staff noted that it can help with worker recruitment when a worker's employer has already enrolled in OH RETAIN and signed the pledge indicating their support. One employer outreach challenge is that employers have limited capacity to meet with program staff, especially in the current employment environment where many employers are understaffed. 2. Lead workforce pa rtners The lead workforce partners, the Local Workforce Development Boards, conduct employer outreach in coordination with the lead health care partner in Ohio's Local Workforce Areas 9, 12, 13, 17, and 18. 34 The lead workforce partners use their employer engagement experience and market OH RETAIN as one retention strategy in a menu of services for employers. The lead workforce partners also provide career and retraining services to treatment enrollees through their OhioMeansJobs centers. 34 OH's Local Workforce Area 9 encompasses the Toledo region, Areas 12 and 13 encompass the Cincinnati region, and Areas 17 and 18 encompass the Youngstown region. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 76 The workforce partner for VR services, Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities , works closely with the OhioMeansJobs centers and provides VR services to referred treatment enrollees. The workforce partner for VR services also consults with employers on work accommodations for treatment enrollees as needed . 3. Other partners The state leadership team includes partners who consult with OH RETAIN on program implementation. The Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation serves in a n advisory role.35 The Governor's Office of Workforce Transformation oversees the state agency partners involved in OH RETAIN. The Ohio Department of Health provides Institutional Review Board oversight. 4. Coordination of program partners Program leaders an d staff were overwhelmingly positive about partner coordination. OH RETAIN benefits from the lead agency and workforce partners having longstanding relationships. Program partners expressed that establishing a memorandum of understanding between partners, having open lines of communication, establishing clear workflows (such as intra -agency referral processes), and drawing on partners' areas of expertise have facilitated coordination efforts. The leadership team meets quarterly to discuss implementation pro gress and areas of focus for the next quarter. C. Program environment surrounding OH RETAIN 1. Employment and policy environment In Ohio , about 37 percent of working-age people with disabilities were employed in 2020, a rate slightly lower than the national average (Exhibit VI.2). Program leaders and partners noted that Ohio has a diverse economy and that manufacturing, health care, education, and retail are among the main industries that employ OH RETAIN enrollees. Although there are numerous job openings in Ohio currently, many jobs are physically demanding, and employers often do not have less physically demanding jobs available for workers needing accomm odations. Program staff and partners described barriers to work for people with disabilities, including lack of transportation in rural areas and basic social needs (such as food and financial insecurity) that must be addressed before being able to focus on returning to work.

RETAIN = Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. 35 The Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation played a larger role in Phase 1 by advising on OH RETAIN implementation strategies based on best practices they had identified in the occupational injury context . Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 77 2. COVID-19 pandemic The COVID- 19 vaccination rate in Ohio is 59 percent, which is lower than the 6 7 percent vaccination rate nationwide.36 Program leaders and partners described mixed effects of the pandemic on OH RETAIN. The pandemic has minimally affected program delivery because OH RETAIN had already shifted its processes (for example, worker recruitment and enrollment, RTW coordination service delivery) to occur virtually. Although some medical provider and employer outreach occurs in -person, program staff did not share any pandemic -related barriers to these interactions. Program leaders and partners have observed some patients being reluctant to attend medical office visits due to fear of COVID-19, or not following through on actions like physical therapy visits due to mask requirements. These challenges might extend to the experiences of some OH RETAIN enrollees. Program leaders and partners noted mixed effects of the pandemic on wo rk opportunities for OH RETAIN enrollees. There are more job openings than pre-pandemic. Remote jobs are more plentiful, which benefits enrollees qualified for these positions, but many of the job openings (such as those in the service and health care industries) involve physical demands that may not be suitable for enrollees. Partners noted that workers needing accommodations who have primarily worked in physically demanding jobs may have more opportunities available if they are willing to undergo career r etraining. Program staff shared that in Phase 2, enrollees have been less reluctant to agree to the RTW coordinator contacting their employers than in Phase 1, which staff attribute in part to enrollees perceiving they have greater job security in the current employment environment . Program leaders and partners said that because employers are short-staffed, they are seeing the need to focus on retaining employees; however, many employers are currently too overwhelmed to engage in efforts like OH RETAIN. D. OH RETAIN's enrollment is on -track to meet enrollment targets OH RETAIN only enrolls patients receiving medical care from the lead health care partner, Mercy Health. Worker recruitment and enrollment processes are standardized across the three OH RETAIN regions. Severity review nurses identify most potential enrollees through EMR reports and receive referrals from medical providers. A summary of the recruitment and enrollment process is included in Appendix D (Exhibit D.2). 1. Early enrollment outcomes During the first six months of enrollment (January 19, 2022 , through June 30, 2022), OH RETAIN enrolled 61 2 workers, or 1 8 percent of its goal of enrolling 3,500 workers. The first six months of enrollment represent about 21 percent of the enrollment period. Among enrollees, 50 percent are treatment enrollees and 50 percent are control enrollees (Appendix D, Exhibit D.3). 36 Johns Hopkins University Coronavi rus Resource Center , 2022 . Available at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region . Accessed May 3, 2022. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 78 2. Referral sources The primary source of referrals is a set of EMR reports that list patients with specified musculoskeletal or cardiovascular conditions who had an office visit the previous day. Severity review nurses run these reports daily and review listed patients' medical records to assess eligibility. Participating medical providers also refer patients. There have been very few self-referrals. 3. Outreach strategies OH RETAIN does not focus outreach efforts on the general worker population, because workers must have a provider employed by the lead health care partner to be eligible for the program ; however, workers who learn about OH RETAIN through sources such as employer outreach events, the program's website , social media sites, or word -of-mouth can self -refer . Program staff can connect self-referred workers with providers employed by the lead health care partner if the workers are not already receiving health care through the lead health care partner and are interested in enrolling in OH RETAIN . 4. Strategies for recruiting underserved populations Many of the lead health care partner's hospitals and ambulatory care clinics are strategically located in historically underserved, low -income communities. Therefore, much of the patient population from which recruitment staff identify eligible workers live or work in these communities. Recruitment staff focus outreach efforts on medical providers practicing in opportunity zones, which are low -income, underserved areas staff identified using Social Vulnerability Index data. 37 One challenge program staff noted is that some medical providers practicing at residency clinics that have large low-income, underserved patient populations cannot receive compensation for OH RETAIN participation due to the residency clinics' billing policies. Therefore, some of these providers are unwilling to participate. Program staff continue to explore how to encourage providers at these clinics to participate in OH RETAIN so their patients can enroll in the program. 5. Screening for eligibility OH RETAIN enrolls workers who have experienced the onset or worsening of a non-work -related musculosk eletal or cardiovascular injury or illness in the past three months. They must be employed or in the labor force, ages 18 to 65, and living in Ohio. In addition, they must have a medical provider employed by the lead health care partner who has completed OH RETAIN training . Program leaders and staff cited clear division of responsibilities among staff involved in the screening and recruitment process that work well in contributing to increasing the enrollment rate. Three experienced severity review nurses generate the EMR reports and retrieve medical provider referrals from the EMR daily. The severity review nurses review patients' medical records to screen for eligibility and to determine whether the patient's condition is severe enough to impact their ability to work. 38 Program leaders and staff emphasized the value of having a dedicated severity review process. They said that by dividing responsibilities between the nurses who have the clinical expertise to conduct severity reviews 37 The Social Vulnerability Index uses U.S. census variables to rank communities on social factors (such as poverty or lack of vehicle access) and identify communities that are especially at risk during public health emergencies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention /Agency for T oxic Substances and Disease Registry 's Social Vulnerability Index is available at https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html . 38 For the severity review, nurses look at a patient's medical record to confirm that t he patient's age, condition, and timing of condition onset or worsening meet the eligibility criteria and that the condition is not work -related. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 79 and the staff making recruitment calls to patients, recruitment efforts are more efficient and focused on the patients who are most likely to be good candidates for the program \u2014thereby increasing the enrollment rate. Program staff also noted that the OH RETAIN eligibility criteria work well to identify workers for the program. Severity review nurses share a list of patients for recru itment with the nine -person recruitment staff team. Upon receiving this list, a recruitment staff member calls the patients whose providers are enrolled in OH RETAIN to ask additional screening questions (including their place of employment) to confirm eligibility, inform them about OH RETAIN, and ask if they would like to participate in the program. 39 The primary challenge with confirming eligibility is reaching potential enrollees; many do not answer their phones. OH RETAIN uses a caller ID that shows calls to potential enrollees as coming from \"OH RETAIN,\" and staff highlight the enrollment incentive (a $100 Target gift card) in voicemails to increase the likelihood that potential enrollees will answer. Program staff also send letters to potential enrolle es who have not responded after two call attempts, and they have seen some potential enrollees call back after receiving the letter. 6. Recruitment Recruitment staff find it helpful to reference specific information from the medical record (for example, the patient's condition and the name of their medical provider) to establish credibility when they reach out to potential enrollees. Because recruitment staff only contact potential enrollees whose providers are enrolled in OH RETAIN, they can frame the prog ram as an opportunity the provider supports . Program staff highlight the gift card incentive and share that potential enrollees generally react positively to this incentive. RTW coordinators call interested potential enrollees to complete enrollment. To complete enrollment, RTW coordinators review the informed consent \u2014which software\u2014and complete randomization. 40,41 RTW coordinators ask treatment enrollees questions to assess their need for social work services. Enrollment challenges include potential enrollees not answering their phones and not being comfortable with study requirements (for example, sharing their Social Security number). To overcome these challenges, RTW coordinators have begun emailing potential enrollees before calling to introduce themselves and remind the enrollee of their call time, which has helped with connecting over the phone. RTW coordinat ors find that clearly explaining how data will be shared helps overcome enrollees' concerns. RTW coordinators continually share with one another verbiage and practices they have found helpful for enrollment. Program leaders and staff described how the characteristics and backgrounds of recruitment staff, training, and regular communication among the recruitment team facilitate recruitment efforts. Recruitment staff huddle daily and meet weekly to review progress and set concrete recruitment goals for the ne xt week, which program staff cited as a helpful and motivating practice. Program leaders described 39 If there are patients in the list whose providers are not yet enrolled in OH RETAIN, staff will try to recruit these providers. If a provider enrolls in OH RETAIN, a coordinator will then reach out to their potentially eligible patients. 40 Enrollees sign a release to communicate with their medical provider and employer as part of informed consent. 41 RTW coordina tors mail consent documents for signature if the enrollee prefers; however, they note that this delays the enrollment process significantly. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 80 \"We trained the [recruitment staff] on tone of voice and...what to say when they leave a message. I think that's definitely been helpful. Almost like... cus tomer service, just the way that you're talking to someone, are you just trying to get through the phone script or are you actually listening to them and offering some sympathy? We did some in -depth training on that, and I think that was helpful for sure.\" -Program Staff the recruitment staff team as diverse in terms of job backgrounds, race and ethnicity, and lived experience and said these characteristics enable the coordinators to relate well to workers over the phone. Staff also cited ongoing training efforts, such as training on customer service principles, as valuable for recruitment. Program leaders noted that due to the budget available for staff, most recruitment staff are recent college graduates, who may lack work experience. This has necessitated spending additional time on general professional skills mentorship. 7. Treatment enrollee characteristics We used enrollment data submitted by OH RETAIN to assess demographic characteristics for the 308 individuals who enrolled during the first six months of the enrollment period ( January 2022 through June 2022) and were assigned to the treatment group (Appendix D, Exhibit D.4). Most treatment enrollees were female ( 62 percent). The average age of the treatment enrollees was 45 years, and 42 percent were ages 50 or older. M ost were White, non -Hispanic ( 74 percent), followed by Black, non-Hispanic (17 percent); others were similarly distributed across the remaining race and ethnicity groups (Exhibit VI.3 ). Most of the treatment enrollees had at least a high school diploma, GED, or certificate of completion (9 3 percent) , and most preferred English as their spoken language (99 percent). Exhibit VI.3 . Race and ethnicity characteristics of treatment enrollees (p ercentage) Source: OH RETAIN enrollment data through June 30, 2022.

OH RETAIN = Ohio Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 81 We also used the enrollment data submitted by OH RETAIN to assess illness and injury characteristics for the same 308 treatment enrollees (Appendix D, Exhibit D.5). Most treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition, with 79 percent reporting a non-back musculoskeletal condition, and 14 percent reporting a musculoskeletal back condition (Exhibit VI.4). OH RETAIN enrolls people with work- and non-work-related conditions, and 2 percent of enrollees reported their injury or illness was related to work. People with a pre-existing or new condition are eligible, and, for OH RETAIN, about half of treatment enrollees reported their illness or injury was a new condition at the time of enrollment (51 percent). Many reported their condition was a result of an accident or injury (61 percent). Treatment enrollees had an average of 29 days between their onset of primary diagnosis (either a new condition or worsening of a chronic condition) and enrollment in OH RETAIN. Exhibit VI.4. Primary diagnosis characteristics of treatment enrollees ( percentage) Source: OH RETAIN enrollment data through June 30, 2022. Note: We classify ICD -10 codes into five categories: Musculoskeletal , back ; Musculoskeletal , non-back ; Long C OVID; Mental ; and Other. These groupings build on previous studies of return to work among injured or ill workers . We include the mapping of ICD -10 codes into these categories in Appendix D, Exhibit 5. ICD = International Classification of Diseases; O H RETAIN = Ohio Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. We also used enrollment data submitted by OH RETAIN to assess employment and benefit characteristics for the same 308 treatment enrollees described above (Appendix D, Exhibit D.6). All RETAIN programs must enroll workers who are employed or in the labor force , and, for OH RETAIN, most treatment enrollees were employed (81 percent). Many treatment enrollees last worked within one month of enrollment (71 percent), and most last worked within three months of enrollment (86 percent) (Exhibit VI.5). On average, treatment enrollees were employed full time (40 hours per week) before onset of injury or illness. A little more than half of treatment enrollees worked at their current job for two or more years (57 percent). Over the last year, many treatment enrollees earned at least $1,000 per month (78 percent). The highest proportion of treatment enrollees were classified as holding a service occupation (43 percent) (Exhibit VI.6). Other treatment enrollees h eld occupations in production, transportation, or Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 82 material moving (23 percent); management, professional or related (21 percent); natural resources, construction, or maintenance (7 percent); or sales and office (6 percent).

OH RETAIN = Ohio Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 83 We also used enrollment data to compare treatment enrollee characteristics to control enrollee characteristics. As outlined in the Evaluation Design Report, we expected treatment and control enrollees to have similar baseline characteristics, because each state has a random assignment design (Berk et al. 2021) . We found no significant differences between treatment and control enrollees in the characteristics examined (Appendix D , Exhibit D.4, Exhibit D.5, and Exhibit D.6). E. OH RETAIN's early service delivery is going as planned At the time of the interviews in June 2022, program staff were implementing RTW coordination services as planned in the OH RETAIN program model. There was a contrast between treatment and control services. 1. Medical provider services Medical providers must complete online trainings to enroll in OH RETAIN (Exhibit VI.7). The trainings focus on OH RETAIN program offerings and SAW/RTW best practices. The trainings also address the benefits of providers using a biopsychosocial model; for instance, usi ng a health behavior assessment to proactively identify any behavioral barriers (for example, fear of re -injury, fear of movement) that might impede a patient's recovery . To address feedback received from medical providers in Phase 1, the OH RETAIN team developed a refresher training which providers complete one year after enrolling in OH RETAIN. Providers enrolling in OH RETAIN also receive one-on-one training from program staff on how to document in the EMR when they use SAW/RTW best practices with OH RETAIN treatment enrollees. By documenting procedure codes for these best practices, providers receive additional compensation. Exhibit VI.7 . OH RETAIN medical provider services Program component Description Training medical providers Provider can access a provider toolkit and five training modules in the lead health care partner's online learning system. These materials provide information on occupational health best practices. Provider receives one- on-one training on how to document when they have used occupational health best practices in the EMR. Provider completes a refresher training on occupational health best practices one year after their initial training. Incentivizing medical providers Providers who complete the five training modules receive a $500 incentive payment and 3.75 CME credits. Providers receive a $100 incentive payment for completing the refresher training. Providers are compensated for performing occupational health best practices. Compensation is based on the average time necessary to complete each best practice, multiplied by the provider's billing rate. CME = continuing medical education; EMR = electronic medical record; OH RETAIN = Ohio Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network . According to program leaders and staff, m edical provider training has gone as planned . At the time of the site visit, more than 90 percent of providers who indicated they wanted to enroll in OH RETAIN had completed the online trainings. Recruitment staff continually set goals for and monitor provider training completion rates and follow up with providers who have not yet completed training. Staff shared that at times, they find it helpful to have the provider champions nudge their peers to complete the trainings. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 84 Providers have responded positively to the incentives for completing trainings but have had mixed responses to the incentives for documenting the use of occupational health best practices with patients. While some providers have been incentivized by the opportunity to receive additional compensation for using and documenting best practices, others do not believe the additional compensation is worth the inconvenience of having to document the best practices. 2. RTW coordination services Six RTW coordinators provide SAW/RTW coordination services to treatment enrollees (Exhibit VI.8) . Services include developing a care plan and establishing treatment goals, assessing functional recovery, making appropriate referrals, and communicating with the enrollee's medical provider and employer. SAW/RTW coordination services end after six months or when the treatment enrollee returns to work with a completed RTW plan, whichever comes first. Exhibit VI.8 . OH RETAIN RTW coordination services Program component Description Coordinating RTW services RTW coordinator s create an individualized RTW plan for treatment enrollees. RTW coordinator s make a series of contacts with treatment enrollees and their employer to assess their ability to work and to explore needs for work accommodations. RTW coordinator s continue to contact treatment enrollees at least every 30 days to assess progress and offer moral support. If treatment enrollees need additional social supportsa, RTW coordinator s refer them to the social worker team for additional social needs assessment and resources . Social workers conduct behavioral health screening and refer enrollees to behavioral health treatment as necessary. If treatment enrollees' providers release the enrollee to return to work without restrictions, RTW coordinator s notify the employer of the RTW date. If treatment enrollees are unable to return to their previous job or need additional services, RTW coordinator s refer them (with the enrollee's permission) to the local lead workforce partner's job center . Communicating among parties involved in RTW plan RTW coordinator s are responsible for timely communications with treatment enrollees, their employer, and their medical provider . RTW coordinators communicate with social workers about treatment enrollees through the EMR or in biweekly interdisciplinary team meetings. RTW coordinator s have designated contacts at the lead workforce partners' local job centers and at the workforce partner for VR services. RTW coordinators send referrals to these contacts or consult with them on which services might benefit treatment enrollees . Monitoring treatment enrollee progress RTW coordinator s track treatment enrollees ' progress in the EMR. RTW coordinator s capture data on enrollees ' employment and health status through conversations with enrollees, their employer, and their medical provider , and by reviewing case notes in enrollees ' medical record. Social workers track case management progress in the EMR. The lead workforce partners' job centers track services provided to enrollees in the statewide workforce case management systemb EMR = electronic medical record; OH RETAIN = Ohio Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network ; RTW = return to work ; VR = vocational rehabilitation. a The most common social needs of treatment enrollees are financial insecurity, food insecurity, and mental health. b Advancement through Resources, Information, and Employment Services (ARIES) is Ohio's case management system. ARIES replaces the Ohio Workforce Case Management System. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 85 a. Coordinating RTW services Program data submitted by OH RETAI N indicate that most treatment enrollees received OH RETAIN services (79 percent), including RTW coordination services or other RTW services (Exhibit V I.9). Most treatment enrollees (78 percent) had an established RTW plan. An average of about 16.8 days elapsed from enrollment to establishment of an RTW plan for treatment enrollees enrolled in OH RETAIN. As of end of June, no treatment enrollees exited the OH RETAIN program. Exhibit VI.9 .

Program leaders and staff noted that RTW coordinators' experience, training, and communication channels facilitate RTW coordination service delivery. All RTW coordinators are experienced case managers who have previously worked in fields ranging from behavioral health to hospice to extended care facilities. The RTW coordinator team benefits from this diversity of case management experience as they draw on their different strengths and areas of expertise. In addition, a coordinator involved in Phase 1 conducts RTW coordinator training and serves as a mentor to newer coordinators. Staff said that RTW coordinators have a virtual chatroom, which enables them to maintain open lines of communication and discuss questions about enrollee cases on a daily basis. Program staff shared that having a dedicated social work team has been invaluable for addressing treatment enrollees' social needs. Rather than RTW coordinators attempting to deliver RTW coordination services while also identifying and navigating referrals to address enrollees' social needs, social workers with expertise in assessing social needs and connecting patients to resources lead this effort. Staff said that the RTW coordinator and social work teams communicate frequently and have biweekly interdisciplinary team meetings, which have been helpful opportunities to discuss complex cases. Although there are some treatment enrollees who do not actively participate or respond to RTW coordinators' calls after enrolling, treatment enrollees who actively participate in OH RETAIN have provided positive feedback to program staff. Treatment enrollees have expressed appreciation that someone cares and is calling to check in on them, shared that it has been valuable to them to have their feelings validated by their RTW coordinator, and said that they do not know what they would do without their RTW coordinator. Similarly, treatment enrollees receivin g social work services through OH RETAIN have shared that it means a lot to them to be able to talk with someone who cares about their situation. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 86 b. Communicating among parties involved in enrollee return to work In Exhibit VI.10 , we list the possible avenues of communication among RTW coordinators and others involved in enrollees' RTW plans, namely the employer and medical provider, and the percentage of reported communications that occurred with each, as reported in the program data OH RETAIN submitted. Exhibit VI.10 . Percent age of treatment enrollees whose RTW coordinator communicated with others involved in their return to work Communicati on among parties involved in treatment enrollees return to work Percentage of treatment enrollees Treatment enrollee's RTW coordinator communicated with employer at least once 68.2 Treatment enrollee's RTW coordinator communicated with medical provider at least once 100.0 Treatment enrollee's RTW coordinator communicated with workforce professional at least once 4.9 Source: OH RETAIN service use data through June 30, 2022. OH RETAIN = Ohio Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work. When they consent to pa rticipate in OH RETAIN, a ll enrollees must sign releases allowing RTW coordinators to contact their medical provider and employer. When enrollees are assigned to the treatment group, RTW coordinators contact enrollees' medical provider s to update them on e nrollees' treatment goals . OH RETAIN requires medical providers also enroll and participate in the program so patients can be eligible for enrollment. This is visible in OH RETAIN's service use data because all treatment enrollees' RTW coordinators communi cated with a medical provider at least once (100 percent) (Exhibit VI.10). RTW coordinators contact treatment enrollees' employer s within three days of completing enrollment to explore opportunities for enrollees' return to work. RTW coordinators track int eractions with medical providers and employers in the EMR. If RTW coordinators identify enrollees that have unmet social needs, they refer enrollees to the OH RETAIN social work team to further assess these needs and connect them to resources. Program staff shared that communication between RTW coordinators and medical providers has generally gone well. Mo st employers have also been receptive to discussing SAW/RTW plan options with RTW coordinators, and about 68 percent of treatment enrollees' RTW coordinator communicated with an employer at least once (Exhibit VI.10). The RTW coordinator team established g uidance around which enrollee -specific information should and should not be shared with employers, which has eased RTW coordinators' initial concerns about having these conversations. \"We're just getting the specialists on board with what it is [RTW coordinators] can do for their patients. And you're finding that they're [saying], 'Oh, well if you can help with that, can you help so and so do this?' or 'Thank you'. Being the advocate, b eing that phone call in between office visits, we're saving the provider the phone calls they'd be getting at the office.\" -Program Leader c. Moni toring treatment enrollee progress RTW coordinators monitor treatment enrollees' progress through telephone calls every 30 days or after enrollees have a visit with their medical provider . During these calls, the coordinator conducts an initial social needs assessment; asks about the enrollee's employment status, barriers, goals, and communication Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 87 with the employer; and identifies any needs for referrals. The RTW coordinator follows up on progress with treatment plans the medical provider has established with the enrollee (for example, physi cal therapy, occupational therapy, and pain medication) and on any referrals the provider has made for the enrollee (for example, to specialists or pain management). Finally, the RTW coordinator works with the enrollee to determine a plan for the enrollee's next medical visit. RTW coordinators use a flow sheet template in the EMR to guide these conversations and to document information. Staff expressed that using the EMR flow sheets has been helpful in structuring conversations with treatment enrollees and documenting comprehensive information. 3. Other RTW services RTW coordinators refer enrollees to the lead workforce partners\u2014the Local Workforce Development Boards' OhioMeansJobs centers\u2014for career services or retraining, or to the workforce partner for VR services, Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities (Exhibit VI.11). Exhibit VI.11. OH RETAIN other RTW services Program component Description Supporting workplace- based interventions The workforce partner for VR services can consult with employers needing support with individual worker accommodations. Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees If treatment enrollees are no longer able to perform their prior job, RTW coordinators refer them to the local lead workforce partner's job center for workforce services. Case managers from the job center contact enrollees, assesses enrollees' needs, and offer an orientation on available services. Job center case managers may offer treatment enrollees job search assistance or enrollment in partner programs for more intensive services, such as VR, training, supportive services, and job search assistance. RTW coordinators can refer enrollees with physical or mental disabilities severe enough to meet VR eligibility criteria directly to the workforce partner for VR services. OH RETAIN = Ohio Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work ; VR = vocational rehabilitation a. Supporting workplace -based interventions The workforce partner for VR services can consult with employers wanting support with individual worker accommodations as needed. There are also OH RETAIN grant funds available to employers for equipment to enable accommodations. As of end of June, approximately 15 percent of treatment enrollees received a workplace accommodation (Exhibit VI.12). Exhibit VI.12 .

OH RETAIN = Ohio Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network . Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 88 b. Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees RTW coordinators refer treatment enrollees to the lead workforce partners' job center services when enrollees are out of work and seeking employment or when their employers are unable to accommodate their work restrictions, and the enrollees are open to connecting with career services. If enrollees have physical or mental disabilities severe enough to meet VR eligibility criteria, RTW coordinators may refer them directly to the workforce partner for VR services . Alternatively, if RTW coordinators refer enrollees to a job center and the job center staff determine s that the enrollee s are eligible for VR, it will make that referral to the workforce partne r for VR services. Program staff and partners noted that coordination between the lead health care partner and the workforce partners is strong. They recently established referral protocols under which there are designated workforce partner contact s for RTW coordinators in each region. RTW coordinators can call these contacts to discuss whether their services would be appropriate for individual enrollees. The workforce partners with whom we spoke in the Youngstown region believed these referral protocols have been helpful . Program partners shared that, although there have been referrals to job centers, enrollees often do not answer their phones when job center staff call, and those who do answer are receptive to hearing about services but not ready to act. Partners said this reaction was not surprising because often it can be difficult for people who are out of a job \u2014and have a recent injury or illness \u2014to process job-related identity shifts. This is consistent with OH RETAIN's program data: no treatment enrollees received retraining or rehabilitating services (Exhibit VI.13). Program partners speculated that enrollee readiness for job center services may take more time than the six - month OH RETAIN service delivery period allows. Partners shared a similar challenge with referrals to the workforce partner for VR services: most referred OH RETAIN enrollees discontinued VR services while they focused on adjusting to the impact of their new disability on their life. 42 \"I spoke with the person who makes those calls [about retraining] to the participants once the referrals are made. And not surprisingly, she said...they are receptive to the information and not ready to act... that's not unusual for people when they lose their jobs for any reason. There's a recovery period where you really are trying to identify who you are and what your goals are -- separating your identity from your old employer. And in this situation, you are going to need to separate your identity from your occupation as well as your employer. So I think particularly for people who have been in a position for several years, the length of time will probably be longer before they're ready to make a commitment to what their new life is .\" -Program Partner Exhibit VI.13 .

Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 89 OH RETAIN = Ohio Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network . 4. Service contrast There is a clear distinction between treatment and control services. After randomization, RTW coordinators provide control enrollees with a packet of resour ces that control enrollees can access on their own. RTW coordinators have no further interaction with control enrollees. RTW coordinators notify medical providers when their patients are assigned to the control condition and then have no further contact with providers about control enrollees; nevertheless, there is a possibility of contamination if a provider implements SAW/RTW best practices with control enrollees. This could occur if the provider is in the habit of using these best practices with all patients experiencing conditions that affect their ability to work. 43 OH RETAIN offers unique RTW services relative to those available outside of OH RETAIN. Workers with work -related injuries or illnesses can receive services through the Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation. Workers can directly access employment support or retraining services through the lead workforce partners' job centers, and workers with physical or mental disabilities can access VR services through the workforce partner for VR. Nonetheless, program partners believe that many workers are not aware of these services. The coordination with medical providers, employers, and other services provided by RTW coordinators is unique to OH RETAIN and fills a gap in the state. 5. Collecting and reporting program data OH RETAIN staff use the lead health care partner's EMR to document enrollment data , case information, and enrollee progress. Program s taff were overwhelmingly positive about the EMR and said that the flow sheets the OH RETAIN team built to outline data elements to collect during enrollee interaction s pro mote efficient and complete data collection. Many staff were already familiar with the EMR system prior to working on OH RETAIN through other job experiences. Staff also use customer relationship management software to track medical provider, employer, and worker recruitment and enrollment. 44 Although some staff members experienced a learning curve with the customer relationship management software, they generally highlighted the value of the software's reporting functions. Ohio recently launched a new statewide workforce case management system, Advancement through Resources, Information, and Employment Services (ARIES). Program partners noted that this system is still being adopted. The lead workforce partners' job centers will track information for referre d enrollees who register for career services in this system. At the time of the site visit, OH RETAIN was experiencing challenges with aggregating enrollment and service use data for reporting to SSA. The lead health care partner sends data extracts to the lead agency weekly. Program staff identified instances where the data extracts did not import properly into the centralized data repository (where the lead agency merges data for reporting). The OH RETAIN team identified the cause of this issue and submitted quarterly data for the evaluation in early July 2022. In addition, there were challenges with integrating the new workforce case management system with the 43 To guard against contamination, OH RETAIN implemented automated EMR notifications to remind providers to use RETAIN best practices with treatment enrollees. These reminders are not triggered for control enrollees. In addition, OH RETAIN's online and in -person medical provider trainings emphasize the importance of avoiding contamination and because the lead healthcare partner participates in other research studies, medical providers tend to be familiar with this research practice. 44 OH RETAIN recruitment staff use the Salesforce customer relationship management software. Chapter VI. Ohio R ETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 90 centralized data repository. However, since the site visit, OH RETAIN was able to report on the workforce service data needed for the evaluation. Program leaders said that some data elements have not been well-defined by federal partners and requiring certain fields to be filled has created more work to prepare data submissions. However, technical assistance from DOL and Mathematica has helped in determining how to handle these elements. 45 F. Areas for continued monitoring and evaluation technical assistance Our analysis of the interview data collected in June 2 022 raised an issue that could affect the impact evaluation. The Mathematica team will continue to monitor th is issue and provide evaluation technical assistance as needed. Because medical providers must complete OH RETAIN training and agree to participate in the program for their patients to be eligible to enroll, individual providers could potentially have patients enrolled in the treatment group and patients enrolled in the control group. Although RTW coordinators notify providers when a patient is randomized to the treatment or control group and OH RETA IN has implemented safeguards against contamination through EMR notifications and provider trainings , there is a risk that providers who completed the OH RETAIN training on occupational health best practices may use these best practices with control enrollees. Although control enrollees do not receive any services from RTW coordinators, this could potentially weaken the treatment - control group contrast. The evaluation team plans to assess whether this is o ccurring through the enrollee survey and upcoming medical provider survey. 45 For example, DOL requested no blank values for the \"employer level of engagement\" element. Program staff were accustomed to leaving this field blank unt il they were able to connect with an enrollee's employer, which meant that at the time of submission, the field was blank for some enrollees. Staff now need to go back and add a value into this field so the data submission will be accepted. Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 91 VII. V ermont RETAIN Key findings VT RETAIN benefit ted from the diverse expertise of staff across its partners and four centers (operational, clinical coordinating, development, and data coordinating). Organizing staff into several work groups with designated milestones helped VT RETAIN address the complexity of coordinating communication and activities across partners. Primary care practices were VT RETAIN's only referral source as part of its clustered random assignment design. VT RETAIN relied on a partnership with Vermont's accountable care organization, OneCare Vermont, to recruit primary care practices to implement pre -screening to identify patients who m ight be eligible for the study. By June 2022, VT RETAIN enrolled 57 primary care practices with the goal of enrolling 68 practices. During the first four months of enrollment (March through June 2022), VT RETAIN enrolled 36 workers, 1.8 percent of its enrollment goal, which was lower than expected. The burden of the COVID -19 pandemic on participating practices led it to delay implementing pre- screening of potential enrollees. Almost half of the treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition. Treatment enrollees had an average of 80 days between the onset of their primary diagnosis and enrollment. Many treatment enrollees were employed at the time of enrollment, with the highest proportion of treatment enrollees holding a service occupation. About 60 percent of treatment enrollees received VT RETAIN services beyond enrollment . VT RETAIN reported 50 percent of treatment enrollees received workplace accommodations and 17 percent received employment services. VT RETAIN focused on sustainability planning, including using its training and development program to train employers, medical providers, and workers in SAW/RTW best pract ices and create educational resources that wou ld last beyond the grant. VT RETAIN made a concerted effort to center equity in its work by enrolling practices that serve d historically underrepresented patients, translating program materials into different l anguages, providing interpreter services, and using the results of a needs assessment to guide program implementation. The most significant contrast between services provided to treatment and control enrollees was access to RTW coordination services. Though VT RETAIN d id not provide specific workforce development services under the program model , RTW coordinators could help connect treatment enrol lees to existing VT workforce development resources. A. Overview of Vermont RETAIN The Vermont Department of Labor (VDOL) is the lead agency for Vermont RETAIN (VT RETAIN). Staff from VDOL's Workers' Compensation and Safety Division oversee the grant and are responsible for the program's administration, budget, and compliance. VT RETAIN aims to support adults who are employed or actively looking for a job and have an injury or illness that is limiting or could limit their ability to stay at work or return to work. Distinct from other RETAIN states, VT RETAIN uses a cluster Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 92 random assignme nt model. In this model, Mathematica assigns participating primary care practices to either the treatment or control group. VT RETAIN provides RTW coordination services to all enrollees recruited at treatment practices; SAW/RTW education for providers, wor kers, and employers; and referrals to various other services as needed. The program catchment area is the entire state of Vermont, including 14 counties. This chapter documents recruitment, enrollment, and program operations four months after enrollment began and presents findings about the initial implementation of VT RETAIN. 46 B. VT RETAIN established partnerships and subcontracts to support enrollment, service delivery, and evaluation The lead agency for VT RETAIN, VDOL , organize d implementation and evaluation efforts into four centers, including (1) the operational center led by the lead agency, VDOL; (2) the clinical coordinating center led by, Dartmouth -Health; (3) the development center led by Haig Consulting, LLC; and (4) the data coordinating center led by the University of Pittsburgh (Exhibit VII.1). VT RETAIN also collaborates with its lead health care partner, OneCare Vermont, the state's accountable care organization founded by the University of Vermont and Dartmouth -Hitchcock, and numerous other partners to support VT RETAIN (Appendix E Exhibit E.1). In this section, we describe the main partners and their roles in supporting VT RETAIN. 46 VT RETAIN en rolled the first worker on March 8, 2021. We collected qualitative data about implementation experiences during semi -structured site visit interviews three months after the start of enrollment. We collected program data through four months after the start of enrollment (June 2022). Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 93 Exhibit VII.1. VT RETAIN organization chart 1. Lead hea lth care partner VT RETAIN developed a partnership with the state's only accountable care organization, OneCare Vermont, to recruit primary care practices to participate in the clustered random assignment evaluation and pre -screen patients for enrollment in VT RETAIN. Program leaders and staff noted that OneCare Vermont's statewide influence and extensive network of medical providers facilitated the recruitment of primary care practices affiliated with OneCare Vermont across the state. Program staff also recruited practices not affiliated with OneCare Vermont to participate in VT RETAIN. In June 2022, VT RETAIN enrolled 57 primary care practices (27 treatment and 30 control) with the goal of enrolling 68 practices. Almost half of participating practices are Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and free clinics. The health care lead is actively involved in recruiting primary care practices. VT RETAIN assigns workers into the treatment or control group according to which practice helped recruit them. The health care lead helps develop and deliver trainings to medical providers and primary care practice staff. Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 94 Dartmouth Health is a large medical center that oversees VT RETAIN's clinical coordinating center. The clinical coordinating center supports (1) recruiting and enrolling eligible workers and (2) recruiting, training, and supporting RTW coordinators who deliver VT RETAIN services. 2. Lead workforce partner VDOL does not have a separate lead workforce partner. Instead, VT RETAIN planned to hire a workforce development lead for VDOL's Workfor ce Development Division. Program staff determined the role is too large for one person, and now plan to hire three staff to work on employer relations and the integration of employment services into VT RETAIN. Program s taff are creating a process for RTW coordinators to refer treatment enrollees needing career resources to employment counselors within VDOL's American Job Centers.47 However, program staff reported they do not anticipate referring many enrollees to Workforce Development, because most treatment enrollees in Phase 1 needed SAW services rather than RTW services. 3. Other partners VT RETAIN has established a range of partnerships to support implementation, service delivery, and sustainability efforts. In this chapter, we describe the partners that program staff discussed during the site visit as having a role in the initial implementation of VT RETAIN. Haig Consulting, LLC, oversees the VT RETAIN development center, which coordinates a sustainability planning group and operates a training and development program for employers, medical providers, and workers. The development center creates training opportunities and educational resources based on the results of a needs assessment that VT RETAIN conducted in Phase 1. The assessment identified gaps in knowledge of SAW/RTW best practices, SAW/RTW services available in Vermont, and training needs related to helping workers who have an injury or illness stay at work or return to work. In response to these needs, program staff are developing content for an online learning platform that will be available to the public long-term. The platform will host educational resources and live and recorded trainings on various SAW/RTW topics. Program staff reported they have not been able to post the educational resources online due to a delay in executing a contract with the learning platform provider. The development center will also administer VT RETAIN grants to employers and providers to complete SAW/RTW certifications and trainings. The reported goal of the training grants is to fill gaps in existing SAW/RTW services. The learning platform resources and trainings will be available to employers, providers, and workers in Vermont regardless of their affiliation with a treatment or control group. VT RETAIN partnered wit h the Vermont Chamber of Commerce and is continuing to build partnerships with organizations that can help them engage employers to market the training and development program and find job placements for treatment enrollees. The needs assessment revealed that employers lacked knowledge and resources to support the workplace needs of people with mental health and substance use challenges. To address this, VT RETAIN is working with Recovery Vermont and the VT Department of Mental Health to develop a mental health and substance use disorder recovery training and certification program for Vermont employers. VT RETAIN is also developing a partnership with Working Fields, an organization with more than 80 employer contacts that is committed to helping people in recovery from substance use disorders stay at work and return to work. 47 DOL funds American Job Centers throughout the country to provide career services to job seekers. Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 95 Program leaders and staff reported that the training and development program is integral to VT RETAIN's sustainability efforts. The sustainability planning group, comprised of representatives of VT RETAIN partners, also identifies decision makers, funding mechanisms, and policy changes to help sustain VT RETAIN beyond the grant. \"There's really two aspects of VT RETAIN. One is definitely the clinical trial and that takes priority and we've dropped everything to really focus on that right now. But underlying it all is we want to leave Vermont in a better place than we found it in terms of training practitioners and training employers.\" -Program Staff The Uni versity of Pittsburgh oversees the VT RETAIN data coordinating center, which manages the evaluation data and reviews program data to support continuous quality improvement (CQI) efforts. The director of the data coordinating center oversees the CQI team, which also includes the director of the VT RETAIN development center, project director, health care lead, and referral and enrollment lead. The CQI team meets weekly, and at the time of the interviews, it was focused on how to improve outreach to and enrollment of workers in opportunity zones. 4. Coordination of program partners Program staff described delays in making decisions across partners. For example, processes like requesting approval for expenses or deciding the layout of the learning platform were time -consuming. Program st aff also described initial challenges with clarifying roles and reporting structures and communicating across different professional backgrounds. Program staff noted the value of having a project administrator at the lead agency and grant program manager contracted by the training and development partner with 100 percent of their time dedicated to VT RETAIN to help manage coordination across partners . To improve coordination of activities across partners, VT RETAIN organized program staff into several workgroups with different charters such as marketing, RTW coordination, and training. Workgroups track progress on implementation milestones and repor t monthly to the executive committee. The executive committee meetings include the workgroup leads, the directors of all four VT RETAIN centers, the lead RTW coordinator, project administrator, and grant program manager. The executive committee meets biweekly to make programmatic decisions based on feedback from the workgroups. The directors of the four centers meet as a smaller group on the off -weeks. Program leaders and staff noted that the workgroups and monthly reporting processes helped address the com plexity of coordinating activities across partners and drew on the insights of professionally diverse subject matter experts. VT RETAIN also gathers an advisory board comprised of representatives from VT RETAIN's main partners monthly. Program leaders noted that this provides an opportunity for them to solicit expert input when making programmatic decisions. C. The program environment surrounding VT RETAIN 1. Employment and policy environment In Vermont, 31.2 percent of working-age people with disabilities were employed in 2020, lower than the national average of 37 percent (Exhibit VII.2). Vermont has a low unemployment rate of 2.2 percent, which program staff suggested facilitates entry into the workforce. According to program staff, VT RETAIN enrollees o ften have physically intensive jobs in industries like quarry mining, trucking, construction, and agriculture. Program staff described how social needs like transportation, Internet Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 96 access, housing, and cell service are common barriers to returning to work. As noted in the needs assessment, poor mental health is reportedly a significant barrier for people in Vermont who are trying to return to work. Staff described little support for mental health services and long wait lists for providers in Vermont. Exhibit VII. 2.

COVID-19 pandemic The COVID- 19 vaccination rate in Vermont is 81.1 percent, which is higher than the 66.6 percent vaccination rate nationwide.48 Program leaders and staff noted that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly delayed participating primary care practices' efforts to implement screening, because practices experienced staffing shortages and focused on COVID-19 testing and treatment. Program staff noted that the pandemic stressed the VT RETAIN program team and partners. \"There's a lot of providers with burnout and so sometimes it's hard to be asking for just one more thing.\" -Program Staff Accor ding to program staff, the pandemic has in some ways improved work opportunities for VT RETAIN enrollees. It reduced the labor market supply and prompted employers to increase wages, focus on retention, and offer flexibility to me et workers' needs. For example, the increased prevalence and acceptance of teleworking during the pandemic provided opportunities for workers in need of remote work accommodations. D. VT RETAIN's enrollment was delayed but is expected to increase as partic ipating primary care practices implement screening VT RETAIN referrals come from patient self -screening at participating primary care practices, which each practice implements differently , depending on the practice's unique workflows . A summary of the recruitment and enrollment process is included in Appendix E (Exhibit E.2). 1. Early enrollment outcomes During the first four months of enrollment (March 2022 - June 2022), VT RETAIN enrolled 38 workers (20 control and 18 treatment enrollees), 2 percent of their goal of enrolling 2,040 workers. The first four 48 Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center , 2022 . Available at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region . Accessed May 3, 2022. Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 97 months of enrollment represent about 15 percent of the total enrollment period. About 47 percent of all enrollees were treatment enrollees and 53 percent were control enrollees (Appendix E, Exhibit E.3). 2. Referral sources The primary source of referrals is patient self-screening at participating primary care practices. The pre-screener identifies patients who may be eligible for VT RETAIN. Practices alert patients to the screening questions by placing VT RETAIN promotional materials (such as posters, postcards, and fact sheets) in waiting and exam rooms . VT RETAIN provides materials for practices to implement the pre-screening method of their choosing, including collecting paper self -screeners, prompting patients to pre-screen on tablets, or including QR codes on promotional materials to allow patients to access the pre-screener on their phones. VT RETAIN has provided some practices with tablets to facilitate self -screening and is considering providing kiosks to practices. VT RETAIN does not have EMR agreements with practices that would allow recruitment staff to use the EMR to review patient medical records for a more active screening approach. VT RETAIN does not have EMR agreements with practices that would allow recruitment staff to use the EMR to review patient medical records for a more active screen ing approach. Program staff described the administrative burden of paper pre -screening forms relative to electronic forms. When patients self -screen using paper forms, recruitment staff do not receive automatic notifications of a positive screen. Instead, a practice staff member must fax completed paper screeners to the recruitment staff who manually enter the information into their data system. Program staff described this as a cumbersome process. When patients self-screen through a tablet or QR code, VT RETAIN recruitment staff receive an automatic notification prompting them to contact the potentially eligible worker. Program staff reported that updating paper forms is more challenging than updating electronic forms. For example, program staff found that a substantial portion of pre -screened patients were retired or did not plan to work, so they added a question to the pre -screener to identify patients who are no longer in the workforce. Program staff were able to make this change quickly at practices that use electronic pre- screeners but were delayed in making the change in practices that use paper screeners. Program leaders designed the self-screening process to limit the burden on practice staff and providers having to administer the screening to patie nts. Most enrollees complete the self -screener without the prompting or involvement of their provider. Program staff said that implementing new processes into primary care practices is always challenging due to limited resources and staffing, and this was made more challenging due to staff burnout and turnover during the pandemic. Some participating practices requested to delay their participation in VT RETAIN during the pandemic, though they were reportedly enthusiastic about the program. As of May 2022, nearly three-quarters of participating practices had implemented pre -screening into their workflows. Program staff reported that screening (and later recruitment) processes are the same for the treatment and control practices. Primary care practices recei ve $500 for implementing the screening process and $30 per enrollee. Program staff noted that both treatment and control practices are more incentivized by access to VT RETAIN's educational and training resources and SAW/RTW rehabilitation expertise than the financial incentives. When communicating with practice s, VT RETAIN program staff refer to treatment clinics as the \"resources and coaching group\" and control clinics as the \"resource group\" to emphasize the benefits of involvement in RETAIN regardless of random assignment . Program staff noted that they would like to explore whether uptake of screening differs between treatment and control clinics. Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 98 3. Outreach strategies VT RETAIN conducts outreach to potential enrollees through participating primary care practices. Program staff (usually the health care lead) held an orientation meeting at practices to review outreach strategies and provide the practice with VT RETAIN promotional materials. Outreach strategies and promotional materials are the same for the treatment and control practices. After the orientation meeting, RTW coordinators regularly check in with participating practices to see if they need additional outreach support. Program staff noted that developing relationships with practice staff and customizing promotional materials is helpful for engaging participating practices and is also time-intensive. VT RETAIN staff try to keep participating practices engaged by developin g in-person relationships with practice staff when feasible and framing VT RETAIN as a helpful resource for medical providers. Program staff noted that RTW coordinators generally interact with practice administrators and front desk staff; they are hoping t o build more relationships with the medical providers and clinical support staff who are more familiar with their patients' needs and could refer a patient to VT RETAIN. Program staff were considering developing a newsletter for practices to highlight ways other practices have implemented screening and patient outreach. Program staff described developing a VT RETAIN webpage on the VDOL website where medical providers, employers, and workers could access VT RETAIN information, including educational materials and training opportunities. Program staff hope that the VT RETAIN webpage will provide an opportunity to address confusion about how VT RETAIN is not a worker's compensation program, though it's housed in the Workers' Compensation Division. Program staff reported delays in launching the VT RETAIN webpage and limitations in the functionality of the State's website. 4. Strategies for recruiting underserved populations To support efforts to recruit and enroll underserved populations, VT RETAIN uses results from the needs assessment and receives guidance on diversity, equity, and inclusion from the Vermont Director of Racial Equity. VT RETAIN also recruited FQHCs, free clinics, and primary care practices in opportunity zones to reach underserved populations in both rural and urban areas. Program staff ask practices about the populations they serve so they can provide 508-compliant screeners, outreach materials, and enrollment forms in languages spoken by their patients. Recruitment staff also have access to interpreter services to make recruitment calls. Program staff noted that equity -focused recruitment efforts are time - and resource-intensive for both program staff and under -resourced practices, which creates a tension between focusing on equity while meeting enrollment targets. In addition, program staff have found that many patients at FQHCs and free clinics are ineligible for the program because of their lack of a Social Security number due to their immigration status, chronic disabilities, and because they recei ve SSA benefits. 5. Screening for eligibility The VT RETAIN program enrolls workers diagnosed with an injury or illness that is limiting or could limit their ability to stay at work or return to work. This includes work-limiting injury or illness that occurred or flared in the past six months. Individuals must be employed or actively looking for a job, age 18 or older, and living or working in Vermont, or be willing to include Vermont in a job search. The program excludes people who previously received care coordination services from VT RETAIN, have no Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 99 projected work capacity, are currently applying for or receiving SSA benefits, or have an active substance use disor der that is untreated. No more than 20 percent of enrollees can have been out of work for more than 12 weeks due to illness or injury. Program staff reported that the exclusion criteria are difficult for recruitment staff to interpret, and the DOL and Mathematica have at times provided conflicting guidance on how to interpret them. They noted that the eligibility criteria are difficult for potential enrollees to understand, which adds time during recruitment calls. Program staff described several challenges with the eligibility criteria that are limiting enrollment. A requirement that enrollees have a S ocial Security number effectively limits the enrollment of patients who immigrated to the United States without documentation . Program staff also explained that the 12 -week exclusion criteria are based on the recovery trajectory for musculoskeletal injuries and do not reflect a realistic recovery window for people with other health issues, such as COVID-19 or mental illness. This excludes about 40 percent of potential enrollees pre -screened as potentially eligible. Program s taff were grappling with developing a systematic process for identifying exceptions to the 12-week exclusion criteria . At this time, VT RETAIN makes exceptions on a case -by-case basis, according to their assessment of worker's potential to benefit from the program. \"It's very frustrating to market ourselves as a return- to-work project and not be able to provide services to people who are clearly in a window to return -to-work and it interferes with our credibility a little bit and then we're just not enrolling as many participants because a lot are inel igible.\" Program Staff 6. Recruitm ent Recruitment staff contact patients from p articipating practices who pre -screen as potentially eligible to confirm their eligibility for VT RETAIN and interest in enrolling. Program staff described a challenge that only about half of the potential enrollees answer recruitment calls, and most have little knowledge of VT RETAIN when they receive the recruitment call. To overcome this challenge, recruitment staff attempt to contact potential enrollees in multiple ways (phone, text, and email) so that they do not dismiss the calls as scams or telemarketing. Program staff also arranged for VT RETAIN to appear as the stated caller on caller identification. Program staff noted that they are continuously identifying additional ways to improve recruitment, including shortening the recruitment script. Progra m staff reported that once recruitment staff connect with potential enrollees on the telephone, about 85 percent of eligible patients enroll. Program staff attributed this success to the recruitment staffs' interpersonal skills. The recruitment staff were racially diverse, have disabilities themselves, and all had patient care backgrounds, reportedly enabling them to effectively connect with patients. Once a patient agrees to enroll in VT RETAIN, the recruitment staff reviews the enrollment forms and inform s the patient if they are assigned to the treatment or control group, which is based on study assignment of the participant's practice. Recruitment staff collect enrollees' informed consent to participate in the study, permitting the sharing of their infor mation. Control enrollees receive a VT RETAIN resource packet developed in Phase 1, which includes 10 tips for staying at work with an injury or illness and a list of resources for services related to general employment; employment specific to physical, mental health, and substance use conditions; social needs; and self -care. Treatment enrollees receive the VT RETAIN resource packet and RTW coordination services from a designated RTW Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 100 coordinator. Recruitment staff send a letter to medical providers informin g them when one of their patients is enrolled in VT RETAIN, screened at -risk for a work disability but was ineligible for RETAIN, or was not contacted. 7. Treatment enrollee characteristics We used enrollment data submitted by VT RETAIN to assess demographic characteristics for the 18 people who enrolled in the first four months of the enrollment period (March 2022 to June 2022) and were assigned to the treatment group (Appendix E, Exhibit E.4). Most treatment enrollees were male (61 percent). The average age of the treatment enrollees was 48. 49 Most were White, non -Hispanic (94 percent) (Exhibit VII.3). Many treatment enrollees had at least a high school diploma, GED, or certificate of completion (61 percent), and most preferred to speak English (94 percent). Exhibit VII.3 . Race and ethnicity characteristics of treatment enrollees (p ercentage) Source: VT RETAIN enrollment data through June 30, 2022. Note: We s uppressed the \"More than one race\" category to avoid disclosing information about particular people, which is why the percentages do not add to 100. VT RETAIN = Vermont Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. We also used the enrollment data submitted by VT RETAIN to assess illness and injury characteristics for the 18 treatment enrollees described above (Appendix E, Exhibit E.5). Just under half of treatment enrollees reported a primary diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition (44 percent), with 22 percent reporting a non -back musculoskeletal condition and 22 percent reporting a musculoskeletal back condition (Exhibit VII.4). The remainder reported a primary diagnosis of a condition that did not fall under the four RETAIN primary diagnosis categories (39 percent). VT RETAIN enrolls people with work - and non-work -related conditions, and 44 percent of enrollees reported their injury or illness was work related. People with a pre-existing or new condition are eligible, and, for VT RETAIN, half of treatment enrollees repor ted their illness or injury was a new condition at the time of enrollment (50 49 We are only able to report the percentage of treatment enrollees who wer e ages 40 to 44 years and 50 to 54 years due to small numbers and the need to avoid disclosing information about particular people. Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 101 percent). Treatment enrollees had an average of 80 days between the onset of their primary diagnosis (either a new condition or an exacerbation of a chronic condition) and their enrollment in VT RETAIN. Exhibit VII.4. Primary diagnosis characteristics of treatment enrollees ( percentage) Source: VT RETAIN enrollment data through June 30, 2022. Note: We s uppressed the \"Mental \" category to avoid disclosing information about particular people, which is why the percentages do not add to 100 percent. Note: We classify ICD -10 codes into five primary diagnosis categories: Musculoskeletal , back ; Musculoskeletal , non-back ; Long C OVID; Mental ; and Other. These groupings build on previous studies of return to work among injured or ill workers . We include the mapping of ICD -10 codes into these categories in Appendix E, Exhibit 5. ICD = International Classification of Diseases; VT RETAIN = Vermont Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. We also used enrollment data submitted by VT RETAIN to assess employment characteristics for the 18 treatment enrollees described above (Appendix E, Exhibit E.6). All RETAIN programs mu st enroll workers who are employed or in the labor force , and, for VT RETAIN, many treatment enrollees were employed (61 percent). A little less than half of treatment enrollees were currently working or worked within one week of enrollment (45 percent). ( Exhibit VII.5). On average, treatment enrollees were employed full time (40 hours per week) before onset of injury or illness. Half of treatment enrollees worked at their current job for less than a year (50 percent) and almost 30 percent worked at their job for more than five years. 50 Over the last year, many treatment enrollees earned at least $1,000 per month (78 percent). The highest proportion of treatment enrollees were classified as holding a service occupation (28 percent) (Exhibit VII.6). Other tre atment enrollees held occupations in management, professional or 50 We suppressed the percentage of treatment enrollees who last worked at their current job from one to five years due to sma ll numbers and the need to avoid disclosing information about particular people.

Therefore, percentages do not add to 100 percent. VT RETAIN = Vermont Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network. We also used enrollment data to compare treatment enrollees' characteristics with control enrollees' characteristics. As outlined in the Evaluation Design Report, we expected treatment and control enrollees to have similar baseline characteristics because each state has a random assignment design (Berk et al. 2021) . We found no significant differences between treatment and control enrollees in the characteristics we examined (Appendix E, Exhibits E.4, E.5, and E.6). E. VT RETAIN has limited experie nce providing RTW coordination services given the low number of enrollees At the time of the interviews in May 2022, VT RETAIN had limited experience delivering the RTW coordination services and other RTW services as planned in the VT RETAIN program model. Early activities centered around developing materials, trainings, and relationships with partners. Staff described initial implementation challenges related to delivering services while developing and refining resources such as the training and development program and integrating equity and sustainability efforts into program implementation. In addition, VT RETAIN noted the time intensiveness of responding to federal reporting and evaluation requirements. 1. Medical provider services The health care lead and program staff deliver in-person and live online trainings to participating primary care practices to increase awareness of VT RETAIN, the importance of work for health, the screening tool, and implementing screening into practice workflows. VT RETAIN is working to create on-demand versions of trainings for the learning platform so that practices can complete trainings at any time. Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 104 Through its training and development program, VT RETAIN aims to increase the number of providers trained in SAW/RTW best pra ctices throughout Vermont. According to program staff, any Vermont provider (including treatment and control providers) will be able to access trainings and educational resources on the learning platform and VT RETAIN webpage. The development center is currently creating these materials and trainings based on feedback they received from providers in the needs assessment and conversations with practice staff. The training and development program is also awarding grants to train multidisciplinary teams in rehabilitation team assessments and award community Functional Restoration Program grants for medical providers in Vermont to receive training in functional restoration. Through these training grants, VT RETAIN aims to increase the availability of rehabilitation services. RTW coordinators will refer treatment enrollees to these providers and multidisciplinary teams. Exhibit VII.7. VT RETAIN medical provider services Program component Definition Training medical providers Providers in Vermont access live and on-demand online trainings and educational materials on SAW/RTW topics. Providers in Vermont can apply for a grant to train a team of providers in multidisciplinary medical rehabilitation. Providers in Vermont can apply for community Functional Restoration Programs grants to receive training on functional restoration. Incentivizing medical providers Providers in Vermont receive continuing medical education credits for completing VT RETAIN training. VT RETAIN = Vermont Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network ; RTW = return to work; SAW = stay at work . Through conversations with participating practices, program staff learned that providers are eager for information about referrals, resources, and best practices to support patients, as well as opportunities to receive CME credits. Program staff noted that providers are extremely busy and were more likely to attend in -person VT RETAIN trainings if the program provided food and the health care lead conducted the trainings on-site. 2. RTW coordination services Each treatment enrollee receives SAW/RTW coordination support from a designated RTW coordinator (Exhibit VII.8). Most RTW coordinators work for the clinical coordinating center full time. A few RTW coordinators are case manager s embedded in treatment practices who spend about 20 percent of their time on VT RETAIN. The pros and cons of embedding case managers is not yet clear, though program staff noted that it may help with communication between VT RETAIN and participating pract ices. During intake, RTW coordinators assess the treatment enrollee's barriers to staying at or returning to work and work goals, develop an RTW plan, connect the enrollee with resources to address social needs, and provide referrals to resources like Vocational Rehabilitation and American Job Centers. RTW coordinators can also communicate with the enrollee's employer, medical providers, and others as needed to coordinate their SAW/RTW needs. Services end once the enrollee achieves the goals documented in their R TW plan or after six months, whichever comes first. Given the low enrollment numbers to date, program staff had limited experience providing RTW coordination services as planned under the VT RETAIN program model . Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 105 Exhibit VII.8 . VT RETAIN RTW coordination services Program component Definition Coordinating RTW services RTW coordinators conduct an intake assessment of SAW/RTW barriers and work goals. RTW coordinators work with the treatment enrollee to develop an RTW plan. RTW coordinators use the RTW Services Inventory to match the treatment enrollee with services RTW coordinators engage with the RTW expert team for support in providing appropriate RTW services and referrals. Treatment enrollees may use a mobile health system to self -report their progress to their RTW coordinator and medical provider. The RTW coordinators may use the app to communicate and share resources with treatment enrollees. Communicating among parties involved in RTW plan RTW coordinators use a strength-based approach to encourage treatment enrollees to communicate directly with their medical provider, employer, and other RTW professionals . If given permission, the RTW coordinators communicate about the RTW plan, progress, and accommodations with treatment enrollees' medical provider and employer. Monitoring treatment enrollee progress RTW coordinators primarily monitor progress through check -ins with enrollees, during which they record enrollees' medical and employment information, case notes, provider notes, and results of assessments . RTW coordinators will be able to use a mobile health system as an additional tool to monitor enrollee progress . Note: * Interactive Mobile Health & Rehabilitation (iMHere) is a care coordination mobile health system. VT RETAIN created a state specific version of the system called LINK~VT. VT RETAIN = Vermont Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work; SAW = stay at work. RTW coordinators have access to many recorded trainings. Examples of training topics include Vermont's economic conditions, how to use the state's electronic data capture system, and resources available to RTW coordi nators to support treatment enrollees. Program staff reported that while the amount of training content available can be overwhelming, the information presented by subject matter experts and colleagues in the recorded trainings is valuable. Through the tra inings, RTW coordinators learn about the clinical experts like physical therapists and occupational therapists with whom they can consult on their cases. Program staff reported that RTW coordinators find it helpful to have short, recorded trainings they can view on their own time. a. Coordinating RTW services Program data submitted by VT RETAIN indicate that 61 percent of treatment enrollees received VT RETAIN services, including RTW coordination services or other RTW services (Exhibit VII.9). Just over half of all treatment enrollees (56 percent) had an established RTW plan. An average of 14.9 days elapsed between enrollment to establishment of a RTW plan for treatment enrollees in VT RETAIN. As of the end of June 2022, there are treatment enrollees who had exited VT RETAIN, but we suppressed these data to avoid disclosing information about particular people. Chapter VII.

RTW coordinators benefit from a mix of expertise on the team, including nursing, employment services, and social work. RTW coordinators attend weekly case review meetings and consult with one another regularly for advice on their cases. Program leaders and staff reported that the RTW coordinat ors are empathetic, collaborative, and dedicated. Program staff report that during initial conversations with their RTW coordinators, treatment enrollees seem relieved to have an advocate who is ready to listen and assist them. In addition to consulting w ith each other, RTW coordinators will be able to reference an RTW coordinator manual and RTW Services Inventory to assist enrollees. VT RETAIN is currently updating the manual and inventory, a comprehensive catalog of SAW/RTW services and resources throughout the state. RTW coordinators have not yet had much experience using the tool to match treatment enrollees to resources. For support on their cases, RTW coordinators can consult a multidisciplinary RTW Expert Team. The team includes specialists in occup ational and environmental medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, pain medicine, physical therapy, occupational therapy, social work, nursing, behavioral health, substance use disorders, VR, employment assistance, financial and benefits counseling, employment and workers' compensation law, and employment and career services. RTW coordinators report using a variety of strategies to address the challenge of keeping treatment enrollees engaged and responsive. They set up regular meetings with treatment enrollees, text meeting reminders, and check in after treatment enrollees' health care appointments. Program staff are hopeful that VT RETAIN's newly developed mobile health system will streamline communication and improve engagement. Participants will us e the app to message their RTW coordinator, complete functional assessments, receive resources from their RTW coordinator, schedule appointments, and document goals and progress. VT RETAIN has employed several strategies to facilitate participant connecti ons with RTW coordinators when access to technology and the Internet is a challenge. If a participant does not have a smartphone, VT RETAIN is able to lend them a phone for the duration of their participation. VT RETAIN is develop ing relationships with Northern Vermont University and libraries to help treatment enrollees in rural areas access Internet connectivity and resources through libraries and telehealth portals. Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 107 b. Communication among parties involved in enrollee return to work In Exhibit VII.10, we list the possible avenues of communication among RTW coordinators and others involved in enrollees' RTW plans and list the percentage of reported communications that occurred in each, as reported in the program data submitted by VT RETAIN. Based on service use data from VT RETAIN, RTW coordinators communicated with a medical provider at least once for 17 percent of treatment enrollees, and no RTW coordinators communicated with a workforce professional at least once (0 percent). We suppressed the data reflecting RTW coordinators communication with an employer to because the numbers were small enough to identify treatment enrollees. Exhibit VII.10.

VT RETAIN = Vermont Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work. RTW coordinators solicit authorization forms from treatment enrollees that give them permission to speak with the treatment enrollees' employer, provider, or workforce professional about their RTW/SAW plan and progress. Because of low enrollment, RTW coordinators had limited experience soliciting authorization forms and connecting with employers, providers, and ot hers to implement workplace-based interventions. Program staff reported that some providers are not aware of VT RETAIN until they have a patient enroll in the program; staff would like to increase provider awareness of the program. c. Monitoring treatment enrollee progress RTW coordinators primarily monitor treatment enrollee progress through regular check-ins with enrollees. RTW coordinators use an electronic data capture system developed by VT RETAIN to record enrollees' medical and employment information and store case notes, forms, provider notes, and results of assessments. Program staff anticipate that as treatment enrollees start using the mobile health system to complete functional assessments, the mobile app will be an additional tool to m onitor treatment enrollee progress. 3. Other RTW services As of May 2022, RTW coordinators had limited experience supporting workplace -based interventions or referring treatment enrollees to retraining and rehabilitation services as planned under the VT RE TAIN program model (Exhibit VII.11). The RTW coordinator can work with the treatment enrollee to create a workplace intervention plan, and the RTW expert team can provide assessment and consultation on workplace accommodations.

Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees RTW coordinator s refer treatment enrollees to employment counselors at American Job Centers. RTW coordinator s make referrals to the VT Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. RTW coordinators make referrals to teams trained in multidisciplinary medical rehabilitation through the training grants . VT RETAIN = Vermont Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Il lness Network; RTW = return to work. a. Supporting workplace -based interventions VT RETAIN's training and development program is expanding and creating new in-person and online employer trainings and educational materials to post on the publicly available learning platform. Content covers topics such as creating functional job descriptions that help clinicians understand their patient's job responsibilities. Vermont employers can also apply for a grant to be certified as a workplace that supports employees with mental health and substance use challenges. VT RETAIN started creating mental health resources in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and requests from employers. VT RETAIN is currently determining a strategy to inform employers about the learning platform and grants. Service use data from VT RETAIN indicated that 50 percent of treatment enrollees received a workplace accommodation (Exhibit VII.12). VT RETAIN did not report on -site job analysis or ergonomic assessments for its treatment enrollees. Exhibit VII.12. Treatment enrollees' receipt of workplace -based interventions VT RETAIN service use and data outcomes Percentage Received on-site job analysis 0.0 Received ergonomic assessment 0.0 Received workplace accommodation 50.0 Source: VT RETAIN service use data through June 30, 2022 VT RETAIN = Vermont Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work. b. Retraining or rehabilitating enrollees Service use data from VT RETAIN indicated that about 17 percent of treatment enrollees received job search services (Exhibit VII.13). In addition to referring treatment enrollees to American Job Centers, RTW coordinators anticipate referring treatment enrollees to the VT Division of Vocational Rehabilitation for retraining and rehabilitation resources that complement VT RETAIN. Staff note that a Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 109 benefit to connecting VT RETAIN treatment enrollees with VR early is that VR can provide support after the end of a worker's six months in VT RETAIN. Exhibit VII.13.

VT RETAIN = Vermont Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network; RTW = return to work. In complex cases, RTW coordinators may refer treatment enrollees to teams trained in multidisciplinary medical rehabilitation through the training grants. These rehabilitation teams can provide in-person assessment and consultation on barriers to employment. As of the site visit in June, none of the VT RETAIN treatment enrollees had received this assessment. 4. Service contrast Access to an RTW coordinator is the most significant service contrast between what was available to the VT RETAIN treatment and control groups. C ontrol enrollees received the VT RETAIN resource packet developed in Phase 1, including information about publicly available resources like American Job Centers, VT JobLink, 52 and VR. VR provide d vocational counseling from case managers, assistive technology suppor t, and job placement and retention services. Though the RTW coordinators refer treatment enrollees to the same WFD services that are available to others, the RTW coordinators can help ensure the treatment enrollees are connected with the right services and coordinate follow up. WFD services. VT RETAIN has yet to hire VDOL workforce development staff to provide services specific to VT RETAIN. RTW coordinators reported coaching treatment enrollees to self -advocate and communicate with their medical providers and employers directly, instead of having the RTW coordinator as an intermediary. Control enrollees do not receive coaching or have RTW coordinators communicate on their behalf. 5. Collecting and reporting program data VT RETAIN developed an electronic data capture system to collect data for the evaluation and monitor enrollee progress. Recruitment staff use the system to enter enrolment information. RTW coordinators use the system to record enrollees' medical and employment information, house forms, and capture case notes. Program staff are overwhelmingly positive about the user -friendly system and appreciate administrators' responsiveness to requests for improvements. For example, the team added an automatic notification when a new patient completes an electronic pre-screener. Staff report that the process for submitting data for the evaluation is going smoothly overall, in large part due to its automation efforts . One challenge is making sure DOL, Mathematica, and VT RETAIN staff 52 Vermont JobLink is an online job -matching and labor market info rmation system. Chapter VII. Vermont RETAIN Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 110 are on the same page regarding data definitions. Changes in reporting requirements and new guidance from DOL and Mathematica have resulted in additional work, though the state reports that Mathematica has been helpful in clarifying data issues as needed. F. Areas for continued monitoring and evaluation technical assistance Our analysis of the interview data collected in May 2022 and enrollment data collected through June 3 0, 2022 , raised several issues that could affect the impact evaluation. The Mathematica team will continue to monitor these issues and provide evaluation t echnical assistance as needed. VT RETAIN's enrollment is low relative to the goal of 2,040 enrollees. As of June 30, 2022, VT RETAIN reached 1.8 percent of the target, while it is 15 percent through its enrollment period. Enrollment will need to increase significantly to have enough enrollees to draw conclusions about the impact of the program on the treatment enrollees. Mathematica will monitor enrollment and screening, particularly in control practices which theoretically could have less incentive for pr omoting screening. VT RETAIN is challenged with developing a system for deciding which workers to enroll who have been out of work for more than 12 weeks due to illness or injury. Mathematica or other RETAIN contractors will provide technical assistance to VT RETAIN, as needed, to help determine and apply appropriate criteria. VT RETAIN has not yet hired workforce development staff to focus on employer relations and the integration of employm ent services into VT RETAIN as planned under the program model. Though the same workforce services are available to both the treatment and control enrollees, the treatment group may benefit from RTW coordinators connecting them with appropriate workforce development services. Chapter VIII. Conclusion Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 111 VIII. Conclusion Our assessment of states' experiences with the initial implementation of the RETAIN programs shows the progress states hav e ma de and the complexities of the demonstrations. In Exhibit V III.1, we summarize the issues emerging across states for which we recommend continued monitoring because they could affect the impact evaluation. Most notably, enrollment was low in four of the five states. In addition, three states were slow to engage medical providers in training. Three states revealed potential concerns with the service contrast and ensuring that treatment enrollees received intervention services that were distinct from the services received by control enrollees. Exhibit VI II.1. Summary of issues that emerged across states' RETAIN programs Area for continued monitoring RETAINWORK S RETAIN Kentucky Minnesota RETAIN Ohio RETAIN Vermont RETAIN Slow enrollment X X X X Limited medical provider training X X X Reduced service contrast X X X Challenges applying eligibility criteria X X Challenges reporting program data X In the upcoming process analysis report, we will assess the full implementation of the RETAIN demonstration. The process analysis report will provide a summative assessment of recruitment, enrollment, service provision, and adherence to the planned program model after the states have had time to fully implement their RETAIN programs. We will use qualitative data from interviews with enrollees (fall 2023) and the second round of site visits (spring 2023) to assess barriers and facilitators that emerged across states to influence recruitment, enrollment, and implementation of the RETAIN programs. Quantitative data from the program performance data and RETAIN medical provider survey will enable us to assess providers' implementation of RETAIN program components and enrollees' receipt of RETAIN services. We will submit a draft process analysis report to SSA in December 2024. Mathematica\u00ae Inc. 112 This page has been left blank for double -sided copying .

However, the referral can begin at another source: 1. Medical provider refers patient. 2. Local workforce center refers client. 3. Worker self -refers. Recruitment RTW coordinator receives completed referral form and contacts the potential enrollee to review eligibility, complete informed consent form, and alert them they will be contacted by an employment counselor. Enrollment RTW coordinator contacts potential enrollee to review informed consent requirements and address any concerns that might prevent enrollment. Randomization Employment counselors contacts the potential enrollee to collect documentation confirming eligibility. Employment counselor enters enrollee's information into Confirmit to determine placement in either the treatment or control group and enters the required information from part 1 of the baseline survey into Confirmit. The Confirmit software randomizes enrollees to either the treatment or control group. Initial engagement into the program Eligible individuals receive $50 incentive for completing enrollment paperwork. Discharge from program RTW coordinators close the treatment enrollee's case after 6 months or after the treatment enrollee has returned to work for 8 weeks without restrictions.

Eight RETAIN KY staff conduct outreach to referral sources to increase awareness of RETAIN and prompt referrals. These referral sources then educate workers experiencing an illness or injury about RETAIN and, if the w orker permits, they make a referral or they encourage the worker to self -refer to RETAIN. 1. University of Louisville Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation physicians group refers staff and patients. 2. UK Healthcare refers staff and patients. 3. Frazier Rehabilitation Institute refers staff and patients. 4. CHI Saint Joseph Medical Group refers staff and patients. 5. KY Workforce Innovation Board refers employers and workers. 6. Local Workforce Development Boards refers employers and workers. 7. KY Chamber of Commerce refers employers and workers. 8. Unite Us, an online platform for referrals from community agencies, refers clients. 9. Absence management organization refers workers. 10. Employer refers workers. 11. Worker self -refers. Recruitment Intake coordinator contacts potentially eligible worker within 24 hours of receiving the referral to confirm eligibility and introduce the RETAIN program. Workers found ineligible can receive additional resources and a referral to the Office of Vocational Rehabili tation. Enrollment The intake coordinator reads a two-page document aloud to obtain informed consent from eligible workers. Enrollee provides verbal consent to enroll, which the intake coordinator records in the CMDS. The intake coordinator offers to send a copy of the consent document. Enrollee completes baseline surveys 1 and 2. Randomization Intake coordinator enters the required information from part 1 of the baseline survey into Confirmit. The Confirmit software randomizes enrollees to either the treatment or control group. Intake coordinator identifies an RTW coordinator based on whether the enrollee is assigned to the treatment group or control group. RTW coordinators work exclusively with treatment enrollees or control enrollees (to provide limited services). Initial engagement into the program Treatment enrollee receives a packet of information electronically, including a form to consent to release information to medical providers, employers, and others. The form includes a separate consent for each type of release. Treatment enrollee selects and signs consents to release information, which allows RTW coordinator to communicate with other stakeholders. Discharge from program RTW coordinators close the treatment enrollee's case after 6 months, or after the treatment enrollee has returned to work and the RTW plan is completed. RTW coordinators refer enrollees who nee d longer -term services to vocational rehabilitation. RTW coordinators close the control enrollee's case after 2 meetings over 2 weeks. There are no incentives for treatment or control enrollees when they exit from the program. Source: Application for Phase 2 of RETAIN , quarterly progress reports, and virtual site visit interviews.

MN RETAIN recruitment and enrollment process Element of recruitment process Description Referral source MN RETAIN has several referral sources. MN RETAIN leaders and program staff are working to conduct outreach to referral sources so these referral sources will educate workers experiencing an illness or injury about MN RETAIN; if the worker permits, they make a referral or they encourage the worker to self -refer to RETAIN. 1. Mayo Clinic recruitment staff review s ocial determinants of h ealth report and an orthopedics report to identify patients who may be potentially eligible for MN RETAIN. 2. Medical provider refers patient. 3. Employer refers workers. 4. Worker self refers. Recruitment Recruitment staff reaches out to the potentially eligible worker to confirm eligibility, introduce the RETAIN program, and determine interest in the program. Enrollment RTW coordinator reviews and obtains informed consent from eligible worker and coordinates completion of the MN RETAIN application and all necessary forms, including the baseline survey. RTW coordinator provides the enrollee with a $100 incentive upon the completion of enrollment. Randomization RTW coordinator enters the required information from part 1 of the baseline survey into Confir mit. The Confirmit software randomizes enrollees to either the treatment or control group. RTW coordinator provides control enrollee with a list of resources to help them return to work and tells them they can access the resources independently. The control enrollees do not receive any further support from MN RETAIN. Initial engagement in the program RTW coordinator notifies the treatment enrollee's medical provider via email that their patient enrolled in the MN RETAIN study. This communication includes a summary of the MN RETAIN program, the MN RETAIN brochure, and encouragement for the provider to complete the MN RETAIN educational training modules on the website. During the enrollment call, the RTW coordinator engages with the treatment enrollee to develop an individualized employment plan and RTW or SAW plan. Discharge from program RTW coordinator works with the treatment enrollee until they return to work without restrictions, return to work with permanent restrictions, or meet the criteria for completing the program. RTW coordinator does not work with the treatment enrollee for more than six months. RTW coordinator provides the treatment enrollee with a $100 incentive at the conclusion of their enrollment in MN RETAIN.

Appendix C Mathematica\u00ae with F Long COVID Z86.16; U09 Other ICD10 codes that do not fall under any of the four categories above a Minnesota's reporting process might affect the share of people in each impairment grouping. Instead of directly recording the primary ICD -10 code for each enrollee, Minnesota developed a drop- down menu of 25 impairment categories to select from (for example, Back, Hip, Knee, Cardiac, Stroke, Mental Health). For injuries or illnesses that do not fall into the specified categories, the Minnesota team entered the primary ICD -10 code. This process might lead to a different distribution of impairment groupings than recording the primary ICD -10 code for each enrollee. But because of the relatively broad impairment groupings we constructed, we expect any differences would be minimal . b Musculoskeletal, non-back includes conditions that affect the joints, bones, muscles, or multiple body areas or systems. c A small percentage of enrollees enrolled before the date of injury.

Appendix D Mathematica\u00ae Inc. D.4 Exhibit D.2. OH RETAIN recruitment and enrollment process Element of recruitment process Description Referral source OH RETAIN has three referral sources. OH RETAIN program staff identify most enrollees through EMR reports. Recruitment staff reach out to medical providers so they can educate patients experiencing an illness or injury about OH RETAIN and, if the patient permits, they make a referral. 1. EMR reports identify patients of the lead health care partner who meet initial eligibility criteria. 2. Medical provider refers patient. 3. Worker self -refers. Recruitment If the patient is interested in participating in OH RETAIN, recruitment staff schedule an enrollment call and email OH RETAIN program and consent information to the patient. Participating medical providers recommend OH RETAIN to their patients who may be eligible. Enrollment RTW coordinator calls potential enrollees to review OH RETAIN program and consent information. RTW coordinator obtains consent from potential enrollees by having them sign the consent via DocuSign software or mail the signed consent forms to the OH RETAIN office. RTW coordinator sends a welcome letter to enrollees with a copy of the signed forms upon receipt of consent forms. Program administrator issues a $100 incentive payment (a Target gift card) to enrollees after completing the enrollment process . Randomization RTW coordinator enters the required information from part 1 of the baseline survey and uploads the enrollee's consent form into Confirmit. The Confirmit software randomizes enrollees to the treatment or control groups. RTW coordinator provides control enr ollees with a packet of resour ces to help them return to work and tells them they can access the resources independently. Control enrollees do not receive any further support from OH RETAIN. Initial engagement into the program During the enrollment call, the RTW coordinator establishes treatment goals with enrollees randomized to the treatment group. The RTW coordinator contacts the treatment enrollee's medical provider upon enrollment and the treatment enrollee's employer within three days to notify them of the worker's enrollment in OH RETAIN. Discharge from program OH RETAIN enrollment ends when a treatment enrollee returns to work without difficulty, after completing six months of OH RETAIN services, or if an enrollee requests to end OH RETAIN services.

RTW = return to work ; VT RETAIN= Vermont Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network . Exhibit E.2. VT RETAIN recruitment and enrollment process Element of recruitment process Description Referral source Patients at participating primary care practices self-refer by completing a pre-screener. VT RETAIN encourages participating practices to integrate pre-screening into visit registration, but each practice identifies the screening mode and workflow that best fits their practice. Pre-screeners are available on paper forms or electronic forms on tablets, kiosks, etc. The pre-screener is 508-compliant and available in several languages. Recruitment The study coordinator calls patients who pre- screen as potentially eligible to scree n for eligibility. The study coordinator introduces the RETAIN program and attempts to recruit workers. Enrollment The study coordinator asks enrollees to sign a consent form . The study coordinator asks the eligible worker to complete the part 1 of the baseline survey through an online portal, picking up and dropping off paper forms at their primary care practice or receiving paper forms in the mail. The eligible worker can opt for the study coordinator to help them navigate the completion of the forms over the telephone. The study coordinator asks the enrollee to complete the Baseline Participant Survey Part 2 and a functional assessment, with support from the study coordinator . If applicable, the study coordinator collects the worker's reasons for declining participation, and VT RETAIN uses this information for continuous quality improvement. Randomization Mathematica helps randomize patients into the treatment or control group, depending on whether they are affiliated with a treatment or control clinic. Initial engagement into the program The study coordinator provides all enrollees with program resources, informs the enrollee about American Job Center services, and assists the enrollee in opening a VT JobLink * account if they do not have one. The study coordinator provides an incentive payment of $50 to the enrollee upon completion of enrollment and intake forms (authorization form, Baseline Participant Survey Part 1 -2, coach intake, functional assessment ). The study coordinator assigns the treatment enrollee to an RTW coordinator. The RTW coordinator asks treatment enrollees to sign a health care-compliant authorization form to authorize the RTW coordinator to access their health records and communicate with their health care provider s and RTW care team. Discharge from program The study coordinator provides a final $50 compensation after the treatment enrollee completes the final satisfaction survey. Enrollment concludes when the treatment enrollee achieves the goals documented in their RTW plan or has been enrolled for 6 months (whichever comes first).

The table that follows provides our mapping of ICD-10 codes into the five primary diagnosis categories. These groupings build on previous studies of return to work among injured or ill workers, such as Contreary et al. (2018) , Neuhauser et al. (2018 ), and Bourbeonniere and Mann (2018 ). Appendix E Mathematica\u00ae with F Long COVID Z86.16; U09 Other ICD10 codes that do not fall under any of the four categories above aVermont's reporting process might affect the share of people in each impairment grouping. Instead of directly recording the primary ICD10 code for each enrollee, Vermont developed a drop-down menu of 30 impairment categories to select from (for example, Back, Hip, Knee, Cardiac, Stroke, Mental Health). For injuries or illnesses that do not fall into the specified categories, the Vermont team entered the primary ICD10 code. This process might lead to a different distribution of impairment groupings than recording the primary ICD10 code for each enrollee. However, given the relatively broad impairment groupings we constructed, we expect any differences would be minimal. b Musculoskeletal, non-back includes conditions that affect the joints, bones, muscles, or multiple body areas or systems. c A small percentage of enrollees enr olled before the date of injury.
