Still, university officials announced the Ithaca, N.Y. campus would be shut down Tuesday after 903 new infections were reported last week, many of them [omicron variant cases](https://wsbt.com/news/coronavirus/data-indicate-omicron-is-milder-better-at-evading-vaccines) among vaccinated individuals. All activities and athletics have been canceled for the rest of the semester and final exams have moved online. \"While I want to provide reassurance that, to date, we have not seen severe illness in any of our infected students, we do have a role to play in reducing the spread of the disease in the broader community,\" vice president for University Relations Joel Malina said in a statement. Two years after COVID-19 was first identified and one year after vaccines became available, a fresh winter surge and a highly transmissible new variant are stirring debates over the public health response and the purpose of mitigation measures. Experts say the virus is likely to remain in circulation for years, and reverting to masks and quarantines every time cases surge is unsustainable long-term. Some have criticized Cornell's response as an overreaction, given that 97% of the campus is vaccinated and no severe symptoms have emerged. However, according to Tomoko Udo, an associate professor of health policy, management, and behavior at the University at Albany, much depends on what the university's intention is. \"If the goal is to prevent any cases appearing on campus, including asymptomatic cases, due to possibility of students or staff becoming a vector and spreading in the wider community, then continuing with this level of surveillance testing and strict quarantine requirement makes sense,\" Udo said. \"If the goal is to prevent students and staff from getting seriously ill from COVID-19, I don't think it makes sense to keep focusing on detection of asymptomatic cases.\" [The emergence of the omicron variant](https://wsbt.com/news/nation-world/us-faces-a-double-coronavirus-surge-as-omicron-advances), which appears to be more capable of evading immunity than previous mutations, presents an unwelcome challenge for policymakers. Some communities that had begun to ease off restrictions after the late-summer delta variant wave subsided are now reimposing them. In New York and California, governors have instituted new mask mandates in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. However, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in Colorado adopted a different approach, declaring, \"The emergency is over\" and rejecting statewide restrictions. \"If you haven't been vaccinated, that's your choice,\" Polis said on Colorado Public Radio Friday. \"I respect that. But it's your fault when you're in the hospital with COVID.\" That sentiment reflects [a frustration and fatigue](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/where-i-live-no-one-cares-about-covid/620958/) that have been simmering among both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated as the pandemic drags on. [In a Trafalgar Group poll](https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/news/nat-issues-survey-omicron-1209/) released Wednesday, 69% said they would not support new mandates and restrictions over the omicron variant. \"As we've seen in our polls repeatedly, the American people are tired of all this and ready to get on with their lives,\" said Mark Meckler, president of Convention of States Action. Even if one agrees there is a time where the nation should back off non-pharmaceutical interventions, though, it is debatable whether this is that time. Case numbers are climbing, about 1,000 people in the U.S. are dying daily, and things are on track to get much worse before they get better. \"As we head into the winter and confront a new variant, we must resolve to keep fighting this virus together,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement Tuesday. \"This means getting vaccinated and getting your booster shot, and taking other prevention measures, such as masking.\" [According to The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/12/14/omicron-us-spread/), new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention models project a fresh wave of infections driven by the omicron variant could peak in January. Officials are concerned about a potential \"triple whammy\" of omicron, delta, and seasonal flu cases overwhelming hospitals. \"We expect to see the proportion of omicron cases here in the United States continue to grow in the coming weeks,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday. \"Early data suggest that omicron is more transmissible than delta, with a doubling time of about two days.\" It is true most people who end up hospitalized or dying at this point are unvaccinated, and anyone over age 4 now has ample opportunities to get vaccinated. However, the strain on health systems from a surge of infections affects more than just COVID-19 patients, and the unchecked spread of the omicron variant could increase the risk to the vaccinated as well. \"I truly think that once we can get the number of deaths and hospitalizations under the control nationwide, or even globally, these preventive measures should go away,\" Udo said. More variants [will almost certainly emerge](https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/experts-hopeful-omicron-causes-more-mild-illness-but-questions-remain), and seasonal weather changes will likely continue to bring new surges in different parts of the country in the years ahead. With effective vaccines and treatments available, living with that threat should become easier, and it will eventually be up to Americans to decide how much it disrupts their lives. \"It definitely makes sense to transfer the responsibility of risk management from the government to individuals at one point,\" Udo said. \"Again, I think this is a philosophical question as to when that "}
