Two thirds of those people are women. A [recent study](https://n.neurology.org/content/82/12/1045) shows, Alzheimer's Disease likely plays a much larger role in the deaths of older Americans than is reported and is now seen as the third leading cause of death right behind heart disease and cancer. Between 2000 and 2017, deaths from heart disease have decreased by 9%, while deaths from Alzheimer's have increased 145%. The good news is, there is finally hope in preventing and even reversing cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's Disease through the Dr. Dale Bredesen's ReCODE protocol. Dale E. Bredesen, M.D. wrote the book [The End of Alzheimers, The First Program to Prevent and Reverse Cognitive Decline](https://www.amazon.com/End-Alzheimers-Program-Prevent-Cognitive/dp/0735216207). Dr. Bredesen is a professor of Neurology at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Dr. Bredesen found that by using a comprehensive approach to assessment and treatment, the reversal of cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease was possible. The ReCODE protocol evaluates 150 different variables, including biochemistry, genetics and historical imaging, to determine which factors are most likely driving the disease. Dr. Dersam is one of the few Integrative and Functional Medicine M.D's who is certified to offer this ReCODE program to her patients. How Does the Bredesen Program Work? Dr. Dersam will conduct a thorough assessment to identify the drivers of cognitive decline in each patient. Dr. Bredesen calls these drivers the \"36 holes in your roof\" that need to be patched to improve cognitive function. He has determined that there are 3 distinct types of Alzheimer's Disease. During the initial evaluation, Dr. Dersam will gather information and conduct tests to classify each patient's type of cognitive decline. Once the \"type/s\" are determined, a personalized lifestyle and treatment program is created specifically for each patient including: - Diet changes - Exercise - Stress management - Sleep optimization Throughout the program you will visit with Dr. Dersam to assess your treatment plan and make any necessary adjustments. Who is a Good Candidate for This Program This program is good for people who have early signs of cognitive decline or are newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. It is also useful for those individuals looking to determine and reduce their risk for developing Alzheimer's when they have a close family member with the disease. How Do I Get Started Contact Integrative Medicine of Arizona to set up a time for a quick consultation over the phone to learn more about the process of the program and what is involved in implementing the Bredesen protocol. During this call you will be asked questions that will help determine if this approach is right for you. We look forward to speaking with you soon. "}
