Angina is a debilitating condition characterized by chest pain, which can occur at rest, during exercise, or both. Anyone who has had angina knows how much of a strain it is on your life. It is a symptom of cardiovascular disease (aka heart disease or coronary artery disease), which affects the arteries of the heart. Major risk factors are lack of exercise, diabetes, poor diet, high blood pressure, overweight, and smoking. Traditional medications can be helpful to reduce the symptoms, but do little to address the actual underlying cause of the disease. Surgeries to 'rotor-rooter' your arteries in your heart - angioplasty, or stents which push open the artery walls from the inside, are a last resort, but don't prevent the arteries from developing the same problem years later if the cause isn't addressed. In fact, stents have been shown to not have any benefit in reducing symptoms. At Vitality Integrative Medicine, we use innovative treatments to address the cause of angina and heart disease. We help you get relief from angina by: 1. addressing the lifestyle and dietary risk factors - putting you on a long-term plan to minimize further damage to your heart vessels and allow them to start healing. 2. adding innovative intravenous treatments to achieve more rapid healing and symptom relief. This includes ozone therapy to improve the oxygen and energy utilization of the heart and vessels, and chelation to reduce causes of inflammation. "}
