The CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics work together to create a schedule of recommended vaccinations for children from birth to adulthood, and, according to the new survey, more and more parents are [disregarding that advice](http://www.thecut.com/2016/04/facts-dont-matter-to-anti-vaxxers.html) despite the fact that vaccines are safe and life-saving. The study examined routine pediatrician survey data from the years 2006 through 2013 to see if doctors have reported parents refusing vaccines for their children for non-medical reasons. Over the course of the period, the number of pediatricians who reported experiencing refusals rose from 74.5 percent to 87 percent.

These beliefs are incorrect, and the study found that 61 percent of pediatricians reported dismissing patients for continued vaccine refusal. The report concludes that pediatricians increasingly believe that parents don't think vaccines are a necessary part of a child's medical care, and that they're refusing to treat these patients at higher rates than in the past.
