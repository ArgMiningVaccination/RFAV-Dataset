However, vaccine hesitancy is widespread. Survey results on uptake intentions vary and continue to change. This review compared trends and synthesized findings in vaccination receptivity over time across US and international polls, assessing survey design influences and evaluating context to inform policies and practices. Data sources included academic literature (PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO following PRISMA guidelines), news and official reports published by 20 October 2020. Two researchers independently screened potential peer-reviewed articles and syndicated polls for eligibility; 126 studies and surveys were selected. Declining vaccine acceptance (from >70% in March to <50% in October) with demographic, socioeconomic, and partisan divides was observed. Perceived risk, concerns over vaccine safety and effectiveness, doctors' recommendations, and inoculation history were common factors. Impacts of regional infection rates, gender, and personal COVID-19 experience were inconclusive. Unique COVID-19 factors included political party orientation, doubts toward expedited development/approval process, and perceived political interference. Many receptive participants preferred to wait until others have taken the vaccine; mandates could increase resistance. Survey wording and answer options showed influence on responses. To achieve herd immunity, communication campaigns are immediately needed, focusing on transparency and restoring trust in health authorities.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-12-30", "cleaned_text": "Confidence and Receptivity for COVID-19 Vaccines: A Rapid Systematic Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9010016](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9010016) [Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of New vaccines and New Target Groups and Impact Evaluation and Effectiveness of Current Vaccination Strategies]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/HTA_vaccines )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00016), [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00016)], rendering achieving herd immunity challenging. [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00016)]. Well before the pandemic, the World Health Organization in 2019 identified it as a top global health threat [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00016)]. Studies regarding intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 have been published since early 2020 with great variations in question formats and results [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00016), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00016), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00016), [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00016), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00016), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00016)]. Many reported a pattern of increasing doubts about vaccine safety and declining receptivity [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00016), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00016), [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00016)]. However, differences in their findings and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy unique to COVID-19 have not been systematically examined. 2. Materials and Methods [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00016)]. The attenuated process included limiting searches to publications in English and not posting protocol to a systematic review registry. 2.1. Data Sources and Searches [Appendix A](#app1-vaccines-09-00016) [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00016)]. The inclusion criteria were primary research that included at least one survey question on willingness, confidence, or intention of getting a COVID-19 vaccine if/when available, conducted in any country, and published in English. Titles and abstracts of the search results were screened, followed by full-text reviews by two researchers to determine eligibility; disagreements were resolved through consensus. 2.3. Data Extraction, Analysis, and Quality Assessment 3. Results 3.1. Search Results and Survey Characteristics [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00016-f001)). All included surveys were conducted as either self-reported online questionnaires or phone interviews. [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00016), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00016), each survey's dates, country (if non-US), sample size, question wording, answer options, responses, key findings, and relevant factors. 3.2. Trends in Vaccine Acceptance, Hesitancy, and Refusal [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00016), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00016), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00016), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00016)], [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00016), [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00016), [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00016)], and subgroups. Among America surveys, the highest intended acceptance of 72% was reported by Morning Consult in early April [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00016)]. In mid-October, the propensity dropped to its lowest at 48% (men 55%, women 42%) [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00016)]. Regionally, acceptance ranged from 38% in the Northeast to 49% in the West [ [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00016)]. Internationally, some Asian countries had higher acceptance: 88.6-91.3% in China and 79.8% in South Korea\u2014both also reported higher trust in central governments [ [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00016), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00016)]. Other highly receptive countries included Brazil (85.36%), South Africa (81.58%), Denmark (80%), and the UK (79%); Russia had the lowest (54.9%), followed by France (58.9-62%), which also reported the largest rate of \"unsure\" responses with 73% for post-graduates [ with [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00016), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00016), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00016)], uninsured [ [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00016), [35](#B35-vaccines-09-00016), [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00016)] or larger households [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00016)] were get vaccinated. [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00016), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00016), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00016), [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00016), [37](#B37-vaccines-09-00016), [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00016)], often [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00016), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00016), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00016), [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00016), [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00016)], while other polls found younger age had lower acceptance [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00016), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00016), [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00016)]. A majority of the US-based surveys reported lower intentions among women than men [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00016), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00016), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00016), [37](#B37-vaccines-09-00016), [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00016)], while some international opposite [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00016), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00016), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00016)]. A multi-country study reported that women's vaccine refusal was more than double men's [ [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00016)]. [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00016), [35](#B35-vaccines-09-00016)] and Blacks showed more suspicion and lower confidence in the vaccine [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00016), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00016), [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00016), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00016), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00016)]. One study found Blacks were 40% more likely than Whites to reject due to lack of trust in vaccine safety, efficacy, and resources [ [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00016)]. Divergent results were reported among Hispanics\u2014some reported higher [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00016), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00016), [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00016), [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00016), [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00016)] or similar [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00016)] as Whites, though others found lower [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00016), [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00016)]. Asian Americans were included in a few surveys for subgroup analysis, and they expressed greater acceptance [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00016), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00016), [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00016)] (e.g., 81% of Asian Americans vs. 68% of Whites and Hispanics, 40% of Blacks [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00016)]). 3.2.2. Vaccine Attributes and Individual Factors [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00016), [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00016)]. The most commonly cited reasons for hesitation or refusal were fear of side effects [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00016), inadequate information general anti-vaccine stand [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00016), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00016)] were associated with lower acceptance. [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00016)], willingness to pay [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00016), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00016), [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00016)], and country of vaccine origin. Cost ranked low as a concern for Americans [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00016)]. One survey reported that 17.1% would get the vaccine only if covered by insurance [ [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00016)] and another found 49% expected it to be free (paid by insurance or government) [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00016)]. In America, US-made vaccines were more trusted than China-made [ [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00016), [57](#B57-vaccines-09-00016)] or foreign-developed [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00016), [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00016)]. Most Chinese (64%) foreign-made [ [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00016)]. [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00016), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00016), and disease severity [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00016), [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00016)] were predictors of vaccination intentions. The impacts of having been infected oneself or knowing a friend/family who had and the desire to protect oneself or others were also cited but less conclusive. Some studies indicated positive association [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00016), [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00016)], while others found no correlation [ [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00016)]. One study reported only 55% of those worrying about themselves or family members getting infected would get vaccinated [ [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00016)]. [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00016), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00016), [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00016), [59](#B59-vaccines-09-00016)], motivating 80% 62% of Americans [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00016)] (compared to 54% if the FDA endorsed the vaccine safety [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00016)]). Opinion of families and friends also played a role [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00016)]. Past inoculation history, [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00016)], was another proven indicator. Conversely, 40-42% said they are more likely to get a flu shot because of COVID-19 [ [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00016), [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00016)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00016), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00016), [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00016)]. Healthcare workers in Indonesia had acceptance than the public (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.12-2.20) [ [63](#B63-vaccines-09-00016)] while nurses in Hong Kong indicated low intention (40%) [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00016)]. Israeli doctors reported slightly higher self-acceptance (78% vs. 75%), but were less likely to vaccinate their children than the public (60% vs. 70%) [ [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00016)]. 3.3. Assessing the Impact of Survey Design [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00016-f002)plotted the rates of affirmative responses to COVID-19 vaccine intention questions across the past eight months, differentiated US-based and international surveys for comparison. Data from Morning Consult and YouGov series provided strong evidence of the declining receptivity based on consistent questioning. Other surveys, though using varied question wording, showed a similar pattern with few but some exceptions. [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00016), [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00016)], me\" [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00016)]. Some surveys tagged additional conditions that triggered higher interest, such as \"free\" or \"at no cost\" [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00016), [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00016), [67](#B67-vaccines-09-00016)] [ other including \"first generation of vaccine\" [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00016)], \"as soon as possible\" [ [68](#B68-vaccines-09-00016), [69](#B69-vaccines-09-00016)], before the US election\" [ [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00016), [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00016), [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00016)]. Examples of such effects and outliers were illustrated with annotated speech bubbles in the following graphs. [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00016-f003)plotted the percentages of participants who picked the first answer in each of the two groups and demonstrated the differences between the two survey designs. Responses were more spread out when there were more options (as in Group B) and thus produced seemingly lower percentages of affirmative answers. Pollsters often combine the results of the first or last two answer categories in writing news articles for more eye-catching headlines, such as \"Two in three Americans likely to get coronavirus vaccine [ [73](#B73-vaccines-09-00016)].\" In such case, attention is needed to distinguish and accurately interpret the results. [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00016)] (e.g., 45% vs. 28% [ [74](#B74-vaccines-09-00016)]). One survey asked \"How likely are you to get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it becomes available?\" with only two answer choices\u2014likely or unlikely, which by comparison received relatively high (67%) affirmatives [ [75](#B75-vaccines-09-00016)]. [Figure 4](#vaccines-09-00016-f004)illustrated the increasing ratio of respondents indicating low or no intention to vaccinate and the summary table ( [Appendix A](#app1-vaccines-09-00016) [Table A4](#vaccines-09-00016-t0A4)) documented each answer COVID-19 Factors [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00016), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00016), [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00016), [77](#B77-vaccines-09-00016), [78](#B78-vaccines-09-00016)]. The expedited vaccine development and distrust [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00016), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00016), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00016), [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00016), [79](#B79-vaccines-09-00016)], particularly the Emergency Use Authorization process [ [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00016)]. While 33% were confident that the FDA will only approve the vaccine if it is safe [ [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00016)], 41% believed the vaccine will be made available before proven safe and effective [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00016)]. Seventy-five percent worried about the safety of fast-tracking [ [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00016)]; 11% would be more likely to take a vaccine if Operation Warp Speed suggested it [ [80](#B80-vaccines-09-00016)]. [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00016)]: 60% were unlikely to get the first generation of vaccine [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00016)]; 64% endorsed prioritizing full testing even if delaying availability [ [57](#B57-vaccines-09-00016)]. Among individual states, 41.6-51% would wait until others have it [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00016), [58](#B58-vaccines-09-00016), [74](#B74-vaccines-09-00016), [81](#B81-vaccines-09-00016), [82](#B82-vaccines-09-00016), showed intention to accept, 47.8% would delay until confirmed safe [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00016)]. On the other hand, one international survey found 43% willing to accept less stringent standards [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00016)]; an American survey reported that 59% agreed that providing more people access outweighs the risks of an accelerated process [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00016)]. [84](#B84-vaccines-09-00016), [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00016), [86](#B86-vaccines-09-00016)]; 33% of respondents in the US and 50% in England showed some conspiracy thinking [ [84](#B84-vaccines-09-00016), [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00016)]. Respondents with higher skepticism had lower perceived risk and trust in government or professionals, and thus higher doubts and objections to vaccination [ [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00016), [86](#B86-vaccines-09-00016)]. Mainstream news could counter misinformation and utilizing politically conservative outlets and doctor's communications were suggested for accurate messaging [ [84](#B84-vaccines-09-00016), belief in clinical trial importance [ [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00016)]). The chasm extended to risk perceptions; 42% vs. 19% believed coronavirus is a severe health threat [ [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00016)]. Conversely, in France, the Far Right parties had higher willingness to vaccinate [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00016)]. Declining trust of information sources and authorities was also observed [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00016), [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00016), [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00016), [87](#B87-vaccines-09-00016), [88](#B88-vaccines-09-00016)]: 50% thought President Trump had influence over FDA decisions [ [89](#B89-vaccines-09-00016)]; 82% of Democrats and 72% of Republicans worried vaccine approval was driven more by politics than science [ [75](#B75-vaccines-09-00016)]. [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00016)]. In the US, 65% believed parents should be required to vaccinate [ [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00016)]; but the rate of refusal grew from 24% to 42.2% in North Carolina and 16.4% to 35.4% in Maine, if it was mandated by the federal government [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00016), [83](#B83-vaccines-09-00016)]. Views varied concerning children: 51% of Americans believed K-12 schools (kindergarten through grade 12) should require COVD-19 vaccines, while 75% of Texans thought the government should require child vaccination for infectious diseases [ [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00016), [91](#B91-vaccines-09-00016)]. Parents may have different considerations for vaccinating their children than themselves. One survey reported 76.02% vs. 74.38% receptivity and another 45% vs. 36.2% [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00016), [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00016)]; 58% would do so as soon as possible [ [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00016)], though having chronic illness was a deterrence [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00016)]. Those who indicated refusal for themselves also would not vaccinate their children [ [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00016)]. 4. Discussion [92](#B92-vaccines-09-00016), [93](#B93-vaccines-09-00016), [94](#B94-vaccines-09-00016), [95](#B95-vaccines-09-00016)]. Nonetheless, increasing daily cases and deaths did not prevent double-digit declines in vaccination intention since its highest point in early April [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00016)]. [96](#B96-vaccines-09-00016), [97](#B97-vaccines-09-00016)]. Minorities, lower income, and less educated individuals are disproportionally more susceptible to COVID-19 [ [98](#B98-vaccines-09-00016), [99](#B99-vaccines-09-00016)]. Their considerably lower vaccine acceptance requires special attention, including acknowledging the source and addressing the effect of their chronic distrust of health authorities in order to confront the vicious cycle of skepticism and inferior health outcomes. Much of minorities' reservation or resistance toward medical research and the healthcare system originated from historical events (e.g., unethical experimentation among Blacks in the Tuskegee syphilis study) as well as ongoing perceived bias in clinical interactions and treatments [ [97](#B97-vaccines-09-00016), [100](#B100-vaccines-09-00016), [101](#B101-vaccines-09-00016)]. Vaccine distribution prioritization should consider these disadvantaged groups as part of the high-risk population, considering their work or underlying health conditions, to improve equity [ [102](#B102-vaccines-09-00016)]. [103](#B103-vaccines-09-00016)], including vaccination [ [104](#B104-vaccines-09-00016), [105](#B105-vaccines-09-00016), [106](#B106-vaccines-09-00016)]. Women are more likely to worry about catching coronavirus, concerned about side effects [ [107](#B107-vaccines-09-00016)], and take protective measures (e.g., masking, handwashing, and social distancing) [ [108](#B108-vaccines-09-00016), [109](#B109-vaccines-09-00016)]. Such prevention-orientation variance, not limited to gender difference, calls for tailored communications and appeals. Future research could explore whether people perceive higher risk in taking a new vaccine than getting infected with a novel disease. [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00016)]. Major news media believed President Trump's repeated pre-election promises of a vaccine \"within weeks\" or by November often \"fueled fears\" and \"heightened concerns\" of a rushed process [ [110](#B110-vaccines-09-00016), [111](#B111-vaccines-09-00016)]. Our polarized electorate mirrors that of the population with large differences across groups. The devastating economic consequences of the pandemic and the heated US presidential election filled with clashing rhetoric have further divided the society along the party line, partitioning people's opinions in the reality of COVID-19 and the life-saving measure against it. Moreover, the proliferation of conspiracy theories surrounding coronavirus and the vaccines, combined with existing anti-vaccine movement adds another uncertain dimension to vaccine decisions [ [86](#B86-vaccines-09-00016), [112](#B112-vaccines-09-00016), [113](#B113-vaccines-09-00016)]. Detected misinformation or the spread of \"fake news\" must be quickly denounced and sources isolated. [114](#B114-vaccines-09-00016)] boosted pharma's reputation to 49% positive view in a national poll [ [115](#B115-vaccines-09-00016)], compared to 32% pre-COVID-19 [ [116](#B116-vaccines-09-00016)]. The FDA advisory committee's public meetings with independent experts also provided some reassurance [ [110](#B110-vaccines-09-00016)]. Second to doctors, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and national public health officials remain the most trusted sources for accurate information (71% and 69%, respectively, though decreased since mid-March) [ [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00016)]; these figures are significant influencers of people's health behavior and should be the main communicators in vaccine campaigns to encourage acceptance [ [117](#B117-vaccines-09-00016)]. [118](#B118-vaccines-09-00016), [119](#B119-vaccines-09-00016)]. For example, posing a question such as, \"Would you be willing to get the vaccine to protect yourself and your family?\" casts a more positive mindset than asking \"how risky do you think it would be to get vaccinated?\" Yet, the latter could be turned into an educational opportunity to correct misconception. Though a vaccine could not be distributed without FDA approval, from the surveys many people do not seem to equate a vaccine becoming available to having been approved with proper safety protocols in place. Delineations on such issues could debunk confusion and doubts. [120](#B120-vaccines-09-00016)]. It is essential to ensure that intention translates into actual uptake [ [121](#B121-vaccines-09-00016)]. Furthermore, hesitancy when compared to avoidance or refusal, is a dynamic state that opens the door for persuasion [ [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00016), [118](#B118-vaccines-09-00016)]. Campaigns targeting those who responded \"likely,\" \"probably,\" or \"not sure\" regarding vaccine intention would be more fruitful than trying to convert those who stated \"no\" or \"definitely not.\" People need to believe that a behavior is beneficial, even vital, in order to adopt it [ [122](#B122-vaccines-09-00016)]. Messages should focus on the safety and efficacy of vaccines as well as clarify the value and necessity of immunization in people's belief system (e.g., stressing that many vaccines have helped eradiate or control deadly diseases that we are no longer aware of or concerned about because vaccines worked). [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00016), [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00016), [81](#B81-vaccines-09-00016), [83](#B83-vaccines-09-00016)]. Framing vaccination as a smart, purposeful personal decision, emphasizing individual's autonomy could yield greater results. In addition to traditional media and official websites for disseminating current and accurate information, since social media is a popular source of news as well as misinformation for many [ [123](#B123-vaccines-09-00016), [124](#B124-vaccines-09-00016)], it should be a key channel in messaging and combating anti-vaccine or conspiracy theories. [125](#B125-vaccines-09-00016)]. Studies also have shown social expectation and portraying anticipated regret from inaction to be potential motivators for vaccination [ [104](#B104-vaccines-09-00016), [126](#B126-vaccines-09-00016)]. Furthermore, accompanying the rollouts of vaccines with short supply and complex delivery requirements (e.g., low-temperature storage and double dosage), campaign objectives should instill confidence not just in the safety of the medical intervention but also in the manufacturing, transportation, access, and equitable distribution to alleviate concerns or distrust. [127](#B127-vaccines-09-00016), [128](#B128-vaccines-09-00016), [129](#B129-vaccines-09-00016)]. The inclusion of studies was not exhaustive (with mostly US-based surveys), but covered a large number of major polls and important factors for a comprehensive picture of the trends. Future research would benefit from qualitative inquiries to allow for elaborations on non-pre-defined factors. Longitudinal studies could re-poll the same participants to detect triggers for attitude changes. [130](#B130-vaccines-09-00016)]. Moreover, opinions may change, especially amid the raging pandemic. Continued vaccine receptivity tracking could reveal whether the reported clinical trials incidents or outcomes and subsequent introductions of vaccines or new treatments would further change people's minds about getting vaccinated. 5.
