To encourage AYUSH drug industry to produce high quality AYUSH medicines for national and international needs. 1.3 National Health Policy, 1983** observed that the country has a large stock of health manpower comprising of private practitioners in various systems. This resource has not so far been adequately utilized. The practitioners of AYUSH systems enjoy high local acceptance and respect and consequently exert considerable infl uence on health beliefs and practices. It is, therefore, necessary to initiate organised measures to enable each of these systems of medicine and health care to develop in accordance with their strengths. Simultaneously, planned efforts should be made to dovetail the functioning of the practitioners and integrate their service, at the appropriate levels, within speci ed areas of responsibility and functioning, in the over-all health care delivery system, especially with regard to the preventive, promotive and public health objectives. Well-considered steps would also be required to be taken to move towards a meaningful phased integration of the indigenous and the modern systems. The signi cance of the Alternative Systems of Medicine was further emphasized in the National Health Policy, 3Annual Report 2012 - 2013 2002***, which stated that Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy have a substantial role because of the inherent advantages, such as diversity, modest cost, low level of technological input and the growing popularity of natural plant based products, especially in the under-served, remote and tribal areas. The Policy also envisaged the consolidation of documentary knowledge contained in these systems to protect it against attack from foreign commercial entities by way of mala de action under the Patent laws in other countries. 1.4 The National Policy on Indian Systems of Medicine & Homoeopathy, 2002 enunciated following as its objectives: (i) To promote good health and expand the outreach of health care to our people, particularly those not provided with health cover, through preventive, promotive, mitigating and curative intervention through ISM&H; (ii) To improve the quality of teachers and clinicians by revising curricula to contemporary relevance and researches by creating model institutions and Centres of Excellence and extending assistance for creating infrastructural facilities; (iii) To ensure affordable ISM&H services and drugs, which are safe and ef cacious; (iv) To facilitate availability of raw drugs, which are authentic and contain essential components as required under pharmacopoeial standards to help improve quality of drugs, for domestic consumption and export; (v) Integrate ISM&H in health care delivery system and National Programmes and ensure optimal use of the vast infrastructure of hospitals, dispensaries and physicians;(vi) Re-orient and prioritize research in ISM&H to gradually validate drugs and therapies to address in particular the chronic and new emerging life style related diseases; (vii) Create awareness about the strengths of these systems in India and abroad and sensitize other stakeholders and providers of health; and (viii) To provide full opportunity for the growth and development of these systems and utilization of the potentiality, strength and revival of their glory. 1.5 The Policy outlines the following strategies to achieve the objectives: (a) Legislative measures to check mushroom growth of substandard colleges; (b) Course curricula to be reinforced to raise the standards of medical training and to equip trainees for utilization in national health programmes; (c) Priority to research covering clinical trials, pharmacology, toxicology, standardization and study of pharmaco-kinetics in respect of identi ed areas of strength; (d) The National Medicinal Plants Board to address all issues connected with conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants leading to remunerative farming, regulation of medicinal farms and conservation of bio-diversity; (e) National Medicinal Plants Board to acquire statutory status to be able to regulate registration of farmers and cooperative societies, transportation, marketing of medicinal plants and proper procurement and supply of raw materials to pharmaceutical industry;4Annual Report 2012 - 2013 (f) Protection of India's traditional medicinal knowledge to be undertaken through a progressive creation of a Digital Library for each system and eventually the codi ed knowledge leading to innovation and good health outcomes; (g) Effort to integrate and mainstream ISM&H in health care delivery system and in National Programmes; (h) A range of options for utilization of ISM&H manpower in the health care delivery system to be developed by assigning speci c goal oriented role and responsibility to the ISM&H work force; (i) Allopathic hospitals to be encouraged to set up AYUSH health facilities; (j) Government to assist allopathic hospitals to establish Panchkarma and Ksharsutra facilities for the treatment of neurological disorders, musculo-skeletal problems as well as ambulatory treatment of stula-in- ano, bronchial asthma and dermatological problems; (k) States to be encouraged to consolidate the ISM&H infrastructure and health services; (l) Pharmacopoeial work related to Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy Drugs to be expedited; (m) Industry to be encouraged to make use of quality certi cation and acquisition of GMP and ISO 9000 certi cation; (n) Quality Control Centers would be set up on regional basis to standardize the in-process quality control of ISM products and to modernize traditional processes without changing the concepts of ISM;(o) States to be advised and supported to augment facilities for drug manufacture and testing; (p) Operational use of ISM in Reproductive & Child Health (RCH) to be encouraged in eleven identi ed areas, where the Indian Systems of Medicine would be useful for antenatal, intra-natal, post-natal and neonatal care;

AYUSH is an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha & Sowa Rigpa, and Homoeopathy. Ayurveda is the oldest system practiced since more than 5000 years; whereas, Homeopathy is being practiced since last around 100 years. These systems are being practised in the country with diverse preferences of people and infrastructural facilities. Ayurveda is more prevalent in the States of The practice of Unani System could be seen in some parts of Andhra Gujarat and the North Eastern States and the Siddha system is practiced in the areas in Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry and Kerala. Recently recognized Sowa Rigpa system of medicine is prevalent in trans Himalayan regions including Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarkhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. Besides, there are institutes of Sowa Rigpa in UP and Karnataka. AYUSH services, as a whole, in the country, are provided by public, private and voluntary sector organizations and the range of their distribution varies from State to State. 2.2 AYURVEDA SYSTEM 2.2.1 The literal meaning of \"Ayurveda\" (Ayu (life)+ Veda (Science)) is \"Science of Life\". Ayurveda developed out of the various Vedic hymns describing the fundamental philosophies about life, disease and health. Ayurvedic knowledge was comprehensively documented in around 5000 years back in the form of Agnivesha Tantra, Vashishtha Samhita, etc. However, these ancient treaties are not available. The Charak Samhita and Sushruta Samhita developed around 2500 BC are the main treaties of Ayurveda fully available today. According to Ayurveda, health is considered as a pre-requisite for achieving the goals of life, i.e. Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. Ayurveda takes an integrated view of the physical, mental, spiritual and social aspects of human beings and about the inter relationships between these aspects. 2.2.2 The philosophy of Ayurveda is based on the theory of Panchmahabhutas ( ve primordialelements), which postulates that all objects and living bodies are composed of these ve elements. The combinations of these ve elements are represented in the form of Tridoshas, viz. Vata (Ether/Air), Pitta (Fire) and in living beings; whereas, Satva, Rajas and Tamas are the mental attributes. Ayurveda aims to keep these structural and functional entities in a state of equilibrium, which signi es good health (Swasthya). Any imbalance due to internal or external factors causes disease and the treatment consists of restoring the equilibrium through various techniques, procedures, regimens, diet and medicines. 2.2.3 Ayurveda considers the human being as a microcosm (Yatha pinde tatha brahmande), which is a replica of the macrocosm (universe).The treatment in Ayurveda is holistic and individualized. The preventive aspect of Ayurveda is called Svastha-Vritta and includes personal hygiene, regular daily routine, appropriate social behavior and use of Rasayana, i.e, use of rejuvenative materials/food and rasayana drugs. AYUSH Systems8Annual Report 2012 - 2013 The curative aspect consists of three major categories - (i) Aushadhi (drugs); (ii) Various procedures including Panchakarma and Surgery; and (iii) Satvavajaya (Methods for mind control). 2.2.4 Practice of Ayurveda as a system of medicine has been recognized under IMCC Act, 1970. The education of Ayurveda is regulated by a statutory body, viz. Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM), Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 regulates manufacturing and sales of Ayurvedic drugs. During the Samhita period (1000 BC), Ayurveda developed eight branches or specialties, which were reason for it being called as Ashtanga Ayurveda. Following are these specialties: - (i) (Science of fertility and healthy progeny) 2.2.5 The above eight branches have over the years and speci cally during the last 50 years expanded into 22 specialties, which are as follows: (i) Ayurveda Siddhanta (Fundamental Principles of 2012 - 2013 2.2.6 Bachelor, Master and Doctorate degrees in Ayurveda are imparted through the various universities of India. 2.2.7 Two volumes of Ayurvedic Formulary of India (AFI) containing 636 compound formulations and eight volumes of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) Part-1 containing 600 monographs on single drugs and three volumes of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) Part-II containing 152 monographs on compound formulations have been published. 2.3 SIDDHA SYSTEM 2.3.1 The Siddha System is one of the oldest systems of medicine in India and is practised mainly in Tamil Nadu and some other parts of South India. The term \"Siddha\" means 'achievements' and Siddhars were saintly persons who achieved 'results' in medicine. Eighteen Siddhars were said to have contributed towards the development of this medical system. Siddha literature is in Tamil and it is largely therapeutic in nature. 2.3.2 The diagnosis of diseases in Siddha involves identifying its causes through the examination of pulse, urine, eyes, study of voice, colour of body, tongue and the status of the digestive system. 2.3.3 The Siddha system of medicine emphasizes that medical treatment is oriented not merely towards the disease but has to take into account the patients and their environment, age, sex, race, habits, mental frame, habitat, diet, appetite, physical condition, physiological constitution, etc. This means the treatment has to be individualistic. Diagnosis and treatment in Siddha ensures lower probability of mistakes in diagnosis or treatment. 2.3.4 During the last four decades, there has been continuous development in Siddha medical education and this has led to the establishment of the following six specialties in post-graduate teaching and training:(i) Maruthuvam is covering 73 monographs on single drugs and Vol-II is covering 66 monographs on single drugs.Siddha Pharmacopoeia of Part-I, Vol-III compilation completed. Siddha Formulary of India, Part-I 22 divisions, 248 classical formulations have been published in English and Tamil. Siddha Formulary of India, Part-II (Tamil) -23 divisions, 151 classical formulations has been published. 2.4 UNANI SYSTEM 2.4.1 The Unani System of Medicine originated in Greece and passed through many countries before establishing itself in India during the medieval period. It is based on well-established knowledge and practices relating to the promotion of positive health and prevention of disease. The Unani System has grown out of the fusion of traditional knowledge of ancient civilizations like Egypt, Arabia, Iran, China, Syria and India. It emphasizes the use of naturally occurring, mostly herbal, medicines and also uses some medicines of animal, marine and mineral origin. This system of medicine was documented in Al-Qanoon, a medical classics, by Sheikh Bu-Ali Sina (Avicena) (980-1037 AD), in Al-Havi by Razi (850-923 AD) and in many other books written by the Unani physicians. 10Annual Report 2012 - 2013 2.4.2 The Unani system is based on the humoral theory, i.e. the presence of blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile in every person. The temperament of a person can accordingly be sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric and melancholic depending on the presence and combination of humors. According to Unani theory, the humors and the drugs themselves are assigned temperaments. Any change in quantity and quality of the humors brings about a change in the status of the health of the human body. A proper balance of humors is required for the maintenance of health. 2.4.3 The treatment consists of three components, namely, preventive, promotive and curative. Unani system of medicine has been found to be ef cacious in many conditions, particularly Sinusitis and Bronchial Asthma. 2.4.4 For the prevention of disease and promotion of health, the Unani System emphasizes on six essential pre-requisites of life (Asbab-e-SittaZarooria) - (a) pure air (b) food and water (c) physical movement and rest (d) psychic movement and rest (e) sleep and wakefulness and (f) retention of useful materials and evacuation of waste materials from the body. 2.4.5 There are four forms of treatment in Unani Medicine - Pharmacotherapy, Dietotherapy, Regimental Therapy and Surgery. Regimental therapy (Ilaj bit-Tadbir) is a speciality under which various methods of treatment are used for treating speci c and complicated diseases. 2.4.6 During the last 50 years, seven Post Graduate specialities have been developed in (i) Kulliyat (Fundamentals of Unani System of Medicine) (iv) Preventive Medicine) (vi) Moalejat (Medicine) and (vii) Jarahiyat (Surgery).2.4.7 Six volumes of National Formulary of Unani Medicine (NFUM) containing 1228 compound formulations and six volumes of Unani Pharmacopeia of India (UPI) containing 298 monographs on single drugs have been published. Two volumes of Pharmacopeia on compound formulations containing 100 compound drugs have been published. 2.5 HOMOEOPATHY 2.5.1 The Physicians from the time of Hippocrates (around 400 B.C.) have observed that certain substances could produce symptoms of a disease in healthy people similar to those of people suffering from the disease. Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, scienti cally examined this phenomenon and codi ed the fundamental principles of Homoeopathy. Homoeopathy was brought into India around 1810 A.D. by European missionaries and received of cial recognition by a Resolution passed by the Constituent Assembly in 1948 and then by the Parliament. 2.5.2 The rst principle of Homoeopathy 'Similia Similibus Curentur', says that a medicine which could induce a set of symptoms in healthy human beings would be capable of curing a similar set of symptoms in human beings actually suffering from the disease. The second principle of 'Single Medicine' says that one medicine should be administered at a time to a particular patient during the treatment. The third principle of 'Minimum Dose' states that the bare minimum dose of a drug which would induce a curative action without any adverse effect should be administered. Homoeopathy is based on the assumption that the causation of a disease mainly depends upon the susceptibility or proneness of an individual to the incidence of the particular disease in addition to the action of external agents like bacteria, viruses, etc. 11Annual Report 2012 - 2013 2.5.3 Homoeopathy is a method of treating diseases by administering drugs, which have been experimentally proved to possess the power to produce similar symptoms on healthy human beings. Treatment in Homoeopathy, which is holistic in nature, focuses on an individual's response to a speci c environment. Homoeopathic medicines are prepared mainly from natural substances, such as plant products, minerals and from animal sources. Homoeopathic medicines do not have any toxic, poisonous or side effects. Homoeopathic treatment is economical as well and has a very broad public acceptance. 2.5.4 Homoeopathy has its own areas of strength in therapeutics and it is particularly useful in treatment for allergies, autoimmune disorders and viral infections. Many surgical, gynaecological and obstetrical and paediatric conditions and ailments affecting the eyes, nose, ear, teeth, skin, sexual organs, etc., are amenable to homoeopathic treatment. Behavioral disorders, neurological problems and metabolic diseases can also be successfully treated by Homoeopathy. Apart from the curative aspects, Homoeopathic medicines are also used in preventive and promotive health care. In recent times, there is an emergence of interest in the use of Homoeopathic medicines in veterinary care, agriculture, dentistry, etc. Homoeopathic medical education has developed in seven specialties in post-graduate teaching, which are Materia Medica, Organon of Medicine, Repertory, Practice of Medicine, Paediatrics, Pharmacy and Psychiatry. 2.6 YOGA 2.6.1 Yoga is essentially spiritual and it is an art and science of healthy living, which focuses on bringing harmony between body and mind. The word 'Yoga' has two meanings; the rst comes from the root 'Yujir' or 'Union', the second is derived from a different root 'yuja', which means 'Samadhi' - the highest state of mind and the absolute knowledge. These two are the most important meanings of the word Yoga according to 'Panini', the most well-known Sanskrit grammarian. 2.6.2 Yoga is being practiced as part of healthy lifestyle and has become part of our spiritual heritage. In the present era, Yoga is popular world-wide because of its spiritual values, therapeutic credentials, its role in the prevention of diseases, promotion of health and management of lifestyle related disorders. Several clinical studies have lucidly demonstrated the therapeutic potentials of Yoga in the treatment of many lifestyle related or psychosomatic disorders. The specialty of this system is that it can get along with any other systems of health care. 2.6.3 The aim of Yoga is complete cessation of all kinds of suffering (sorrow) and its root cause ignorance and is known as Moksha or liberation. The main objectives of Yoga are health, happiness, harmony, spiritual quest, personality development, etc. 2.6.4 Yoga is as old as civilization. The rst archaeological evidence of existence of Yoga is found in Stone Seals excavated from Indus Valley. Yoga was special feature of Indus Valley Civilization (3000 BC). Yogic literature has been found in Vedas, Upanishadas, Darshanas, Epics, Puranas, Aagmas, Tantras, etc. Rich sources of Yoga have also been available in medieval, modern and contemporary literature. 2.6.5 The Yoga referred in the Vedic and Upanishadic literature has been depicted in three important texts called Prasthanatrayi: (i) Principle Upanishads (Upadesha (Sadhana Prasthana).12Annual Report 2012 - 2013 These texts further lead to different schools of Yoga, like Jnana Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Dhyana Yoga, etc. 2.6.6 The most important texts referred in Yoga are as follows: (i) Patanjala Yoga Sutra which is one of the Shad Darshanas, has been advocated by the great sage Patanjali, who lived around approximately 200 BC. Patanjali wrote a book known as Yoga Sutras, which contains 195 sutras. Patanjali advocates Ashtanga Yoga, which is widely practiced from Dharana or State of liberation). 2.6.8 The following are the doctrines and concepts adopted in Yoga Therapy:(i) Doctrine of \"Panchakoshas\" ( ve sheaths/ bodies) as found in Upanishads. (ii) Doctrine of \"Chitta-vrittinirodha\", \"kriyayoga\"and \"astangas\" as found in Patanjala Yoga Sutras; (iii) Doctrine of various kinds of \"shuddhis\" found in Patanjala Yoga Suntra and Hathayoga; (iv) Doctrine of opening blocked channels of vayus and prana (nadishuddhi), opening of lotuses and as found in Hatha Yoga and Kundalini Yoga; (v) Working with the mind on the lines of Patanjala Yoga Sutra, Mantra Yoga and Hatha Yoga; (vi) Working on the lines of \"Karma-Jnana Bhakti\" from Bhagawadgita; (vii) Certain aspects of Tantra Yoga also get integrated in various Yoga practices. 2.6.9 The following Yogic practices are being practiced for prevention and management of diseases: (i) Shatkarma: These are six cleansing techniques in Yoga used to clean the internal organs and systems of the body. These are called as the process of are special patterns of body that stabilise the mind through static stretching. Yogasanas are psycho-physical in nature. They play a signi cant role in toning up the neuro-musculo and glandular systems of the body. There are more than 84 asanas mentioned in the classical texts;13Annual Report 2012 - 2013 (iii) Pranayama: Pranayama is a practice which helps to regulate vital energies through regulation of breathing; (iv) Mudra: These are special gestures/ techniques formed with the combination of Asana and Pranayama and are used in channelization of Prana, the vital force; (v) Dhyana: Sustain concentration on the object is Dhyana. Dhyana is an integral part of Yoga practice and is bene cial for psychological and spiritual growth and also helps in health promotion. 2.6.10 Several leading Yoga Institutions have been engaged in the promotion and propagation of Yoga according to their Guru-Shishya Parampara. Many Institutions, Universities are conducting Certi cate, Diploma, Bachelors, Masters and Doctorate degrees courses in various aspects of Yoga. 2.7 NATUROPATHY 2.7.1 Naturopathy is a science of health and healing and a drugless therapy based on well-founded philosophy. It has its own concept of health and disease and also principles of treatment. Naturopathy is a system of medicine that advocates harmonious living with constructive principles of Nature on physical, mental, moral and spiritual planes. It has great health promotive and restorative, and disease preventive as well as curative potential. 2.7.2 According to Naturopathy, the primary cause of disease, barring accidental or surgical injury, is violation of Nature's laws and the effects of violation of Nature's laws are- (i) Lowered vitality; (ii) Abnormal composition of blood and lymph; (iii) Accumulation of morbid matter in the body.2.7.3 The science of Naturopathy teaches us that the disease is Nature's effort to eliminate the morbid matter from the body to restore the health. Hence, we must not suppress the outward symptoms of disease like fever, cough, loose motions, etc., but cooperate with Nature in the process of eliminating morbid matter from the body. 2.7.4 Some of the basic concepts of Naturopathy are outlined as under: (i) Naturopathy believes in the concept of unity of disease and unity of cure. According to it, root cause of all diseases is one, i.e. accumulation of morbid matter in the body and the remedy also is one, i.e. elimination of those toxins from the body; (ii) Naturopathy considers bacteria and virus to be secondary cause of disease. The primary cause of disease is accumulation of morbid matter in the body. The microbes survive in the body only when a favourable atmosphere for their growth is established by the accumulation of morbid matter. Hence, the basic cause of disease is morbid matter and microbes are only the secondary cause; (iii) Acute diseases are self-healing efforts of the body. Hence, they are taken as our friends, not enemies. Chronic diseases are outcome of wrong treatment and suppression of the acute diseases; (iv) Human body has remarkable recuperative powers when left alone. Nature is the greatest healer. The human body is a self healing machine. It is endowed with inherent healing power to prevent itself from disease and regain health when fallen ill; (v) In Naturopathy, the patient is at the centre 14Annual Report 2012 - 2013 of intervention and treatment, cure of disease is effected automatically with the increase in vitality and detoxi cation of body; (vi) Naturopathy believes in holistic treatment. It not only treats the body as a whole, instead of speci c organs but also take into account intervention at mental, moral and spiritual planes; (vii) Naturopathy does not use medicines.

It has 15 Agro-Climatic zones and medicinal plants are distributed across all biogeographic regions, diverse habitats and landscapes. It has one of the oldest, richest and most diverse cultural traditions, associated with the use of medicinal plants. Indian systems of medicine use various raw materials, of which medicinal plants constitute 90% of the raw drug material. About 3000 plants species are reported to be used in the codi ed Indian Systems of medicines, like Ayurveda (900 species), Siddha (800 species), Unani (700 species) and Amchi (300 species). The rest of the species are used in local health traditions and in folk systems of medicine. Medicinal plants, thus, contribute an important component of the plant resource wealth of our country. In addition to their use in the preparation of Traditional medicines, the medicinal plants are being used in preparation of various pharmaceuticals and health products under the modern medicine system. Keeping in view the need for availability of authentic raw drugs, the vast potential of herbal products/herbal drugs and the role India could play in the global market, Government of India has taken the lead by establishing National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) under Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India.
