Furman University South Carolina Nominee to the U.S. Department of Education Green Ribbon Schools Prepared by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control In Partnership with the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education February 2020 Documentation of Sustainabil ity Achievement Summary Narrative: An Overview of Our Work Encompassing All Three Green Ribbon Pillars Furman University is firmly committed to reducing environmental impacts, promoting and improving health and wellness, and providing effective environmental and sustainability education. More than two decades ago, Furman recognized that fulfilling our educational mission required that students attain environmental and sustainability literacy, and that we operate more efficiently and take greater responsibility for our impact on the environ ment. Furman has received national recognition and won numerous national awards for its sustainability efforts including the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating Syst em (STARS) gold rating for campus sustainability, a top 10 national ranking among baccalaureate institutions (the highest ranked institution in the south ern US ), the 2016 National AASHE Campus Sustainability Achievement Award, and selection by AASHE as one of fo urteen national sustainability academic centers for \"Teaching Sustainability Across the Curriculum\". The Shi Institute for Sustainable Communities serves as the university's interdisciplinary academic sustainability hub promoting the integration of sustai nability across the curriculum and the study and practice of sustainability on campus and in the greater community. Originally established as a center in 2008, the Institute analyzes and addresses campus and community sustainabili ty challenges from an evid ence-based , solutions -oriented, systems approach that involves interdisciplinary collaboration among campus and community stakeholders. This approach provides unprecedented learning opportunities for our faculty, staff, students, and community partners and contributes to the greater campus and community good. Other colleges and organizations regularly visit the Institute to learn about its programs and benefit from its innovative approaches. The Institute offers a wide array of faculty, staff, student, and community development programs including (1) an Affiliate Faculty Program designed to stimulate interdisciplinary conversation, collaboration, and course development around campus and community sustainability, with more than 65 faculty participating, (2 ) A Student Fellows Program which has supported over 230 fellows in their sustainability research and action around campus and in partnership with 30 different community partner organizations, and (3) the Community Conservation Corps (CCC), a free home weatheriz ation program for low -income homeowners in the greater Greenville area designed to reduce energy consumption, promote financial stability, and increase environmental awareness. The program has weatherized 138 homes in the Greenville community, with the assistance of student volunteers. In addition to offering programs, the institute is also responsible for implementing, coordinating, and tracking sustainability for the entire campus. With the guidance of Sustainable Furman, our campus sustainability plan, the Shi Institute has garnered support for sustainability among students, faculty, and staff. Some recent accomplishments include working with facilities to implement environmentally -friendly landscape and construction practices, providing opportunities f or students to solve sustainability problems on campus, creating a framework for a zero-waste campus, and hosting an AASHE Hub workshop on integrating sustainability into curriculum through campus living /learning laboratories. Regarding curriculum, Furman believes all students should be environmentally - and sustainability -literate and requires that all students take a \"Humans and the Natural Environment (NE)\" course to graduate as part of their General Education requirements (GER). NE courses emphasize some aspect of the interactive relationships between humans and the natural environment. Furman is also the first, and still only, liberal arts institution in the country to offer a Bachelor of Science in Sustainability Science (SUS) degree . The degree program, now eight years old, has been one of the fastest growing majors in Furman's almost two -hundred -year history, with more than 70 declared SUS majors cu rrently enrolled. In addition to requiring the GER and offering multiple degree programs in sustainability and environmental science, the university also supports multiple, one year engaged living programs including (1) the Greenbelt Community, an intenti onal living, learning community intended to foster sustainable living and lifestyle choices among twenty -two sophomore students living in four eco -cabins on campus and (2) the Environmental Community of Students, a first -year program focused on glob al environmental and sustainability issues. Operationally, Furman is reducing environmental impacts through energy and water conservation, sustainable buildings, waste reduction, and alternative transportation. As an inaugural signatory of the American Co llege and University Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), Furman declared that it will strive to reach climate neutrality with zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2026. We have been diligently working towards this goal by increasing operations efficiency, creating a campus -wide culture of conservation to decrease energy use, creating a more sustainable transportation system through changes in behaviors and policies, investing in renewable energy projec ts, and developing offset projects and sustainability -oriented service projects in the greater Greenville community. We track our Greenhouse Gas Emissions annually and have developed a Climate Action Plan that lays out a path to reduce our carbon footprint . To date we have been able to reduce our overall carbon footprint by nearly 30% since our 2007 baseline , even as we have increased our building square footage. Our facilities team has been working to improve building efficiency and optimize energy use. Furman has installed several renewable energy installations around campus including an extensive geothermal system for its upper -class residences and a 743 -kW solar farm on a six -acre site at the campus's main entrance. This solar array is the largest solar project on a South Carolina college campus and, together with numerous other smaller solar arrays on campus, brings Furman's total solar generating power close to the 1 MW cap set by the state. A locally -owned flock of sheep were also added t o the solar farm to manage and \"mow\" the grass. Furman boasts eight LEED -certified buildings on campus including the first LEED -certified building in the state of South Carolina , Hipp Hall . Other inn ovativ e campus operations that incorporate sustainability design technologies and provide stud ent learning opportunities include: (1) the Living Machine, a tidal wetland wastewater treatment system that treats campus wastewater and uses the treated water f or toilet flushing in our science center and (2) the organic practice Furman Farm and hydroponic system that provides the dining hall with fresh produce and composts all dining hall pre - and post -consumer food waste for use on the farm. Furman promot es campus health and wellness through a variety of programs, practices, and educational efforts. All students are required to take a \"Mind and Body (MB)\" course to graduate. MB courses support Furman's mission statement expressing a commitment to develop the whole person -intellectually, physically, socially, emotionally, and spiritually. Some new programs include: (1) a student Eco -Reps program which promotes sustainable lifestyle choices within the residence halls and has recently launched a residential co mposting program, (2) FitRx, a student -led program that creates individualized exercise training programs for faculty and staff participants, and (3) a free Mindfulness and Meditation Course whic h explores mindfulness techniques, personal practice experienc es, and strategies to enjoying a mindful presence. Overall, living sustainably entails taking the long view of our actions and their consequences. Furman University has made institutional sustainability a primary priority , and our efforts have produced very tangible benefits on campus and in our community. Pillar I: Efforts to Reduce Environmental Impact and Costs Furman is currently an AASHE STARS gold rated institution. Sustainability has been integrated into all our campus operations, practices, and policies. Highlights of our efforts include: Carbon Neutrality Goals Greenhouse Gas Emissions: In 2007, Furman signed the American College and Universit y President's Climate Commitment, developed a Climate Action Plan, and committed to carbon neutral ity by 2026, the university's bicentennial. Beginning with the sig ning of the President's Climate Commitment, Furman has calculated its carbon footprint every year. To date, net emissions have been reduced from 28,668 MTC O2e to 20,115 MTCO2e, a total reduction of about 30%, through improved energy efficiency, more renewable energy, behavior change, and local offsets. Carbon Offsets: Achieving carbon neutrality will not be possible without offsetting unavoidable emissions. Furman participates in several programs that provide local carbon offsets: Community Conservati on Corps (CCC): The Community Conservation Corps is a university - run program founded in 2009 and managed by the Shi Institute that performs energy efficiency weatherizations free of charge to qualifying underserved local residents with the goals of reducin g energy consumption, promoting financial stability, and increasing environmental awareness of homeowners. Pre - and post -improvement audits, combined with homeowner utility data pre - and post -weatherization, are compiled to determine average energy savin gs per home (both natural gas and electricity). Energy savings are converted to a greenhouse gas emission equivalent and applied against Furman's carbon footprint. Over the first nine years, the CCC weatherized 138 homes. The program is a partnership betwe en Furman University, Habitat for Humanity, and Piedmont Natural Gas. In 2016 , the CCC received the Habitat for Humanity Organizational Donor of the Year Award. Composting: All pre - and post -consumer food waste from the Dining Hall and campus yard waste is composted on campus. Last year, Furman produced 51.6 short tons of compost. UCapture: Furman has partnered with UCapture, an online shopping platform that allows users to fund carbon offset projects via a commission program with online merchants. Furman user- generated funds contribute to a methane capture project at the Wolf Creek Landfill in Georgia. Furman currently has the most people participating in the program of any higher education institution (over 600 users) and currently ranks #2 in the countr y in UCapture offsets with 222 MTC02e. Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation To date, Furman has installed eight photovoltaic projects and three solar thermal projects on campus to generate renewable energy. The 30-kW solar photovoltaic array at the Shi Institute generates enough energy to completely power the building. Additional energy is returned to the grid to be used elsewhere on campus. Solar thermal panels at the Townes Science Center and the Physical Activities Center provide hot water for those buildings. In 2017, Furman installed a 743-kW solar array in a visible location across from the main entrance to campus. This array is the largest solar project on a South Carolina college campus and brings Furman's tota l solar generating power close to the 1 MW cap set by the state. A locally -owned flock of sheep were also added to the Solar Farm to help manage the grass. Green Building LEED Buildings Since 2001, Furman has required that all new or significantly renovat ed buildings meet LEED - Silver standards. The university is now home to 8 LEED -certified buildings. The university has also implemented energy efficiency projects in existing buildings. Recent accomplishments include the creation of a recommissioning progra m for existing buildings and the installation of geothermal ground -source heat pumps in North Village residence halls with a $2.5 million -dollar grant from the US Department of Energy. The system has helped reduce energy use by 20 -25% in the residence ha lls. Shi Institute Southern Living Showcase demonstration home The Shi Institute resides in a LEED Gold, former Southern Living Green Design, net zero energy, showcase home. The building has had over 30,000 visitors come see its green design features that incorporate a wide array of green building features including locally sourced building materials, passive solar design, five different types of solar arrays, geothermal heating and cooling, and recent additions of smart home technology, countertops mad e from glass recycled on campus, and Interface carpet tiles made from recycled fishing nets. Water Quality and Campus Grounds Tree Campus USA / Arboretum Furman University has been recognized for eleven years running as a Tree Campus USA\u00ae by the Arbor Day Foundation for its commitment to effective urban forest management. The campus is also home to the George G. Willis Jr. Arboretum, a Level 1 accredited arboretum through the ArbNet Arboretum Accreditation Program and The Morton Arboretum. The arboret um contains over 280 labeled trees, representing more than 80 distinct species. Integrated Pest Management In April of 2019, Furman's Grounds Department implemented an Integrated Pest Management Plan for the entire campus landscape in order to ut ilize natural methods of pest control and reduce the use of synth etic pesticides. Lake Restoration In 2006, as part of Furman's \"Year of the Environment\" campaign, the university dedicated itself to improving the environmental quality of the campus lake and its surroundings. A lack of vegetated buffers, increased stormwater runoff, and an ov erpopulation of waterfowl contributed to a decline in water quality over time. A local landscape design firm crafted and implemented the first phase of the restoration plan, including the addition of native vegetation along the shoreline and extensive rai ngardens in place of pipe entry points. The lake is being used as a living laboratory to study the effects of the restoration effort on the water quality and ecological integrity of the lake system. Campus Habitat and Biodiversity The Furman campus consis ts of a mixture of forest, lawn, stream, and lake, which produces a mosaic of habitats supporting a wide range of species. The campus is home to numerous migrating species which are seasonally characteristic of the South Carolina Piedmont region. Faculty, students, and classes regularly study the vast array of local species and conduct biodiversity surveys on campus . Sagittaria fasciculata , more commonly known as bunched arrowhead, a n endangered , federally -protected small , herbaceous plant that grows in wetland s and lives on campus. Furman maintains a protected area for the bunched arrowhead, complete with a viewing deck and educational signage. Living Machine One of our more innovative projects is the closed -loop solar/aquatic tidal wetland wastewater treatment system in the Charles Townes Science Center, dubbed \"The Living Machine.\" Wastewater from Townes and the Physical Activities Center are sent to the Livi ng Machine to be naturally treated through a series of wetland basins. The facility can process up to 5,000 gallons of wastewater every day. The treated water is reused inside Townes Science Center for toilet flushing. Regular class visits to the Living Ma chine provide hands -on introductions and lab activities related to the nitrogen cycle, wastewater treatment, and graywater reuse systems. Waste Reduction Furman has a comprehensive recycling program , as well as food composting and yard waste composting pro grams. Throughout campus there are recycling containers located within and outside of bu ildings , as well as at athletic events. We recently completed a campus -wide waste audit and are currently working to implement a series of proposed recommendations including : (1) paper towel composting in the academic building bathrooms, (2) a glass recycling program, (3) composting in the residence halls, and (4) a paper pri nting reduction campaign. Move -in / Move -out Move -in and Move -out are high waste periods. Furman has a move -in recycling program, where students set up recycling stations outside of the dorms and collec t and recycle the cardboard boxes used during the mov e-in process. During move -out, large donation boxes are available to collect donated items within the residence halls and trucks are stationed in the student parking lots to collect larger items. All donations go to the Dream Center, a local nonprofit that serves those in need with a hand up instead of a handout by empowering them to grow towards becoming healthy and self -sufficient. Transportation Furman recently completed a comprehensive transportation plan which includes efforts to educate the campus about greenhouse gas emissions generated by transportation, facilitate alternative automobile use and use of the public transit system, revise parking policies to discourage casual car use, and promote our bike rental program. The plan also calls for the conversion of the campus fleet to hybrid and electric vehicles. Currently our admissions office's electric trolleys use solar panels on their roof to charge. Pillar 2: Efforts to Improve the Health and Wellness of Students and Staff Campus and Community Health and Wellness Furman University is firmly committed to improving the health and wellness of our campus community. We offer a wide range of health and wellness programs for our faculty, staff, and students, and integrate environmental health policies and practices into our operations, work spaces, and overall campus landscap e. Improved Health and Wellness - Practitioners and Programs IACH Furman has an Institute for the Advancem ent of Community Health (IACH) and a formal partnership with Prisma Health System, Clemson University, and the University of South Carolina to help e ducate health care professionals and foster research and partnerships that strengthen community health. Furman seeks not only to advance health and wellness issues on campus, but also advance the well -being of the diverse communities in Greenville and arou nd the world. IACH builds upon the classroom experience by facilitating collaborative projects that incorporate research and programs to drive community impact. Campus Clinics, Counseling, and Psychiatric Services For students, we always have a nurse on duty and a local physician on call to treat common illnesses, dispense over -the-counter medications, and provide care for chronic illnesses. Aside from routine and emergency medical care, we also offer a women's clinic, a sports medicine/physical therapy c enter, counseling center, and alcohol and drug education. Stud ent Counseling Services provide crisis intervention, psychological support, individual counseling, mental health wellness outreach and clinical collaboration. Health Promotion for faculty, staff , and students provides inclusive health programming, advocacy and outreach to support mental, physical , and social well -being. Specific Health & Wellness Programs Furman University is committed to supporting employees in all dimensions of wellness \u2014 physical, social, environmental, spiritual, occupational, financial, emotional, and intellectual.

The bike is housed on campus through the County Recr eation Department and can be checked out by any faculty or staff member free of charge. Local & Nutritious Foods Food Systems Bon Appetit is Furman's food provider and has a long -standing commitment to healthy and sustainable foods through their Farm to Fork program. Their first choice is to purchase seasonal ingredients from small, owner -operated farms and ranches within a 150 -mile radius of campus. Their commitment to local food is about preserving biodiversity, protecting open space, supporting family farmers, and keeping money invested in our community. Furman source s at least 25% of ingredients, by dollar, from local farmers and artisans , prioritize s plant -based proteins in the caf\u00e9 , offer s vegetarian options at every meal , provides food cooked from scratch, including stocks, sauces, and soups , and purchase s only cage -free and third party -certified eggs, pork raised without the use of gestation crates, and ground beef from Certified Humane operations or small, local farmers. Sea food is purchased in a ccordance with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Guidelines for Sustainability. In addition, we've been at the forefront of the movement for farmworkers rights and host an annual National Farmworker Awareness Week on campus. Furman Farm Located adjacent to the Shi Institute, the Furman Farm is an organic practice farm with a comprehensive composting program. The composting progra m handles all the pre - and post - consumer waste from the dining hall and processes much of the university's landscaping waste. The compost program uses large scale pile composting and an in -vessel anaerobic composter. The farm is largely student run . The Furman Farm provides the campus community with an environment in which students, faculty, and staff can study, research, and practice smallscale food production. The garden helps strengthen physical, mental, and spiritual connections to the land throu gh the practice of sustainable, organic agriculture, and it provides a wide variety of crops which are served in the Dining Hall. Plant Based Eating and Other Nutrition Courses for Faculty, Staff, and Students Taught by a Prisma Health Registered Dietitian , this free course helps participants identify areas to integrate small, sustainable, dietary changes toward a more plant -based diet. Other classes have included general nutrition, healthy cooking, and healthy eating. Furman University Eating Lean ( FUEL ) FUEL uses a simple plate -based model to promote healthful eating. Participants are asked to conform most of their meals to the FUEL plate which consists of one -half vegetables and/or fruits, one quarter whole grains or potatoes, and one quarter lean proteins. FUEL participants receive comprehensive assessments, such as body composition analysis via Dual Energy X -Ray Absorptiometry, blood work (lipid panel, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, C -reactive protein, blood pressure), and a three -day food record analys is to assess nutrient intake. The program includes a comprehensive nutrition education class where participants can sample many delicious new foods. Since the program began, over 150 participants have learned how to improve their health - one plate a time. Campus Health Chemical Management / Green Cleaning Purchasing decisions result in large socio -economic and environmental impacts, both locally and globally. Furman University is committed to the use and purchase of environmentally - and socially -responsible products and services, particularly around our green cleaning supplies. Pillar 3: Efforts to Ensure Effective Environmental and Sustainability Education Environmental and Sustainability Education at Furman Environmental and sustainability education and literacy are paramount to what we do, and sustainability has been infused across our entire curriculum. In 2018, there were 374 courses offered that explicitly included sustainability as part of their focus , representing 31% of our course offerings and spanning 21 of our 24 academic departments. We support a wide range of curricular and co -curricular environmental and sustainability education programs for our students: Credit or Certificate Bearing Environmental / Sustai nability Programs Humans and the Natural Environment General Education Requirement Furman maintains general education requirements for all undergraduate students to graduate.
