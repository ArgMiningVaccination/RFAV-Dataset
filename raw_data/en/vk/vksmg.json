The encapsulation procedure and the phospholipids used were selected to maximize both the encapsulation and nebulization efciencies, withoutcompromising liposomal integrity during nebulization. with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine and dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (3:1 molar ratio), which allowed for peptide encapsulation levels of 730 mg/mL using 30 mM lipid concentration. The aerosol produced with the selected liposomal formulation wassubsequently analyzed for determination of size distribution and nebulizer efciencies. These quantities were used as input for a mathematical lung deposition model, which predicted local lung depositions of the liposomal peptides for three models of lunggeometry and breathing patterns: an adult, an 8-year-old child, and a 4-year-old child. The deposition results were then applied to a novel model of airway surface liquid in the lung to assess the concentration of the deposited peptide. The resulting concentrationestimates indicate that the minimum inhibitory levels of CM3 can be reached over most part of the tracheobronchial region in the adult model, and can be exceeded throughout the same region in both pediatric model subjects, using a valved jet nebulizer with a2.5mL volume ll. \u00df2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical simulation INTRODUCTION Cationic peptides are being developed as a new class of antibiotics.1They are highly effective against bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aerugi- nosa , which commonly infect cystic brosis (CF) patients. The antimicrobial action of these pep-tides is proposed to involve ''self-promoted uptake''across the outer membrane of Gram-negativebacteria followed by interaction with and crossing of the cytoplasmic membrane to attack cytoplas-mic targets. 2The initial interaction of the peptides with bacteria, involving self-promoted uptake, dictates two additional features of cationic pep-tides. First, these peptides have antiendotoxinactivity, because they bind to lipopolysaccharide(LPS), a by-product of the bacteria killing thatstimulates tumor necrosis factor production anddeath from endotoxaemia. Indeed, their abilityto neutralize endotoxin has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo in the galactosamine- sensitized mouse model 3,4(in contrast, other JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, VOL. 90, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2001 1647Correspondence 90, 1647-1657 (2001) \u00df2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Associationantibiotics promote the release of LPS, inducing endotoxaemia5). Secondly, some cationic peptides show synergy with conventional antibiotics aga-inst antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, actingas enhancers of those antibiotics. Scott et al. 3 compared in vitro levels of the three above- mentioned features in several cationic peptides.Among the peptides they tested, CM3 showedgood antimicrobial activity against Gram-nega- tive bacteria, one of the highest LPS binding activities, and marginal enhancer activity. In ad-dition, a preliminary study of the relative efcacyof diverse a-helical peptides in animal models demonstrated that CM3 was the best peptidewhen delivered by aerosol to the lungs of ratschronically infected with P. aeruginosa or by injection to the peritoneum of Pseudomonas infected neutropenic mice. 6Hence, CM3 was chosen for the present investigation. Liposome encapsulation of CM3 was developed to allow modication of the pharmacokineticsafter delivery to the lung due to the issues oftoxicity and stability that remain of concern forthese peptides. 7Simultaneous reduction of sys- temic toxicity and enhancement of drug efcacy with liposome encapsulation has been shown, for instance, by Parthasarathy et al.8with all- trans - retinoic acid. One of the major considerations inusing antimicrobial peptides therapeutically istheir potential to be toxic when applied systemi-cally. 7Unfortunately, the basis for toxicity is unknown, because to date there have been nopublished studies of toxicity. Some studies have noted that antimicrobial peptides are signi- cantly hemolytic, although this is issuefor the a-helical peptide CM3 studied here. Alter- natively, we have observed that certain peptidestend to precipitate rapidly in the blood of ( mg/kg). 9The only is the observation thatsingle injections of CM3 and related peptides give greater protection against peritoneal infections of P. aeruginosa than do double injections. 9Another consideration is the lability of natural peptides toproteases, which are abundant in the host. 7 Therefore, liposome encapsulation with a nalconcentration of approximately 1 mg/mL is beingconsidered, in the expectation that it will reduceCM3 toxicity and reduce proteolytic degradation in the host, while demonstrating at least a similar level of efcacy as the aqueous solution. Nebulization of liposome encapsulated drugs has been studied for many years. Among thevarious aspects investigated were the stabilityof liposomes during ditions,14and lipidic concentration.15Several studies pointed to the damage that the liposomalvesicles might suffer during nebulization becauseof the high shear forces that occur in thenebulizers. 10,13Another possible cause of vesicle disruption are the discontinuities in fluid proper-ties that occur during droplet impact on baffles. 16 The breakup of vesicles causes them to leak theentrapped drug back into the supernatant.Waldrep and coworkers compared the liposomalaerosols generated with different phospholipids 17 and by various nebulizers,18estimating numeri- cally the amount deposited in each lung region.Farr et al. 19and more recently Vidgren et al.20 studied in vivo regional deposition and clearance of nebulized liposomes labeled with 99m-techne- tium on healthy volunteers. Their studies demon-strated that deposition is primarily determined bythe aerosol characteristics, and not by the type orsize of liposome vesicles. The main objective of the present work was to develop and select a liposome preparation forCM3 that optimized encapsulation and nebuliza- tion, minimizing leakage due to nebulization, to be subsequently used for animal testing. Ano-ther aim of the present work was to estimate theinitial peptide concentration in the airway surfaceliquid (ASL) of human lungs 21immediately after aerosolization, to determine if efcacious levels ofthe drug can be expected. Because of the topicalaction envisioned for the CM3 peptide in the lung, an estimate of the local concentration of the antibiotic seems more relevant than the estimateof total regional dosages, obtained in previousstudies. 17,18,22This concentration estimate re- quired the combination of the measured aerosolcharacteristics with a mathematical lung deposi-tion model and a new model for the ASL distribu-tion in the human lung. The only other work known to the authors that used regional deposi- tion results to numerically estimate drug concen-trations in the lung, was a study on mucousconcentration of nebulized dextran. 23The present ASL model builds upon the foundation estab-lished in that study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Peptide Preparation Thea-helical cationic peptide CM3 is derived from a hybrid of silk moth cecropin and bee melittin1648 LANGE ET AL. JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, VOL. 90, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2001peptides, containing the rst eight amino acids of cecropin followed by the rst 18 amino acids of melittin with small amino acid changes. It wassynthesized by Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbo-nyl) chemistry at the Nucleic Acid/Protein ServiceLaboratory, University of British Columbia, Van-couver, BC, Canada. The amino acid sequence ofCM3 is KWKKFIKSLTKSAAKTVVKTAKKPLIV,as described in Scott et al. 3 Liposome Preparation and Vesicle Sizes Six liposome preparations were compared regard- ing in this comparison. The lipo-somes consisted of combinations of each of thesephospholipids with dimyristoyl phosphatidylgly-cerol sodium salt (DMPG-Na). One set of prepara-tions included cholesterol (Chol) (sigma grade:99\u0087%), frequently used to reduce encapsulated drug leakage during storage, 24in the form pho- sphatidylcholine:Chol:DMPG-Na \u00883:1:2 (molar ratio), lipid concentrations 30 and 60 mM. Theother set consisted of the same lipidic formula-tions, but without cholesterol (as in Knight et al. 25 and Parthasarathy et al.8), in a molar ratio of phosphatidylcholine:DMPG-Na \u00883:1 and a con- centration of lipids of 30 mM. Thus, the sixpreparations DPPC:DMPG-Na \u00883:1 molar ratio. For simplicity, the sufx Na will be omitted in subsequent notations. The lipids were rst dissolved in chloroform HPLC grade, then placed on a rotary evaporator at 408C for chloroform evaporation. The resulting lipid lm was flushed with nitrogen and left in avacuum oven overnight to remove any residualsolvent. The desiccated lipid was peptide (pH \u00887.4). liposomal multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). 26,27The freeze-thaw method (freezing indry ice/acetone bath, thawing in water bath at458C, followed by 1-min vortexing). A total of ve freeze-thaw cycles were performed, shown byMayer et al. 26to ensure maximum trapping efciency with MLVs. The hydrated liposomes were separated from the unencapsulated peptideby centrifuging two times at 4 8C and 150,000\u0002g for 20-30 min. Finally, the remaining pelletswere resuspended in PBS to a nal lipid concen-tration of 30 mM. The preparations were stored at 4 8C and used within 14 days. They were tested for leakage before every nebulization by analysis of the presence of CM3 in the isolated supernatant(20-30 min centrifugation, 4 8C, 150,000\u0002g), but no leakage occurred during storage. The sizes of the selected liposomal MLVs were measured with a Zetasizer (Malvern InstrumentsLtd., Nebulization and Total Output Nebulization of the liposomal preparations was with the valved nebulizer Pari LC STAR(Pari, Starnberg, Germany), which has shownsuperior performance in previous studies. 22,23For determination of the total output of encapsulatedpeptides, the nebulizer was connected directly to an Andersen cascade impactor (Andersen Mark II, Graseby Andersen, Smyrna, GA) with constantflow rate of 28.3 L/min. Nebulization took in mostcases approximately 10 min, and was terminatedwhen no aerosol was produced. Because thiscommonly used setup was recently shown tounderestimate the particles' size distribution(cf. Ref. 28), no distinction between the impactor plates was made in this case, i.e., only the total deposition in the impactor was considered. Forthis measurement the impactor was used in lieu ofan absolute lter. The aerosol collected in the impactor was wash- ed from the plates with 4-5 mL PBS, as was theresidue from the nebulizers. Samples from each ofthe washings (2 mL) were centrifuged at 4 8C and 150,000\u0002gfor 30 min. After dilution with metha- nol, the CM3 content was with UV so the fraction of encapsulated could be determined. Todistinguish leakage owing to nebulization fromleakage owing to simple dilution, a sample of theoriginal unnebulized liposomal preparation was treated with PBS (4-5 mL) and submitted to the same work-up as cascade impactor plates andnebulizer washings. This sample preparation wasused as standard for comparison of leakage withthe washings following nebulization.AEROSOL DELIVERY OF A LIPOSOMAL CATIONIC PEPTIDE 1649 JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, VOL. 90, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2001Droplets' Size Distribution and Liposome Distribution in the Droplets To determine the aerosol size distribution, the nebulizer was run intermittently. In this waythe above-mentioned underestimation of particle sizes was avoided. Five cycles of 10 min were performed, consisting of 30 s of nebulizationand 9 min 30 s of pause. The short nebuli-zation time reduced the cooling effect thatcompromises the measurement, 28and the long pauses allowed for the temperature of the nebu-lizer ll to return to equilibrium with theambient. Two size distribution measurements had to be distinguished. Because of the colloidal nature ofthe liposome vesicles, it could not be assumed liposomes were evenly distributed in thedroplets. 29If the liposomes were, for instance, preferentially concentrated in larger droplets, anassay of CM3 content in the washings of the im-pactor plates would misrepresent the size dis- tribution, overestimating the droplet sizes. On the other hand, besides the actual aerodynamicdroplet diameters, it is important to know howthe drug is distributed in the droplets to correctlyestimate local deposited dosages. These twodistributions were determined by two separatecascade impactor measurements. To determine the actual droplet was added tothe liposomal preparation immediately beforenebulization, to serve as a tracer for the aqueousphase. The mixture (2.5 mL) was then intermit-tently nebulized as described above, and theimpactor plates were assayed for methyleneblue by UV spectrophotometry. In an additional experiment, it was veried that, despite the cationic nature of methylene blue, the dye wasnot trapped by preformed liposomes, which arenegatively charged, thus, validating its use astracer for the aqueous phase. To determine the distribution of liposomal peptide in the droplets, a separate set of cascadeimpactor measurements was performed, and this time the impactor plates were assayed for CM3 in the same way as in the above-described measure-ment of total output. Calculation of Efciencies and Losses The parameters used for the comparison and selection of the liposomal preparations can beexplained in terms of efciencies and losses. The percentage of the initial amount of CM3 peptide (M initial) that was with as in the above-described assay of impactor plateswashings. After CM3 was submitted to nebulization.Because of retention in the walls of the nebulizer,only a fraction of the nebulizer ll ( M neb. ll ) gets actually lipo- somal suspension10,11,30and the effect of the droplet impaction on the baffles16during the nebulization process may cause rupture of thevesicles and leakage of the encapsulated drug.

Dilution of the liposomal suspension during the washing of impactor plates causes additional leakage due to osmotic pressure.30 To compensate for this procedural effect, astandard unnebulized liposomal preparationwas diluted by the same amount as the impactorwashings. The percentage of released peptideduring simple dilution ( M freein the standard) was then added to the measured percentage of encapsulated peptide after nebulization ( Mencaps pended also on the inhalation efciency, dened1650 LANGE ET AL.

Vented jet nebuli-zers, such as those used in the present study, tendto diminish these losses by reducing the aerosol production during exhalation. As a result, the inhalation efciency varied with the breathingpattern, and was determined in a separate set ofexperiments that involved the connection of thenebulizer to a breath simulator, consisting of anin-house computer-controlled piston. Three dif-ferent breathing patterns were tested: an adultpattern, based on literature data on breathing pat- terns of CF patients, 31-33and two pediatric patterns, corresponding to normal children 8and 4 years old, using data by Hofmann et al. 34 The corresponding values for tidal volume,breathing frequency and duty cycle are summar-ized in Table 1. All breathing patterns wereapproximated by asymmetric sine wave functions(inhalation:exhalation \u00881:1.3) without breath hold. The measured inhalation efciency deter- mined the actual amount of drug inhaled by eachmodel subject and was used as input for thenumerical prediction. Numerical Prediction To predict the initial peptide concentration in the airway surface liquid (ASL), the amount of peptide deposited in each lung generation mustbe estimated rst. For the local deposition of theinhaled droplets in the lung, a numerical lungdeposition model was employed, as described inFinlay et al. 23This deposition model has been shown to compare well with in vivo gamma scintigraphic measurements on normal sub-jects35,36and will be briefly described here for completeness. In this model, the aerosol particles were followed as they traveled through theairways, in what is termed a one-dimensionalLagrangian approach, or compartmental method.The lung of a healthy adult was represented by asymmetrically branching model derived from thedata given in Phillips et al. 37for the conducting airways (generations 0-14), and Haefeli-Bleuer and Weibel38for the alveolar region (generations 15-23). This lung model was scaled to give alsopediatric lung models for healthy children of ages4 and 8 years old using the procedures of Phalenet al. 39(tracheobronchial region) and Hofmann et al.34(alveolar region). More details about the three lung models can be found in Finlay et al.23 Amounts of aerosol depositing in each generation of these lungs were estimated by the model using the equations of Chan diffusion. Deposition the mouth- throat was estimated using the equations ofRudolf et al. 44The breathing pattern for each model subject consisted of asymmetric square waves dened by the data in Table 1. Although the model was capable of computing two-waycoupled hygroscopic effects, these were not con-sidered because of the high aerosol mass fractionproduced by the jet nebulizer. The negligibilityof hygroscopic effects in the present case wasindicated by the high value of the parametergproposed by Finlay 45to estimate the importance of such hygroscopic effects, and was conrmed by the small dosage differences ( <3%) obtained with simulations that included two-way coupledhygroscopicity. In addition to the calculated local dosages of liposomal peptide, the local volume of ASL in thethree lung models required estimation to predictASL drug concentrations. A new model of the generational distribution of ASL in the tracheo- bronchial region was developed for this purpose.The new model distinguishes the mucous and thepericiliary liquid (PCL) layers that characterizethe ASL in the upper airways, 21treating them separately as two concentric continuous annularlayers. The PCL layer is formed by a watery liquidthat facilitates the beating of the cilia and keeps the thicker mucous layer afloat at an exact distance to be reached by the tip of the ciliaduring their forward beating. 21Although the regulation mechanism of the PCL layer thicknessin the airways is still the subject of controversy, 46Table 1. Description of Breathing Patterns for Each Model Subject Model SubjectTidal Volume (L)Frequency (Breaths/ min)Duty CATIONIC PEPTIDE 1651 JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, VOL. 90, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2001it is recognized that this regulated thickness is well approximated by the length of the cilia. Measurements of cilia lengths in humans bySerani & Michaelson 47were interpolated with an exponential function and used in all tracheo-bronchial generations as the average thickness ofthe PCL layer in the generation. The volume ofPCL in each generation was calculated using thelayer thickness and the morphometric dimensions from the respective lung model. The mucous layer is essentially a gel formed by secretions from goblet cells located in the airwayepithelium, and also from submucosal glands inthe larger airways. 21The thickness of the mucous layer was estimated using mass conservation andmodels of average mucous velocity and productionrate for each generation. A reference set of mucous velocities was determined by the combi- nation of the present lung deposition model andthein vivo clearance data from Stahlhofen et al. 48 The mucociliary clearance of the tracheobronchial region was treated as a series of ''escalators,'' andthe mucous velocities, assumed constant insideeach generation, were estimated to match theclearance rates of those in vivo data, as explained in detail by Finlay et al. 23This procedure generat- ed a series of velocities that had a maximum at thetrachea, progressively slowing down to approxi-mately one-thousandth the tracheal most distal was with pre-scribed values of tracheal mucous velocity to covera meaningful range, as described below. For the distribution of the mucous production along the conducting airways there are no human datacurrently available. 49As an approximation for the distribution of mucous secretion in humans, theairway surface density of total secretory materialmeasured by Plopper et al. 50in various lung generations of the rhesus monkey was adopted.The values were linearly interpolated and multi- plied by the generational airway surface of the respective lung model, resulting in a referencecumulative production rate of mucus, startingfrom the terminal bronchiole and reaching thetotal at the trachea. Again, this reference produc-tion distribution was scaled according to pre-scribed tracheal values. Because of the variability of possible mucous velocities and production rates, two combinations for each model subject were chosen, so as to resultin a lower and an upper bound for the localpeptide concentration in the ASL. The upperbound for peptide concentrations corresponds tolow production rates and high tracheal velocities. Yates et al. 51did velocities in patients with were higher than normal, a maximum of15 mm/min was combined with arbitrarily lowdaily production rates (5 mL/day) to estimatemaximum peptide concentrations in the ASL. Onthe other hand, several studies point to increaseddaily mucous productions in CF patients, for example, Oberwaldner et al. 52observed an aver- age of 37 mL/day and later Oberwaldner et al.53 reported mean production values between 31 and37 g after special physiotherapeutic treatment.Hence, a production rate mL/day togetherwith relatively low tracheal mucous velocities(5 mm/min for the adult and 10 mm/min for thepediatric models) were chosen for the prediction of minimum concentration levels of liposomal pep- tide in the ASL. It is worth mentioning that thiscombination of high production rate and lowvelocity of the mucus represented airway lumensthat were nearly clogged, a situation that may notbe uncommon with CF patients. Finally, the concentrations in the total ASL layer were calculated assuming uniform deposi- tion of the liposomal peptide in each in the volume(sum of PCL and mucous layers) diluted by thewater of the deposited droplets. Theestimates of liposomal peptide concentrationsare representative of the initial state immediatelyfollowing nebulization and before signicantmucociliary transport takes place. Statistical tests were performed using ANOVA and Tukey HSD means comparisons. Results arepresented as mean \u0006SD. RESULTS For comparison of the liposomal preparations, encapsulation, nebulization, and stability ef- ciencies, described in the previous wereconsidered. All liposome formulations containingcholesterol showed low encapsulation efciencies.High lipid (60 mM) were needed toachieve encapsulation efciencies of 35-55%when including cholesterol. Higher lipid concen-trations result in higher viscosity of the prepara- tion and lower nebulization efciency, by Bridges and Taylor. 15The liposomal prepara- tions with cholesterol also showed a tendency nebulization. This effectcombined with the higher viscosity contributed1652 LANGE ET AL. JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, VOL. 90, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2001to reduce the nebulization efciencies to approxi- mately 20%. DLPC:Chol:DMPG was less viscous, but more prone to leakage due to nebulization(low stability efciency), resulting again in lowoutput of encapsulated peptide. Although choles-terol is generally associated with higher liposomestability, 13Niven & Schreier11have shown that cholesterol might in some cases increase nebuli-zation leakage. In contrast, the liposomal preparations without cholesterol showed considerably higher encapsu-lations efciencies, ranging between 70-90% forlipid concentrations of 30 mM. Nebulization was,in general, also more efcient in the absence ofcholesterol and with lower lipid concentrations.However, DPPC:DMPG was prone to precipita-tion after the typical temperature drop that takes place during nebulization, resulting in low neb- ulization efciencies ( E neb\u008810-30%). This effect, also found by Waldrep and coworkers,17can be explained by the relatively high phase transitiontemperature of DPPC. 24The two other formula- tions, DLPC:DMPG nebuliza-tion efciencies ( E E stabil\u008880-100%). simi- lar overall efciency levels of DLPC:DMPG andDMPC:DMPG, the latter was more readily cen-trifuged and handled. Because of the limited availability of CM3 peptide, the above-described selection part of the study had to rely on single or double experimentalruns, and the given results are to be seen asindicative only. To provide an illustration of howthe combination of efciencies results in the totaloutput of encapsulated peptide, Figures 1 and 2show graphically two typical cases of the process.Figure 1 shows the losses that occurred in one particular test of DPPC:Chol:DMPG, whereasFigure 2 shows average results for the case of DMPC:DMPG. In contrast to the efciencies, dened in each step of the process, losses areshown in both gures as percentages of the initialamount of CM3 peptide. Figures 1 and 2 clearlyshow the superiority of DMPC:DMPG overDPPC:Chol:DMPG. Taking into account all the above considera- tions, DMPC:DMPG was selected for the full characterization required as input to the mathe- matical lung of 730 mg/mL was used for nebulization. The sizes of the DMPC:DMPG \u00883:1 MLVs showed a mean diameter of 262 of the liposomes between 190-342 nm the range of 930-1700 nm. The nebulization of 2.5 mL of the selected liposomal preparation with the vented jet nebu-lizer resulted in a nebulization efciency fact, no statistically signicant differences ( p>0.1) between the leakage from the cascade impactor washings of nebulized DMPC:DMPG and the standard were measured. The size distributionof the aerosolized preparation, based on theaqueous phase, was lognormal with mass medianaerodynamic diameter (MMAD) standard deviation n\u00883). The independent assessment of the liposomal peptide distribution in the aerosol showed no statistically signicant difference (p>0.01) in the MMAD, indicating that the peptide is homogeneously distributed in theaerosol droplets. This result was expected in viewof the small sizes of the liposomal vesicles. Figure 1.

Theinhaled amounts resulting from a 2.5 mL nebu-lizer volume ll (corresponding to 1.8 mg ofliposomal peptide) were included in Table 2. Thefull characterization of the selected preparationdescribed above is summarized in Table 3. Using the information about the aerosol and the inhaled amounts obtained from the experi-ments, the deposited dosages of liposomal peptidein the three lung models were estimated. Asummary of the relative deposition resultsgrouped by region can be seen in Table 2. Lungdosages for the case of an adult are approximatelyhalf as large as the pediatric dosages. The estimated bounds for the liposomal CM3 peptide concentration in the ASL along thetracheobronchial airways of the model subjectsare shown in Figure 3. Results for the twopediatric simulations were similar and substan-tially higher (10 times in average) than for theadult case. Concentrations were in general higherin the proximal airways, tapering off at the more distal bronchioles.DISCUSSION Based on the overall performance, i.e., the combination of all efciencies, the liposome pre-paration DMPC:DMPG \u00883:1 molar ratio was chosen as the best formulation for the aerosoldelivery of encapsulated CM3 peptide, as shownin encapsulation ef-ciencies obtained with DMPC:DMPG \u00883:1 and 30 mM lipid concentration compare well with published values for cationic species. 26Cationic peptides, in particular, have previously beenencapsulated in liposomes to induce an anticancerimmune response as part of the development oftherapeutic cancer vaccines, as reported by Guanet al. 54But the encapsulation levels required for stimulation of immune response were an order of magnitude smaller (approximately 100 mg/mL) than the levels targeted in the present study. Thesuccessful encapsulation of 730 mg/mL of CM3 peptide, allied to the relatively high nebulizationefciency of the formulation and the smallleakage due to nebulization (Table 3), distin-guished the selected liposomal preparation aswell suited for the aerosolized delivery of the encapsulated antibiotic. The numerical simulation of drug deposition in the lung showed a large difference between thepediatric and the adult cases (Table 2). Thispronounced difference in predicted lung dosagescan be partially explained by the morphologicaldifferences of the lung models. The narrowerairways of the youngsters caused an increase in the two main deposition processes (impaction and sedimentation) in the conducting airways (tra-cheobronchial region). This effect was then mag-nied by the differences in tidal volumes of thethree breathing patterns. Although the absolutevalues of the tidal volume increased with age, asseen in Table 1, the relative values as fractionsof the model lung volume, i.e., the depths of inhalation, actually decreased. The tidal volumesTable 2.

Characterization of the Selected Liposomal Preparation DLPC:DMPG\u00883:1 Molar Ratio, 30 mM Lipid OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, VOL. 90, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2001corresponded to 44 and 30% of the lung volume (at 50% of TLC) in the 4- and 8-year-old models,respectively, but only to 20% of the volume in theadult model. The shallower inhalation resulted ina reduction of the relative alveolar deposition(Table 2). It is worth noting that this analysis isbased on lung data from healthy subjects. Although there is need for a morphologic model of diseased lungs in general, and of CF lungs inparticular, the present analysis represents theclosest approximation possible. Higher tracheobronchial dosages in the pedia- tric models were combined with a much smalleramount of ASL (approximately 1/3 of the adultASL volume), resulting in the prediction of 10 times higher concentrations than in the adult model in average. Although no experimentalstudies of pediatric ASL concentrations could befound in the literature, the present estimates forthe adult model show good agreement with themeasurements of Sinicropi et al. 55Sinicropi and coworkers measured sputum DNase concentra-tions in 18 CF patients 15 min after inhalation of a 2.5 mg nebulizer ll of rhDNase, and found an average of 2.9 mg/mL. This compares well with the lowest bound of concentrations pre-dicted in Figure 3 for an adult after inhalationof 1.8 mg nebulizer ll of CM3 peptide in thepresent study. In both pediatric cases the model predicts minimum concentrations of CM3 peptide that are well above the minimum inhibitory concen- tration of 2-4 mg/mL, shown by Scott et al. 3to be effective against several strains of P. aeruginosa . Despite the lower dosage received by the adultmodel and the dispersion of this dosage in a largervolume of ASL, most of the range of concentra- tions predicted still lies above the 2 mg/mL threshold. The estimated lower bound of concen-trations for the more distal conducting airwaysfalls short of this limit, but still ensures aminimum of 0.8 mg/mL. These simulation results indicate that the optimized liposome encapsula- tion of the new antibiotic CM3 combined with an efcient nebulization is a viable delivery option,thus fullling the main objectives of the presentwork. This nding supports future in vivo testing of the developed formulation. The new model for the ASL distribution in the human lung, which to the authors' knowledge isthe rst of its kind, in association with the lung deposition model was revealed as a valuable tool for the pretrial evaluation of the aerosol deliveryof new drugs, such as the investigated newliposomal peptide CM3. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are thankful to H. Orszanska (Aero-sol Research Lab. of Alberta) for the liposomepreparation and the laboratory analysis, and toM. King for the help on development of the ASLmodel. This work was supported nancially by theCanadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's SPARXprogram. REFERENCES 1. Hancock REW. 1997. Peptide antibiotics.
