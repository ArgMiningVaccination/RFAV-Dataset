The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:55 a.m., in room 2322, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Henry A. Waxman (chairman) presiding. Mr. WAXMAN. The meeting of the subcommittee will come to order. Last September the Department of Health and Human Services and the Burroughs Wellcome Company made a dramatic joint an- nouncement. There was an AIDS drug. The drug AZT had been in clinical trials in humans for 7 months. The trials were double- blinded and placebo-controlled. That is, by secret random selection half of the patients received AZT and half received a placebo. A few months later researchers began to report that some AIDS patients were clearly getting better. Others were dying. The re- searchers insisted that a scientific safety board break the secret code to see if the drug was producing these results. In September the safety board revealed that about 1 out of 8 pa- tients in the control group had died compared to one out of 145 of the patients receiving AZT. Given this information, both HHS and Burroughs Wellcome decided that it would be unethical to continue the study, that keeping some patients off the drug endangered their lives. While formal approval procedures began, all control group pa- tients were given AZT. In addition, Burroughs Wellcome and HHS began to supply AZT free of charge to any AIDS patient in Amer- ica who had symptoms similar to those of the study. To date, over 4,500 patients have been given the drug. In January the FDA's scientific advisory panel recommended that the drug be approved for sale in the U.S., England and France have already approved its sale. Last month Burroughs Wellcome announced that the drug will wholesale for about $7,000 per pa- tient per year. The retail price is expected to be between $8,000 and $10,000. There are a number of major questions that mus' be answered in today's hearing. Is this a fair price? Who will pay for the people who are now being treated for free? Who will pay for the people (1)i 2 who become ill after the drug is approved? Who is responsible for people who cannot pay? But the guiding principle in answering these questions has al- ready been given by HHS and Burroughs Wellcome as part of their original dramatic announcement: Keeping AIDS patients off AZT endangers their lives. It would be unethical to do so. We cannot permit the health care system to keep this drug away from people any more ethically than we could have permitted the health research system to do so. Giving patients sugar pills because they are part of a study can be justified as an effort to learn about a disease and its cure. Giving patients nothing because they have no insurance and no money can be rationalized only as a part of a system that provides health miracles to the wealthy and health ne- glect to the poor. This subcommittee has wrestled with aspects of these problems before, perhaps most visibly in the question of paying for organ transplants and the expensive drugs that are needed to make them successful. Today we confront the problems in their most crystal- lized form. If the manufacturer, the States and the Federal Govern- ment work well, lives can be prolonged, perhaps for a long time, perhaps until a cure for AIDS is found. If we do not, poor AIDS patients will die. It's as simple as that. Before calling on our witnesses, I want to recognize the distin- guished ranking minority member of the subcommittee, Mr. Mad- igan. Mr. MADIGAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, this morning's hearing brings into focus once again the problem of meeting the high cost of providing health care with finite re- sources. The question is, \"Who is going to pay for it? And it's a re- frain which we have heard repeatedly in the past and which we will continue to hear in the future, not only with regard to this therapy but with regard to many others. I hope that the witnesses today will help us in developing a ra- tional answer to that question, and will not automatically say that, \"It is not us who will be paying for it.\" The AZT therapy has been demonstrated to prolong the lives of certain AIDS patients. The question is-or the first question is, should it be made available to those patients at little or no cost? What if a superior drug is discov- ered, should it also be made available? Should the provision of AZT be continued if some superior drug is discovered? Those are just some of the questions. I'm interested in the future prospects for AIDS therapy and hope that the witnesses will focus on their planning for the future, as well as the immediate problem of financing AZT therapy. And I would hope that all of the witnesses this morning will keep in mind that this subcommittee will be hearing about numerous health issues in coming weeks. I'm sure all the members of the sub- committee will join me in requesting that the AZT issue be put in perspective with those other issues, particularly the testimony from various department officials. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Wyden. Mr. WYDEN. Just very briefly, Mr. Chairman. I certainly com- mend you for going forward with this hearing. There are really two issues that I think are particularly important. 3 One, I would like to see Congress to bring some certainty and some new integrity to the drug approval process. In some instances drugs are approved too fast; in other instances drugs are approved too slowly. I'm very interested in looking at the AZT pricing issue in conjunction with an overall examination of the drug approval process. The other reason that I think your hearing is so important, Mr. Chairman, is that there will be billions of dollars involved in the development of new drugs against AIDS. The prospects are there for abuses and problems steming from these drugs. I think it's veryimportant that we maintain vigorous oversight. This hearing is an important first step in that process, and I look forward to your tes- timony. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Wyden. Mr. Whittaker. Mr. WHIrAKER. Nothing, thank you. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Dannemeyer. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I commend you for looking into this subject of how we can withstand the cost of pro- viding hopefully some treatment and drugs for those people who now have a non-curable disease. One of the tragedies of the public health response to this epidemic in America is the non-traditional response which public health authorities have adopted. Notwithstanding the epidemic in the country specifically, we do not today call on States to report and notify public health authori- ties when a person with the AIDS virus is found in the course of treatment by physicians. Reporting the existence of a communica- ble disease is a normal, routine process that strangely in the treat- ment of this disease is not now being followed. As to why, that re- mains a good question. I hope that this subcommittee will hold hearings on the failure of the public health authorities in this Nation to adopt normal,routine practices that can hopefully minimize the transmissability of this fatal virus to other citizens in our community. One of the tragedies of this whole thing is that we don't know the number of people in this country today who may have a need for this drug or other drugs that may come along because we have not been follow- ing the routine, normal response of public health authorities when a new communicable disease comes along. Namely, to report it to public health authorities. I would hope someday, Mr. Chairman, that you will find time on your agenda to hold hearings on this issue and others that are de- signed to develop a public health response whereby this Govern- ment and State governments around the country will treat this issue as a public health issue and stop treating it as a civil rights issue. Thank you very much. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Dannemeyer. We will be holding a number of hearings on a number of the ramifications of the AIDS epidemic throughout the year, but the one today is on this question of the cost of AZT. [The statement of Hon. Terry Bruce follows:] STATEMENT OF HoN. TERRY BRUCE Thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing. 4 The spread of the AIDS virus has truly become a national concern-one that de- mands the awareness of every American. Programs aimed at eliminating the threat of AIDS demand the uncompromised support of every American. I strongly believe that we must redouble our effort to devise both a preventive measure to protect the uninfected population and move forward in providing hope for Americans who al- ready have AIDS. The development of the drug AZT holds out new hope for AIDS victims and their families. Preliminary tests indicate that AZT will retard the ravages of AIDS and permit many patients to resume productive lives. Unfortunately, AZT is prohibitively expensive-an estimated cost of up to $10,000 per year for each patient using the drug. For AIDS patients whose resources have already been exhausted, AZT can realistically only offer hope in conjunction with Federal assistance. Medicaid, the health care provider for low-income Americans, may spend as much as $800 million this year on assistance to AIDS victims. If Med- icaid were to provide its AIDS patients with AZT the bill could jump to $950 million in 1988. With the welcome life prolonging effects of AZT we can expect increasing Federal Government cost exposure through the Medicare program. The cost of pro- viding AZT raises the question of how best can the Federal Government provide for victims of AIDS. Mr. Chairman, I commend you for holding this hearing and I look forward to the witnesses' testimony. Mr. WAXMAN. And for our first witness, we're pleased to recog- nize Mr. T.E. Haigler, Jr., president and chief executive officer, Burroughs Wellcome Company. We're delighted to have you with us. We'll make your statement part of the record in full. We'd like to ask you to present your testimony orally and to try to highlight the main points, trying to keep as close to 5 minutes as possible. STATEMENT OF T.E. HAIGLER, JR., PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXEC- UTIVE OFFICER, BURROUGHS WELLCOME CO.; ACCOMPANIED BY DAVID BARRY, VICE PRESIDENT, RESEARCH Mr. HAIGLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to appear before your committee. I am T.E. Haigler, Jr., president and chief executive officer of Burroughs Wellcome Co., located in Re- search Triangle Park, NC. With me today is Dr. David Barry, our vice president for research. As you know, it was Burroughs Wellcome research that first identified AZT, now called RETROVIR, as being of potential value in the fight against AIDS. And it was Burroughs Wellcome, along with a number of outstanding government scientists and university investigators who conducted the study and development of this drug which has brought hope to AIDS sufferers everywhere. We have submitted a formal statement and asked that it be made part of the record. I will attempt to briefly summarize that statement and then answer your committee's questions. Eight months ago Dr. Barry appeared at a Congressional hearing on AIDS research before Congressman Weiss and yourself. I think it is fair to say that tremendous progress has been made since then. Today we have a drug that is in the review process and hope- fully will be soon approved for use against the human immunodefl- ciency virus. We have gone from making the quantities necessary for small scale clinical trials to a situation where more than one-third of all living AIDS patients in the United States are receiving RETROVIR therapy. Normally, it would take about 5 years to devise and per- fect the production methods required to go from synthesizing small quantities of drugs to the tons currently being produced. Through 5 an enormous effort, we have succeeded in increasing our supply more than a thousandfold in the last 18 months. We have invested millions of dollars in the research program that has brought this drug from the laboratory to more than 4,000 patients in a period of less than 3 years. We began this research at a time when AIDS was not considered a significant public health problem by the general public. We did this because we felt our experience with antivirals would enable us to make a valuable contribution to the fight against this devastat- ing disease, and we believed we had an obligation to do so. This effort involved a significant of financial risk. The full use- fulness of RETROVIR is unknown. Efficacy and speed of introduc- tion of other therapies are unknown. Our financial returns are un- certain. After we showed that the antiviral approach could indeed by successful, others have taken an active interest in this therapeu- tic area. And we believe that that is in the public good. The costs involved in this project have been significant. Apart from the millions of dollars that we have spent in research, Well- come has committed more than $80 million in additional capital for raw matei-ials for production of RETROVIR. This is above and beyond other usual costs associated with manufacturing and dis- tributing RETROVIR to patients. Mr. Chairman, as I am sure you and your committee know, de- spite our best efforts, we will be faced with the difficult situation of having a somewhat limited supply of RETROVIR initially following FDA approval. However, let me assure you that we are devoting the necessary time, technology, personnel, and financial resources to continually increase supply. I can say that the supply situation is constantly evolving and improving. We expect to have adequate supplies of the drugs available for most seriously ill patients immediately upon approval. And Mr. Chairman, we expect our supply to be sufficient to meet the needs of more than 30,000 patients in the United States by the end of the year. We have discussed an appropriate distribution system with the FDA and other agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services and outside experts. This distribution system will be in place at the time of FDA approval. At this point, Mr. Chairman, I think we can safely say that drug therapy offers the only hope for patients suffering from this deadly disease. While education and ultimately vaccines may help to slow the acquisition of the virus, drug therapy is the modality that will have the most positive impact on the substantial population al- ready infected. The hope of drug therapy is to save lives, return pa- tients to productive lives, and keep patients with minimal symp- toms healthy. We have shown that RETROVIR can prolong life in those pa- tients who have one of the most severe forms of human immunode- ficiency disease. We know that RETROVIR can reduce their risk of opportunistic infections and improve their ability to live day to day. On the health care expenditure side, we believe RETROVIR will reduce annual direct costs for the patient with advanced forms of the disease. We believe the RETROVIR therapy also will limit the 6 progression of patients from less serious to more serious forms of the disease. Aside from the obvious benefits to the patient, this wiJ! also reduce health care costs. As we all know, the end stages of HIV infection are when the largest consumption of health care re- sources occur. We estimate that the annual cost of RETROVIR to patients could be in the range of $7-to $10,000. Let me assure you that we have considered a number of factors in establishing our price for RETROVIR. We have considered the high cost of developing and producing this drug, and the very real needs of the patients for whom it was developed. I believe we have balanced our concern for patients with the de- velopment and production costs involved and the risks we have as- sumed. We have recognized our need to recover our cost, achieve a financial return in an uncharted therapeutic area and in an un- charted, uncertain future. It is my hope, Mr. Chairman, that the proceeding has been of value. Dr. Barry and I will be happy to answer any questions you might have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Haigler follows:] STATEMENT OF T.E. HAIGLER, JR. I am T.E. Haigler, Jr., president and chief executive officer of Burroughs Well- come Co., a research-based pharmaceutical company located in Research TrianglePark, North Carolina. With me is David Barry, M.D., our vice president of research. I am pleased to have the opportunity today to provide information about Bur- roughs Wellcome's efforts in the discovery and development of RETROVIR for the treatment of certain patients suffering from diseases associated with the human im- munodeficiency virus, namely Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS Related Complex (ARC). I would like to give you some background informa- tion about Burroughs Wellcome and its prior work in the antiviral area. I will then summarize our research and development efforts with respect to RETROVIR and describe our supply situation and distribution plans for RETROVIR, including pric- ing considerations. BACKGROUND Burroughs Wellcome is the American subsidiary of The Wellcome Foundation, Ltd., a worldwide group of pharmaceutical companies. The Wellcome enterprise wasfounded in 1880 by two American pharmacists, Silas Burroughs and Sir Henry Well- come. Throughout the years, it has been dedicated to the advancement of medical knowledge and care. The Wellcome Foundation was established in 1924 to consoli- date the international business of Wellcome. In 1936, Sir Henry's will created the charitable Wellcome Trust as the Founda- tion's sole shareholder and directed that earnings would be used to further medical and scientific research to improve the physical condition of mankind. Since its cre- ation, The Trust has distributed more than $180 million dollars to worldwide medi- cal research, independent of Wellcome research activities, making it the largest pri- vate philanthropy in Great Britain. In 1986, 25 percent of the Foundation shares were offered for public sale. Theother 75 percent remain with the Trust. This public offering was intended to diversi- fy the Trust's source of income and provide additional resources for its work. After 105 years, Wellcome became a publicly held company and now is traded on the London Exchange. Burroughs Wellcome Co., the United States subsidiary, was founded in 1906. It employs more than 3,500 people in the United States and is dedicated to research, development, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceutical and diagnos- tic products. The company makes about 90 products including antibacterials, analge- sics, and drugs to treat cardiovascular diseases, gout, malaria, cancer and organ transplant rejection. Seven of our medicines have been used in the treatment of var- ious manifestations of AIDS and its associated opportunistic infections. 7 A particular area of interest and success at Wellcome has been the development of antiviral agents. Over three decades, Wellcome scientists have developed the mostsuccessful antiviral program in medical research. This research grew out of pioneer- ing studies in cancer chemotherapy and nucleic acid derivatives in the 1940s and 1950s. It pointed the way to the company's first antiviral drug, MARBORAN, which was used during the 1960s for the prevention of smallpox and treatment of smallpox vaccination complications. Burroughs Wellcome began an intensive research effort to discover new antiviral compounds in the 1960s and 1970s. The company developed VIROPTIC brand tri-fluridine to treat herpes infections of the eye and later discovered ZOVIRAX brandacyclovir, the first antiviral to selectively attack a virus while leaving normal cellsvirtually untouched. Intravenous ZOVIRAX and ZOVIRAX Ointment were intro- duced in 1982 for the treatment of initial genital herpes infections and herpes sim-plex infections in patients with inadequate immune systems. ZOVIRAX Capsuleswere introduced in 1985 and are used worldwide for the treatment and suppression of a variety of herpes group infections including genital and facial herpes as well asshingles. ZOVIRAX has helped millions of people in their efforts to deal with the medical and psychological effects of infections caused by this group of viruses. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Our research into AIDS is a natural extension of this antiviral program. This re-search began at a time when AIDS was not considered a significant public healthproblem by the general public, and pharmaceutical manufacturers generally did notconsider the illness to be one involving significant financial rewards. We initiatedthis research because we felt that, based on our antiviral experience, we could makea valuable contribution to the fight against this devastating disease. Our AIDS research program began in June 1984 with a study of chemical com-pounds which we felt might be effective against the AIDS virus. In November 1984we identified a compound, AZT, also known as azidothymidine or zidovudine, and which we now call RETROVIR, which inhibited the replication of certain animalviruses in the laboratory. Independent laboratory testing in late 1984 and early 1985confirmed that zidovudine was effective in inhibiting the multiplication of thehuman AIDS virus in the test tube. Toxicologic and pharmacologic testing began in the spring of 1985, as did work onscaling up synthesis of the drug. On June 14, 1985, we submitted an application tothe Food and Drug Administration to obtain an Investigational New Drug Exemp-tion for the use of RETROVIR in humans. On June 21, 1985, the FDA indicated thatthe data were sufficient to allow us to begin clinical studies in humans.The first patient received RETROVIR on July 3, 1985 at the Clinical Center of theNational Institutes of Htealth. This initial Phase I study ultimately involved 35 pa-tients. It showed that adverse reactions were limited, consisting primarily of somebone marrow suppression in some patients when taking high drug doses for pro-longed periods of time. The study also indicated that RETROVIR was well absorbedafter oral administration and entered the brain in reasonable amounts. Some of thepatients showed some objective and subjective evidence of improvement, including an increased sense of well-being, weight gain, and improvement in various measuresof their immune system. These responses were sufficiently encouraging to allow us to begin a Phase II double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of RETROVIR.This study, which took place at 12 medical centers throughout the country, began on February 18, 1986. It was financed solely by the Burroughs Wellcome Co. Itbegan five months before the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases selected the AIDS Treatment and Evaluation Units (ATEUs). Most of the 12 centersinvolved in the Burroughs Wellcome study were eventually selected as ATEUs. Atotal of 282 AIDS and AIDS Related Complex (ARC) patients were enrolled in thisstudy during the period of February to June 1986. Because of the ehical concernsraised by a placebo-controlled study in a uniformly fatal disese, arrangements weremade to convene a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, through the auspices of theNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, to examine the data on pa-tients in the study every two to three months. If either the placebo or the drug-treated group did either so poorly or so well that it would be unethical to continue the study as designed, this outside review board would inform us and the study would be stopped. In September 1986, an interim analysis presented to this board showed that there was a significantly lower mortality rate in patients randomized to receive RETRO-VIR compared to those randomized to receive placebo. The trial was halted. At the 8 time the trial was stopped, there had been 16 deahts among the 137 patients receiv- ing placebo and one death among the 145 patients receiving RETROVIR. The group receiving RETROVIR also had a decreased number of opportunistic infections. This was true of both AIDS and ARC patients. In addition, weight gain and improve- ments in the immune system and the ability to perform daily activities noted in the earlier study were confirmed in this larger study. Bone marrow suppression contin- ued to be a significant side effect. Because this study showed the benefits of RETROVIR therapy outweighed the risks associated with treatment in certain groups of AIDS and ARC patients, place- bo recipients in this study were given the opportunity to receive RETROVIR ther- apy. Eighty-four percent of the patients enrolled in this study are alive today, more than one year after the first patient was enrolled. In addition, the National Insti- tutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and Burroughs Wellcome estab- lished an investigational new drug (IND) program to make RETROVIR more widely available to the group of patients for whom the benefits had been shown over- whelmingly to outweigh the risks, namely AIDS patients who had recovered from at least one episode of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Since September 1986, more than 4,500 patients, one-third of all living AIDS pa- tients in the United States, have received RETROVIR free of charge from Bur- roughs Wellcome through this treatment IND program. There are 2,122 physicians registered with the treatment IND program and 919 registered pharmacists. We an- ticipate that the treatment IND program will ultimately distribute more than $10 million worth of drug. While this program wag being implemented, a U.S. New Drug Application (NDA) was filed in sequential segments with the FDA to ensure that the data were under review as rapidly as possible. The submission of the NDA began in October and was completed on December 2, 1986. The FDA held an advisory committee meeting to review the data on January 16 of this year. The committee voted 10 to 1 to recom- mend approval of RETROVIR for the treatment of most AIDS patients and certain seriously ill ARC patients. We have supplied the FDA with additional information they requested and are in active discussion with them, including meetings later today. We expect approval in the very near future. License applications have been submitted to a number of regulatory authorities in other countries by the Wellcome Foundation. Approvals for general sale already have been granted in the United Kingdom and France. In the meantime, we have continued our efforts to learn more about RETROVIR and the patients for whom it might be beneficial. Our clinical trial program has ex- panded and we expect to begin studies with RETROVIR in 1,500-2,000 patients around the world within the next six months. This program will include pediatric patients, patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, neurological disease, ARC and asympto- matic infection. Also underway are studies to test the effectiveness of RETROVIR in combination with other drugs as well as its usefulness in patients undergoind bone marrow transplantation or T-lymphocyte transfusions. These efforts are just part of a multimillion dollar investment in research which brought this drug to its current status in a period of less than three years. Current- ly, about one-fifth of all research and development spending at Burroughs Wellcome Co. involves RETROVIR. Clinical trials of drugs in AIDS and ARC patients are ex- traordinarily expensive because of the difficulty in culturing the virus, the relative- ly long-term nature of most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) studies and the extremely complicated nature of the illness which these patients present to the cli- nician. We began this research at a time when the full impact of this disease was not fully appreciated and the chance of success was highly unlikely. This effort in- volved a significant amount of financial risk. Because the full usefulness of RETRO- VIR and the efficacy and speed of introduction of competitive products are un- known, our financial returns are uncertain. However, the research we have done has already contributed to a greater understanding of the disease. For example, the information collected from the placebo arm of our phase II trial alone is the most rigorous study of the natural history and progression of AIDS and ARC. The data will provide an excellent foundation for the research efforts of our own company and ma:nv others who have only recently begun taking a greater interest in this therapeutic area. PRODUCTION A;D SUPPLY Parallel to our efforts to expand our clinical knowledge about RETROVIR have been our efforts to increase production of the drug so that it can be made more widely available to appropriate patients. Compared to most other drugs, RETROVIR 9 is a complex and very expensive drug to manufacture. The overall process from original raw material to delivering RETROVIR to the patient takes about seven months. The chemical production process can be divided into two sections. First, the work done externally to make and supply thymidine, a key raw ingredient, and then the work done by Burroughs Wellcome to go from raw material to final drug substance. For our initial work on zidovudine, we purchased commerically available thymi- dine, which had been obtained as a side product from the DNA in salmon and her- ring sperm. We are informed that the a nual worldwide usage, at this time, was about 25 pounds. By the summer of 1985, .the world's available supply of thymidine had been exhausted. We, therefore, had to find companies with the appropriate technology to manufacture larger quantities of both natural and synthetic thymi- dine for us as fast as possible. One company in particular, Pfizer Inc., has been very cooperative and allowed us to continue our development with minimal delays. They have a multi-step process which involves about 10 chemical reactions. Even with this technology, a great deal of work was involved to increase the world's supply of thymidine several thousand- fold in less than two years. The costs have been significant and were undertaken with no assurance during most of that period that a commerically viable product would result. Because of the complexity of the synthesis and the quantities involved, several chemical plants are involved in production of thymidine. Burroughs Wellcome uses six chemical reactions in a series of stages to convert thymidine to RETROVIR. By employing the majority of our chemical development resources over the past 18 months, we have doubled the efficiency of these stages. Normally it would take about five years to devise and perfect the methods required to increase the amount of drug synthesized from the fraction of an ounce produced for initial study to the tons needed for availability to thousands of patients. Through improvements in technology, the cooperation of our suppliers and our willingness to disrupt production plans, we have been successful in increasing our supply by a factor of 10 every six months for the past year and a half. The costs involved in this operation have been significant. The Wellcome group has committed more than $80 million in additional capital and raw material specific to RETROVIR. This is above and beyond other usual costs associated with manufac- turing and distributing RETROVIR to patients. Despite our best efforts, however, we will be faced with the difficult situation of having a somewhat limited supply of RETROVIR for a period of time in the near future. We are devoting the necessary time, technology, personnel, and financial re- sources to continually increase supply. The supply situation is constantly evolving and improving. We believe that adequate supplies of RETROVIR will be available for the most seriously ill patients immediately, and project that supplies for a mini- mum of 30,000 patients and probably more will be available by the end of 1987. However, because of the limited availability of RETROVIR initially following FDA approval, there appears to be a need for some type of controlled distribution system. Burroughs Wellcome has discussed an appropriate system with the FDA and other agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services. A panel of experts, chaired by Dr. Sheldon Wolff and organized through the auspices of the In- fectious Disease Society of America, is serving as an outside consultant to help us with this system. These groups and the FDA Advisory Committee understand our supply situation and the proposed distribution system and have indicated their sup- port of our plans. The company has three goals in distributing the available supply of RETROVIR. We have a commitment to help ensure the continued availability of this medicine to patients who already have begun RETROVIR therapy, as long as the drug is medi- cally appropriate for them. We want to channel the available supply to the patients with the greatest need and those patients who are most likely to benefit from RE- TROVIR therapy, given our present state of knowledge about the drug. We need to ensure an adequate supply to meet their continuing needs. In addition, we have to set aside enough drug to continue a large clinical trial program in order to advance our knowledge about RETROVIR therapy and further identify the patients for whom it may be beneficial. A distribution system designed to meet these objectives will be in place when the drug is a proved. The system will be similar to the process presently being followed in the treat- ment IND program. During the period of limited drug supply, criteria for patient selection will be determined based upon the indications in our FDA-approved pack- age insert and in consultation with our outside experts. Physicians will apply for the drug on behalf of individual patients. Qualified patients with a physician'spre- scription will be given an identification number and RETROVIR will be shipped di- 10 rectly from Burroughs Wellcome to a pharmacy of the patient's choice. This system will enable us to alert physicians as soon as additional drug supplies become avail- able. The price Burroughs Wellcome will charge wholesalers for RETROVIR is expect- ed to be $188 per bottle of 100, 100 mg capsules. The monthly and yearly cost for individual patients will vary depending on dosage regimens and length of time on therapy, as well as distribution costs. We estimate that the annual retail cost of RE- TROVIR therapy for a patient could be in the range of $7,000 to $10,000. We are informed that the price Wellcome companies will charge for RETROVIR will be con- sistent throughout the world. In arriving at the price for RETROVIR, we looked at the usual factors that influ- ence pricing decisions. These include the costs of developing, producing and market- ing the drug, the high costs of research, and the need to generate revenues to cover these continuing costs. Other factors considered include the uncertain market for the drug, the possible advent of new therapies, and profit margins customarily gen- erated by significant new medicines. We also examined factors that might be consid- ered to be unique with respect to RETROVIR. These included the very high cost of producing this drug and the very real needs of the patients for whom this drug was developed. We considered all of these factors and attempted to arrive at a price that we con- sidered reasonable. However, the cost to the patient will be relatively high for all the reasons I have described. This situation is particularly difficult when one realizes that the clinical improve- ments achieved through RETROVIR therapy may make disabled patients produc- tive citizens but at the same time disqualify them fromeligibility in health care safety net programs. Also, a very substantial portion of the money they earn when re-entering the workforce may have to be spent on the medicine that has enabled them to return to work. As part of our regular procedures, Burroughs Wellcome Co. maintains a limited indigent care program for some of its life-saving therapies. These patient requests are considered on a case-by-case basis. We hope to continue this with RETROVIR, but the magnitude of the potential need and the impact of the illness are so enor- mous that we know it is beyond our scope. In our view, it is a national public health problem well beyond the resources of one company, and must be dealt with by governments, employers and the health insurance industry. COST-EFFECTIVENESS An important aspect of RETROVIR therapy is that it appears to substantially lower the present costs of treating AIDS patients are limited, analysis of the avail- able data for RETROVIR indicates that RETROVIR therapy is extremely cost-effe- citve. One study done in San Francisco estimates that the cost of treating AIDS pa- tients for one year is approximately $43,500. Other estimates place the cost at a sub- stantially higher figure, some as high as $150,000 per patient. Analysis of the data presently available, using the lower San Francisco base line, indicates that treating AIDS patients with RETROVIR could reduce direct medical costs during the first year by about 25 percent. It is anticipated that the cost of treating ARC patients could be reduced by about 60 percent in the first year, primarily because of fewer opportunistic infections and fewer hospitalizations. Projecting these savings to a population of 20,000 AIDS and ARC patients treated with RETROVIR indicates a combined first year savings of $386 million. There are also large indirect costs associated with HIV-related conditions, includ- ing AIDS. Some of these indirect costs are the loss of wages for sick persons, the loss of future earnings for persons who are permanently incapacitated or die because of illness, and the cost of infection control in the course of other health services, such as dental care. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that the first 10,000 pa- tients with AIDS lost approximately 8,387 years of work and $189 million in poten- tial earnings due to disability. The economic loss from future earnings lost followingpremature death are calculated to be $4.6 billion. (Ann M. Hardy, DPH, et al., Jour- nal of the American Medial Association, January 10, 1986.) In addition, it is possible that RETROVIR therapy may affect the progression of patients from less serious to more serious forms of the disease, further reducing health care costs. More important than the cost savings is the evidence that RE- TROVIR can prolong life in certain patients as well as improve the quality of that life. Data from our multi-center trial indicates that 68 percent of the AIDS patients treated with RETROVIR were able to continue or resume productive lives. In addi- tion, a recent study by scientists at the National Cancer Institute published in The Lancet suggests that RETROVIR may reverse some of the dementia and other neu- 11 rological disorders in some patients with HIV infections. We have similar data from our own multi-center study. While a great deal more research needs to be done in this area, the observation that RETROVIR may modify the neurological impact of this disease has significant implications for patients and their future outlook. As a research-intensive pharmaceutical company, Burroughs Wellcome Co. has fo- cused its efforts on what we do best-discovering and bringing new drugs to market. As we determined the price of the drug, however, we alerted those responsible for public and private policy and financing to the difficulties that some patients might face in purchasing the drug. We are concentrating on the scientific and technical challenges of discovering and bringing to market the first effective therapy for AIDS. But we hope we have not lo:t sight of the patients and their families. Their need has been an ever-present reality to us, and their improvement on RETROVIR therapy has provided us with the encouragement to continue our efforts. Our concern for patients has led us to make a number of other commitments as well. Our interest in providing and acquiring information will not end when the drug-is commercially available. We will continue to support and participate in edu- cational efforts in the United States and around the world to advance the state of knowledge about AIDS therapy. We will broaden our discussions to include state governments by assisting in the development and and dissemination of a policy guide for states on AIDS issues. We will have a significant educational effort de- signed for physicians and other health care providers to help assure they are well- informed about RETROVIR therapy and its role in the management of human im- munodeficiency virus diseases. Our medical department will be doing follow-up stud- ies on patients who are already receiving RETROVIR and initiating studies in many other important patient sub-groups. Burroughs Wellcome has succeeded in rapidly developing the first drug to provide hope to patients who formerly were faced with almost certain death. We have con- ducted, and will conduct, clinical trials that add significantly to medical understand- ing of AIDS and ARC as disease conditions. For now, drug therapy offers the only hope for patients with this disease. While education and, ultimately, vaccines may help to slow the acquisition of the virus, drug therapy is the modality that will have the most positive impact on the substantial population already infected. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my remarks. I will be happy to answer any ques- tions you may have and hope I can be of assistance to you and others as you deal with this important topic. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Haigler. Before we begin questions, let me say that I think that Burroughs Wellcome has done an outstanding job in getting this drug developed. I recog- nize that you've taken risks, that despite all your expenses this drug could become outdated quickly. The country has entrusted the essential function of making pharmaceuticals to the private sector companies and you have made it work. You're to be commended for it. Mr. HAIGLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. You should have a fair return on your investment and fair compensation for the risks that you are taking with this product, and I understand the pharmaceutical manufacturers are not charitable businesses. But I also believe that pharmaceutical companies share with the public sector the responsibility of not just getting the drug on the market, but also getting it to patients. In this life and death situation, the responsibility is especially high. I want to congratulate you on your development work and I look forward to working with you in getting AZT to people who need it. And let me proceed with my questioning in that spirit. Mr. HAIGLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. The first issue I want to just discuss with you is the price for the drug. It's quite a high price. I gather the estimate is maybe $8,000 to $10,000 per patient per year. Now we're going to have to decide if a patient can pay for a drug with a cost tag on it 12 of that magnitude. If the patient can't, will insurance pay for it? If insurance is not available, will government pay for it? And if no one can afford it, what will happen? These are questions that pol- icymakers must grapple with. But I want to discuss with you how you've come to the price that you now put on the drug. You want to recoup your investment. I want to ask you some questions about the investment that you've made in developing this drug. As I look at the timetable, Burroughs Wellcome has done about a year of screening for drugs and 7 months of clinical trials involving only a few hundred people, as opposed to the thousands that are usually required. You've also received orphan drug status for AZT which should contribute as much as a 72 percent tax subsidy of your clinical costs. And in addition to that, you get a 25 percent tax credit for increased research and development. After taxes, how much do you estimate that it cost to get AZT to the point of manufacture? Mr. HAIGLER. You have asked a lot of questions there, Mr. Chair- man, and I think first, if I might, in arriving at our price for RE- TROVIR, we looked at all of the usual factors that go into-that influence drug-pricing decisions. These certainly include, as you said, the cost of research-perhaps I can ask Dr. Barry in a minute to address that, the particular question about the short time-the cost of development of the drug, the cost of production of the drug, which includes certainly material costs, which in those cases are a fairly high cost, labor, overhead, yields that come about out of the process itself, waste management, capital expenditure cost, cost of distribution, medical information cost; all of these factors are usual factors in arriving at a drug-pricing decision. Certainly other factors that we considered included the risk re- lated to, as I think you said, the uncertainties of the market, the uncertainties about the full usefulness of RETROVIR, the possible advent of new therapy. We also, I think, carefully considered two factors that are specif- ic to RETROVIR, and that is the high cost of producing this par- ticular drug, and the needs of those patients for whom this drug was developed. Mr. WAXMAN. Let's go back to that first part, the cost of the de- velopment, research and development of the drug itself. You did have a quick timeframe for getting this drug to FDA, for which you are to be commended. It's essential that we get this drug out there as fast as possible. On the other hand, the shorter period ofe time and the fewer number of patients involved meant there was less cost to you. And, of course, with some of the costs you incur, you get tax credits. It was considered an orphan drug because the number of people af- fected by the disease at the time you were seeking to get this drug approved put it in the category of an orphan drug benefiting a rare number of people or relatively small number of people who are af- fected, even though potentially we have large numbers of peoplethat may have a need for this drug. You got a tax credit for that, you got a tax credit, 25 percent tax credit for the R&D costs. Do you have a figure that you could give us after you take the tax credits as to how much it cost to do research and development 13 to get the point of manufacture of the drug? We'll talk about the manufacturing costs in a minute. Mr. HAIGLER. Mr. Chairman, I think all of those are very good questions, and in regards to the cost of research and development, perhaps I could ask Dr. Barry, who is certainly much more inti- mately familiar with that part of our process, to discuss this. Mr. BARRY. Thank you. The cost, particularly of the clinical trials, is not less than the cost of most-the development of most other drugs, for several rea- sons: First, patients with AIDS and AIDS-Related Complex, so-called ARC, are not only extraordinarily ill, but have a multitude of infec- tions which require a great deal of attention by the physician and many diagnostic procedures. Mr. WAXMAN. Why don't you start by telling me what the costs were, and then we can compare them to other drugs. Mr. BARRY. I really honestly don't have that cost figure, because it's difficult to differentiate from our entire research and develop- ment program, particularly in the antiviral area. But I did want to emphasize that although the number of patients were relatively small compared to the thousands of patients that are often exam- ined in clinical trials, the expense in the relative term was not sig- nificantly less from other studies; first, as I mentioned, because of the extraordinarily difficult and complex medical care that must be given to the patients; second, because of the costs of the drug itself; and third, because these patients, as part of their clinical trial, must be cultured on a regular basis. And the cost of culturing-- Mr. WAXMAN. I want to stop you there, if you don't have a figure, and I understand it involves a lot of other considerations and other costs that you can't quite differentiate with this drug. But what you want to do, and you are entitled to, is recoup your investment. And you say that the pricing structure includes reve- nues to cover your development costs. If just the 4,500 patients that are now getting AZT continue, your income this year, when you are approved, would be $45 million. By the end of this year, there will probably be about 25,000 living AIDS patients in the United States. If all of them take AZT, your income next year would be about $250 million. Most epidemiologists suggest that there are 10 times the number of people with ARC who have AIDS, so if FDA approved AZT for ARC, your income next year could be almost $3 billion. When you have all these series of projections, at some point you are going to recover your development costs, and we'd like to know after you do so-I expect there would be some decrease in the price of the drug-whether that would be realistic. Let me put this in the context of Barron's publication which pre- dicted profits of $200-$300 million this year. Do you agree with that estimate? Mr. HAIGLER. I'm sorry; who? Mr. WAXMAN. Barron's Magazine. Barron's has an article on the profits Burroughs-Wellcome can expect on AZT. I haven't seen this article, but I'm told that Barron's predicts profits of $200 to $300 million this year. Is that an estimate you would agree with? 14 Mr. HAIGLER. I don't have any basis-I don't know the basis of the estimate that they arrived at. So I really can't comment on that. But, no. Mr. WAXMAN. You don't agree with that figure? Mr. HAIGLER. No. Mr. WAXMAN. One pharmaceutical company-- Mr. HAIGLER. I think, as I said earlier, if I may, Mr. Chairman, there are still a lot of uncertainties about this particular drug. Mr. WAXMAN. I understand that, but I'm trying now to figure out the one component of recovering your investment, the develop- ment of this drug, and it looks like you have the potential to recov- er it many, manyfold. Now that shouldn't be the only basis for set- ting a price, I understand that. One pharmaceutical newsletter sug- gested that your mark-up of AZT is 100 percent, that half the price is going to be profit. Do you agree with that statement? Mr. HAIGLER. I'm sorry, I can't respond to that, Mr. Chairman. I think, to go back to what I said earlier, the potentials of this drug may be there, but what will actually happen when the drug is fi- nally approved and it's on the market, what those sales will be, we have no way of really knowing. We certainly don't know what's going to happen in the next year or two as far as new therapies are concerned. Whether this drug will continue to be the drug of choice and really used, we don't know. So I don't think we can speculate on what sales we will have or what profits we might see. Mr. WAXMAN. You set the price of $8000 to $10,000 for the sale of the drug this year to reflect your investment, the uncertainties, and the profit potential, and you are not sure of the full profit po- tential, although it could be enormous, but I assume you're looking at the possibility it might not be as high as some people are conjec- turing. Now what price are you going to charge overseas for this? Mr. HAIGLER. It's my understanding that the price overseas will relate specifically to our price here. There are exchange rate com- plications to get into that, but the base price will be, as I under- stand it from our parent company, will be the same in dollars as we are charging here. Mr. WAXMAN. And have other countries agreed to this price? Mr. HAIGLER. I do not know the answer to that, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Let me just move on to one other area that I want to examine with you, and that's the very unusual situation we have with this drug, because ethically you can't give a placebo any more, siffce we have a drug that we know will prolong the life of the patient. To try to establish whether another drug is going to be effective to deal with AIDS, a control drug has to be AZT. In other words, before your competitors can get on the market, they have to be able to have access to AZT to use as the control drug by which they will measure their new chemical entity. In order for anyone to do research on new, better, and cheaper AIDS drugs, they really need to have AZT to compare against. I would like to know whether you will supply NIH with the AZT they need for research on other drugs, and will you supply it to your competitors? Mr. HAIGLER. I'll ask Mr. Barry to respond to that. 15 Mr. BARRY. Yes, Mr. Chairman, we will. I think it should be pointed out, though, that your statement that AZT has to be a com- parative drug for all patients with AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex may not necessarily be true. I think it would be true in studying those forms of the illness where the patients are extremely ill, and have a very poor prognosis. I think for milder forms of disease where we, as well as others, are still in the process of establishing the effectiveness of the drug, one would not necessarily compare with our drug. Now in terms of working with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the AIDS Treatment and Evaluation Units, we already have made a significant amount of drug avail- able to them for studies and, in fact, four of the studies that are going on through those units are studies of AZT. We have already said that in working with comparative drugs, that we would be working hand in hand with them, and we would be helping develop the protocols and review the various compara- tive therapies that would be done. Mr. WAXMAN. I understand the drug that has been made avail- able to NIH has been for the question of determining what the dosage of the AZT should be. Have you provided AZT to NIH re- searchers so that they can use that as a basis to compare competi- tor drugs? Mr. BARRY. We have supplied it both to look at dosages, we have supplied it for pediatric study, to determine the effectiveness of the drug in pediatrics, and we are in the process of initiating a study in neurologic disease through the NIAID. In terms of comparison with competitor drugs, to my knowledge, there is no competitor drug available now that has shown the effec- tiveness of AZT in prior studies. I'm not clear what you're refer- ring to there. A comparative study between AZT and something else? Mr. WAXMAN. Some other pharmaceutical. Mr. BARRY. In terms of a straight comparison like that, we have not-- Mr. WAXMAN. Well, has NIH requested-- Mr. BARRY. Drug for comparative study against something else? Not to my knowledge. I think the question has come up as to whether AZT could be used in conjunction with some other com- petitor's drugs, and we have-we are in the process of making that drug available for combination studies with AZT alone, versus AZT in combination with other compounds, including acyclovir, includ- ing interferon, including a number of other potential therapies, and those discussions are ongoing. And what we have indicated is that if we see the data on other drugs that could be used in con- junction with AZT and the data appear to be valid and there is good reason to do the studies, we would go ahead and do them. But right now, with a limited supply, we cannot give a free and open supply to anyone who wishes to study our drug in conjunction with theirs. We have to make sure that the drug is being used properly. Mr. WAXMAN. So you are in the anomalous situation, with a scarcity of this drug, that you're deciding the allocation of it. And, for research purposes, you're in the position to decide to approve an application for another drug where someone wishes to use AZT 16 for comparison purposes, which would be the only basis they could go through their drug approval process. It would have to be ap- proved by you, but you have not been requested by either NIH or any other drug company to make AZT available for that purpose. Is that your testimony? Mr. BARRY. No, we have been requested by a number of groups, literally almost in the hundreds, to use our drug in combination to use our drug in connection with their particular therapy. What we have said is that we would make it available provided that the data that they have were valid in terms of giving a reason to use them together. And we have been in very active discussions about this as recently as 1 week ago-- Mr. WAXMAN. None has been agreed to yet? Mr. BARRY. We agreed to one as recently as 1 week ago, in terms of a study with AZT and interferon. Now, in terms of that-I might add also, that's not the only way-- Mr. WAXMAN. I'm going to have to ask you to respond to my question. You approved one last week. In terms of approving an- other experiment like this, is it in NIH's purview to make the de- termination, or is it in your purview to make the determination whether an experiment would be reasonable or not under the crite- ria you have discussed as the basis for allowing the drug to be used? Mr. BARRY. It would be under both of our purview. We will con- tinue to work, as we have in the past, to ensure that the clinical studies are being performed properly and in agreement, much as we have worked with NIAID for many years. I will point out, however, that this is being done at a time when we have an extremely limited drug supply. It is not the only way the drug would be obtainable after approval. And certainly there would be very easy mechanisms, if someone wanted to compare our drug in conjunction with theirs, or in contrast with theirs. Mr. WAXMAN. Well, even if the drug were approved-- Mr. BARRY. After approval. Mr. WAXMAN. Even if the drug were approved next w~ek, there still wouldn't be a sufficient supply, so the supply would be con- trolled by some allocation system that you would determine? Mr. BARRY. That is correct. There is a relatively limited supply, but as Mr. Haigler pointed out, that supply is increasing, and the precise supply is in an evolving situation, but I expect that it will loosen up a great deal. And as Mr. Haigler also mentioned, by the end of the year, we should have sufficient drug for over 30,000 pa- tients in the United States alone. Mr. WAXMAN. And the first priority is for those who otherwise would die? Mr. BARRY. The first priority is for those patients who have been shown to benefit by the drug. I will point out, however, that we have set aside a very significant amount of drug for clinical trials. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you. Mr. Madigan. Mr. MADIGAN. If I can ask you, Mr. Haigler, I'd like to try to go back for just a moment and put the AIDS problem in a bit of an international perspective. 17 I have recently been told that 9 percent of the total population on the African Continent now tests positive to AIDS antibodies. Is that consistent with information that you have? Mr. BARRY. I think that's an estimate based on sampling of popu- lations that may or may not be representative. But there is certain- ly a very large number of patients in Africa who are antibody-posi- tive, but I don't believe anyone knows what that percentage is. Mr. MADIGAN. And that the rate of this progressing through the heterosexual population on the African Continent is now roughly equal to the rate of progression in the homosexual population in the United States;-is that correct? Mr. BARRY. From the best, and at times very rough, estimates that we have, that is correct. Mr. MADIGAN. When this first became a matter of public concern in the United States in the 1981-1982 timeframe, we would read that approximately 1.0 percent of the people who tested positive to the presence of the antibodies would subsequently acquire the dis- ease. I am now told that that conversion rate is more in the range of 90 percent. Is that also a correct estimate? Mr. BARRY. It's certainly above 10 percent. I would really defer to the epidemiologists, particularly from the Centers for Disease Control, that have been looking at this to see how much above 10 percent that is, and over what period of time. Mr. MADIGAN. But with the passage of time, what we are finding is that the people who test positive to the presence of the anti- bodies with the passage of time, and because of the incubation period, a greater percentage than was originally projected are actu- ally acquiring frank AIDS; is that not fair? Mr. BARRY. That appears to be the case. Mr. MADIGAN. On page 4 of Mr. Haigler's testimony, it says, \"Some of the patients showed some objective and subjective evi- dence of improvement, including an increased sense of well-being, weight gain, and improvement in various measures of their immune system.\" I have heard of a particular case in Chicago where one of the pa- tients has actually been able to go out and go back to work. Has that happened in more than one instance? Mr. BARRY. Yes, that's happened with a number of others. Mr. MADIGAN. Is there any evidence yet as to whether or not AZT affects the ability of a person to transmit or communicate the AIDS disease? Mr. BARRY. No, there are no data to support that. What we have found in clinical studies is that evidence of viral multiplication within the body diminishes greatly when the patient is on the drug, as manifested by what's called the P-24 core antigen circulat- ing the body. However, the amount of virus in the body, which is often in a so-called latent or non-replicating state is not decreased, because the drug is effective only against multiplying viruses. So if one removes blood cells from patients who are on therapy, one can still recover virus from them. Mr. MADIGAN. With regard to our own blood supply in the United States, I'm told that in going back now and testing this blood supply, some contamination is found in blood going all the 18 way back to blood donated in 1977. Does that concur with what you understand to be the case? Mr. BARRY. Again, I'm not an expert in this area, but my under- standing that the beginning of detection of virus in the American population in a very small number of patients did date from around that period. Mr. MADIGAN. So it's possible for people to be AIDS patients today who are not homosexual, not intravenous drug users, but are merely people who at some point in time in the last 10 years were transfused; is that correct? Mr. BARRY. That is correct. Mr. MADIGAN. There is an ethical question, it seems to me, in de- termining priorities for the distribution of this drug. Since one group of potential recipients has a greater potential for the trans- mission of the disease than other groups, has there been any dis- cussion of that ethical question within your company or between your company and health officials in the United States? Mr. BARRY. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by some pa- tients having a higher potential for transmitting the virus. Mr. MADIGAN. If a homosexual patient gains weight, has an in- creased sense of well-being, improvement in various measures ofthe immune system, and as you have testified, is able to go out and go back to work, doesn't that person have a greater capacity for transmitting the disease than someone who has the disease as a result of having received a blood transfusion? Mr. BARRY. Not to my knowledge, because the amount of virus that patients have varies tremendously. It does not appear to be necessarily related to how they acquired it-certainly not be blood transfusion. There is some evidence that patients who are hemo- philiacs may have less virus than other patient populations. But there is no question that many asymptomatic patients have a very large amount of virus. I'm not quite sure of your question. Mr. MADIGAN. If one person has acquired the disease as a result of a blood transfusion and another as a consequence of sexual habits, is one more likely to refrain from sexual activity than the other? Mr. BARRY. I'm really not an expert in that area, and I just don't know. Mr. MADIGAN. I'm not questioning whether or not you're an expert. I'm questioning whether or not there has been any discus- sion of this within your company or between your company and U.S. health officials. Mr. BARRY. The only discussion we've had has been with academ- ic experts looking at the ability to culture virus from hemophiliacs versus non-hemophiliacs. But in terms of the question you've asked, it hasn't even been in that context, no. Mr. MADIGAN. Two fin.l questions. Is the present cost of this therapy comparable to the present cost for other types of therapies, such as the use of immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplants? Cyclosporin, for example. Mr. BARRY. It's roughly comparable, but I don't have a precise number. 19 Mr. MADIGAN. And finally, can you tell me how many other com- panies here and internationally are engaged presently in research and development activities on a drug similar to AZT? Do you have any information on that? Mr. BARRY. I don't have the precise number. I believe the Phar- maceutical Manufacturers Association is gathering data along those lines. Certainly, there are a very large number of companies who are working both on the chemotherapy of acquired immunode- ficiency syndrome, as well as the diagnosis and prevention of that disease. It would be in the 20 to 50 to higher range, depending on how broad one wants to be in defining what research is in that area. Mr. MADIGAN. And that would not include organizations like the Pasteur Institute in Paris, for exAmple? These would only be pro- prietary companies that you're giving us a count on? Mr. BARRY. Obviously the Pasteur Institute is working on it, but a very substantial of private pharmaceutical companies are also working in this area. Mr. MADIGAN. I have no other questions. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Madigan. Mr. Wyden, it's your time, but I'd like to ask you if you'd yield to ask one question. Mr. WYDEN. I'd be happy to yield to the chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Th ability to transmit the disease is not related to the source of infection. A likelihood to transmit or resume sexual activity obviously depends on the individual, the counseling that individual might have had, and the education about transmis- sion. Isn't that a correct statement? Mr. BARRY. Yes. Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I might start back on the point the chairman made with respect to pricing. I think your comments established that there was a lot of uncertainty about how reych it would cost the company to develop the drug and how much you might make on it. The profit picture in your mind was uncertain. My question to you then is, did the company set the price ran- domly? How did the company set the price? Mr. HAIGLER. Mr. Wyden, if I may, in arriving at the price, as I said, we looked at all of those factors of cost we knew at the time, what is was developing into in term of the research and develop- ment and production cost, what it seemed it was going to cost us to distribute the drug, taking into account the substantial financial investment that we had made. And the price wab not randomly set. It was set very carefully taking into account all of those factors. The fact that we need to generate revenues to support continuing research on this and other drugs. And at the same time taking into account the needs of the patients. Mr. WYDEN. Did Burroughs think about-- Mr. HAIGLER. We just didn't pick a number out of the air. Mr. WYDEN. Did Burroughs think of the number of Americans who are capable of paying for the drugs, when it set the price. I haven't heard you mention that? In setting the cost of AZT did the company think about all the people who can't pay. Did they factor that into the pricing structure? 20 Mr. HAIGLER. Certainly the cost of the drug was-the price of the drug itself, as I said, was determined considering a lot of factors. I think it's important to remember that drug therapy is just one ele- ment in the cost of treating AIDS. And as we said and stated, RE- TROVIR therapy does appear to substantially lower the present cost of treating AIDS patients. So we think that the drug will be cost effective, although that data is limited at the present time. Mr. WYDEN. If you considered the predicament of all the people who can't pay, could you give us an estimate of the number of people who can afford your drug? Mr. HAIGLER. I have no data on that at all, Mr. Wyden. Mr. WYDEN. Then you must not have considered all those other people. You had to have made some rough calculations, otherwise you d be pricing yourself out of the market all together. Mr. HAIGLER. We didn't make any calculations as to how many patients could or couldn't afford the drug. The matter of payment for drug therapy is, we believe, not just a concern for us alone; a concern for health authorities, too. Mr. WYDEN. We certainly agree with that. But I think the proc- ess you've described is pretty close to a process of setting the price at random. I've asked you whether you considered all these people who couldn't pay, and the limitations of the government programs. I then asked specifically if you could give us an estimate of how many people would be able to afford the drug, and you said, no. Mr. HAIGLER. I don't think-I know that we don't have the answer to that question, sir. And I don't know that anyone has the answer to that question, how meny people will not be able to afford the drug. Mr. WYDEN. Did you assume that AIDS patients are going to come up with the money? Or did you assume thF.. the government was going to come up with the money? Mr. HAIGLER. I guess we assumed that the drug, if it was an ef- fective drug, that the drug would be paid for in some manner by the patient himself out of his own pocket, or by third-party payers, whether insurance companies or by employers with insurance pro- grams, or by the public health authorities if in fact the patient himself could not pay for it. We really didn't get into a lot of calcu- lations along those lines. MV. WYDEN. How much if the bill did you think the Government might pay? It just seems to me, you are all basically doing this in the dark. I asked you a question with regard to some of the gut issues; how many people you think will be able to afford it? What are we going to do about the people who can't? It just seems to be very murky ground, and i don't get any indication that the compa- ny has made any calculations at all. Mr. HAIGLER. We certainly made calculations, as I said, about what -Costs we've had in it, our need to recover those costs, and tried to take into account the fact that it is an expensive drug. In terms of trying to determine exactly how many patients could afford to pay for this drug out of their own pockets, we really didn't get into that at all. Mr. WYDEN. I know overseas things are very different. Some have national systems and can tell a company, such as Burroughs 21 Wellcome, exactly what they are going to pay. I gather that the United States price doesn't take that into account. Mr. HAIGLER. I can't speak to what will happen overseas, Mr. Wyden. Mr. WYDEN. I didn't ask about overseas. We know what is hap- pening overseas. The United States pricing structure doesn't take what is gong on overseas into account, does it? Mr. HAIGLER. I really don't understand your question. Mr. WYDEN. Let me say it again. Overseas with the nationalized systems, the government tells the company exactly what they are going to pay. So you have a process for making these calculations. The American pricing structure doesn't take that into account, does it? Mr. HAIGLER. The American pricing structure is a free pricing structure, yes. Mr. WAXMAN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. WYDEN. Be happy to yield to the chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. The American pricing structure is based on mo- nopoly that we give to a manufacturer of a drug as an inducement to make the investments for research and development to produce new drugs. But we, nevertheless, give a patent which is a monopo- ly, and therefore, where: you decide what would be an appropriate price you're basing your decision with the knowledge that you have monopoly control over that drug. Mr. WYDEN. I just have one other question and we'll move off this pricing issue. If AZT could prevent infection from turning into full-blown AIDS, obviously a large amount of treatment costs could be saved. Does Burroughs Wellcome have any trials underway on early intervention with AZT? Mr. HAIGLER. That is a question I think Mr. Barry can answer. Mr. BARRY. We obviously have some trials continuing to go on with AIDS-related complex, ARC, and we will be initiating a study in asymptomatically infected patients in the relatively near future, within a few months. Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Wyden. Mr. Dannemeyer. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Who's responsible for the name AZT? Is that your company? Mr. BARRY. That's correct. Its name right now is, its trade name is RETROVIR, and its U.S. approved name is Idovudin. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Have you applied for a patent? Mr. BARRY. Yes, we have. Mr. DANNEMEYER. When? Mr. BARRY. I can't say exactly. I think it was about a year and-a- half ago. Mr. DANNEMEYER. And your company has the capacity to produce drugs that will treat about 30,000 people a year, right? Mr. BARRY. At present. But as Mr. Haigler emphasized, that cir- cumstance is rapidly evolving and may be improving above that. We just can't say right now. Mr. DANNEMEYER. What claims do you make for this drug? Will it cure a person with AIDS t6 make them healthy? Mr. BARRY. No, it will not cure a patient with AIDS, if by cure we mean elimination of all vestiges of the virus from their body 22 forever. What it does do is it decreases their mortality rate. That is, decreases the chance they have of dying, at least over the now nine or more-- Mr. DANNEMEYER. Wait a minute. It won't cure it. They're going to die, aren't they? Mr. BARRY. Some will. Whether all of them will die or not is dif- ficult to say because the clinical studies have been going on-the first patient received the drug in July of 1985. The clinical studies have only been going for 18 months. Mr. DANNEMEYER. You're not claiming it will cure AIDS. Mr. BARRY. That's correct. Mr. DANNEMEYER. What you're saying is it will prolong-- Mr. BARRY. It improves the quality of life of patients with AIDS and certain patients with AIDS-related complex, those who mani- festations of severe immune dysfunction. And it decreases their chance of dying, at least over the observation period, which has now been extended from 6 to greater than 9 months. And we have some patients who have been on the drug for over 18 months and are doing well. Now whether they will continue to do well, or whether all patients can tolerate the drug that well and have an improvement in their quality of life for what period of time, we don't know. And we have to continue to observe these patients. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How long have we been administering this drug to patients in this country? Mr. BARRY. Since the beginning of July of 1985. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How many patients have received it? Mr. BARRY. Over 5,000 patients have received the drug, but not beginning in July. Many of those patients are patients who have been on the treatment IND which began-investigation of new drug exemption-which began in October of 1986. But we have over 200 patients who have gone well over 9 months now on the drug. And we have a smaller number who have gone over a year. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How often is the drug taken? Mr. BARRY. The drug is taken every 4 hours. Mr. DANNEMEYEU'. Through what form? Is it orally? Mr. BARRY. It's in capsules. Two capsules every 4 hours around the clock. Mr. DANNEMEYER. And the cost per patient per year is $8,000 to $10,000? Mr. BARRY. That's correct. Mr. DANNEMEYER. I was interested when you were asked about how you projected your costs in the free enterprise that exists'in this country, you definitely dodged any revelation of the internal machinations of the pricing projection, which I think frankly, you have the right to do. I think that's proprietary information and you can charge in our system just what the market will bear. We may in our society be at a very profound public policy posi- tion given the epidemic we are facing, that from a public policy standpoint we may have to look at the way you are costing this drug which will be available to the public. Because if your patent is granted, you've got a patent on the drug that will alleviate human suffering, which the taxpayers of this country for humanitarian reasons have said publicly will be available to any person on the 23 perceived neqd of the provider independent of the ability of the re- cipient to pay as a public policy. We all know we've said that. So we're talking about $10,000 per patient per year. And the Sur- geon General has said we'll have 270,000 people with AIDS in the next 5 years. And I think that's low. That's 54,000 a year times $10,000 would be a half a billion dollars just in drug costs to take care of these people. Not to cure them, but to hopefully make a better life for them. And the nature of our system, the competitors out there are at liberty to develop a competitive drug which will render your drug, frankly, less desirable in the marketplace. We all know that. Hope- fully, they'll come up with one that will bring a little discipline to your price. That's our system. And maybe some scientist can develop a drug that, as I say, will treat this disease more effectively at a price that is more attractive to those in this country who obviously are going to have to pay for it, namely the taxpayer. How long had you been working on this drug before it began its clinical trials in July of 1985? Mr. BARRY. Approximately just under 1 year, about 9 months. Mr. DANNEMEYER. What do you know about what your competi- tors are doing? Any knowledge about that. Do the trade journals talk about it? Mr. BARRY. Well, there are certain compounds that are in Phase I or Phase II studies, and we are aware that they are in studies. We, ourselves, are continuing to look for new and better and less toxic therapies for AIDS, as are a number of other companies. Mr. DANNEMEYER. To your knowledge, have there been any other applications for patents from producers of drugs that are designed to treat persons with AIDS? Mr. BARRY. Oh, yes, a very substantial number. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How many? Mr. BARRY. I don't know the number, but a very substantial number. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How many are currently being clinically pre- scribed by medical personnel for relieving symptoms of ARC or AIDS today that you have knowledge of, besides AZT? Mr. BARRY. Well, there are none that have been shown effective in that area. There are clinical trials of at least three or four dif- ferent chemical entities and probably a variety of immune thera- pies, four or five of those. But none are being prescribed in the usual therapeutic sense for the treatment of these diseases. A large number of drugs are being used to treat the complica- tions of AIDS, such as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, CMB reti- nitis, a wide variety of other infections that these patients have. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Has your company considered the possibility of licensing the production of this drug by other companies, so that the total produced will come closer to fitting the need of society than the capacity of your company to produce? Mr. HAIGLER. If I may, Mr. Dannemeyer, I might speak to that point. We have not considered licensing. We don't think that in the case of RETROVIR that compulsory licensing would accomplish anything. 24 As regards the supply situation- Mr. DANNEMEYER. Wait just a minute, sir. I don't understand that. I'm not familiar, of course, with the production of a drug, but other drug companies, I suspect, are, and if your capacity only per- mits you to produce enough to service 30,000 patients a year, and we're going to have more patients than that in the United States and probably worldwide, doesn't it appear prudent, from a public policy standpoint, to be thinking about making other productive ca- pacities of drug companies in America able to produce this drug as well. Mr. HAIGLER. The supply situation, as we said, is improving rap- idly. We expect it to substantially resolve itself in the near future. As far as the ability of anyone else to get to a very high level of production capacity for this particular drug before we have re- solved the situation ourselves, I don't know that, but I would doubtit. I just don't think that compulsory licensing in this particular case would improve the supply situation. Mr. DANNEMEYER. What s the problem in terms of producing more? Is it a lack of supply or a lack of capacity to assimilate-- Mr. HAIGLER. It's a matter of having had to, in the matter of just a couple years time, go from a point of practically no material at all being produced anywhere, except in grams for laboratory pur- poses, to where we are today, producing tons and tons of the mate- rial and having to gear up our production facilities and production capacity to be able to produce these tons of material in those quan- tities. Usually that takes a pretty good while. Mr. WYDEN. Would the gentleman yield? Mr. DANNEMEYER. I sense from what you're saying-go ahead. Mr. WYDEN. Well, the gentleman has touched on an important area. I'm just very curious as to what will happen when the next drug comes along. What will the policy be for handling that? Mr. HAIGLER. You mean a drug from us? Or a drug from some- one else? Mr. WYDEN. You, or someone else. Mr. HAIGLER. Whose policy? Mr. WYDEN. Well, I think it's really the Government's policy. This is such a vague area that you just wonder how the next one is going to be handled. Mr. HAIGLER. Well, I can't speak to the next one. I can just say that we do believe that the supply situation is evolving very rapid- ly, and very shortly we're going to be-we'll have that resolved. Mr. WYDEN. I thank the gentleman. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Dannemeyer. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Sikorski. Mr. SIKORSKI. Just a couple of questions. Earlier you said that the pricing mechanism was a reflection of a host of things-return on investment, production cost, R&D. Then as I understand it, analysis of R&D was fuzzy. You couldn't identify the R&D cost. And then Mr. Wyden was told that you used R&D costs as the basis for price again. How can you use them if you don't know them, if they can't be rationally segregated out? 25 Mr. BARRY. Well, I wanted to emphasize that the research costs are great, but the precise costs would be considered proprietary in- formation. But I was making the point that the cost of clinical trials, which I believe that the chairman was referring to, was not significantly less than the clinical trials for most any other drug, because of the extreme expense in studying these patients. We accelerated clinical trials, and we had a limited number, but it didn't lower our costs significantly. It merely compressed them into a shorter timeframe. Mr. SIKORSKI. Let me understand this. You know the R&D costs. They're defined. They're just not available to us in this kind of forum because of your proprietary concerns. Mr. BARRY. That's correct. Mr. SIKORSKi. What would you say to the cynics who would say that your pricing is a reflection of an exclusive market, an analysis of the short-term nature of that market, and \"get while the getting is good?\" Mr. BARRY. I think I'd say they were wrong. The costs that we have are a reflection of all the multitude of factors that Mr. Haigler listed, not only the cost of research and development, the cost of raw material, the expense of scaling up, capital investment, and in particular the uncertainty of the future-that is, how long will this drug be considered to be the drug of choice or even prefer- able for any of the patients infected? Mr. SIKORSKI. Have you focused-this drug is not without some severe, serious side effects; is that correct? Mr. BARRY. That is correct. A number of the patients who receive the drug, particularly those who have very poor bone marrow func- tions before they receive it, have a depression in that marrow func- tion, which is manifested by a significant anemia and at times what's called a granulocytopenia-that is, a lowered number of white cells. Mr. SIKORSKI. There are some toxic effects other than bone marrow suppression, aren't there? Mr. BARRY. Those are the primary toxic effects. There have been some reports of patients who have had headache and nausea and so oa. -Those tend to be much milder and much more difficult to dif- ferentiate from the baseline symptoms that many of these patients have. Mr. SIKORSKI. Thank you. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Sikorski. To put this thing in perspective, I do want to go back to where I started, and that's that you have done an outstanding job in pro- ducing this drug. It has been desperately needed. You've taken the risk. You've made the investments, and now you have a drug that means life or death for a certain period of time for many, many AIDS patients. But in setting your price for that drug, you have the ability to set it under a framework where you recognize you have a monopo- ly over that drug. So you could figure to recoup your research and development investment and all your other investments, and to get a profit on top of that-you're entitled to it. The question is: What is an adequate profit when you've got a drug that, if you set it at a price that's going to be too high, some 26 people are going to have to, by the nature of economics, go without this lifesaving drug? And I gather from the atiswer to questions from Mr. Wyden, while you had many conside:ations that you took note of in setting your price, one was not the ability of the atient to pay. Your ex- pectatio.a was that those people who wanted to buy this drug will come up with the money, and if government couldn't abide by the idea of people going without the drug because it meant death to those people who couldn't afford it, that the Government would step in. Well, that offers a real dilemma to us. In the hospital sector, we have DRGs where we have said to the hospital, \"This is what we think is reasonable for you to get paid,\" and we established the amount. In other areas where we have monopoly control over a service or a product, Government has stepped in as well and established what would be a reasonable return on the investment. We can't second-guess your evaluation of a reasonable return on your investment, since you're not telling us what your investment was. But then even if you did tell us what your investment might be, you have the other factors which you appropriately raise: What is the future marketability of this drug, other competitors, et cetera. I don't want to be critical of you, because you're operating within the system that you didn't create, and you're benefitting from it, and you've done well for society in producing this drug. But it highlights the dilemma for us. Mr. Dannemeyer said that the drug would be paid for. I guess with our next series of witnesses, we're going to try to determine whether that's the case, whether the drug will be paid for, because otherwise the reality will be that those who can't pay for it will go without. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. Chairman, could I just ask one other question on the pricing matter? Mr. WAXMAN. Sure. Mr. WYDEN. You know, again, I think the chairman has stated my concerns very well. But let me try another approach with re- spect to this pricing issue. Why didn't you set the price at $100,000 per patient? Mr. HAIGLER. Well, I think that-you know. How can I answer that question? I think that would have been completely out of the realm of anything reasonable at all. We had to set the price at a reasonable level, and I would like to say also, in rebuttal to your statement about the needs of patients, we have taken into account, we think, the very real needs of the patients for whom this drug was developed. We've had a great concern about this. Our people at Burroughs Wellcome Co. pride themselves on pro- ducing drugs that will help alleviating illness and provide a better life to those people who have medical problems. And I think one of the prides that we have here is being able to produce this drug that s going to help a lot of people. So I do think the needs of these patients were very carefully con- sidered. In terms of trying to, in our own system within our own 27 company, decide on how many patients could or couldn't afford the drug, we had no way of determining that. We are trying to set the price based on what we think is a rea- sonable price for this drug that is shown to be effective for this par- ticular disease. Mr. WYDEN. The chairman needs to move on. I must tell you, I'm still unclear about how you arrived at $10,000, rather than $30,000 or $25,000. I appreciate your feeling that $100,000 is unfair. But I must tell you that I think the pricing system is close to a random system. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Wyden. Gentlemen, we appreciate your testimony, and I think you sum. marized your position well in your last statement. I appreciate it. Mr. HAIGLER. Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. WAXMAN. For our next witnesses, we wish to call forward Dr. Robert Windom, Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Health and Human Services, and Dr. William Roper, Administra- tor of the Health Care Financing Administration, Department of Health and Human Services. Let me at this time ask unanimous consent that all members be permitted to insert an opening statement at the appropriate point in the record. Without objection that will be the order. Dr. Windom and Dr. Roper, we want to welcome you to our sub- committee hearing this morning. Your prepared statements will be made part of the record in full, and we'd like to ask you if you each would summarize in around 5 minutes. STATEMENTS OF ROBERT E. WINDOM, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH, PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; AND WILLIAM L. ROPER, AD- MINISTRATOR, HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION Mr. WINDOM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. Dr. Roper and one that is very much I are here to discuss AZT, azidothymidine, which is an experimental drug which has proven to be of value in the treatment of certain patients with AIDS, ac- quired immune deficiency syndrome. With me today are Mr. Lowell Harvison, Deputy Assistant Secre- tary for Health; Dr. Maureen Myers, Chief of the Treatment Branch of the AIDS Program at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Bruce Chabnor, who is Director of the Division of Cancer Treatment at the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. Gary Noble, who is the AIDS Coordinator for the Public Health Service. With your permission, then, I would like to have my entire state- ment submitted for the record, and I will give you a summary. To date, 31,982 AIDS cases have been reported in this country with some 18,462 deaths. We estimate that 1 million to 1.5 million moie Americans are infected by the AIDS virus. 28 Remarkable progress has been made in research on AIDS. Still, as we've heard before, we have no effective cure, and general avail- ability of an effective AIDS vaccine is some years in the future. I would like to highlight the elements of the PHS Drug Develop- ment Program. We have developed a special process to supplement the normal, private-sector drug development system. It is a collabo- rative program of the NIAID and the NCI established in 1986 to identify potentially effective and therapeutic agents and move them carefully and systematically through a process which will make them available to the public both quickly and responsibly. Two committees have been established by the Public Health Service to guide the drug selection process at the National Insti-tutes of Health. After candidate drugs are identified, they must be produced in large quantities and distributed to investigators for preclinical and eventually for clinical testing. Scale-up production and animal studies of toxicology, pharmacol- ogy, and bioavailability are performed on candidate drugs, undercontract, for AIDS prior to initiating clinical studies in man. Once animal studies have identified a dose with potentially acceptable .toxicity, then initial small clinical studies can begin in patients. Once a drug is approved for use in patients, it may be evaluatedin the NIAID-funded Aids Treatment Evaluation Units, ATEU's, for Phase I and II clinical trials of candidate therapeutic agents at medical centers throughout the Nation. An AIDS Clinical Trial Coordinating Center was created to permit centralized data analysis for these geographically dispersedunits and to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Data from controlled clinical trials conducted in these units are evaluat- ed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. This oversight allows the early termination of a trial due either to effi- cacy or unanticipated toxicity. The attached chart outlines key events that have led up to where we are today with AZT, to your left. It also is with the presentation. The first phase of human testing for AZT was conducted from July to December 1985 at the NCI and Duke University. Becauseresults of these very limited trials were promising, Burroughs Well- come began a Phase II controlled clinical trial in February of 1986.This study was designed to test the drug's safety and effectiveness in persons with AIDS who had an episode of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, known as PCP, and in selected persons with advanced ARC. On September 10, 1986, the Data and Safety Monitoring Boardreviewed preliminary data from this study. These data showed a significant difference in survival between patients who had re- ceived AZT versus those who had received placebo. The data also showed that the group receiving AZT had a decreased number of significant AIDS-related medical complications, including opportun- istic infection, compared to the placebo group. One week later, the Board conducted a more in-depth review ofthe data and recommended that the placebo arm of the Phase II trial be terminated. During this time, I convened meetings of our senior Public Health Service officials in order to independently assess develop- ments on the latest AZT data and their implications for wider dis- 29 tribution of the drug. The NIH and FDA officials met with the offi-cials of Burroughs Wellcome to develop a proposal for a coordinat- ed approach to distribute AZT. On September 19 of 1986 I held a joint press conference withBurroughs Wellcome to announce that all patients who were cur- rently in the phase 2 trial would receive AZT. In addition, AZT would be made available to certain AIDS patients under a compa- ny-sponsored IND. Not only had FDA moved with great speed togrant AZT treatment IND status, the agency also waived the usual local institutional review board requirement as part of an overall effort to move without delay. An 800 number hotline was established at NIH for AZT informa- tion and distribution. A center managed by NIAID was established for the registration of patients and their pharmacists and physi- cians for AZT treatment, for the receipt and evaluation of applica-tions for use of the drug, and for the monitoring of laboratory datagenerated from patients receiving the drug. All this happened in less than 2 weeks. On February 16, 1987 Burroughs Wellcome Co. assumed fromNIAID full responsibility for coordinating the AZT treatment IND. From September to February, under that treatment IND 4,228 pa-tients and 2,112 physicians were registered, 919 pharmacists were registered, and 35,200 hotline calls had been answered. NIH scientists have continued to study AZT in AIDS patients. Clinical trials are now in progress to test the drug's safety and po-tential efficacy in AIDS patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, pediatric AIDS patients and AIDS patients with dementia and other related neurological disorders. It is worth stressing the AZT again is only a first step. AZT has significant toxicity in some patients, particularly in those with anemia and depressed white blood cells. Patients with advanced disease seem to be at greatest risk for these side effects. Therefore, we are continuing our antiretroviral drug developmentprogram, and in the future we can expect a number of new thera- peutic strategies to Fmerge. Now I want to highlight the steps the PHS has taken to make AZT available to AIDS patients. In September of 1986 the FDA es-tablished what we call a 1AA classification system for potentially useful drugs for AIDS. Assigning them the highest priority assures expedited review. In December of 1986 Burroughs Wellcome Co. submitted to FDA a new drug application for AZT. On January 16 of this year the application was reviewed by an FDA advisory committee. The com-mittee recommended approval of AZT for AIDS patients with cer- tain opportunistic infections and for certain patients with advanced ARC. The committee further recommended extensive post-approval patient monitoring and reporting by the drug's manufacturer and approved of the company's intent to develop a system for controlled distribution of the drug. As we move ahead with final approval decisions for AZT, all of these appropriate scientific issues must be waived and analyzed ex- peditiously. We are all aware of the important ramifications of the approval action. It's direct effects on the health of patients, its major implications for the testing and evaluation of other drugs for 72-6-5 -88 -2 30 the treatment of AIDS, and perhaps more indirectly the precedents that they may set for the development, evaluation and approval of other drugs for the treatment of AIDS. This is a very devastating disease, and I pledge to you that the Public Health Service remains committed to our efforts to alleviate the suffering and death it causes. This completes my statement, Mr. Chairman. And I'll be glad to answer questions after Dr. Roper has submitted his. [The prepared statement of Mr. Windom follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT E. WINDOM, M.D. Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, Dr. Roper and I are here to discuss AZT (azidothymidine), an experimental drug which has proven to be of value in the treatment of certain patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). To date, 31,982 AIDS cases have been reported in this country, with some 18,462 deaths. We estimate that 1 million to 1.5 million more Americans are infected by the AIDS virus and can spread it to others, even though they may currently show no signs of illness. Present data indicate that approximately 20 to 30 percent of these persons can be expected to develop AIDS itself within the next 5 years. Remarkable progress has been made in research on AIDS, including identification of the AIDS virus; ensuring the protection of the blood supply and clotting factors used by hemophiliacs; subsequent identification of AZT, an agent which has been shown to prolong the life of a select group of AIDS patients; initiation of clinical trials; and development of public health guidelines. Still, we have no effective cure, and general availability of an effective AIDS vaccine is some years in the future. DRUG DEVELOPMENT Before proceeding with a discussion of AZT, I would like to review the elements of the PHS drug development program. Because of the importance that the PHS places on AIDS, we have developed a special process to supplement the normal private sector drug developmnt system. It is a collaborative program of the National Insti- tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) established in 1986 to identify potentially effective therapeutic agents and move them carefully and systematically through a process which will make them available to the public both quickly and responsibly. Two committees have been established by the PHS to guide the drug selection process at the NIH. The NCI has the lead responsibility for the Preclinical Drug Decision Network Committee. This committee is responsible for developing effective agents against the AIDS virus; evaluating the antiretroviral activity of candidate agents from screening programs, drug development programs and other sources; and, bring candidate agents through appropriate preclinical evaluation and develop- ment. The NIAID has the lead responsibility for the AIDS Clinical Drug Development Committee. The objectives of this committee are to review and evaluate candidate agents or therapies to control HIV infections, opportunistic infections and malignan- cies and to reconstitute the immune system. Candidate agents approved by this com- mittee are recommended to the NIAID for clinical evaluation in the AIDS Treat- ment Evaluation Units (ATEU's). After candidate drugs are identified, they must be produced in large quantities and distributed to investigators for preclinical and eventually for clinical testing. This has been done through augmentation of existing NCI contracts that currently produce and formulate anti-cancer drugs. Scale-up, toxicology, pharmacology, and bioavailability studies on candidate drugs are performed under contract in animals to test drugs for AIDS prior to initiating clinical studies in man. These preclinical studies are expensive and logistically com- plex operations. Once animal studies have identified a dose wth potentially acceptable toxicity then initial small clinical studies can begin in patients. AIDS TREATMENT EVALUATION UNITS Once a drug is approved for use in patients, it may be evaluated in NIAID-funded ATEU's at medical facilities around the country. These units perform multi-cen- 31 tered Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of candidate therapeutic agents throughout the United States. Phase I trials are intended to carefully assess the safety of the drug and to determine any phaymacologic effects that can be monitored. The number of patients entered into these pilot trials is necessarily limited until the ini- tial assessment of toxicity is determined. As data are accumulated, studies are gradually expanded in scope and size to obtain safety and efficacy data. Phase II consists of controlled clinical trials designed to demonstrate the effectiveness and relative safety of a drug. Normally, these are performed on closely monitored pa- tients of a limited number-seldom will the number go beyond 100 to 200 patients. An AIDS Clinical Trial Coordinating Center was created to permit centralized data analysis for these geographically dispersed units and assure compliance with regulatory requirements. Data from controlled clinical trials conducted in the units, are evaluated by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). This Board composed of scientists, statisticians and ethicists, periodically review data from ongoing trials. Th's oversight allows the early termination of a trial due to either unanticipated efficacy or toxicity. CHRONOLOGY OF TESTING AZT At this time, let me take a few moments to review key events that have led us to where we are today with AZT (see attachment). In 1964, a 3'-azidothymidine was snthesized at the Detroit Institute for Cancer Research (now the Michigan Cancer Foundation) under the support of an NCI grant to discover new anti-cancer agents. The drug did not show appreciable activity as an antitumor agent and was subse- quently shelved. In 1974, it was noted that AZT was active against the Friend erythroleukemia virus (a retrovirus) in a cell culture system. This observation was not pursued, be- cause retroviruses were not known to exist in humans. For the next decade, Bur- roughs Wellcome manufactured AZT for non-human applications. In February 1985, the NIC, under the direction of Dr. Samuel Broder, tested AZT and found that it was a potent inhibitor of HTLV-Il in vitro. Burroughs Wellcome then entered into a commitment with the NCI to pursue the clinical development of AZT, and the company assumed the responsibility of doing the necessary animal toxicology. The NCI assisted by providing starting stocks of raw materials (thymi- dine) for manufacturing the drug. The in vitro data demonstrated the activity of AZT against multiple strains of human HTLV-IlI, and defined a range of in vitro dosing. In June, 1985, an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) was issued to the NCI to begin Phase I testing in patients, and on July 3, 1985, the first AIDS patient received AZT in the NIH Clinical Center. Additional patients were enrolled at both Duke University and the Nci shortly thereafter. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also has provided assistance to the drug's developers through the Agency's Orphan Product Development Program. This promotes promising new drugs and biologics for relatively rare diseases includ- ing AIDS, by providing their manufacturers with the opportunity to receive tax in- centives, grants, and exclusive seven-year marketing protection. AZT was awarded Orphan Drug status by FDA in July 1985. RESULTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS OF AZT The first phase of human testing for AZT, involving only 33 patients with AIDS and AIDS-related Complex (ARC), was conducted from July to December 1985 at the NCI and Duke University. The studies showed that the drug was well absorbed after oral administration. It was also determined that AZT does cross the blood brain bar- rier. This is important because involvement of the central nervous system is common in patients with HIV infection. The patients enrolled in the Phase I studies continue to be followed for evidence of toxicity, and for evidence of the effect of the agent on the eventual outcome of the disease. The longest period of patient observa- tion has now reached 18 months. Because results of these very limited trials were promising, Burroughs Wellcome began a Phase 11 controlled clinical trial in February 1986. This study was designed to test the drug's safety and effectiveness in persor- with AIDS who had an episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and in selected persons with advanced ARC. Close to 300 patients were involved in the company sponsored multicenter trial, which was a randomized comparison of AZT and placebo. Prior to starting this study, the company asked the NIH to establish a DSMB to perform periodic analysis of safety and efficacy. 32 On September 10, 1986, the DSMB reviewed preliminary data from the study. These data showed a significant difference in survival between patients who had re- ceived AZT versus those who had received placebo. The data slso showed that the group receiving AZT had a decreased number of significant AIDS-related medical complications, including opportunistic infections, compared to the placebo group. This was true of both patients with AIDS and certain advanced ARC patients. In addition, weight gain and improvements in daily activities, as well as improvements in immune function noted during the Phase I studies were confirmed. One week later, the DSMB conducted a more in-depth review of the data and recommended that the placebo arm of the Phase II trial be termin ted. During this time, I convened meetings of senior PHS officials in order to inde- pendently assess developments on the latest AZT data and its implications for wider distribution of the drug. NIH and FDA officials met with officials from Burroughs Wellcome to develop a proposal for a coordinated approach to distribute AZT under a Treatment IND. On September 18, led by Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of NIAID, with the assist- ance of Dr. Daniel Hoth of the NCI, and officials from PHS and Burroughs Well- come met to discuss issues of availability, distribution, and cost of AZT. In a very short time, we had devised an efficient and equitable system for the distribution of AZT. On September 19, I held a joint press conference with Burroughs Wellcome to an- nounce that all patients in the Phase II trial would receive AZT. Further AZT would be made available to certain AIDS patients under a company sponsored, Treatment IND. Not only had FDA moved with great speed to grant AZT Treatment IND status, the Agency also waived the usual local Institutional Review Board (IRB) require- ment as part of an overall effort to move without delay and because an adequate alternative mechanism existed for protecting those receiving AZT under this Treat- ment IND. The Burroughs Wellcome Company and NIH immediately collaborated in setting up an AZT Treatment IND Coordinating Center which was responsible for the distribution mechanism for making AZT available to eligible persons under the treatment IND. An 800-number \"hotline\" was established by NIH for AZT informa- tion and distribution. A government contract was used to establish a center man- aged by NIAID for the registration of patients and their pharmacists and physicians for AZT treatment, for the receipt and evaluation of applications for use of the drug, and for the monitoring of laboratory data generated from patients receiving AZT. All this happened in less than two weeks. On February 16, 1987, the Burroughs Wellcome Company assumed from NIAID full responsibility for coordinating the AZT Treatment IND. From September to February under the Treatment IND: 4,228 patients and 2,112 physicians were regis- tered; 919 pharmacists were registered; and, 35,200 hotline phone calls were an- swered. RESEARCH NIH scientists have continued to study AZT in AIDS patients. Clinical trials are now in progress to test the dru 's safety and potential efficacy in: -AIDS patients with Kaposi s sarcoma; -pediatric AIDS patients; and, -AIDS patients with dementia and other r lated neurological disorders. A great deal of effort is directed at finding new dose regimens or new combina- tions of anti-retroviral drugs (as well as combinations of retroviral drugs plus im- munomodulators). The purpose of this effort is to develop regimers that reduce the toxicity of the drug without impairing its ability to benefit patients. It is worth stressing that AZT is only a first step. AZT has significant toxicity in some patients, particularly in those with anemia and depressed white blood cells. Patients with advanced disease seem to be at greatest risk for these side effects. We are continuing our anti-retroviral drug development program, and in the future, we can expect a number of new therapeutic strategies to emerge. STEPS TOWARD MARKETING APPROVAL Finally, let me bring you up-to-date on the steps PHS has taken to make AZT available to AIDS patients. In September 1986, the FDA established a 1 AA classify. cation system for potentially useful drugs for AIDS. This 1 AA classification assures the drug of an expedited review by assigning it the hi hest priority in FDA's drug reviewing divisions. In December 1986, the Burroughs Wellcome company submit to FDA a New Drug Application (NDA) for AZT, and on January 16 of this year, the 33 application was reviewed by an FDA Advisory Committee. Based on the data from the controlled clinical trial which showed that 19 of 137 patients on placebo had died compared to only one of 145 patients on AZT, the Committee recommended ap- proval of AZT for AIDS patients with certain opportunistic infections and for cer- tain patients with advanced ARC. The Committee further recommended extensive postapproval patient monitoring and reporting by the drug's manufacturer in order to resolve important questions about the efficacy of prolonged use and possible adverse effects associated with AZT's long-term use. The Committee also approved of the company's intent to devel- op a system for controlled distribution of the drug. The FDA is reviewing and analyzing the data collected on patients who were en- rolled in the open-label continuation of the study in addition to the data from the placebo-controlled trial. They must decide on the basis of all this information which patients have been demonstrated to benefit from AZT despite its toxicity, and in which groups of patients further studies are needed to determine the risk-benefit ratio. While AZT appears, in the short-term, to be beneficial, the studies have shown that it, like many active antiviral drugs, has significant side effects. it causes anemia severe enough to require transfusions and depresses the white blood cell count in many individuals. This is a reminder that it is necessary to assess the risks of such a drug very carefully, as well as its potential benefits. As we move ahead with final approval decisions for AZT, all of these appropriate scientific issues must be weighed and analyzed expeditiously. We are all aware of the important ramifications of the approval action: its direct effects on the health of patients, its major implications for the testing and evaluation of other drugs for the treatment of AIDS, and perhaps more indirectly the precedents that may be set for the development, evaluation, and approval of other drugs for the treatment of AIDS. This is a devastating disease and I pledge to you that the Public Health Service re- mains committed in our efforts to alleviate the suffering and death it causes. The issues involved in development of AZT-under conditions of tremendous public pressure-have been extremely complex and have presented enormous chal- lenges to regulators and scientists, both outside and within government. During this time, our utmost concern has been the relief of AIDS patients but we have had to balance compassion for those who suffer from this dread disease with the very im- portant public health issues of drug safety and effectiveness. This completes my statement, Mr. Chairman. I wili be glad to answer questions that you or your subcommittee members may have after Dr. Roper completes his statement.

STATEMENT OF WILLIAM L. ROPER Mr. RoPER. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the com- mittee. I'm pleased to be here today to talk about Medicare and Medicaid as they relate to AZT. We estimate that about 40 percent of current AIDS patients are being served by the Medicaid pro- gram, and about 1 percent of AIDS patients by Medicare. The Fed- 34 eral and State governments through the Medicaid program will spend more than $400 million on AIDS patients this year. Primari- ly because of the disability waiting period, spending under the Medicare program is currently estimated to be under $50 million a year. Most AIDS patients who qualify for Medicaid do so by meeting the disability requirement under the supplemental security income, or SSI program. Social Security Administration has made it possi- ble for persons with AIDS to qualify for SSI almost immediately under the presumptive disability provisions. Also AIDS patients frequently can become eligible for Medicaid benefits as medically needy individuals through the spenddown process. Thirty-five States provide this option. Medicare is available to disabled persons under 65 who have re- ceived Social Security disability benefits for 24 months. Since cash benefits for disability income eligibles do not begin until almost 6 months after the onset of the disability, a disabled person with AIDS would not be eligible for Medicare for almost 30 months. This waiting period certainly limits the coverage of AIDS patients under Medicare. Under Medicaid the full range of regularly provided Medicaid services in a State are available to the AIDS patient. States have substantial flexibility to choose to cover a number of additional benefits which could assist the typical AIDS patient, such as hos- pice care and personal care. In addition, States may also imple- ment innovative health care delivery alternatives through the home and community based waiver services program. As you know, a provision of OBRA-86 set up a special waiver pro- gram for AIDS waivers, and we have approved earlier this year such a waiver for the State of New Jersey. Prescription drugs are an optional benefit under State Medicaid programs. Every State but two has elected to offer drugs to the cat- egorically needy. Thirty-five States provide a drug benefit for the medically needy category as well. HCFA will reimburse the States for any drugs, including experimental drugs which are provided ac- cording to Federal guidelines, except those that have been deter- mined by the FDA to be less than effective. Under the Medicare program, the only circumstances under which we will pay for drugs are when they are provided on an in- patient basis or incident to a physician's services. In other words, Medicare does not pay for out-patient, self-administered drugs in- cluding AZT. In order to provide advance notice of the availability of AZT to our State Medicaid agencies we issued a program memorandum to alert the States that FDA approval of the drug AZT is likely in the near future. This information allows the States to begin immediate- ly to revise their State fornmularies to include AZT if they choose to d so. We have promised to inform the States of any significant change in the status of AZT. You've heard testimony that the estimate by Burroughs Well- come is that the cost of AZT will be $8,000 to $10,000 per year per patient. Determining the cost of AZT to the Medicaid program is extremely difficult and involves a number of assumption that could change. For one thing, we don't know at this time whether the 35 drug will be prescribed for all AIDS patients, or even all AIDS and ARC patients. We don't know if AZT can be produced in significant quantities to meet anticipated demand. Given the limited information available, HCFA believes that the costs to the Medicaid program of AZT itself, not counting the cost of treating side effects as well as potential savings from reducing the number and severity of acute spells of illness could range up to $50 million this year if the drug is approved by April 1. Costs for 1988 under similar assumptions could reach $150 million. These costs would be shared approximately equally by the States and the Federal Government. As the agency responsible for financing the Medicare and Medic- aid programs, we've worked closely with Assistant Secretary Windom, the Surgeon General, the Public Health Service to make sure we are maximally coordinating our efforts in responding to the AIDS crisis. HCFA is committed as an agency to ensuring that appropriate care and services are delivered to AIDS patients. In partnership with the States, the Department and HCFA will con- tinue to address and respond to the treatment of patients with this ve y serious disease. I d be pleased to respond to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Roper follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM L. ROPER, M.D. Mr. Chairman, I am Dr. William L. Roper, Administrator of the Health Care Fi- nancing Administration. I am pleased to be here today to discuss Medicaid and Med- icare payment for he AIDS-treatment drug AZT. Mr. Chairman, as you know, AIDS is one of the priority items on the Secretary's agenda. I want to asSure you that Doctor Bowen and I have discussed at length the seriousness of this tragic disease and the hope of soon finding an appropriate treatment and cure. BACKGROUND I would like first of all to provide a brief overview of how AIDS patients qualify under the Medicaid and Medicare programs. Based on information gathered from hospitals treating Medicaid patients and data on AIDS-related disability awares, we estimate that about 40 percent of AIDS patients are served by the Medicaid pro- gram and about 1 percent are receiving care under the Medicare program. it has been estimated that the Federal and State governments, through the Medicaid pro- gram, will spend from $400 to $800 million on AIDS patients this year. Primarily because of the disability waiting period, spending under the Medicare program is currently estimated to be under $50 million annually. It should be noted that these estimates do not include the impact of the drug AZT, about which I will say more later. MEDICAID Most AIDS patients qualify for Medicaid by meeting the disability requirement under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. In the early stages of AIDS, most patients have resources, incomes, or health insurance coverage. As the disease progresses, most patients become unable to work and, as a result, lose income and resources. At this point, they often turn to SSI to seek qualification based on disability which, in most cases, would make them eligible for Medicaid. Those who might not qualify are in the 4 States which, when the SSI program was enacted, were allowed to use the more restrictive qualifying criteria from their pre- vious Aged, Blind, ad Disabled programs. Congress provided this option based upon the fear that States would face an overwhelming Medicaid caseload because of their eligibility under SSI. In February 1985, SSA made it easier for persons with AIDS to qualify for SSI under the presumptive disability provision. This allows the applicant to qualify for benefits almost immediately by reducing the waiting time between applying for and receiving benefits. 36 Even if persons with AIDS do not qualify initially for cash assistance benefits under SSI, they frequently can become eligible for Medicaid benefits as medically needy individuals through the \"Spenddown\" process. People with incomes and re- sources above the Medicaid limits who have incurred substantial medical expenses can have those expenses subtracted from their income level, thus bringing them below the Medicaid limits. Currently, 32 States have a medically needy program covering the aged, blind, and disabled; an additional five States have this program for pregnant women and children. In addition to SSI and medically needy coverage, another avenue of assistance for the AIDS patients is qualifi',ation for Medicaid coverage through eligibility for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. The individual may be a child with AIDS whose mother had contracted the disease through drug abuse, as well as the mother herself if she qualifies for AFDC. In states which have an AFDC-Unem- ployed Parent program, the AIDS patient could be, for example, the unemployed parent provided that that household met the program's qualifying criteria. MEDICARE Medicare is available to disabled persons under 65 who have received Social Secu- rity disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act for 24 consecutive months. The disability criteria under Titles II and XVI are the same. However, unlike SSI, cash benefits for all Title II eligibles do not begin until six months after the onset of the disability. After the \"24-month waiting period\" iActually in most cases almost 30 months), a disabled person with AIDS would be eligible for both part A (Hospital Insurance) and part B (Supplemental Medical Insurance) of Medi- care. Because of the relatively rapid and fatal course of AIDS, only a very small percentage of individuals with AIDS can receive benefits under the Medicare pro- gram. SERVICES AVAILABLE UNDER MEDICAID The scope of covered benefits under Medicaid varies considerably from State to State. All States, however, must cover certain mandatory services for almost all SSI and AFDC recipients. AIDS patients who are Medicaid-eligible receive services through hospitals, outpatient departments, physicians' offices, rural health clinics, laboratory and radiology settings, and skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies for those who are 21 years of age and older. States may choose to cover certain additional benefits which could assist the typi- cal AIDS patient. Some examples include clinic services, prescribed drugs, interme- diate care facilities services, miscellaneous diagnostic services, and skilled nursing facility care and home health care services for individuals under 21 years of age. Other ancillary services such as personal care, private duty nursing, and rehabilita- tion services are also optional benefits. States are also permitted to cover hospice services under their Medicaid pro- grams. The Medicaid hospice benefit stresses home care, which provides an alterna- tive to institutional settings and allows AIDS patients another choice for receipt of their care. New York has already designated one hospital as an AIDS center and expects to approve eight more. These hospitals will be required to provide a continu- um of care, including hospice, nursing home, and inpatient care. New York has sub- mitted a State Plan Amendment to HCFA to cover the hospice benefit under its Medicaid program. We are now in the process of evaluating the additional informa- tion that New York has supplied. States also have the ability to implement innovative, health care delivery alterna- tives through the home- and community-based waiver services program. This pro- gram gives State Medicaid programs the opportunity to pay for a wide range of care delivered at home and in the community for those who might otherwise be institu- tionalized. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-509) allows States to target their home- and community-based services waiver to AIDS and ARC (AIDS-related complex) patients. On January 8th of this year, we approved the first AIDS-targeted waiver to the State of New Jersey Medicaid agency so that it might provide home treatment for patients with AIDS and ARC. New Jersey can now provide services under this home- and community-based waiver program such as personal care, medical day care, narcotic and drug abuse treatment, private duty nursing care, and intensive foster care for pediatric patients. The three-year waiver was effective March 1 and can be renewed. New Jersey has the fifth largest populaion of persons with AIDS and expects to treat 578 Medicaid-eligible AIDS patients in the first year of the waiver, at a cost of about $11 million or $18,996 per patient. The State projects that 37 it will serve 990 patients at a cost of $20 million or $20,554 per individual in the second year, and, in the third year, 1650 patients at a cost of $36.6 million or $22,238 per individual. Based upon New Jersey's projections, the average rate of growth for total costs would be 82.4 percent. New Mexico has also requested a home- and community-based services waiver for AIDS patients. In order to assist the State in bringing its request into conformance with statutory and regulatory requirements, we formally requested additional infor- mation regarding the proposal. Our Dallas Regional Office worked closely with the State in an effort to develop the information necssary for the waiver to be approved. We have just received the additional information, which we are in the process of evaluating. Clearly, States have the flexibility to provide a wide range of additional services. The States with the highest number of AIDS cases, California and New York, which have recorded approximately 53 percent of all reported AIDS cases in the United States, provide numerous additional optional service, respectively, to their Medic- aid populations. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Prescription drugs are also an optional benefit under State Medicaid programs. Every State, except for Alaska and Wyoming, has elected to offer drugs to the cate- gorically needy. Thirty-five State programs provide a drug benefit for the medically needy category as well. States may limit the number of drugs covered and the amount and scope of the benefit, for example, by restricting drug coverage to so many drug prescriptions per month. Eighteen States require copayments on pre- scriptions. A State determines, with the advice of medical consultants, which experi- mental drugs, if any, it chooses to cover under its Medicaid program. HCFA will match States' payments for any drugs, including experimental drugs, which are pro- vided according to Federal guidelines, except those that have been determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be less-than-effective. The Medicare program will pay for drugs when provided on an inpatient basis or incident to a physician's service. Drugs generally are not covered under Medicare when provided on an outpatient self-administered basis. In addition, Medicare does not cover experimental drugs, which are those not approved by the FDA for market- ing. AZT (AZIDOTHYMIDINE/RETROVIR) The drug AZT has demonstrated some success in prolonging survival among cer- tain AIDS patients. Burroughs Wellcome, the manufacturer of AZT, now provides the drug free to the more than 4,000 patients participating in the Irvestigational New Drug clincial trials. The drug is now awaiting final approval by the Food and Drug Administration in order that it may be marketed as a prescription drug by the Burroughs Wellcome Company. In order to provide advance notice of the availability of AZT to our State Medic- aid agencies, we issues a program memorandum to alert them that FDA approval of the drug AZT is likely in the near future. This information allows States to begin immediately to revise their State formularies to include AZT if they choose to do so. We have promised to inform the States of any significant change in the status of AZT. The Burroughs Wellcome Company has indicated that the drug will be $188 per one humdred 100 mg. tablets. This would mean that the resulting cost to the patient would be, depending on the individual patient's regimen and actual dosage, between $7,000 and $10,000 annually. Determining the cost of AZT to the Medicaid program is extremely difficult and involves a number of assumptions that could change. For one thing, we do not know at this time of the drug will be prescribed for all AIDS patients, or limited to the population on which it has been tested in the Phase II Study, i.e., those with at least one occurrence of Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia or some other groups of pa- tients. At this point, we do not know if AZT can be produced in sufficient quantities to meet anticipated demand. Among other unknowns is the cost of treatment for the side effects of AZT and the cost implications of its potential for reducing the inci- dence of acute spells of illness. Given the limited information available, HCFA believes that the costs to the Med- icaid program of AZT itself-ignoring the cost of treating side effects as well as po- tential savings from reducing the number and severity of acute spells of illness- could range up to $50 million in 1987 if the drug is approved by April 1 and de- 38 mands for it can be met. Costs for 1988 under similar assumptions could reach $150 million. These costs would be shared approximately equally by the States and the Federal Government. SUMMARY As the agency responsible for financing the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we have worked closely with the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Surgeon General, and the Public Health Service to ensure maximum coordination of our efforts in re- sponding to the AIDS crisis. In addition, we have a HCFA AIDS coordinator, and a HCFA representative serves on the Assistant Secretary for Health's PHS Executive Task Force on AIDS. HCFA is committed as an agency to ensuring that appropriate care and services are delivered to AIDS patients. In partnership with the States, the Department and HCFA will continue to address and respond to the treatment of patients with this serious disease. I will be glad to answer any questions you may have. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Dr. Roper. Dr. Windom, there are approximately 4,500 people who are now receiving AZT for free. These are the people that are part of the clinical test. Now when AZT becomes licensed by FDA the drug is not going to be made available free. They're going to charge $8,000 to $10,000. Who will pay for these people? We've already had them on the drug. If they don't continue with the drug, they'll die. Who will pay for them? Mr. WINDOM. Mr. Chairman, there are a number of those pa- tients who are continuing on those trials. Also because there's post- marketing surveillance necessary to follow up, so a number of those will be receiving the drug, as they are now, at no expense to them. Mr. WAXMAN. Who will pay for it? Mr. WINDOM. The drug company is providing that under certain circumstances for those who are continuing in certain trials that will be ongoing. Otherwise for the open market, that will be based upon the individual, third party or Medicaid or whatever. There will be a number of sources. Mr. WAXMAN. How many of the 4,500 would then be in the cate- gory for which the company would continue to pay? Mr. WINDOM. I don't have that figure, Mr. Chairman. I don't know the exact number. Mr. WAXMAN. Do you know the range? Are we talking about three out of the 4,000? Are we talking about 50 out of the 4500? We'd like that figure and we'll get it for the record. Mr. WINDOM. We'll provide that for the record, sir. Mr. WAXMAN. But the other point is, whatever number of those people in that group that have gone through this clinical trial, don't we have a responsibility for them since they've been part of this trial to establish the efficacy of this drug, not to just suddenly push them aside on their own? If they can't afford it, they're just going to be out of luck? Mr. WINDOM. I'm not aware that anybody is going to be taken off the drug because they cannot pay. That would have to be evaluated on individual circumstance. Mr. WAXMAN. You would say it would be unethical not to have that drug available to all those 4,500 people that have already been 39 part of the trial and that already are getting the drug. So if they don't get it there are serious consequences. Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. Mr. WAXMAN. Now as you've outlined the NIH has contributed a great deal toward the development of AZT. The Public Health Service has set up the AZT program, and the FDA has acted in near record time to get this drug out to market. So we've had a lot of government assistance in moving this drug along. Do you believe that the Burroughs Wellcome price of $8,000 to $10,000 per person per year is a fair price? Mr. WINDOM. Mr. Chairman, I can only comment that I do not know the exact way by which they have come about their pricing mechanism and would have to defer to their best judgment, and feel that they're doing this to meet their requirements. Again, I don't know the intricacies of that. Mr. WAXMAN. Do you intend to get the records from them to look at their investment cost, to second guess their evaluation as to whether this is a reasonable price? Mr. WINDOM. I do not intend to. I don't think that is in the pur- view of our position, our work. Mr. WAXMAN. How many other drugs besides AZT are in clinical trials now? Mr. WINDOM. There are approximately 10 or 11 other trials that are going on with other drugs. 0 Mr. WAXMAN. We'd like a list of those for the record, if you could provide that to us. We'd like to know how many are in clinical trials, how many drugs have been proposed for trials to the NIH drug selection committee, and get the complete update on that. We've heard Dr. Roper talk about the financial costs of AIDS care. Are there any clinical trials underway for early intervention drugs that may stop the virus before it becomes a full AIDS case? Mr. WINDOM. No, this is the first drug that actually we have available to be used. So we have no drug available at this point as far as showing to effect upon the early stages of AIDS. Mr. WAXMAN. Does NIH plan to initiate such research? Mr. WINDOM. There are a number of these drug trials that are presently in effect, new drugs that may be appropriate for the early stages. We'll have to wait to see what their trial results are. Mr. WAXMAN. Now let's talk about who's going to pay for the drug. If a patient can afford it, the patient will pay. If the patient has insurance that will pay for it, the insurance company will pay. Dr. Roper, you indicated that Medicare, while it covers the disabled generally does not cover AIDS patients because there's a 2-year waiting period and they generally die before that 2 years eligibility is met. So Medicaid becomes the government health care insurance system that will pay for care for these patients. That's after they become eligible on a spenddown basis-- Mr. ROPER. After they become eligible for SSI or spenddown under medically needy programs, yes. Mr. WAXMAN. So they become impoverished and then when they're eligible on that basis Medicaid will come in. Mr. ROPER. Yes. 40 Mr. WAXMAN. Now in the Medicaid program many States set a dollar limit on prescription drugs? Mr. ROPER. Yes, they're able to do that. Mr. WAXMAN. Florida has one of the highest incidences of AIDS in the country. Florida limits Medicaid reimbursement for drugs to $22 per month. AZT will probably cost between $600 and $800 a month more than that. What will a person with AIDS do under the Florida Medicaid program? Mr. ROPER. They would not be eligible unless the State of Florida changed that limit. I would expect a number of States to make those kind of changes. AZT is a unique drug. AIDS is a unique ill- ness. Mr. WAXMAN. Why would you think the States would want to change their limits? I mean, after all, if the drug company works on the assumption that in pricing the drug somebody is going to pay for it, why wouldn't the States work on the assumption that if they put the limits on it that the Federal Government will be stuck with it because somebody else, i.e., the Federal Government, will pay for it? Why would the States want to incur this additional cost? Mr. ROPER. Because they have a responsibility to their citizens. Mr. WAXMAN. And what will be the Federal Government's re- sponse? Mr. ROPER. We operate the Medicaid program in concert with the States. Mr. WAXMAN. Right now under the terms of the Medicaid pro- gram may a State refuse to reimburse for a specific drug, even if it's life-sustaining? Mr. ROPER. Yes. States are free to determine the formulary or the list of drugs that are covered under their Medicaid program. Some States have an open formulary, meaning they cover any drug that's FDA approved. Others have more limited lists. That came about because of a desire to save money, to conserve costs in the program. Mr. WAXMAN. What would an AIDS patient do in a State that doesn't pay for prescription drugs or one that refuses to pay for AZT? Mr. ROPER. They would not be eligible for AZT payment under the Medicaid program in their State. Mr. WAXMAN. They would go without. Mr. ROPER. Or find some other means of payment. Mr. WAXMAN. Now under the Medicaid program, 19 States in- cluding New York and California have a State formulary or list of drugs that will be paid for. You say that you've notified States of the possible approval of AZT. How many States have moved to add AZT to their reimbursement list? Mr. ROPER. Twenty-six States have open formularies. And what that means is immediately on FDA approval the drug will be cov- ered under those States. Another 10 States have told us that they will cover AZT almost immediately. The others we have not yet heard back from. Mr. WAXMAN. We'd like to get a list from you of the States. Mr. ROPER. Surely. 41 Mr. WAXMAN. How long does it take to add a drug to the State formulary? Mr. ROPER. Again, it varies widely. Some States do so immediate- ly. Others have a process of committee meeting to review the drug and make a determination for the State Medicaid program. Mr. WAXMAN. Some States amend their formulary once or twice a year, don't they? Mr. ROPER. That's correct. M.-. WAXMAN. Some may refuse to pay at all. Mr. ROPER. That's correct. Mr. WAXMAN. Some may move to add AZT on an expedited basis. Mr. ROPER. Yes. Mr. WAXMAN. So it's now up to the States. Mr. ROPER. Yes. Mr. WAXMAN. What will an AIDS patient do if a State does not add AZT to its formulary? Mr. ROPER. He will not be eligible for it under the Medicaid pro- gram. Mr. WAXMAN. Certainly we're talking about a catastrophic health problem. What help would the administration's pf )posal for catastrophic health insurance be in paying for the $10,000 a year for AZT? Mr. ROPER. The provision to provide better financing in the Med- icare program would not affect AZT and AIDS patients. Another part of the Secretary's proposal that the President has recommend- ed to the Congress is, assistance to the States to State actions like this one under the Medicaid program to provide better coverage. Mr. WAXMAN. We have a proposal before us from the administra- tion called catastrophic health insurance and it covers- Mr. ROPER. That's specifically the Medicare part. Mr. WAXMAN. So it wouldn't cover AZT? Mr. ROPER. No. Mr. WAXMAN. Even though it would a medical catastrophe. Nei- ther the Medicare program nor the Administration's plan has an out-patient prescription drug coverage. The administration's plan affects only Medicare beneficiaries and very few AIDS patients live long enough to qualify for Medicare. So what's being called cata- strophic health insurance before the Congress will not take care of this particular kind of medical catastrophe. In earlier testimony before this subcommittee HCFA said that it anticipates that 23 percent of AIDS costs will be born by Medicaid. Today you say that 40 percent of AIDS patients will be served by Medicaid. Could you explain the difference? Mr. ROPER. The figure is 40 percent in outpatients and 23 per- cent in the costs, because of the spend down process of becoming Medicaid eligible. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Haigler suggested that AZT actually lowered treatment costs for AIDS patients since it may prevent frequent re- currences of disease, and then lower hospitalization rates. Do you agree? Mr. ROPER. That is a logical presumption, but I don't know the evidence. I haven't reviewed the figures. Mr. WAXMAN. Well, it's going to-healthier people are not going to need to be in the hospital. Wouldn't that give you the conclusion 42 that it would save money, that you'd otherwise have had to pay the hospitalization? Mr. ROPER. Indeed, yes. Mr. WAXMAN. If it can be shown that the drug will lower costs, would you support a mandatory Medicaid benefit requiring all States to supply AZT? Mr. ROPER. No, because the Medicaid program is operated in con- cert with States, Federal and State partnership, and the States fora variety of reasons, ought to be given substantial latitude to oper- ate the program. We trust the judgments of the states. Mr. WAXMAN. Under Federal law, we require that the Medicaid program provide health care services for certain population groupsthat are in the bottom economically, and we require that they pro-vide certain services. We leave some things as optional and leave it to State discretion, but some things we mandate.If we saw that States decided they didn't want to cover AZT for thebe patients, and I think we all agree ethically that we must pro- vide this, we must as a society make sure these people don't gowithout the drug, and die because of the fact they can't afford it.Isn't there a Federal responsibility? We talked about the State re- sponsibility to take care of their citizens. Isn't there a Federal re- sponsibility to take care of our citizens? Mr. ROPER. And the Federal Government is discharging that re- sponsibility in the Medicaid program. Mr. WAXMAN. By shifting the burden to the States? Mr. ROPER. Not at all. Because by operating the program in con- cert with the States, it's a Federal-State partnership. Mr. WAXMAN. Yes, but we are letting the States decide rather than decide at the Federal level. Mr. ROPER. That's been the nature for 21 years. Mr. WAXMAN. That's not the nature of every service. That's thenature of some services, and we're talking about one that is unlike others we've had, not completely unlike, but unlike others we've had because of the high cost, and clear inability for people who are on Medicaid to be able to come up with $10,000 a year.There's no reference to it in your statement, but I don't need toremind you that the fiscal year 1988 budget that the administra- tion submitted to Congress calls for a cap on the Federal Medicaid spending, which would then ask the States to pick up at least $1.3billion next year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If AIDS related Medicaid spending will be $400-800 million this year as you've testified, how do you expect the States to cope with the even greater financial consequences of the epidemic next year under that proposed cap? Mr. ROPER. The other part of the cap is a proposed enhancement, substantial enhancement, of the States' ability to manage their Medicaid programs more efficiently and given the ability to dothat, we think they could pay for more services, deliver more serv- ices, even with a cap. Mr. WAXMAN. Well, we've had reductions in Federal dollars to the States in the past, and the way they've handled it is by reduc-ing services and reducing eligibility. One would expect if that's how they meet the fewer Federal dollars, under the Medicaid program in the past, they're not going to be talking about expanding Medic- 43 aid formularies to pay for AZT, which is going to be so very, very expensive. Mr. Dannemeypi. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Windom, you're a licensed physician in the State of Florida, right? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How long did you practice there? Mr. WINDOM. 26 years. Mr. DANNEMEYER. And did you have a general practice? Mr. WINDOM. General internal medicine, yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Are you familiar with the law of the State of Florida that calls for the reportability of certain communicable dis- eases? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How many diseases made are reportable by the law of the State of Florida, that a physician encounters, rough- ly? Mr. WINDOM. I don't have that list in front of me, but it is quite large, probably 15 or more. I just don't know exactly. Mr. DANNEMEYER. And among those that are reportable, some are curable and some are non-curable, right? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Give me an example of some that are curable that are reportable. For example, syphilis and gonorrhea. Are they reportable in the State of ,lorida? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, si:'. eases, aren't they? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, but we see some cases now that are resistant, but potentially they are curable. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Do you support the policy, the public health policy, of making curable communicable venereal diseases report- able? Mr. WINDOM. That is a provision within the State health pro- gram, which they do, and are allowed to do, and they make their decisions, and I go along with that. Mr. DANNEMEYER. You support them? Mr. WINDOM. The State decision is to make that. Mr. DANNEMEYER. That's been standard public health response to deal with communicable disease throughout this country for at least during the years you've practiced medicine. Isn't that right? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. You believe that to be sound public health policy? Mr. WINDOM. That determination is sound, yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Then let's take a person with a virus for AIDS. Mr. Koop-Dr. Koop, the Surgeon General of the United States, in his report to the Nation last October, in that report said, we must presume that every person with the virus is capable of transmitting that virus to another human on a transfer of bodily fluids. Isn't that right? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. 44 Mr. DANNEMEYER. Therefore any person with the virus has by definition, a communicable disease, right? Mr. WINDOM. Potentially communicable. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Do we have a cure for the virus today? Mr. WINDOM. No, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. So we have in the words of Dr. Koop, I think at one point in his report, it's estimated we have 1-2 million Ameri- cans with the virus in their blood, right? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. The current estimate is those that have the virus that will go on to get the disease is about 50 percent, right? Mr. WINDOM. 25-50 percent is the figure used. Mr. DANNEMEYER. All right. One of the things that prompts me on this line of question is the rule of paradox in the public health response to deal with this epidemic in America. You say as a public health official and a private practicing physi- cian, that you support the concept of reportability for curable com- municable venereal diseases, such as syphilis and gonorrhea. Will you please tell this panel and the people of this country, how the public health authorities of this Nation can justify the public posi- tion you now pursue, of attempting to defend that we will not call to be reported those w'th a non-curable communicable venereal dis- ease? I'll say it again. How in the world do we justify a system which mandates the reportability of a curable communicable vene- real disease, and attempt to defend making not reportable, a non- curable communicable venereal disease? Could you please explain that to me? Mr. WINDOM. Sir, the question is raised by many States, and many States have taken action right now, or concerning action to take, as to how to handle that particular problem. I think we will find-- Mr. DANNEMEYER. Wait a minute. Dr. Koop in his report to the Nation, at one point in that report, expressly defended the non-re- portability of those with the virus to public health authorities. Mr. WINDOM. The disease AIDS is reported. Mr. DANNEMEYER. I understand that, sir. But the virus is not? Mr. WINDOM. That's right. In some States. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Dr. Koop in his report specifically attempted to defend the non-reportability of those with the virus. Why does he do that? Why do you do that? Mr. WINDOM. Well, we are informing our States, and let them make these decisions based upon the evaluation of this condition, in those people who are antibody positive. Some States do report it. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Now you, under Dr. Bowen, you are the head of the Public Health Service in America, aren't you? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. They do what you tell them because the buck stops with you, right? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, to an extent. Then it goes on up to Dr. Bowen also. But we just held a conference-we just held a conference-- Mr. DANNEMEYER. You made up your mind to make a public policy position that those with the virus should be reportable. You'd recommend that to the people of the country and the States, and they'd probably do it, wouldn t they? 45 Mr. WINDOM. Well, first the results of the meeting we just spon- sored and held 2 weeks ago was dealing with this subject of testing and reporting, and that information will be brought to me on April 1. And we will look at that in great depth, then come forth with the recommendations or decisions based upon that best input from people representing the whole Nation, over 900 people at this im- portant program. So it's through this mechanism that we do make decisions, besed upon input from many sources. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Do you believe sitting here this morning that as a public policy response those with the virus should be report- able? Mr. WINDOM. I do not feel it should be mandated at this point, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. You don't think it should be mandated? Mr. WINDOM. At this point, I feel that-- Mr. DANNEMEYER. I'll ask the question again. If by law we re- quire a person with a curable communicable disease to be reported to public health authorities, how in the world do we justify a public health response which does not exact the same requirements for a non-curable communicable venereal disease? How do you explain that? Mr. WINDOM. Well because there are so many ramifications about this disease that's different from others that we've ever come across, that we have to look at for all these-- Mr. DANNEMEYER. You bet it's different. It's non-curable. Mr. WINDOM. Right. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How else is it different? Mr. WINDOM. Well, in the fact that once it goes through its full- blown stage, it's fatal. And it's rapidly progressively fatal. Mr. DANNEMEYER. But Doctor, I'll state it this way. If public policy requires we report a curable communicable venereal disease, doesn't it seem logical that we would exact the same requirement for a disease which is not curable? Mr. WINDOM. Well, that's-- Mr. DANNEMEYER. Human logic would seem to dictate that. Mr. WINDOM. There is also some evidence, and a feeling that if we did that, there would be a number of instances where that person would never even seek the opportunity to get tested, be- cause it has many other ramifications. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Now the State of Florida, I mean the States of Colorado, and Idaho and Minnesota in this country reject that ar- gument, don't they? They require that those with the virus be re- portable, don't they? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. Yes. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Wouldn't you say that every person with the virus today and in next 5 years is going to manifest some impair- ment of their immune system? Mr. WINDOM. Well we don't know that, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Well the French study published about 8 months ago indicated that about 50-70 percent of those with the virus would get AIDS and die, and the balance would all manifest some impairment of their immune system. My point is, you say that some people would not participate if we had mandatory test- ing. 46 What I am suggesting is, every person with the virus is going to be in contact with the health care system of this Nation, because they frankly have no place else to go, and at that point they have no place to hide, and when they come into the health care system, isn't it appropriate that we adopt and respond with the normal routine public health response for every communicable disease that has come down the pike in the lab test-last half century, and make it reportable? Mr. WINDOM. What you're saying is being considered in many, many places today. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How long is-- Mr. WAXMAN. Gentlemen, the time has expired. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Wait a minute, Mr. Chairman. You started at 10:24 and quit at 10:36. I started at 10:36 and I think I should be able to go to 10:48, and take 12 minutes just like the Chairman did. Mr. WAXMAN. Well I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't think you've cal- culated correctly, and I think we've given you the same amount of time, but we'll give you an opportunity in the second round. Mr. Wyden has been waiting patiently, and you have another opportu- nity. Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a couple of questions. Dr. Roper, in 1987 the cost of AZT in the Medicaid program could reach $50 million, according to your indications. Is that Fed- eral money, or combined State and Federal? Mr. ROPER. Combined. It's 25-25 roughly. Mr. WYDEN. In producing that number, Doctor, how many States do you assume are going to cover AZT this year? Mr. ROPER. We assume that 26 States will immediately cover. They are the ones with so-called open formularies. Mr. WYDEN. I think all of us on the subcommittee would appreci- ate for the record, the data and assumptions used by HFCA to esti- mate the Medicaid related costs of AIDS and AZT? Mr. ROPER. I'd be glad to provide that, yes. Mr. WYDEN. For the sake of the record. Mr. ROPER. Yes. Mr. WYDEN. Dr. Roper, my second question is, what is the range of poverty that AIDS patients have to reach before becoming eligi- ble for Medicaid? Mr. ROPER. It's substantial poverty. It varies across the states. States have different levels. Mr. WYDEN. Well, I know that the Chairman spoke of the Florida situation at a very low level. But I think there are several States that are even well below that. I think one State, it may be Ala- bama, but I'm not sure, you have to have $88 a month for a family of 2 in order to be eligible. Mr. ROPER. I don't know the Alabama figures off the top of my head, but substantial poverty in many States is required. Mr. WYDEN. Should patients have to move from the States with a very low level? From Florida, and if it's Alabama, as I say I don't know, to California to get AZT? Is that what the administration is advocating? Mr. ROPER. No. We are advocating the States to effectively manage their Medicaid program. 47 Mr. WYDEN. But what if you're very low income, yet you still don't qualify, in your State. Heard that, I guess it's an old notion, vote with your feet, but clearly people who are in pain and are dis- abled couldn't possibly do that. It would certainly put an extra burden on the States. What do you do if you're very low income, in a State you're not eligible. Mr. ROPER. Well the question you pose-it strikes to the heart of a Federally-State operated program, a partnership program. We depend on the voters and the elected officials of the several States to do the right thing by their citizens. Mr. WYDEN. Well, I think we're all interested in the States doing as much as possible. I'm just concerned that people are going to fall through the cracks as a result of this situation. There may not be any drug services in their State, and they may not be able to move. The question for both of you that I'd like to ask, deals with whose responsibility is this? Where are the lines between the Fed- eral Government and the States? I think your positions are a little bit different. I understood Dr. Windom to say that it's unethical to withhold AZT from AIDS patients. That was Dr. Windom's statement to Chairman Waxman. But Dr. Roper has said that's it's not a Feder- al ethical responsibility. My question is, whose responsibility is it? Mr. ROPER. I think we as a society have a responsibility to pay for health care services to those who can't afford to pay for them themselves. That includes not only AIDS patients, but patients of whatever malady. And society has that duty. The Federal Govern- ment, State Government, local Governments, the private sector, the manufacturers of the drug. It's a responsibility that we all share. The Federal Government is discharging that responsibility primarily through the Medicaid program, as I've said. Mr. WYDEN. I don't think that's much solace to people in great pain, and agony to say that society in the abstract has a responsi- bility to do it. We haveto make decisions to try to help alleviatethat pain, and make sure they're in the most cost effective manner. I personally think the Federal Government has a more significant role to play in this then all of you do, but that will be a subject for other debates. Dr. Windom, would you want to comment? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir, Mr. Congressman. This is a early disease process, it's a very devastating one that has aroused the concern of millions of people in this Nation, and we know of many communi- ties where this disease has manifested itself more than others. There's a great deal of community effort, individuals helping the patient through many ways, to show compassion, and concern, and to make their care more available with all the help of many disci- plines. So I think it is evident that there is a great deal of human- istic approach to this disease on all levels. Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Wyden. The thought that strikes me that when you say society has the obligation to pay for it is that that could be an excuse for no one in society taking the re- sponsibility. It could be an excuse for the Federal Government not to do it, or the States not to do it, for the drug companies to assume that somebody will pay whatever their price will be, and 48 we could easily see large numbers of patients going without this drug which we would all consider an unethical, unacceptable situa- tion. So we're going to have to, it seems to me, monitor this situa- tion very carefully. Dr. Windom, there are a lot of questions I could ask you about the AIDS problem, and about reporting and testing routine, man- datory, whatever. We are going to hold hearings on these issues at a later date. This is not an issue we're unconcerned about, but I'm going to refrain from getting into those issues at this time, because we have this hearing on this question. But any member can pursue anything they want when they're asked-when they're given the time to pursue questions. I just don't want you to think that our refraining from going into these questions means that we agree with Mr. Dannemeyer on his point of view, or that we are uninterested in this situation. Mr. Dannemeyer, do you wish a second round? Mr. DANNEMEYER. Yes; I do. Mr. WAXMAN. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Windom, I don't think you were working as head of the Public Health Service of the Federal Government in March of 1985, but I suspect one of the staff persons sitting behind you there can help you with respect to this issue, because it relates to the integrity of the blood supply of this country. In March of 1985, the Public Health Service of the United States Government took some action in order to protect the integrity of the blood supply and in about March of that year, action was taken with respect to the group that contributed 17 percent of the AIDS' cases, intravenous drug users. That action provided that the group contributing 17 percent of the AIDS cases cannot 'onate blood; isn't that right? Mr. WINDOM. An intravenous drug user cannot? Mr. DANNEMEYER. In the Spring of 1985, statistically speaking, 17 percent of the AIDS' cases came from a group called intrave- nous drug users, and so from the standpoint of protecting the blood supply of the country, a decision was made that that group that contributed 17 percent of the AIDS' cases, cannot donate blood; isn't that right? Mr. WINDOM. Yes. Mr. DANNEMEYER. At the same time, the Public Health Service for the United States Government made a decision with respect to the group that contributed 73 percent of the AIDS' cases, male ho- mosexuals, relating to the integrity of the blood supply. Specifical- ly, the Public Health Service said, and here they differed, if you subjectively consider yourself to be a monogonous male homosex- ual, there is no restriction on your donating blood at all, but if you subjectively considered yourself to be a polygamous male homosex- ual, the Public Health Service said you should not donate blood; isn't that right? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. And then in September of 1986, you changed your policy whereby you said, irrespective of whether you classify yourself as a monogonous or polygamous male homosexual, you should not donate blood; isn't that correct? 49 Mr. WINDOM. Yes. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Now, the question I have is this; if it is sound public policy to protect the integrity of the blood supply of thiscountry, that the group that contributes 17 percent of the AIDS'cases, intravenous drug users, is told, you cannot donate blood, how do you justify adopting less than an identical stricture with respectto the group that contributes 73 percent of the AIDS' cases, male homosexuals, but to that group, to my knowledge, you have to thisdate just said, should not donate blood as opposed to cannot donate blood. How do you justify that? Mr. WINDOM. Well, because we feel with the testing procedure,that we can test the blood today, too, for those who do give blood beyond which they should not give it, they still offer giving blood. We cannot prove whether they fit that category or not. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Well, that's interesting. The testing procedure would pertain to whether you are an intravenous drug user or you are a male homosexual; wouldn't it? Mr. WINDOM. It could; yes. Mr. DANNEMEYER. So if the blood test is a constant, there must be some other reason why the Public Health Service has not been able to bring itself and say to the group that contributes 73 percentof the AIDS' cases, you cannot donate blood. Can you give me a ra-tionale as to what-why you do that? Mr. WINDOM. Well, the history, of course, of the IV drug use, hada greater instance of possibility of the spread or the contamination and consequently, looking at the other issue more with the homo- sexual population and to evaluate just where we stand at that point. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Now, let's be candid about it. The ELISA testhas a false negative in between 4 and 10 percent of the cases; doesn't it? Mr. WINDOM. Yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. In other words, if a test is negative on a pro- posed blood sample, there is a 4 to 10 percent chance that that blood can contain the virus for AIDS; right? Mr. WINDOM. That's too high; about 1 percent now. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Well, it depends on what statistician you relyupon, but I've seen figures on false negatives between 4 and 10 per- cent. What figures have you seen? Mr. WINDOM. I think it is 1 to 2 percent. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Let's take yours, 1 to 2 percent. Don't you be-lieve it is sound public policy considering we are attempting to pro-tect the integrity of our blood supply, for the Public Health Service to say to the group that contributes 73 percent of the AIDS' cases,male homosexuals, you cannot donate blood to the blood supply ofthis country, just as you have said to the group that contributes 17 percent of the AIDS' cases, intravenous drug users? Wouldn't that make sound public policy? Mr. WINDOM. It's something we would have to look at in more depth, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Well, how long is it going to take you to lookat that? Let me give you an example of how this is relevant. Lastyear, Dr. Windom, the public health in Colorado reported the in- 50 stance where a donor to the blood supply, and I think it was in May of 1986, showed up negative on the ELISA test and that donor's blood was admitted to the blood supply. That blood ended up being donated from the blood supply to a recipient and the re- cipient got AIDS. Then that donor came back in August to donate again. That donor tested positive under the ELISA test. The rationale as to why it was missed at the beginning; in May was because it takes about 6 weeks to 10 weeks for the latency period to develop in the human system where antibodies are detect- ed by the antigen. My point, Dr. Windom, is this; when will the Public Health Serv- ice of this country recognize that the current policy on protecting the blood supply of this Nation is defective? Your policy has result- ed in that citizen in the State of Colorado getting AIDS, because your policy relating to the people donating blood is defective. My question is when are you going to straighten it out and say as a matter of public policy that the groups that contribute 17 per- cent of the AIDS' cases, intravenous drug users, are going to be treated on the same basis as the group that contributes 73 percent of the AIDS' cases, male homosexuals. Those groups should be told, that they cannot donate blood. When will you do that? Mr. WINDOM. Well, as I mentioned, the first of April we will have a report of that meeting which discussed this very intensively, 2 weeks ago, on the question of blood testing and mandating and to look at that in more detail to see what we should do, because it is a question that is broad based and requires a great deal of input. Mr. WAXMAN. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. DANNEMEYER. In my judgment, you are treating this as a civil rights issue. You and the other members of the Public Health Service, in my judgment, are derelict in your responsibility and if you can't straighten up the public policy health response to this epidemic in America, I think with all due respect, sir, you should be replaced by people who will have that courage to do so. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. The gentleman's time has expired. What Mr. Dan- nemeyer has expressed here is nothing new. He has expressed it in other settings and other forums and in complaints to the President hin- , 1, as I understand it, there were letters complaining about his own administration. But just on this blood question, which isn't the subject for debate today but it has been raised, if you have someone coming in to donate blood and they are an intravenous drug user, that can be determined by a medical person at the site where the blood is to be donated. If someone is a homosexual, you are relying on that per- son's judgment. You have to prove whether that individual is cor- rect or not in the statement that he or she makes, that it is not the case. The Public Health Service has relied on the fact that you can screen out the blood rather than try to go out and find out whe iier these individuals are other than what they say they are. You say, someone comes in to donate blood, you are not to donate blood if you are a homosexual. Isn't that correct? 51 Mr. WINDOM. We request that if individuals have had sexual re- lations with another male since 1977, are a category of people who should not donate blood. Mr. WAXMAN. You tell them don't donate blood. Now, if you are going to require them at the site to go out and investigate further, you are going to have to investigate everybody who comes in. Now, the reason, as I understand it, that you have this particular proc- ess, is because you have the ability to then examine the blood. You tell people not to donate blood and then you screen the blood to see if the virus is in the donated blood and you remove any blood from whatever source. After all, you can have blood with the virus in it from someone who is not a homosexual, who never was aware they were carrying that virus. I wanted to raise those points, as well, to counter the charges that have been made, that you have not been acting in an responsi- ble way. That concludes our business before the subcommittee. We stand adjourned. [Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the hearing was adjourned, to recon- vene at the call of the Chair.] [The following letter was submitted for the record:] AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIATION STATEMENT ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE (AZT) The American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA commends the Burroughs- Wellcome Co for its decision to distrubute the new AIDS drug, azidothymidine (AZT, through the traditional drug distribution system that ensures the active par- ticipation of pharmacists. Although the AIDS patient will be required to designate a particular pharmacy where he or she will have prescription orders for AZT dis- pensed, the patient through this system will be assured access to comprehensive pharmaceutical services through the pharmacy of his or her choice. In the case of AZT, it is particularly appropriate that the traditional physician- pharmacist-patient relationship has been preserved. AZT is a highly toxic drug for which therapy must be individualized for each patient. Further, strict adherence to the prescribed dosage is essential to achieve maximum effect. Consequently, pa- tients on AZT therapy require special counseling, and their therapy must be closely monitored. Pharmacists are especially suited to provide these essential services. Be- sides special services related directly to their drug therapy, patients on AZT, be- cause of the nature of their disease, often require other community health services, such as hospices and mental health counseling, and pharmacists can refer patients to such services available in their communities. Pharmacists can also assist patients in dealing with the relatively high cost of AZT therapy. Pharmacists have historically worked with their patients to achieve maximum drug therapy effect at the lowest possible cost, as well as to help identify sources of financial assistance that might be available in the community to help with patients' drug therapy costs. In the case of AZT, pharmacists through their monitoring function can work with patients and physicians to achieve a dosage level that will be effective yet most economical. In addition to helping tailor therapy to achieve cost savings, pharmacists' tradi- tional methods of determining their fees will also help keep patient costs low. Al- though pharmacists will be assuming significant financial risks and inventory carry- ing costs related to stocking AZT, the fees which pharmacists will receive, besides recovering their actual costs for the drug product, will relate primarily to their pro- vision of the counseling, monitoring and other pharmaceutical services that they will be providing to the patient. Therefore, it si clear then that patient cost esti- mates cannot and should not be based upon percentage markups on the wholesale price of the drug charged by the manufacturer. Although the actual professional fee received by pharmacists will vary from pharmacist to pharmacist, all pharmacists obviously are entitled to receive a reasonable professional fee for the services they 52 provide in supplying the drug. However, if compared with a percentage of wholesale cost, that fee likely will be quite small. As experience is gained on the distribution of AZT, APhA has offered to further work with Burroughs-Wellcome to make any adjustments in the distribution system that would assure that it works even better to help the AIDS patient. AIDS ISSUES AIDS and Minorities MONDAY, APRIL 27, 1987. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT, Houston, TX. The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m., in Moot Court Room of the Law School at Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas, Hon. Henry A. Waxman (chairman) presiding. Mr. WAXMAN. The meeting will come to order. We will speak as loudly as we can. We want to welcome you to this subcommittee meeting hearing of the Health and Environment Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives. This subcommittee has held over a dozen hearings on the epidemic of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syn- drome or AIDS. Most have been on the stubborn refusal of the Reagan administration to heed the warnings of its own best health and medical experts. Some have been on models of clinical care for AIDS patients. Some have been on the need to develop new thera- pies for the disease. Today's hearing will deal with all of these issues at once. But today's hearing is also to bring to public attention a side of the epi- demic that has been largely unaddressed: The disproportionate dangers that AIDS poses for minorities in America. I have argued on many occasions that had AIDS first appeared among members of the Chamber of Commerce, the Federal re- sponse to the disease would have been much more urgent and much more comprehensive. Since the disease was first recognized among gay men, however, the Reagan administration dealt with it as business as usual. This neglect of gay men who were ill is now matched by the ad- ministration's unwillingness to recognize the particular problems of AIDS among minority groups, both gay and straight. While Black Americans represent about 12 percent of the population of the Nation, they represent 25 percent of the confirmed cases of AIDS. While Hispanic Americans represent 7 percent of the popu- lation, they make up 14 percents of the cases of AIDS. These numbers are complex. They involve drug abuse and sexual activity. They are tied to a variety of problems in minority access to health care, education and employment. But clearly above and beyond these complexities, these statistics point out that there is a special need for the public health agencies (53) 54 of Federal, State, and local governments to provide AIDS education and clinical care services that reach Black and Hispanic Ameri- cans. Educational programs for white gay men may never reach Hispanic gay men. Counseling programs for white pregnant women may be inaccessible to Black pregnant women. The Reagan Revolution in government services has hit minority groups particularly hard. The AIDS epidemic will make these years of neglect even more devastating and will be fatal for many Black and Hispanic people. I hope that with today's hearings, we will remove some of the blinders that surround observers of AIDS and finally conclude that AIDS is a crisis for all Americans Hispanic, Black and white, het- erosexual and homosexual, young and old. Once that occurs, we will be able to address the disease as a disease and not as a curse. We will be able to care for all sick people regardless of their race or their income. And I hope we will be able to bring together a Nation that is becoming frightened and torn over the epidemic. I want to thank, Congressman Mickey Leland, who has invited us to come to this meeting, today, and to hold this hearing. Congress- man Leland is a very active member of the Subcommittee on Health, has been involved in our hearings and activities in the AIDS area, as well as in many other health issues. And, through his leadership, we are trying to deal with these very pressing prob- lems at a time when we are having a lot of trouble from the failure of the cooperation of many of the administration to recognize the realities. We hope this hearing will aid both of us in fighting for more Federal efforts to combat the AIDS epidemic and to make sure that those Federal efforts are targeted and clear and coherent from a public health point of view. And I want to recognize at this time, Congressman Leland. Mr. LELAND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank you for your very quick and ready response to the invitation to come and hold this hearing here in my city, in my district, at my alma mater. A few years ago, the' Gay Political Caucus invited me to a \"town hall\" meeting and introduced me to the very severe and critical problem that afflicts Houston. This problem, of course, of AIDS. I was involved through the committee's work and activities with the issue of AIDS, but had never realized to what extent or the magnitude of the problem that existed in my own city. I guess, to some extent, I was as guilty as some of our so-called city leadership with my ignorance about the prominence of this very serious, this very serious affliction of our city and our country. I am most pleased, however, that indeed there are those of you, Mr. Chairman, in the Congress, who would take the kind of fervent leadership to not only address the problem of how it is that we cure AIDS, but also how it is that we prevent AIDS. It is becoming more and more apparent, now, that the homftosex- ual community is not the only community that has been afflicted with this disease. The gay community, the gay and lesbian commu- nities are communities that indeed we have to guard in terms of their human rights and their human ailments, if you will, and we cannot push them aside. But, at the same time, and I do not want 55 to demean the interest of doing just that, but at the same time, I would like to expand this sphere of discussion in order that we can address the very critical problem of AIDS that is growing amongst heterosexuals and, particularly, amongst minorities, too. I think maybe with working in coalition together with those all who are afflicted, we can finally realize some true solutions to the problem. Since AIDS was first targeted as a specific disease in 1981, it has received a tremendous amount of public attention. Unfortunately, the general public continues to think of AIDS as a disease of homo- sexual white males. As a result, one aspect of the epidemic has been largely overlooked. AIDS cases occur nearly three times more frequently among Black and Hispanic men than among white men, as was alluded to by our chairman. And the incidence among Black and Hispanic women and children compared to whites is evenhigher. Moreover, recent studies indicate that AIDS will continue to spread at much higher rates among Blacks and Hispanics than among whites. If we are serious about developing a game plan with which to win this war against AIDS, these sobering statistics must be taken into consideration. In order for our actions to be effective, we must aggressively pursue answers to such difficult questions as: Why does AIDS occur more frequently amongst minorities than whites. And why is this disease increasing in the heterosexual community? We already have many hints as to answers to some of these ques- tions. For instance, in the white community, AIDS has spread pri- marily through male homosexual contact and women having con- tact with bisexual men. Among Blacks and Hispanics, however, AIDS is spread primarily as the result of intravenous drug abuse and heterosexual contact. This pattern is partly due to the dispro- portionately large number of Black and Hispanic IV drug users in areas most affected by the AIDS epidemic. As a matter of fact, 62 percent of minorities acquiring AIDS through heterosexual contact have reported sexual contact with an IV drug user. Since most of the women with AIDS are Black and Hispanic, it is not surprising that most children with AIDS are also Black and Hispanic, estimated to be about 80 percent of the victims afflicted with AIDS. AIDS affects our entire society. Therefore, we must all work to- gether to address this problem. Black and Hispanic organizations have a unique opportunity and obligation to become educated about AIDS and how to stop its further spread in our communities. Of course, the development of an effective vaccine and treatmentmust remain a high priority. But until a vaccine and treatment are discovered, prevention programs are our only remedy. Mr. Chairman, today's hearing is an integral and critical aspect of any prevention remedy: Education. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that these panel members will help educate all of us about the impact of AIDS beyond the homosexual community, in general. And I would like to again reiterate that that does not demean the importance for us to pursue how it is that we can pro- tect our homosexual community against this very dire disease. Mr. Chairman, let me at this time, if I may, thank the President of the Texas Southern University for not only his participation, 56 which is to ensue, and I see that he is here, for allowing us to hold this hearing here. We would like to thank Gene Harrington, who we know facilitat- ed the opportunity for us to participate in this setting at the Moot Court of the Thurgood Marshall Law School. Let me also thank the Chicano law students as well as the Black Law students who facili- tated the welcoming banners that we see and the refreshments that we were able to get before the hearing and for all of those who have participated here in the City of Houston to help put this in- credible hearing and this landmark hearing, I might add, Mr. Chairman, on here in the City of Houston, at Texas Southern Uni- versity. [The opening statements of Hon. Mickey Leland and Hon. Jack Fields follows:] STATEMENT OF HON. MICKEY LELAND Mr. Chairman, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for holding this hear- ing here in our City of Houston and for your focus on the problem of AIDS both in and beyond the homosexual community. Since AIDS was first targeted as a specific disease in 1981, it has received a tre- mendous amount of public attention. Unfortunately, far too many members of the general public continue to think of AIDS as a disease of homosexual males. And many people continue to thing of AIDS as a disease which predominately affects the white community. As a result, one aspect of the epidemic has been largely over- looked: AIDS cases occur nearly three times more frequently among Black and His- panic men than among white men. And the incidence among Black and Hispanic women and children compared to whites is even higher. Moreover, recent studies indicate that AIDS will continue to spread at much higher rates among Blacks and Hispanics than among whites. And since most of the women with AIDS are Black and Hispanic, it is not surprising that most children with AIDS are also Black and Hispanic. If we are serious about developing a game-plan to win the war against AIDS, these sobering statistics must be taken into consideration. In order for our actions to be effective, we must aggressively pursue answers to such difficult questions as: Why does AIDS occur more frequently among minorities than whites? And why is this disease increasing in the heterosexual community? We already have many hints as to the answers to some of these questions. For instance, in the white community, AIDS has spread primarily through male homo- sexual contact and women having contact with bisexual men. Among Blacks and Hispanics, however, AIDS is spread primarily as the result of intravenous drug abuse and heterosexual contact. This pattern is partly due to the disproportionately large number of Black and Hispanic IV. drug abusers in areas most affected by the AIDS epidemic. As a matter of fact, 62 percent of minorities acquiring AIDS through heterosexual contact have reported sexual contact with an I.V. drug abuser. AIDS affects our entire society; therefore, we must all work together to address this problem. Black and Hispanic organizations have a unique opportunity and obli- gation to become educated about AIDS and how to stop its further spread in our communities. Of course, the development of an effective vaccine and treatment must remain a high priority; but until a vaccine and treatment are discovered, prevention pro- grams are our only remedy. In my view, an effective prevention program must in- clude certain features that have not yet received much public or media attention. These include: (1) targeted outreach risk reduction programs for minority popula- tions; (2) programs that are sensitive to cultural and language needs; (3) improved access to, and utilization of, health services to minority populations; (4) coordinated Federal, State, and local prevention activities; and (5) technical assistance for com- munity groups. Mr. Chairman, today's hearing is an integral and critical aspect of any prevention remedy-education. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that these panel members will help educate all of us about the impact of AIDS beyond the homosexual community, in general, and in minority communities in particular. I look forward to hearing their testimony on how best to address this devastating epidemic. 57 STATEMENT OF HON. JACK FIEWS Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend you and my col- league from Houston, Congressman Mickey Leland, for conducting this hearing today here in Houston. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS, as it is commonly known, is the most pressing public health problem with which this coun- try is faced today. It certainly merits considerable attention by our society. This deadly disease also merits considerable attention in Houston and Harris County. Latest figures show that Harris County has logged 1,027 cases of AIDS. This is the fourth highest tally in the country. The State of Texas also has the fourth highest State total. There have been 2,138 confirmed cases of AIDS in Texas; almost half of that total has been in the Houston area. In Texas, there have been 1,325 deaths. If there are no significant breakthroughs in the treatment and prevention of AIDS, by 1991, 240,000 people in Texas will have been exposed to AIDS; 16,200 of those will be confirmed cases; and of those 16,200, about 11,000 will have died from AIDS. Texas Commissioner of Health Robert Bernstein has predicted 60,000 cases of AIDS in Texas by 1997. Certainly it was an understatement when U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop told a Joint Session of the Texas Legislature that \"You've got a big problem in Texas.\" This is one situation that I sincerely wish weren't \"Texas-sized.\" Nationally, there have been 33,997 confirmed cases of AIDS; of those cases, 19,658 people have died. Almost a year ago the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services projected that there would be about 196,000 confirmed cases of AIDS by the beginning of 1991, with another 74,000 diagnosed during 1991. Health and Human Services also predicted that 125,000 people will have died from AIDS by the begin- ning of 1991, with 54,000 more deaths during the year. These are monumental figures. Perhaps the immensity of the problem can best be appreciated by comparing it with the tragedy that occurred when polio was epidem- ic 40 years ago. Between 1943 and 1956, 400,000 people were infected with polio. Since AIDS was introduced into the United States, probably in 1976, experts estimate that at least 1.5 million people have been infected with, or are carriers of, the virus. Of the 400,000 people who were infected with polio, 22,000 died during the period 1943-1956. As I mentioned earlier, nearly 20,000 have already died from AIDS. With AIDS, I am afraid, the worst is yet to come. I am sure everyone has heard all of these staggering numbers before. But I, and others, recount them to impress upon all of us that this communicable disease is the severest public health problem any of us have faced, or are likely to face, in our lifetime. While more people may die from cancer, heart disease and stroke this year and next, they are not contagious diseases. The specter of contagion is what sets AIDS in a class by itself. With that caveat firmly in mind, we must all concert our efforts to rid our society of this deadly disease. When I say we, I mean the local, State and Federal levels of government, as well as the private sector. We all have a responsibility to contribute to the provision of adequate resources to effectively deal with AIDS. We also must be courageous enough to take the appropriate public health meas- ures which will curtail needless suffering and death. This may require some tough decision-making; but, it will be necessary. Mr. Chairman and Congressman Leland, I hope we can work together on meas- ures which adequately and appropriately address the public health disaster of Ac- quired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. I would like to call forward Dr. Robert Terry, president of Texas Southern University to make a presentation to the subcommittee. As Dr. Terry approaches, I want to let him know how much we do appreciate the fact that we are holding this meeting here today and we appreciate your hospitality in allowing us to meet in the Moot Court. It is a long time since I was in a Moot Courtroom, not since I was at UCLA Law School, and I was not up on this side of the room when I was last in a Moot Court setting. But this feels much better up here than down there. 58 And Dr. Terry, now you have your turn to be down there. Mr. LELAND. Mr. Chairman, before the president speaks, I see that the Dean of the Law School is also here, Dean Douglas; and we want to thank him, too, for this program. STATEMENT OF ROBERT .. TERRY, PRESIDENT, TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY Mr. TERRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning. I am Robert J. Terry, president of Texas Southern University. I am a biomedical scientist. I am honored to welcome the US House of Representatives Subcommittee on Health and the Environment to our campus. I believe it is especially fitting that these hearings focusing on AIDS and its impact upon minorities are being held in the Thurgood Marshall School of Law. While AIDS is a major medical and social problem, effecting American society in general, it is especially devastating to minority communities, women and children. The following statistics are pro- vided by the Centers for Disease Control in the United States. In the United States, Black people make up a disproportionate number of persons with AIDS. Thirty-eight percent of all of those with AIDS in the United States are minorities. And 87 percent of women with AIDS are women of color. Ninety-one percent of all children with AIDS are non-white. And 60 percent of those with AIDS in Newark, New Jersey are heterosexual Black people. In Washington, DC, 50 percent of those who have AIDS are non-white heterosexuals. And in New York City, nearly one-half of the AIDS cases are heterosexual and 80 percent of these are Black or Hispan- ic. Most heterosexually infected persons with AIDS in the United States have been Black or Hispanic women. Heterosexual women who are not drug abusers have the highest rate of increase than any group. As a special purpose institution of higher education, Texas Southern University is an appropriate site for these hear- ings. The Thurgood Marshall School of Law is one of the leading non-medical institutions in the country that is devoting its atten- tion to AIDS and its impact upon people of color. The Houston Mayor's Task Force on AIDS, the AIDS Foundation in Houston, the Texas Human Rights Foundation and the Associa- tion of American Law School's Section Dealing with AIDS have all had the benefit of our law faculty input. Our Law Library has one of the most complete collection of AIDS' discrimination materials and we have the most complete AIDS' clipping service in the city. In addition, our law faculty was instrumental in conjunction with the Clark Reed Foundation in setting up the AIDS Legal Hot- line which provides legal assistance to persons being illegally dis- criminated because of AIDS and AIDS-related complex, or HIV se- rially positive status. In September, the Law School will host a national conference on AIDS, Minorities and the Law, which will convene legal experts from throughout the country to discuss the major legal issues AIDS presents. I believe the reception you have received this morning from the administration, from the faculty and student body is testimony to 59 the dedication of our institution in insuring that the special prob. lems that AIDS poses to people of color are adequately addressed. I again welcome you and wish the hearings a success. Thank you very much. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Dr. Terry. I want to thank you very much, again, for having us here. Our subcommittee has been the most active in dealing with the AIDS crisis in the Congress. We have held a number of hearings. And this is the second hearing outside of Washington. The first was in Los Angeles in 1981 when we did not even know the word, \"AIDS.\" We had first received reports of a disease called Kaposi's Sarcoma, which is a rare form of cancer. And, suddenly, it was occurring among gay men in the United States in very small numbers. Well, now, after all of these years, we have discovered AIDS. We have seen over 30,000 Americans come down with AIDS. We have seen the statistics of the number of people that will get this disease in the coming years, which is very, very frightening, indeed. And, as we look at the statistics for Houston, they are among the most frightening. As of April 13, Texas had the fourth highest number of cases in the country, behind New York, California and Florida. Total cases were 2,142. Also, as of April 13, Houston had the fourth highest number of cases among cities in the United States. And we realize that the problems here are going to be the kind of problems that other cities, unfortunately, will go through in the years ahead. So, we want to learn what we can from the experience here in Texas with all those people who have AIDS and with special emphasis on special groups, minority groups, particularly, that are afflicted and how,- how they ought to be handled in ways that will be more sensi- tive to the differences in the population. I thank you very much for greeting us and for hosting us. To give us a background about the AIDS disease, I would like to call forward to testify as a panel: Dr. J. Michael Lane, Director, Center for Prevention Services, Centers for Disease Control, Atlan- ta, GA; Dr. Mathilde Krim, Associate Research Scientist, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and Columbia University, and Founding Chair of the American Foundation for AIDS Research; and Dr. James Haughton, Director, City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services. If the three of you would please come forward in these seats where there are microphones. We are pleased to welcome the three of you to this hearing, today. We have prepared statements that you presented to us and those prepared statements will be made part of the record, in full: but what we would like to ask you and all other witnesses today is to try to summarize your testimony in no more than 5 minutes. We will have to try to ask everyone's cooperation. As difficult as it is sometimes to say all that you want to say in 5 minutes, but for us to have the full opportunity for questions and answers and to hear all of the witnesses and to keep with all the schedules that we are trying to juggle today. So, we are going to use a timer which will ring at the end of 5 minutes to let you know that the time has expired and we would like to ask at that point that the witnesses give us a summary sen- tence and conclude. 60 Why do we not start with Dr. Lane, if we might. STATEMENTS OF J. MICHAEL LANE, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR PREVENTION SERVICES, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL, PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; MATHILDE KRIM, ASSOCIATE RESEARCH SCIENTIST, ST. LUKE'S-ROOSEVELT HOSPITAL CENTER AND COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, AND FOUNDING CHAIRWOMAN, AMER- ICAN FOUNDATION FOR AIDS RESEARCH; AND JAMES G. HAUGHTON, DIRECTOR, CITY OF HOUSTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Mr. LANE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am Dr. J. Michael Lane, Director of the Center for Prevention Services at CDC. And I am pleased to represent CDC at this hearing. AIDS., as you know, is the Nation's No. 1 public health problem, with nearly 35,000 cases and nearly 20,000 deaths having been re- ported since 1981. The largest number of cases have been concen- trated in certain areas such as New York, San Francisco, Los An- geles, here in Houston, and Miami. But AIDS has been represented in every State in the Union. In 1985, AIDS became No. 11 leading cause of potential years of life lost before the age of 65 and provi- sional data indicate that in 1986, it moved up to the eighth spot. Blacks and Hispanics are being disproportionately affected by this epidemic. Of the more than 34,000 cases of AIDS reported to CDC as of April 20, 24 percent were Black and 14 percent Hispan- ics, whereas these groups represent only 12 and 6 percent, respec- tively, of the U.S. population. Even more racial differences are seen for certain groups of AIDS patients. For examples, Blacks and Hispanics account for 72 per- cent of all heterosexual adults with AIDS and 79 percent of all children with AIDS. Approximately two-thirds of Black and His- panic AIDS patients are residents of New York State, New Jersey and Florida. The great majority of adults with AIDS can be placed in one or more transmission categories: homosexual and bisexual men, intra- venous drug abusers, hemophilia patients, transfusion recipients and the heterosexual partners of persons in these groups. Blacks and are over-represented in all of these categories except for hemo- philiacs. Particularly effected are Black and Hispanics IV drug abusers, their sexual partners and children. There are no studies that suggests that Blacks or Hispanics are physiologically more susceptible than whites to infection with the AIDS virus or to the development of AIDS once infected. As with other public health problems, there are undoubtedly many socio- economic and other factors that influence the incidence of AIDS. For example, increased rates of AIDS in Blacks and Hispanics probably reflect behaviors that place them at increased risk for AIDS virus infection. Some of the differences in the national rates of AIDS between minorities and whites may also be a reflection of the racial and ethnic distribution of high AIDS incidence areas. I would like now to touch on some of the things that we are doing or will be doing at CDC to address this important problem. Our major efforts to prevent and control AIDS in minority popula- 61 tions are found in the health education/risk reduction aspects of the prevent projects that we have been funding in all States, terri- tories and selected metropolitan areas. In these 55 programs al- ready underway, 15 have activities aimed at their Hispanic popula- tions and 21 have targeted the information and education services to the Black communities. We recently published new guidelines governing the criteria for continuation of these projects. We established a requirement that applicants State and local health departments must recognize in their applications the problem of AIDS minorities and describe education and outreach plans designed to reach persons at risk in minority communities. Of the 58 cooperative agreements recently received for AIDS prevention support, the overwhelming majority indicated plans to provide a minority health component in their AIDS health education/risk reduction efforts. The Public Health Services, through its AIDS Executive Task Force, coordinates the AIDS prevention and control efforts of the operating agencies, including CDC. The Director of the Office of Minority Health is a member of that task force. I might add that there is also a person at CDC whose sole responsibility is related to the problem of AIDS and minorities. The CDC has funded and will continue to support innovative AIDS risk reduction projects with Narcotic and Drug Research, In- corporated of New York City and Beth Israel Medical Center in the same locality. These projects are targeted to minorities and will test prevention techniques among drug abusers. The CDC also supports a three-part AIDS Community-based Demonstration Project in the New York City area which is focus- ing on AIDS prevention among street addicts, condom usage among women in areas with high prevalence of both AIDS and drug abuse, and prevention of infection among couples when one partner is on methadone maintenance. This project focuses on changing be- haviors that are found to a greater degree in minority populations. Projects in Chicago and in Long Beach, California, also have com- ponents which focus on minorities. The CDC will soon announce the availability of funds for one to three pilot demonstration projects to prevent the perinatal trans- mission of AIDS virus infection. Nearly 90 percent of children who have acquired AIDS through perinatal transmission are Black or Hispanic. Therefore, these projects will focus on individuals from minority communities and particularly on people who use IV drugs or who are the spouses or sexual partners of drug abusers. Additionally, backstopping all of these efforts, is the AIDS Infor- mation/Education Plan to prevent and control AIDS in the United States. Mr. Chairman, I know you know of this plan and I am simply going to allude to it for the record. We realize that the problem of AIDS in minority communities will require some additional targeted efforts. This summer, on behalf of the Public Health Service, CDC will hold a national con- ference to solicit the advice and assistance of experts from minority organizations across the Nation to address the problem of AIDS in minority populations. This conference is tentatively scheduled for August 1987 to take maximum advantage of the information that 62 can be shared and we hope this conference will help us in develop- ing policy for the future. Thank you, sir. [Testimony resumes on p. 77.] [The statement of Mr. Lane and attachment follow:] 63 STATEMENT OF J. MICHAEL LANE, M.D., M.P.H. DIRECTOR CENTER FOR PREVENTION SERVICES CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Hr. Chairman, I am J. Michael Lane, Director of the Center for Prevention Services, Centers for Disease Control (CDC). I am pleased to represent CDC in addressing the issue of AIDS in minorities. AIDS is the Nation's number one public health problem with 34,513 cases and 19,938 deaths having been reported since 1981. To date, the largest number of cases have been concentrated in certain areas such as New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, and Miami. But AIDS is also a national problem, with cases having been reported in every State of the Union. In 1985, AIDS became the eleventh leading cause of potential years of life lost before the age of 65, and provisional data indicate that in 1986 it moved up to the eighth spot. Although there does not appear, based on data currently available, to be a physiological basis for a higher incidence of AIDS in minorities, there is no doubt that blacks and Hispanics are being disproportionately affected by this epidemic. Of the 34,513 AIDS patients reported to the CDC as of April 20, 1987, 24% were black and 14% were Hispanic, whereas these groups represent only 122 and 62, respectively, of the U.S. population. An additional 12 of cases occurred in other minority groups and in individuals of unknown race. The overall cumulative incidences for AIDS in black and Hispanic adults -that is, the number of cases per million population in these racial/ethnic groups - are three times that for white non-Hispanic persons. Even more marked racial differences are seen for certain groups of AIDS patients. For example, blacks and Hispanics account for 722 of all 64 -2- heterosexual adults with AIDS, and 79% of all children with AIDS. Approximately 2/3 of black and Hispanic AIDS patients are residents of New York State, New Jersey, and Florida as compared with only 1/3 of white patients. As you know, the great majority of adults with AIDS can be placed in one or more transmission categories: homosexual and bisexual men, intravenous (IV) drug abusers, hemophilia patients, transfusion recipients, and the heterosexual partners of persons in these groups. Blacks and Hispanics are overrepresented in all of these categories, except for the category of hemophilia patients. Particule y affected are black and Hispanic IV drug abusers, their sexual partners, and their children. It is also of note that in male AIDS patients who have had sexual contact with other men, black and Hispanic men are more likely to be bisexual than white men, most of whom are exclusively homosexual. These bisexual men can infect their female sexual partners with the AIDS virus and, in turn, these women can infect their newborn children. The data I have presented thus far deal only with reported AIDS cases. However, similar results are seen when we examine data on the prevalence of infection with the AIDS virus in certain population groups. Again, blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately affected. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense has tested over 700,000 military recruit applicants for evidence of AIDS virus infection. Rates of infection in black and Hispanic applicants have been 5 and 3 times the rate in white applicants, respectively. Even more striking are-racial differences in infection rates seen for volunteer blood 65 -3- donors. In a study CDC has conducted with American Red Cross Chapters in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Maryland, infection rates in black and Hispanic donors were 15 and 5 times the rate in white donors, respectively. Although neither military recruit applicants nor volunteer blood donors represent the general population, these data support our belief that AIDS virus infection is more common in blacks and Hispanics than whites. As I mentioned earlier, there are no studies that suggest blacks or Hispanics are physiologically more susceptible than whites to infection with the AIDS virus or to the development of AIDS once infected. As with other public health problems, there are undoubtedly many socioeconomic and other factors that influence the incidence of AIDS. For example, increased rates of AIDS in blacks and Hispanics probably reflect behaviors that place them at increased risk for AIDS virus !nfection. Blacks and Hispanics may have higher rates of IV drug abuse than other persons. In a survey of heroin abuse treatment facilities conducted by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1981, 632 of clients were black or Hispanic. In proportion to their numbers in the population, blacks and Hispanics were 9 and 8 times more likely, respectively, to be clients than whites. Some of the difference in the national rates of AIDS between minorities and whites may also be a reflection of the racial and ethnic distribution in high AIDS incidence areas. Even within AIDS risk groups, blacks and Hispanics may be at increased risk. In three separate studies of AIDS virus infection in IV drug abusers, infection rates were approximately three times higher in blacks and Hispanics than in whites. Although the reasons for the difference are unclear, one possible explanation could be that persons tend to share needles with members of their own racial/ethnic groups. Socioeconomic factors also contribute to 66 -4- needle-sharing. These factors would lead to the non-uniform spread of the AIDS virus among IV drug abusers. I would like now to share with you some of the things we are doing or will be doing at CDC to address this important problem. Our major efforts to prevent and control AIDS in minority populations are found in the health education/ risk reduction aspects of the prevention projects that we have been funding in 55 States, territories, and selected metropolitan areas. In these programs already underway, 15 have activities aimed at their Hispanic populations and 21 have targeted information and education services to black communities. Most of these activities to date have focused on fully identifying the AIDS problem in each locality, including an assessment of the extent of needle-sharing locally. Data suggest that needle-sharing practices vary remarkably around the country, and may be a reasonable predictor of the potential for infection among IV drug users. Survey results will guide each community's AIDS education strategy. We recently published new guidelines governing the criteria for continuation of these projects. We established a requirement that applicants--State and local health departments--must recognize in their applications the problem of AIDS in minorities and describe education and outreach plans designed to reach persona at risk in minority communities. Of the 58 cooperative agreements recently received for AIDS prevention support, the overwhelming majority indicated plans to provide a minority health component in their AIDS health 67 -5- education/risk reduction activities. Those who did not will be receiving assistance from CDC in developing a minority component. Some specific examples of the approaches being used might be of interest. Baltimore and New Jersey are using ex-addicts to reach minority street addicts. Additionally they will hire a full-time health educator to focus on minorities .and will enter into a contract with the Haitian Council to provide health education/risk reduction messages to this important minority group. Ohio included black community leaders in planning and delivery of health education/risk reduction messages. Michigan included a complete set of measurable objectives targeted to their minority populations. Georgia has entered into a contract with the Morehouse School of Medicine to provide educational seminars for the minority community. Philadelphia will contract with BEBASHI (Blacks Educating Blacks About Sexual Health Issues) to target testing to the black community and to provide training for black community educators. Los Angeles County has funded two Hispanic organizations to provide family-oriented AIDS education and raise AIDS awareness among Hispanic youth. AIDS Prevention Programs must work closely with the organized segments of the minority communities and develop plans which have the minorities themselves delivering most of the information and messages r :ding AIDS risk reduction, through appropriate messages concerning abstinence and safer sex, through drug abuse counseling, and through serologic testing for the presence of HIV infection. CDC Is communicating this message to r' States. This aspect of the program will more fully mature during FY 1987 as the dimensions of the problem become known, and relationships with minority community organizations become stronger. 68 -6- The Public Health Service, through its AiDS Executive Task Force, coordinates the prevention and control efforts of the operating agencies. The Director of the Office of Minority Health is a member of that Task Force. Effective AIDS education is critical, but it must complement efforts to stop drug abuse altogether. To ensure that close communications are maintained between the CDC and NIDA to coordinate their AIDS control efforts, our agencies have entered into a formal agreement. NIDA has taken major responsibility for activities to control the spread of HIV by focusing on increasing recruitment of IV drug abusers into treatment and educating IV drug abusers regarding AIDS risk reduction. The CDC focus is on ensuring that its grantees provide an appropriate array of educational and public health outreach services for minorities. Both agencies are pursuing practical research to get risk reduction messages across to individuals in the minority communities. CDC has identified an individual within its newly established Office of the Deputy Director for AIDS to serve as liaison with NIDA, and NIDA has a comparable position. I might add that there is also a person at CDC whose sole responsibility is related to the problem of AIDS in minorities. Additionally, CDC staff responsible for training personnel in the States about HIV antibody test counseling have maintained communications with the NIDA Community Research Branch which is coordinating similar training for counselors who work in drug abuje treatment facilities. CDC has funded and will continue to support Innovative AIDS Risk Reduction projects with Narcotic and Drug Research, Inc., of New York City and Beth Israel Medical Center in the same locality. These projects are taFgeted to minorities and will test prevention techniques among drug abusers. 69 -7- CDC also supports a three-part AIDS Community-based Demonstration Project in the New York City area which is focusing on AIDS prevention among street addicts, condom usage among women in areas with high prevalence of both AIDS and drug abuse, and prevention of infection among couples when one partner is on methadone maintenance. This project focuses on changing behaviors that are found to a greater degree in minority populations. Projects in Chicago and Long Beach also have components which focus on minorities. CDC will soon announce the availability of funds for I to 3 pilot demonstration projects to prevent the perinatal transmission of AIDS virus infection. As I pointed out earlier, nearly 90Z of children who have acquired AIDS through perinatal transmission are black or Hispanic. Therefore, these projects will focus on individuals from minority communities, and particularly on people who use IV drugs or who are the spouses or sexual partners of such persons. These pilot projects will probably occur in areas with a high morbidity of AIDS in children. The intention is to develop data to better understand the problem and a methodology for preventing perinatal AIDS which can be used to refine and improve programs across the country. This year CDC is initiating an AIDS school health program. The program is a mix of technical and financial assistance to existing education agencies and organizations, designed to help school and college-aged youth receive information about AIDS and how to prevent infection with the virus. CDC will be funding cooperative agreements with about 10 State education agencies and 12 local education agencies in States and cities that have reported high numbers of cases of AIDS. These projects also require special attention in meeting minority health education needs. 70 -8- We will also provide funds to three local education agencies and one State agency to establish training and demonstration centers for assisting other State and local education agencies in the establishment of effective and appropriate AIDS educational strategies. Among other things, these centers will address how to implement effective AIDS education with consideration of cultural differences. To reinforce the State and local efforts, two cooperative agreements villa be established with national minority organizations to help increase the accessibility and effectiveness of AIDS education. We hope that these organizations will be able to influence the minority community and especially those organizations that serve the interest and educational needs of Black and Hispanic youth. Additionally, backstopping all of these efforts is the AIDS Information/Education Plan to Prevent and Control AIDS in the U.S. A copy of this Plan will be provided for the record. Included in the Plan is the national public information campaign that is being developed, which will have minority aspects, and the national Clearinghouse system which is under development. This latter activity is an effort to establish a network of existing AIDS Clearinghouses, and to provide a mechanism for effectively channeling information to the public through State and local organizations. One aspect of the project will be the identification of culturally sensitive materials that can be used for reaching minority populations. 71 -9- However, we realize that tl~e problem of AIDS in minority populations will require some special targeted efforts. This summer on behalf of the Public Health Service, CDC will host a national conference to solicit the advice and assistance of experts from minority organizations across the Nation to address the problem of AIDS in minority populations. This conference is tentatively scheduled for August 1987 to take maximum advantage of the Information which will be shared at the Third International Conference on AIDS during June in Washington, D.C. The conference on AIDS among minority populations is being designed to raise the awareness of Federal, State and local health education and drug abuse agencies that serve the needs and interests of minority populations about (1) the extent of AIDS and HIV infection, and (2) the prevalence of and factors influencing behaviors that increase the risk of AIDS and HIV infection among minority populations. It will Include discussions of actions that should be taken by Federal, State and local health education and drug abuse agencies, as well as organizations that serve minority populations to help reduce the spread of HIV infection among those populations. Through this meeting, we hope that leaders in the minority community will become more aware of programs and resources that are currently available, that groundwork can be laid for more effective involvement of minority organizations in State and local AIDS prevention efforts, and lastly that we will gain new insights into how to assist minority Individuals who are at risk of becoming infected. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. 72 AImM 183)01 n 109215 tMA Since Jan I 5mlatiw Sin 6 -NJp rva (rv) Drug Abser 569 (11) 4476 (14) 163 (45) 1170 (0) 732 (14) 5646 (17) acasnal Male and IV Drug *AJPe 363 (7) 2607 (a) 363 (7) 2607 (8) H pipldisOaglation Disrder 53 (1) 292 (1) 1 (0) 8 (0) 54 (1) 300 (1) HeteSmal Cases3 85 (2) 63 (2) I4 (28) 666 (29) 189 (3) 13D9 (4) Transfusion, llooda qors a 98 (2) 4A (1) 54 (15) 241 (10) 15 (3) 675 (2) lkdecezuuxm1 (4) 45 (3) 43 (2) 36 (10) 239 (4) uIC (3) suarm.

Thank you very much, Dr. Lane. Dr. Krim. STATEMENT OF MATHILDE KRIM Ms. KRIM. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Leland. What is frightening about AIDS is the deadly nature of the dis- ease of the disease, the fact that it is transmissible, that it is spreading now, including in the heterosexual community, in fact where it spreads now at a faster rate than among the previously identified high-risk groups, and that there is no end in sight to the epidemic. To me, in addition, what is frightening is the quality of informa- tion the public has about this situation, which is appalling. And this applies to every ty'pe of public. AIDS, the public should understand, is a result of a slow, pro- gressive and relentless deterioration of the natural immune de- fense system caused by a viral infection. The virus that causes AIDS is called the Human Immune Deficiency Virus, or HIV. The HIV does not kill directly. What kills is a variety of other infec- tions and cancers to which HIV infected persons progressively lose their resistance and that medicine cannot treat effectively. The HIV infection is for life, once acquired. The human body does not develop resistance to HIV. The HIV is treacherous be- cause it does not cause symptoms immediately. There is a very long incubation period, one that can last many years between infec- tion and the occurrence of clinical symptoms. Since HIV is mainly transmitted sexually in the natural course of things, it is transmitted usually between people who appear healthy and are usually unsuspecting of having been at risk or having become infected. People who transmit HIV can be gay or straight, can be young or old, and can be of any race. In New York, we are suffering a grievous epidemic of HIV infec- tion and AIDS. In Houston, that is already the fourth city in the Nation in this epidemic, as was pointed out earlier, can expect to experience what New York City is experiencing now, unless it acts locally, rapidly and energetically. The HIV was introduced probably in New York among the gay community in the early or midseventies. Because it did not cause disease and nobody was aware of this virus, or AIDS to come sever- al years later, nothing was done about the spreading infection, of course. And by 1981, when the first cases of AIDS occurred, we had already 30 to 50 percent of individuals in the gay community who were infected. In 1983, we knew that AIDS was not a gay disease and we did not act on this information. In 1984, we knew the existence of the causative virus, and we still did not act effectively by warning the people at risk. We forgot that the so-called high-risk groups includ- ed also bisexuals and drug abusers. And these transmitted the in- fection into the larger heterosexual population. Now, in 1987, 40 percent of all cases of AIDS in New York occur among heterosexuals. Ten percent of the cases occur among women. AIDS is the greatest killer of all women between the ages 78 of 25 and 29 years of age in New York. And we have hundreds of sick children. Dr. Joseph, our Commissioner of Health, expect the birth of over 800 babies with HIV infection in 1987 alone, and he has stated that we have half a million people infected with HIV virus. The screening of military recruits done by the Army has re- vealed that in the general population in Manhattan, between the ages of 17 and 25, 1 in 100 is infected. And, if minority group people are selected out among Army recruits, the rate of infection is 1 in 50. Minorities, as we heard already, are much over-represented among all groups affected by HIV infection or AIDS. Nearly 50 per- cent of all cases of AIDS in New York occur among minorities. Sev- enty-five percent of all women with AIDS are minority group women. And 90 percent of all children with AIDS are minority group children. And what is the fate of HIV-infected people? We used to believe that only 10 or 20 or 30 percent of them would develop disease. We now know over the last few months, we have learned that after 6 years, over 50 percent of HIV-infected people develop serious clini- cal symptoms. And because the rates at which infected people become sick each year has remained stable has not decreased yet it is quite possible that, after 10 or 15 years, 100 percent of all people will become sick. There is a silver lining in the AIDS clouds. And this is that there is no casual transmission and that research will certainly be able to do something and bring control of the epidemic with treatment or a vaccine within 5 to 10 years. There is a race going on between research and virus spread at this time, and we are at a very impor- tant crossroads. We have a collective the collective means we have are economic resources and solid information on how the AIDS virus spreads. In- dividually, we have the capacity to understand this information if it is made available, and we have the capability to exercise self-con- trol over our own sexual behavior. The job of educating and changing people's ways can be done, as we have learned, from the self-help organizations in the gay com- munity that have demonstrated that it can be done. There are no countless people in institutions that stand ready to undertake the enormous educational and counseling job that must be done. They must be given the resources to do it. We do have a chance in this country to slow and perhaps even halt the spread of AIDS through education, first, and through the fruits of research later. Our chil- dren will justly hold us accountable and will not forgive us if we do not do the job. Thank you. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Dr. Krim. Dr. Haughton. STATEMENT OF JAMES G. IIAUGIITON Mr. HAUGHTON. Thank you for the opportunity to address you today. I think you will find that my perspective on the problem is slightly different than my colleagues. 79 The AIDS is a serious problem. It is not the only health problem in Houston: and, therefore, as director of Public Health of this city, it has been my responsibility to help keep some perspective on the problem. The 1,135 cases in the Houston AIDS registry include all report- ed cases diagnosed from January 1 of 1980 through April 6 of this year among residents of the Houston Standard Metropolitan Statis- tical Area. That area includes all of Harris County, Montgomery County, Fort Bend, Brazoria, Liberty and Waller Counties. Al- though cases have been reported from each of these counties, Harris County residents account for 95 percent of the total, and Houston residents account for 85 percent of the total of the SMSA cases. Comparisons of the current national statistics on AIDS with those for Houston reveal some interesting differences. And I have provided you with a chart there that shows those differences. Transmission categories, in both cases, in both case series are as- signed according to a nationally standardized system in which,, when there is a case with multiple characteristics, the case is only/ counted in one of the transmission categories. Now, nationally, the largest transmission category is \"Homosex- ual and Bisexual Males,\" which represents 64.2 percent of cases throughout the United States, but 83 percent in Houston. National- ly, the \"Intravenous Drug User\" category is second largest trans- mission category accounting for 17 percent. In Houston, it is 1.7 percent. Houston's second largest transmission category is \"Homo- sexual and Bisexual Male and IV Drug User,\" which is a recently instituted category by CDC and is intended to reflect more accurate the risk status of cases who were previously classified only as ho- mosexual or bisexual male. That group represents 10 percent of all Houston cases and 71/2 percent nationwide. The picture that emerges from these comparisons is one in which IV drug use plays a much larger role in the transmission of AIDS nationwide than it does in Houston. Upon examination of regional statistics, however, it becomes apparent that IV drug use as a soli- tary factor is geographically specific. Approximately 75 percent of all U.S. AIDS cases attributed to IV drug use come from the States of New York and New Jersey. If New York and New Jersey cases are excluded, the percentage of all other U.S. AIDS cases attributa- ble to IV drug use drops from 17 percent to 4.1 percent. Therefore, 4.1 percent seems to be a more accurate description of the contribu- tion of 1V drug use to AIDS in areas of the country other than New York and New Jersey. Even after this adjustment, the Hous- ton value of 1.7 percent is still substantially less than this amended National average. A notable characteristic of the Houston registry is the absence of confirmed cases attributable to hemophilia where there are 313 cases in the national registry and none in the City of Houston. Houston cases also differ from the U.S. cases with respect to sev- eral denvgraphic characteristics. The Houston cases tend to be younger, a: d to consist of a larger percentage of whites and males than the National cases. Both have a high percentage of cases con- centrated in the 30-49 age range: but in Houston 79 \"percent are under 40, while nationally, it is 69 percent that are under 40. In 80 the U.S. registry, 60 percent of cases are white, 25 percent are Black, and 14 percent are Hispanics and 1 percent are categorized as \"Other\" or \"Unknown.\" This leads to the conclusion that Blacks and Hispanics are over-represented among AIDS cases in the United States. In the Houston registry, by comparison, 79 percent of cases are white, 11 percent are Black, 10 percent are Hispanics and less than 1 percent are characterized as \"Other,\" while in the general popu- lation of Houston, 50 percent of the population is white, 27 percent\\ are Black and 20 percent are Hispanics. Minorities are therefore under-represented among AIDS cases in Houston. In Houston, 98 percent of the cases are males, compared to 93 percent nationally. Although the CDC no longer requests the investigation of trans- fusion-associated cases, we still have guidelines from the Texas De- partment of Health. And we still identify those cases. Since the Houston AIDS surveillance began, 29 transmission-associated cases have been investigated by our Bureau of Epidemiology. All of those cases had their beginning prior to the use of the HIV antibody test. There are only eight pediatric cases confirmed in the City of Houston, four of which are white, three are Black and one is His- panic. This is in contrast to the U. S. pediatric cases where the ma- jority of the pediatric cases, more than 50 percent are Black. Five of our pediatric cases acquired their infection from the parents who were at risk of AIDS. There are other areas of controversy within the subject of AIDS, but I have covered them quite thoroughly in the paper I have pre- sented to you and will not take the time to repeat them now. Thank you. [Testimony resumes on p. 120.] [The statement of Mr. Haughton follows:] 81 STATEMfENT OF JAMES G. HAUGHTON AIDS IN HOUSTON, April 1987 Acquired Immune Deficiency /Syndrome (AIDS) was recognized as a new disease entity in Los Angeles and New York City in the summer of 1981. Recognition of the disease, as well as the disease itself, is now widespread. In the United States, additional cases first appeared in other large metropolitan areas, but now every state has reported AIDS cases to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Although Houston was not among the first group of cities to recognize a cluster of cases in 1981, Houston currently has the fourth largest number of confirmed cases. Given the current number of cases reported (April 6, 1987) by New York City (9,382), San Francisco (3,309), and Los Angeles (2,917), Houston is a distant fourth in this ranking with 1,135 cases. This, however, is still an onerous distinction. The 1,135 cases in the Houston AIDS registry include all reported cases diagnosed from January 1, 1980 through April 6, 1987 among residents of the Houston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). The Houston SMSA is comprised of the city of Houston, the remaining areas of Harris County and Montgomery, Fort Bend, Brazoria, Liberty, and Waller counties. Although cases have been reported from each county in the SMSA, Harris County residents account for 95% of the total. Houston residents, account for 85% of all the SMSA cases. Comparisons of the current national statistics on AIDS (April 6, 1987) with those for Houston reveal some interesting differences. Transmission categories in both case series are assigned according to a nationally standardized system, which lists risk factors hierarchically. Cases having 82 multiple characteristics are counted only in the transmission category with greater importance as indicated by its position in the hierarchy. (See Table 1.) Nationally, the largest transmission category is \"Homosexual/Bisexual Male', whici represents 64.2% of other U.S. cases and 83.1% of Houston cases. Nationally, the 'Intravenous (IV) Drug User' category is the second largest transmission category accounting for 17.0% of cases. However, only 1.7% of all Houston cases fall into this category, making it the third largest category in douson. Houston's second largest transmission category is 'Homosexual/Bisexual Male and IV Drug User'. The CDC only recently instituted this category. It is intended to reflect more accurately the risk status of cases who were previously classified in the homosexual/bisexual transmission group, but who also use IV drugs. They represent 10.0% of all Houston cases and 7.5% of cases elsewhere. The picture that emerges from these comparisons is one in which IV drug use plays a much larger role in the transmission of AIDS nationwide than it does in Houston. Upon examination of regional statistics, however, it becomes apparent that IV drug use as a solitary factor is geographically specific. Approximately 75% of all U.S. AIDS cases attributed to IV drug u3e come from the states of Nee York and New Jersey. If New York and New Jersey cases are excluded, the percentage of all other U.S. AIDS cases attributable to IV drug -use drops from 17.0% to 4.11. Therefore, 4.1% seems to be a more accurate description of the contribution of IV drug use to AIDS in areas of the country other than New York or New Jersey. Even after this adjustment. the Houston value of 1.7% is still substantially less than this amended national average. A limited number of local cases have been classified in the transmission categories 'Heterosexual Cases', \"Transfusion Recipient', and \"Parent at Risk for AIDS'. Each of these risk groups constitute a smaller pcrcentage of the 83 .Houston cases than they do nationally. A notable characteristic of the Houston registry is the absence of confirmed cases attributable to hemophilia while there are 313 cases (1%) in the national registry. Although the Bureau of Epidemiology has received several reports of suspect cases among hemophiliacs, none of these have met the CDC case definition. The percentage of cases without an apparent risk factor is often seized upon by those who want to argue that we do not xnow all the means of transmission. Houston's experience is similar to the national with 3.2% among other U.S. cases and 2.5% (29 cases) among Houston cases. Of the 29 Houston cases, twelve have been interviewed and found to have no established risk factors, nine died before interview, three refused a detailed interview, one was lost to follow-up, and four are currently under investigation. Of the 12 cases interviewed, three cases indicated contact with prostitutes as their only probable risk factor. Houston AIDS cases also differ from other U.S. cases with respect to several demographic characteristics. The Houston cases tend to be younger, and to consist of a larger percentage of Whites and males than the national cases. Both have a high percentage of cases concentrated in the 30-49 age range, but in Houston 79% are under 40, while nationally only 69% are under 40. In the-U.S. registry, 60% of cases are White, 25% Black, 14% Hispanic, and 1% Other/Unknown. This leads to the conclusion that Blacks and Hispanics are over-represented among AIDS cases in the U.S. In the Houston registry by comparison, 79% of cases are White, 11% are Black, 10% are Hispanic and less than 1% are categorized as Others while in the general population of Houston 50% are White, 27% are Black and 20% are Hispanic. Minorities are therefore under-represented among AIDS cases in Houston. In Houston, 98% of the cases are males, compared to 93% nationally. 84 The distribution of the major disease groups among Houston cases and national cases differs only slightly. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the disease most frequently associated with AIDS in both. It affects 61% of Houston cases and 65% of U.S. cases. Kaposi's sarcoma occurs in 284 of the Houston cases and 21% of the national cases. Although the CDC no longer requests the investigation of t:ansfusion- associated (TA) AIDS cases, the Texas Department of Health has guidelines for identifying the donors at risk for AIDS in such cases. Since the Houston AIDS surveillance began, 29 TA cases have been investigated by the Bureau of Epidemiology. Of the 15 TA cases among residents of the Houston SMSA, eight have been directly linked to a HIV antibody positive donor, a donor whc is now an AIDS or ARC patient, and/or a donor in a risk group for AIDS. All of the TA cases received their blood products prior to the implementation of stringent screening procedures for AIDS antibody which have been in effect at all U.S. blood banks sirce late Spring, 1S85. The Houston area has 28 confirmed AIDS cases among females. Twenty-three cases are among adults and five are among children. The average age of adult female cases is 37 years. The largest transmission category for adult females in Hou3ton is heterosexual contact, with 9 cases reported. This is not the case nationally where most are attributed to IV drug use. In Houston, five adult female cases are attributed to IV drug use. All five are Black. There are five adult female cases linked to blood transfusions. Four are White females and one is ar. Hispanic female; all received blood products prior to current screening for HIV antibodies now done by all blood centers. The remaining four adult cases are classified a3 \"Unknown Risk Factor\". One female case reported a history involving 15 sexual partners in her lifetime. Another estimated over 300 partners in her lifetime. In all four cases, no 85 male sexual partner was known to the female case as being at risk for AIDS. As of April 6, 1987, there are only eight pediatric cases confirmed with onset of symptoms in Houston. Four (50%) are White, three (38%) are Black and one (13%) is Hispanic. This is in contrast to the U.S. pediatric cases, where the majority of the pediatric cases (56%) are Black. There are three males and five females. Five of the pediatric cases acquired their infections from their parents who were at risk for AIDS'. The remaining three cases acquired their infection from transfusions before the spring of 1985. Houston's low number of pediatric cases may be related to the low number of cases attributed to IV drug use, especially among women. Accuracy of the Data in the AIDS Registry Despite the fact that 1,135 confirmed cases of AIDS with a 65% mortality rate clearly indicates a serious public health problem in Houston, there is a constant concern as to whether or not the AIDS registry accurately describes the disease in this community; describes it in terms of the number of persons affected, as well as the population groups at greatest risk. To understand the accuracy of the descriptive data available from the Houston AIDS registry and its utility for policy making and planning, it is necessary to understand how reporting of all communicable diseases and of AIDS, in particular, actually works. The degree to which any disease is reported to health authorities depends on a multitude of factors. Perhaps the most important is whether or not the disease is required to be reported by state health regulations. Without such a requirement, physicians and hospitals will be very reluctant to provide detailed information without the patient's consent for fear of violating I 86 patient confidentiality. If there is a large, obvious outbreak where detailed patient information is needed to minimize the spread of disease, the broad powers of the local or state health authority can be Invoked to overcome this reluctance. This also provides legal protection for physicians who do release germane patient information to health authorities during a short term emergency. Once a disease is added to the list of reportable diseases, there are several practical considerations that will determine the degree to which cases will actually be reported. A key factor that encourages reporting is a genuine feeling among those required to report that reporting each and every case will help local health officials limit subsequent spread of the disease. Other considerations that encourage reporting include requiring only an extremely limited number of data items, so the time and effort required to report a case is minimal; and not requiring information about sexual practices and drug use. Reporting is also Fess difficult if the risk factors associated with acquiring the disease are not associated with any social stigmas. Although AIDS is a reportable disease in Texas it is easy to understand why some might conclude that AIDS is a poorly reported disease. First, few physicians believe that reporting any or all of their cases will help stop the spread of AIDS, because there is neither a vaccine for unexposed persons nor a preventive treatment for contacts already exposed to a case. Second, the information required to mesh a diagnosis of AIDS with the CDC definition can be rather detailed. Finally, personal information regarding sexual preference and drug use is required to complete each case report, and the most commonly reported risk behaviors are associated with significant social stigmas. Despite all this, AIDS is probably the most thoroughly reported communicable disease in Houston and in the U.S. The most important, but S 87 unfortunate, factor for thorough reporting is the very predictable course of the disease that eventually results in each case being hospitalized, at least once. Therefore, if a physician does not report cases among their clinic patients who are in the early stages of the disease, the case will be reported when that patient is admitted to the hospital. This delays the reporting of some cases, but they will eventually be reported. Our documentation regarding the completeness of hospital reporting of confirmed AIDS cases in Houston is formidable. On a monthly basis, all death certificates filed with the Bureau of Vital Statistics are reviewed for deaths due to 18 different causes which may be related to AIDS. This process has identified an occasional case which had not previously been reported, but more importantly, has identified hospitals which had not been reporting cases. In an equivalent vein, the Bureau of Epidemiology also reviews the reporting performance of some 50 acute-care hospitals in the Houston area for five of the most commonly reported communicable diseases. Hospitals with significantly lower reporting rates of selected reportable diseases relative to comparably sized hospitals are identified as having a potential reporting problem. The infection control officers of these hospitals, and those of hospitals having discrepancies between case reports and death certificates, are contacted. They are informed-of their responsibility to report as prescribed by state regulations, and of the need for accurate information about AIDS cases in order to monitor trends of transmission of the disease and to plan for care facilities of projected cases. In the one situation where this approach did not correct reporting problems, hospital officials were advised that steps could and would be initiated to have their Medicare certification revoked by the state for not being in compliance with all applicable state and local regulations. The problem was quickly rectified. 88 Additional documentation of nearly complete hospital-based reporting comes from two record validation studies. Two hospitals have undergone validation studies, one in 1985 and one in 1986, to assess surveillance. A third study at another hospital is currently in progress. In 1985, a validation study was done at one of the county hospitals. This hospital is a 467 bed general hospital which is part of the Harris County Hospital District. The hospital district provides indigent care. Printouts of 1984 patient discharge diagnoses suggestive of AIDS were reviewed. Eighty-five cases had codes suggestive of AIDS. Fourteen of these patients were found in our registry. Ten cases were reported by the hospital and four by other sources. The remaining cases were pared down to 28 patients for whom chart reviews were conducted to determine if any of these patients should be reported as AIDS cases. After reviewing these charts, one patient was identified and classified as a suspect/presumptive AIDS patient. This patient is an IV drug user with empirically treated (not confirmed) Candida esophagitis. Nonetheless, this was the only case who should have been reported by the hospital and was not.\\ \\ A validation study was also conducted at a 700 bed hospital with a long history of underreporting communicable diseases. This history of underreporting was carefully documented for AIDS and several other reportable diseases over a 3 month period. The hospital administration was then presented with this documentation and was persuaded to assist with a record validation study. This validation study covered all reportable diseases since January 1986. Pathology reports and medical record codes back to March 1983 were reviewed for illness associated with AIDS. Prior to this study, 7 of this hospital's cases had been identified from other sources, but were still 8 89 incomplete for reporting purposes. These 7 were identified and completed due to the validation study. Ten new cases were reported after communication was reestablished with this hospital. Up to a year had elapsed from date of diagnosis to report for some of these cases. From the validation study itself, 6 cases were discovered that had never been reported. Therefore, at this time, a total of 23 AIDS cases have been completed and reported due to f. these negotiations with this hospital. For more than a year, this hospital has been an excellent reporting hospital. In the process of this second record validation study-, an often discussed reporting phenomenon, the duplication of cases in informal case counts, was documented. With the hospital in question, several physicians estimated that possibly 200 AIDS patients had been admitted since 1983 and few, if any, had been reported. In the final analysis, approximately 50 patients had been admitted, but, only six unreported cases were discovered by the validation study. The other cases had all been reported by other physicians and hospitals. Apparently, AIDS patients typically seek numerous clinical opinions. This results in a high level of reporting even if a limited number of care providers do not regularly report. This multiple opinion phenomeno is also the basic cause of highly exaggerated informal case counts. Each physician counts his or her cases without knowing which patients may have been seen by several other physicians. These other physicians also count these cases in their informal tallies. Still, with all these indications of good or improved reporting compliance, without continuing encouragement and periodic feedback to those who report, compliance would deteriorate. To maintain regular contact a monthly AIDS Information Up-ate was initiated and sent to all hospital reporting officers and physicians who have reported AIDS cases. The first 9 90 issue was mailed January 1985 to approximately 50 persons. Currently, nearly 200 updates are mailed each month. The updates contain detailed statistical summaries of the Houston case registry, and an original narrative pointing out trends in the data or new developments in the CDC case definition. (See Attachment A.) The preceding, however, applies only to the reporting of confirmed cases. Persons with symptoms consistent with AIDS, but who do not meet the CDC definition are not routinely reported even though they could be Included under the state requirements for reporting. Persons who are HIV antibody positive bu lacking significant symptoms, are not to be reported according to current policies of the Texas Department of Health. This situation, which is typical of AIDS reporting in the U.S. in all but a few isolated locations, requires resource planners to make projections based on some multiple of the number of confirmed AIDS cases. Given the diligent efforts of the Bureau of Epidemiology in achieving a high level of reporting compliance, numerical projections based on the Houston AIDS case registry will not be compromised by the quality of the registry effort. Rate of Increase One of the more controversial aspects of AIDS involves the projections to estimate the number of future cases. Varying projections have been made. The Surgeon General's report contains an estisiate of 270,000 cases of AIDS by the end of 1991 with 179,000 deaths. Other projections, if adhered to would soon project more U.S. cases than the country has population. One point of certain r- agreement is that the number of cases will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. 10 91 Although the official estimates published by the CDC are among the most realistic, they are probably overestimates. Quoting from the CDC paper published in the September-October 1996 issue of Public Health Reports, the author's concede that their models are \"empirical in the sense that they reflect observed trends in the distribution of reported cases and assume these trends will continue unchanged over time.\" Although mathematical models can't sense change in the at risk population, public health officials and elected officials have to recognize changes as they begin to occur. There are already strong indications that these projections are inaccurate. For example, CDC projected 34,090 to be diagnosed by the end of 1986. After allowing three full months (January through March, 1987) for receipt of delayed reports, 32,081 cases had actually been diagnosed through April 6, 1987. Only the case counts for 1986 were estimated in this projection; the remaining cases in this total were actual case counts. Therefore, when attention is focused on the actual projection of 15,800 to be diagnosed in 1986, it is found that the actual number reported for that year by April 6, 1987 is 12,732 or 201 less than expected. It is even below CDC's lower bound for 14,800 estimated cases. Given such an error in the first interval, with five additional intervals estimated, the 1991 estimate of 270,000 case needs to be revised downward. There are two reasons why the model overestimated the cases. First is that the cases of AIDS being seen right now are primarily the result of activity which transpired two, four, or six years ago among homosexual males and IV drug users engaging with great frequency in practices that are very effective in transmitting the AIDS virus from one person to another. In short, these are persons who have lived in the \"fast lane\" of their respective lifestyles. Other homosexual males may not have been exposed to the virus 11 92 because they limited their number of contacts, were very selective, or were extremely lucky. The second reason is that behavior did change as-the seriousness of the situation began to be realized in 1984 and 1985. Many homosexual males became much more cautious. Certainly the warnings of AIDS spreading heterosexually have also had a dramatic chilling effect on the level of sexual activity among sexually active singles. These two factors may ultimately result in a significantly lower number of cases than the 270,000 projected for 1991. In Houston, the trends of the disease over the past three years have been tracked. The first case was diagnosed retrospectively in the second half of 1980. Since the first half of 1982, the number of cases diagnosed has increased for each six-month interval to reach a high of 247 diagnosed in the first half of 1986. The totals for late 1986 and early 1987 are not yet complete, but both will probably exceed 250 cases each. (See Figure 1.) Although the number of cases diagnosed Curing each half-year period will continue to increase for the foreseeable future, a slowing in the rate of increase of newly diagnosed cases has been noted. (See Table 2.) In 1983, the number of new cases diagnosed represented a 3271 increase from 1982. For 1984, the percentage of increase was 126%. For 1985, it was 86%. For 1986 it was 45%. With any luck, this trend, in terms of rate of increase, will continue and changes in personal behaviors which began occurring several years ago will speed this trend. 12 105 ATTACHMENT A AIDS INFORMATION UPDATE: APRIL 1987 This month's report shows the addition or 57 cases or confirmed AIDS In theHouston area over last month. Among the additions, there are two new eases due totransfusions and two new pediatric cases due to parents being at risk for AIDS. Two New Cases or Transfusion-Associated AIDS Both cases occurred in Houston area women who received blood components in late 1982 and early 1983. This was prior to the implementation of stringent screeningprocedures for AIDS which have been in effect at all U.S. blood banks since the spring of 1985. One white female was over 60 years of age and received six unitsor red blood cells in early 1983. r Four years later, she developed anopportunistic infection diagnostic or AIDS and expired. She was HIV antibodypositive. One of the six donors reported a history of homosexual activity. Thesecond patient is an Hispanic female in her twenties and has no other risks forAIDS except receiving two units of red blood cells in late 1982.: Thre and onehalf years after these transfusions, she was diagnosed with AIDS and was HIVantibody positive. To date, a specific donor at risk for AIDS has not been identified. Transfusion-associated cases are those In which no risk factors for AIDS areidentified other than receiving blood products via transfusion. When these casesare reported, the Bureau of Epidemiology Investigates transfusion-assoolated AIDScases to identify any donors at risk for AIDS. In order to rule out a transfusion as the source of infection, all donors must be found to be HIV antibodynegative. If any of the donors cannot be located or tested, then a case Is stillconsidered transfusion-associated in the absence of other risks for AIDS. Two New Cases of Pediatric AIDS One of the new pediatric cases is a white male child under the age of three whosemother now has AIDS. The child showed signs or illness within the first fourmonths of life, was confirmed with AIDS one year later, and expired. The mother was diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia late last year and is HIVantibody positive. She has been interviewed and reports no risks for AIDS other than heterosexual contact. Although there is no direct evidence, it is probable that she was exposed through heterosexual contact. The second new pediatric case involves an Hispanic female child under the age offive whose parents are both at risk for AIDS. The child did not show signs orillness until the fourth year of life and Was diagnosed with an opportunisticinfection of AIDS. She is still living. The father of the child reported ahistory of IV drug use but was HIV antibody negative at latest testing. All thesiblings In the family are HIV antibody negative. The mother, however, wastransfused one month before delivery (in 1982) with two units of red blood cells and is HIV antibody positive. The \"Look-Back\" Program undertaken by bloodcollection centers has identified one of her donors as HIV antibody positive.

The responsibility of medical care has been mandated by state charter to the Harris County Hospital District. Thus, all indigent care for Harris County residents is provided by Ben Taub General Hospital and Jefferson Davis Hospital. These two hospitals currently provide in-patient care for AIDS and ARC patients who are without funds. Other patients with AIDS who have insurance are cared for at many of Houston's private hospitals. Out- patient care, social services, and information and referral is provided by many agencies in Houston.

This left 222 cases that have been interviewed. Approximately 102 of these reported multiple sexually transmitted disease (STD) and/or sexual contact with prostitutes. While this does not put them Into an official high-risk group, it does indicate a history of multiple sexual partners. The remaining 120 cases reported no behaviors to account for their having AIDS. This could be because they do not know the history of all their sexual partners for the last 5 to 7 years any of whom could have been Infectious. These MIR cases represent only 0.4% (120/33,245 adult cases) of the total adult case series. This data has proved to be very effective in convincing the public that AIDS is not spread by casual contact. Variations of this presentation have been presented to a subcommittee of Houston City Council, dozens of groups of health professionals, administrators and nurses of the majority of schools in the city's largest school district, employee groups of numerous local companies, and dozens of church groups. A weekend feature highlighting this data was published In one of the daily newspapers along with regular updates on AIDS ir, both major local newspapers. Apparently, the message that AIDS cannot be spread by casual contact hat taken hold in Houston, since Issues similar to the health card initiat \u00b0 :ave not resurfaced in more than two years. The other part of health education is going to be uch more difficult. This challenge is to educate all segments of the population who are sexually active on how to avoid or minimize the risk of acquiring AIDS. Sending a safe-sex brochure to every Houstonian over the age of 18 will not be effective. Instead, efforts should be placed in public service announcements on television and radio, backed up by information hotlines and a carefully selected inventory of brochures. To reach teenagers who are becoming sexually active, health education programs in school need to incorporate segments on how to avoid exposure to the AIDS virus. Programs are being implemented by local school districts and the largest district is involving epidemiologists from the Health Department in the development of these programs. These efforts through mass media ard in the schools present the best chances of limiting the spread of this disease In Houston. 17 96 recently occurred in Houston where, for very different reasons, gay community advocates and very conservative political advocates both began sounding an alarm that AlIN was going to \"spread liki wildf!re\" through the heterosexual population. One group's solution was to have government spend more money on AIDS programs. The other group's solution was to lock up all persons in high- risk groups. The first tangible proposal by this second group was to reinstitute health cards for all foodhandlers in ouston. Given the cost of such testing, the nmber of foodhandlers, and the proposed schedule of testing, the .cot to consumers was estimated to have been $33 million per year in Eouston alone. Therefore, the Health Department's first major educational challenge was to accurately and convincingly assure elected officials and the public that AIDS is not spread by casual contact. The following presentation of the key epidemiologic data was used to convince a vast majority of Houstonians that AIDS is not spread by casual contact. First, the major risk groups in the national case series are described and how sexual behaviors, IV drug use, and transfusf.ons were indeed the most probable risk factors for 96.8% of all 33,720 reported cases. Second, attention was focused on the miscellaneous risk category of cases whose risk factors were designated as \"Other/Unknown at this time'. As of April 6, 1987 a total of 1,053 no identified risk (MHI) cases were in this category. Since 1901, 1,621 cases have been initially reported with no identified risk factor. Of these, 560 were reclassified to an official risk group when further information was obtained. The remaining cases (1053) were listed as NIR. Within that group, 236 cases could not be interviewed. They either refused the interview, or died, or became lost to follow-up before an interview could be conducted. Of the remaining 817 cases, 595 were still 16 95 data. However, data on the actual number exposed in the general population is unknown. Estimates by the CC are that I to 2 million people may be infected in the United States. Education In the fight against AIDS, the most powerful weapon is education. Care must be taken, however, to be extremely efficient and deliberate in those educational efforts. Given the magnitude of the challenge to educate, billions of dollars could easily be wasted by trying to deliver the critical information through ineffective means that produce little or no impact. There is an unfortunate trend for every involved group to have their own AIDS information pamphlet carrying their own logo. The growth of this vanity presa activity should not be funded by taxpayers' dollars. Instead, the minimum requirements for printed material could be met by a limited number of brochures or booklets that are closely reviewed by scientific, educational, and advertising panels, then endorsed by a limited number of highly respected national organizations, such as the U.S. Public Health Service or the National Red Cross. A critical issue is to balance the information In the educational messages. Some are of the opinion that they should Oscare the hell out of the public'. Unfortunately, many simply ignore messages that are perceived to be overly dramatic or shocking. An example from the past is when teenagers were shown the bloody details of motor vehicle accidents in order to scare them into becoming safe drivers. It didn't produce the desired effect, as documented by post-screening surveys. With AIDS, there Is a risk of not only numbing the intended target audience, but also provoking completely unproductive reactions. A situation 15 94 virus. Results and a description of those seeking the test since December 1986 are presented in Table 3. This table does not represent the overall aeropositivity reported above, only a selected two month period of testing. The HIV antibody prevalence at blood collection centers in Bouston represents another, yet quite different segment of the population. Since June 1985. all local blood banks have tested every unit of donated blood for the HIV antibody. Previous to this testing, voluntary deferral programs were implemented to strongly discourage high-risk indivi~als from donating blood. This deferral program includes a questionnaire in addition to a confidential way of designating whether the donation should be used for transfusion or for research. both the voluntary deferral system and the donor designation are still utilized in conjunction with YIV antibody testing. From June 1985 to December 1986, -Ae large local blood collection center had tasted 296,023 units of blood. Of the 294,987 units designated by the donors to be used for transfusion, 151 or 0.05% were HIV antibody positive. These units were destroyed and not used for transfusion. The low prevalence of 0.050 represents either rare false-positive reactions, even with Western Blot confirmation, or exposure among people who believe themselves not to be at risk for AIDS. (Sao Table 4.) The prevalence is higher (0.8%) among those who designated their donation to be used for research. The higher prevalence among this group is probably due to a limited number of persons who suspected that they may be at risk for AIDSO but because of circumstances (i.e. group donations) felt uncomfortable in declining to donate. Data from these two highly selected groups of people indicates that the prevalence of HIV exposure in Houston varies greatly with the group tested. The true prevalence among the entire Houston population is probably underestimated from blood center data and overestimated by Montrose Clinic 14 93 AIDS Ant.ibod Screening In Houston, HIV antibody testing is provided to the public in three settings. The Montrose Clinic Alternate Test Site provides free and anonymous testing. The institute for Immunological Disorders offers testing for a tee of $30.00 to $40.00. Private physicians in conjunction with reference laboratories also provide testing at varying costs. Routine testing is also performed at all blood collection centers and donor banks, but these are not considered public screening sites. The Montrose Clinic Alternate Test Site was established to provide a testing facility where persons concerned about possible exposure to the AIDS virus could be tested away from the blood bank setting. The clinic provides pre- and post-test counseling for all clients. Ho names are taken and no personal identifiers are kept. Each client is given a number and must return a week later, in person, for test results and counseling. Since December 1986 a more detailed, but still anonymous, questionnaire has been Implemented to assess risks and the demographics of those tested. For the purpose of testing, the risk categories are: homosexual/bisexual sales, intravenous (IV) drug users, hoaosexual/bisexual sales who also use IV drugs, heterosexual partners of the above categories, and others (low risk). Antibodies (IlV) have been detected in 301 of the high-risk persons and 31 of the low-risk persons tested at the Montrose Clinic. This rate is based on 3,999 high-risk people and 1,081 low-risk people tested since mid-1985. In recent months, the clinic has noticed a large increase in the number of heterosexuals interested in knowing their antibody status. Some are past or current sexual partners of people at risk for AIDS, including heterosexual contacts of female prostitutes. Others do not report any known risks and represent sexually active heterosexuals who are worried about exposure to the 13 .1 -H_ -1 i l II1 \" f, =4zv mw tK A OF CASES Mmovivopwi w1wo&-twomexud nm OF U.Se ADS CASES as of P#d 44 law r.

The most important message that we need to convey to people is: AIDS is preventable. But the type of partnership that is required to prevent the spread of AIDS is not happening in Houston nor in Texas. That is between the private sector and the Government. Two days after Surgeon General Coop addressed a joint session of the Texas Legislature, the House Appropriations Committee voted to allocate not one cent to AIDS education, nor to the State Health Department's request for their AIDS program. The city of Houston has spent only $21,000 on education between October of 1984 and the present on education. The county which provides hospital care and social services will be over-burdened if the predictions come true of 9,000 cases in Harris County by 1991. I listened to Dr. Haughton this morning, and, in my heart, I would really like to believe what he is saying. But, in my head, I know it is not true. We, in Houston, cannot think that we will avoid the cases into the heterosexual population, the minority com- munities, the women, and the cases in children thet other cities have experienced. It would be a miracle if that happened, but; unfortunately, mir- acles do not happen in Houston, TX. We, at the Foundation, have understood and have been con- cerned about the effect of AIDS on minority women and children. We know that it will take a targeted, educational program to reach Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, women; and, in truth, every person in Houston. But, again, this takes funding. What we need is your help. Today, not one Federal dollar has come to Houston for education or patient care. That same effort that is given to securing funding for NASA or the same planning that goes into bringing a superconductor to Texas is needed on the AIDS crisis in Texas. We will provide the expertise, the knowledge, the energy, the work, the volunteers, of which, we have 500 at our Foundation, in help preventing this disease and caring for people with AIDS, if you will provide us in Texas with the money that we sorely need. You, the Federal Government, are our only help at this point. The funding is not going to be made available from the State, city or county. We will continue to raise money from the private sector; but we realize these dollars are limited, especially given the state of economy in Houston.Without your assistance, women, children, minorities will unfor- tunately experience the same pain and suffering and loss that we have felt in the gay community I can tell you from a very personal standpoint: I do not want that to happen. Thank you. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much. Mr. Kihnel. STATEMENT OF CHRIS KIHNEL Mr. KIHNEL. Distinguished Congressmen Leland, Fields, Chair- man Waxman, thank you for having me. If I had known the con- text of Dr. Haughton's testimony today, as a Texan, I would have worn my boots. 132 Counseling services are non-existent and essential to the psycho- logical well-being of minorities. Counseling is needed to help mi- norities in dealing with the stigma surrounding the common forms of infection and the idea of death, which is so much a part of this disease. That is basically it. Thank you. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much for your testimony. Ms. Sue Lovell. STATEMENT OF SUE ILOVEILI MS. LOVELL. Chairman Waxman, Congressman Leland, Fields, I welcome you to-back to Houston. It is nice to have you here. My name is Sue Lovell. I am a board member of the Texas Human Rights Foundation, a member of the Commissioner's State Health Task Force on AIDS, and a member of the AIDS Founda- tion, Houston, for the past 5 years. As I said, I am glad to see you here today because, quite truthful- ly, we need your help. The AIDS Foundation is the primary main- stream AIDS service provider in the city of Houston, the fourth most impacted city in the United States with AIDS cases. I would like, at this time, just briefly to recognize two other serv- ice providers in the audience: Eleanor Munger, who started Omega House, which is a hospice where people can go and die with digni- ty. And Sister Patricia, who is-started the Children's Home, which is a home where children that have no where to go, with AIDS can live. They share the same common goals and frustrations that we do at the AIDS Foundation. I gave a lot of thought, today, to what I wanted to say to you. I would like to be able to say that the AIDS Foundation is doing an excellent job; but I cannot. We are doing the best job we can with the resources available. Since the AIDS Foundation was started in 1981, our two main purposes were to provide social services for people with AIDS and education. Our social services program currently serves 400 clients. Our program includes a buddy system, transportation assistance,rent subsidies a hospital helper team, Stone Soup, our food bank, and Macadory House, a home for indigent PWA's, which is now at full capacity-excuse me. Which is at full capacity and recently had to turn away two people that needed assistance in housing. We currently have 72 new clients that are waiting intake to become clients of the Foundation. We have one paid staff member that oversees this whole program. Our education program consists of a hot line,- a speaker's bureau, which we are the ones that receives the calls to go to Baytown and Waller and League City, and all the other outlying areas. We have done workshops. We have seven different brochures. We were the first foundation in the United States to start a safe sex risk reduc- tion program. In the past year, we have hired a minority educator, with funding made available from grants through the U.S. Confer- ence of Mayors and the Chicago Resource Center. I could go into greater detail about our education efforts and would like to do so because everybody likes to boast about your ac- complishments. But I would be missing a very important point. 131 We did a resource guide that we took into the community. We had it published in one of the major publications. \"Y Por Nation.\" And what we got was a series of phniie calls that was really dis- turbing. One was from a non-English speaking mother of three who was worried about her husband's drug-IV drug abuse. All we could do was refer her to the Montrose Clinic. And then she said she could not talk to anyone at the Foundation. But she finally found someone to talk to. She was scared for herself and for her children. I mean she just had no idea of what was involved with this. A mono-lingual, Spanish-speaking homosexual male feared that a health problem he was having had to do with AIDS. And he was not sure and he could not find anywhere to go to find out if it was or not. A mono-lingual mother worried about her husband's extra-mari- tal affairs, which she suspected included men. This woman was ex- tremely upset. She was frightened and worried that her condition might be having an adverse effect on her children. And, again, no counseling. No anything for this group of people. A non-English speaking Chicano, unmarried and childless, living with a middle-aged Black male, both of whom are IV drug users, is also worried about AIDS. She is worried because she does not quite understand the problem and she suspects that something is wrong with her own body. We informed her about the hours of the Mon- trose Clinic and referred her there. This is just a sample of the calls that we have received in the wake of the publication of the resource guide. These Latinos have called us because we are the only available Hispanic-based organi- zation doing anything about AIDS prevention and awareness in this city. The resource guide and the workshop were completely funded by GLHU event held during New Year's Eve, which just raised a little over $400. What these projects did uncover was the ignorance and lack of material about AIDS which has gone into the Latino com- munity here. It is an injustice to keep the Latino community in the dark about this disease. It is as if we do not exist. This is a sophisticated form of racism. Not giving minorities the chance and the efforts of AIDS preven- tion is an insidious form of racism which is the most difficult to confront. Latinos need a mass media campaign about AIDS prevention and awareness. The media campaign must be in Spanish to insure that it reaches every facet of the Latino community, especially the par- ents of Latinos, who, according to most demographic studies, are most comfortable with Spanish language material. The need for minority based agencies to do the actual work of minority AIDS education is crucial. The existing AIDS service pro- viders are structured to meet the needs of the white, gay males. Latino PWA's, on the other hand, are made up of a more diverse group of people, including women and children. All AIDS services for minorities must be upscaled because of the shorter life span of minority PWA's, which, nationally, is 6 weeks for Latino PWA's, as opposed to 2 years for everyone else. 130 accurate, they are bad figures and something needs to be done about. I am glad to see the Government now at least beginning to follow up on this. Congressman Leland knows very well, as one who is concerned about both health and hunger, that quite frequently those concerns begin with people like entertainers. And then, final- ly, the people who are supposed to be our elected leaders follow suit. So, I am glad to see the Government at least expressing some interest in this. I am wondering if it is not possible to get the public school-and public school systems all have some kind of Federal funds-to rec- ognize that this ought to be some kind of budget priority for them, serious budget priority for them. I am wondering whether or not we ought not to be able to convince the media, which has to be reg- ulated by the Federal agency, that some of their public service time probably needs to be given to something else besides church programs. And I am glad about church programs, but I think that at least some of that public service time needs to be mandated for some way of getting to people who otherwise would not call up about AIDS. My hope is that there can be an aggressive program involving Federal money, State money, local money and private money. And I think that at this point, the governments also have some kind, some kind of leverage on those companies that have Federal con- tracts. I think that there are ways, at least of getting people involved. And my hope is that there can be the kind of involvement that can say, \"We think that AIDS is a serious problem. It is a serious prob- lem enough so that we can spend some concern and some dollars on it.\" I wish that I could say something that would be a lot more schoi- arly about it, but I think that you have a lot of scholarship. Mine is just the concern of a Black man and a pastor. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much. Let me suggest to the audience that it would be, I think, prefera- ble not to applaud. I think it takes away from some of the demean- or of the hearing and, then, if you applaud when you like a state- ment. Then, there is an inclination to boo when you do not. And then it gets to be more of a circus than a congressional hearing. But I, if I thought we ought to applaud at a hearing, I certainly would applaud that statement. It was an excellent one. Thank you very much, Reverend Lawson. I would like to now call on Mr. Perez. STATEMENT OF JOSE PEREZ Mr. PEREZ. Yes. I am from the Gay and Lesbian Hispanics Unidas. Mr. WAXMAN. Could you speak up? Mr. PEREZ. Sure. I am from the Gay and Lesbian Hispanics Unidas. And we began our AIDS education, Latina Community Prevention and Awareness Program, last year, with the AIDS Foundation of Houston. And one of the things that we found was that nobody knows anything about AIDS in this Latino community. 129 body has any question that that it is of somewhat disastrous pro- portions. I, as a pastor, am doubly concerned. First, because as a Black man, my background is in Africa, from which much of the AIDS problem seems to have come. And, as a pastor, we are very much concerned about our mission in the field which is in Haiti, which is also a center of much of the AIDS problem right now. Our concern about AIDS as it has an effect on minorities, Blacks and Hispanics, particularly, is one that says that there is, right now, still not enough concern being expressed and we are iery grateful to this subcommittee for having this hearing and for giving an opportunity for the several perspectives that are being presented here. But it seems to me that what we first have to realize is that we are still looking at AIDS far too negatively. We are thinking of it as something that does involve a certain kind of bad risk communi- ty. And, whether we limit it to gays and drug users or whether we think of some other high-risk groups, we have to realize that it is also now infecting people who are neither gays nor drug users. It is now even infecting babies. And it seems to me that anything that has over 1,000 cases in Houston is certainly in the nature of some kind of an epidemic. And it bothers me that I hear the city of Houston and the State of Texas saying that it is something that we can simply throw $100,000 at. That is probably about the cost of one bus to run our streets. That does not do a whole lot for this kind of disease. And my concern is that many of the people who need the kind of educa- tion are not now getting it. I listened to Dr. Haughton, just a few moments ago, saying that the city of Houston Public Health Department is doing a great deal in the area of AIDS education; but, as I deal with people in the ghetto, my feeling is that probably most of them would not go to the Public Health Department. And, so, it does not surprise me that there would be only nine phone calls that came in. When, on the other hand, they see something like the AIDS Foundation, which is a private group, that then rings a bell. And, so, they prob- ably would be making contact with them. I think that there needs to be, quite clearly, a real priority placed on some kind of education. And there needs to be, likewise, some priority on treatment. It is not true that Blacks and Hispan- ics and other groups within the poverty community can take care of all of the needs involved in either learning about or treating AIDS. And my hope is that there can be some kind of collusion be- tween government and the private sector that can work this out. I would certainly agree with Congressman Leland that if we need to trim from any place, we probably need to trim from the Penta- gon enough money to deal with something that is killing our people at this high rate. Some of the words that I have heard is that, while we may have about 14,000 AIDS cases, we have go something like a million people who have been actually infected with that disease, but are not considered confirmed AIDS cases. I do not know whether those figures are right or wrong, but I know that even if they are not 128 er. That is the only contact that I have had from outside the city of Houston. Mr. FIELDS. Sir, just in closing, you know, we as a Nation found apreventative cure for polio. We had a national resolve to put aperson on the moon. And it seems that we need that same type of resolve in this particular situation. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much. We certainly do need ahigher resolve to deal with all the ramifications of this AIDS epi- demic. I want to thank the three of you for your presentation to us.We appreciate it very much. We look forward to discussing the issues further with you. Thank you. I understand that we are going to have a microphone for the wit-nesses. It is being set up right now. So, we will wait a second before we call the next panel. [Pause.] I think we are ready now to start, again. For our next panel, Iwould like to ask the following people to come forward: Reverend William Lawson from the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church; Mr. Jose Perez, Gay and Lesbian Hispanics Unidas, here in Houston; Ms. Sue Lovell, Board of Directors, AIDS Foundation, and Mr.Chris Kihnel, President of People with AIDS Coalition. If youwould please come forward and take seats in this area with the microphones. We want to welcome you to our hearing this morning. We arepleased that you are here. Your prepared statements will be part ofthe record in full. We would like to ask you, if you would, to sum-marize in nc more than 5 minutes, and when the bell goes off, wewould like you to conclude your statement at that point. We would like to start with Reverend Lawson. As I understand, the way the-the one-there is only one microphone. And, so, after you have concluded, just pass it along and we will hear from theother witnesses. I understand some of the audience are havingtrouble with hearing the witnesses. So, if you will pass the mike, it will be helpful. Reverend Lawson, pleased to welcome you. STATEMENTS OF REVEREND WILLIAM LAWSON, WHEELER AVENUE BAPTIST CHURCH; JOSE PEREZ, GAY AND LESBIAN HISPANICS UNIDAS; SUE LOVELL, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AIDS FOUNDATION; AND CHRIS KIHNEL, PRESIDENT, PEOPLE WITH AIDS COALITION Mr. LAWSON. Mr. Chairman, and to Congressmen Leland andFields, I will probably be able to give you back part of this 5 min- utes. Mr. WAXMAN. Speak up. There we go.Mr. LAWSON. I am probably the only one of the experts who istotally inexpert. I am a pastor and do not have access to all of thestatistics and all of the data that some of my honorable colleagues have. Can you still not hear me? You law folks tell me that you have to eat mikes.I think that it goes without saying that all of us are concernedabout what is quite clearly an epidemic. I do not think that any- 127 got in touch with us as soon as Dr. Koop made that presentation and asked us to assist them in developing a program to reach their children. Since then, we have trained all 200 of their principals. We have helped them, together with Texas Children's Hospital and the In- stitute for Immunological Disorders to create a 1-hour training film for their teachers. And we are now in the process of conducting seminars for groups of 20 to 30 of their teachers and school nurses. And they have begun three pilot projects in three middle schools in the city of Houston-Houston Independent School District to imple- ment that program of teaching young people about family life, about the problems of AIDS and how to protect themselves. Mr. FIELDS. Besides school groups, do you feel that there has been a response. Is there solicitation of you for your speakers to come out and provide better information for the communities? Mr. HAUGHTON. Yes. We have had a large number of requests from, more recently, employee groups. Employers are asking us to come make presentations to a group of their employees. We spoke to the Marriott Hotel chain employees, to several banks, to the flood control district. So, we get a lot of such calls. A lot of congre- gations are calling us to speak to their church-related groups, both their young people groups as well as their full congregation. So, the word is getting around. People, even though there is still some degree of denial, because of our numbers, it appears still that AIDS is a gay and bisexual disease in Houston. Ninety-four percent of our cases are still in that category. But I believe that the word is beginning to filter down to the rest of our community that we can no longer talk about high-risk groups. We must now begin to focus on certain types of behavior. Because, in pursuing those behaviors, anybody is vulnerable. And I think that word is getting around and we are beginning to get a spark of interest from others. I mentioned before you came that NBC had this national pro- gram last night. We set up a phone bank here and had four epide- miologists available to answer calls. And, in 3 hours, we got only nine calls. I think that was because that program was on the wrong station. Mr. FIELDS. Let me just ask one other question. I appreciate the Chairman's indulgence. You represent the city of Houston and youare talking about information and it seems that you are being fairly aggressive on this issue. What about areas within HarrisCounty that are outside the jurisdictional boundaries of the city of Houston, the smaller cities? In my congressional district, cities like Baytown, Jacinto City, Galena Park and also in the unincorporat- ed, you know who is working in those particular areas? And isthere coordination with you and other people? Mr. HAUGHTON. No. We have found very little interest in the problem from the other five counties in our Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. And, as you may be aware, Congressman, those counties include Montgomery, Ft. Bend, Brazoria, Liberty andWaller. They have very small numbers of cases. In the 31/2 years that I have been in Houston, I had one call from Montgomery County, about 1 year ago, asking me to send a speaker out. I had a call from the health director in that county asking me to send a speaker to speak to a community group that he had pulled togeth- 126 Mr. HAUGHTON. Most of our death rate is quite high in Houston, higher than the national average. About 65 percent. And most of our cases have been dead within 2 years. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much. We are pleased that Congressman Fields has joined us. Congress- man Fields, of course, is from the Houston area and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as the Subcommit- tee on Health. Mr. Fields. Mr. FIELDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to apologize to you and my colleague, Congressman Leland. There is a press tour today of the Hardy Toll Road which is a major transportation link in northern Harris County, and I had to attend that this morning. And, also, I am going to have to be leaving in just a second to go introduce Secretary Don Hodel who is here for the Offshore Tech- nology Conference and the World Petroleum Congress. I would like to have my prepared statement entered for the record, if I could. I also want to say that AIDS is public health enemy No. 1. I have usually been considered conservative on fiscal matters. However, I think more money needs to be expended in AIDS-related research. I do not think that anyone should be consid- ered conservative nor do I think anybody should be considered a liberal on this issue. I do not think people ought to be considered Republican. I do not think they ought to be considered Democrat. I think this is a problem that our Nation faces and I think we must come to grips with this problem as a Nation and dedicate ourselves to its resolution. So, with those opening remarks, again, I apologize for coming in on the tail end, but I did have one or two questions, if I could. Mr. WAXMAN. Sure. First of all without objection, your statement will be put in the record at the opening of the hearing. And I want to say personally that I welcome those remarks because we are facing a terrible national tragedy with this epidemic and it is an epidemic that knows no political boundaries or ideological views of the people affected. It is one that we all have to get together on, whatever our ideological views, to try to combat. And I thank you for those comments. Mr. WAXMAN. Please go ahead with questions. Mr. FIELDS. Dr. Haughton, just a couple of questions. And I, again, apologize for missing your testimony, but going back to edu- cation. It has been my experience just in talking with people in a general way, there is so much misinformation and misunderstand- ing about AIDS. What are you doing in regard to education? And I know you were talking just a moment ago about some of the money that is being expended. But is there any coordination with volun- teer groups going out into communities and talking about, you know, this particular problem? Mr. HAUGHTON. Yes. We have created a speaker's bureau jointly with the AIDS Foundation. And epidemiologists, physicians, nurses, health educators from that speaker's bureau are available to speak to any group that requests our assistance and we also so- licit groups that we want to talk to. One of the most important things that ha,3 happened in Houston resulted from Dr. Koop's, the Surgeon General's statement with regard to the education of chil- dren about this problem. The Houston Independent School District 125 If we believe in health education and if we are going to spend a lot of money in health education, then we must take into account what we believe that education will do in making these projections. You know, these projections have a double-edged, a two-edged sword. For example, just recently, in this city, because of our con- cern about spreading in the heterosexual community, we began to emphasize education in that area. The result was that for people at risk, they were demanding more funds for education against AIDS. For those people who believe it is the punishment of God, they were saying, \"Let's lock up all the homosexuals.\" So, we have to be careful about our education and the outcome of what we say. Mr. WAXMAN. Well, it doesn't look like your State legislature has learned the lesson of this epidemic. Mr. HAUGHTON. I think they are in our second group. Mr. WAXMAN. Well, the fact of the matter is, from what I hear you testifying, if you are spending $100,000 and that is it in the city of Houston, that is not an incredible expenditure for education. Mr. HAUGHTON. That is correct. Mr. WAXMAN. And if your State legislature refuses to spend more money, then it seems to me they fall into that group that you have described where, unfortunately, the population will have to learn the hard way, after this disease spreads into larger numbers of people, before they take action. But we talk about funds for this effort. What about funds for treating the patients with AIDS? Are your public hospitals not overwhelmed with the cost of treating these patients? Mr. HAUGHTON. No. That has not been a major problem in Hous- ton. The hospital district is the agency responsible for health care for the needy. And, of course, that is where people fall after they have exhausted their other resources. That agency has a tax base of 100 mils. I think in last year's budget, they allotted about 22 mils. So, they have some freedom. Now, I must say, in their behalf, that they have been very sensitive to this problem. They have re- sponded when M. D. Anderson, our cancer institute, decided not to treat AIDS cases anymore, they created an in-patient unit and an out-patient unit at Jeff Davis Hospital. More recently, when the Institute for Immunological Disorders decided that they could no longer provide indigent care to AIDS pa- tients, the hospital district doubled the size of their AIDS in-pa- tient unit, and are now about to create a 20-bed hospice for those patients who do not need acute hospital care. They are very respon- sive. Mr. WAXMAN. Maybe you are not the one to ask this question, but do you know the statistics of how many patients have health insurance to pay their bills, how many are on Medicaid, and how many have no source of payment? Mr. HAUGHTON. No, I do not. But I do know that most of the pa- tients with AIDS in Houston have started out their problem at a time when they did have resources. The problem is on the far end: After they have had several hospitalizations, have been ill for a long time, have exhausted their insurance benefits, are no longer employed. Then is when the problem begins. Mr. WAXMAN. Far end is a year? Six months? r' -8 --' 124 Mr. HAUGHTON. At the beginning that was true. It was taken from other programs. I didn't hear what you said, Congressman, Mr. LELAND. I just said, unfortunately, those funds that were taken from other places were not taken from the Defense Depart- ment. Of course we have a problem with crime here in the city of Houston. I certainly would not want to see us take those moneys from the Police Department. But I think that maybe because of the severity of the problem and I do not want to engage in any kind of controversial colloquy with you, Dr. Haughton, but I think that be- cause of the rising problem in this country and the rising problem in this city, that we need to prioritize, if in fact we can, the prob- lem of AIDS and more moneys being expended. Mr. HAUGHTON. Now, let me make one point. I do not know if you have this set of slides in front of you. Mr. LELAND. Yes, we do. Mr. HAUGHTON. If you will look at the second page, you will see we have been tracking the rate of increase of AIDS cases in Hous- ton. And if you will look at that chart, you will see that over the last 3 years, while the number of cases have been increasing, the rate of increase has changed and is trending downwards. We hope that that is a good sign. Mr. LELAND. Very good. Mr. HAUGHTON. You will notice that between 1983 and 1984, we had 126 percent increase in the number of new cases. Between 1984 and 1985, that dropped to 86 percent. And between 1985 and 1986, it dropped to 45 percent. Mr. LELAND. But is that not misleading? Mr. HAUGHTON. So, even though the numbers are increasing, they are increasing at a slower rate than they were 3 years ago. Mr. LELAND. But is that not misleading to say they are increas- ing at a slower rate. If you take 50 percent of 10 as opposed to 25 percent of 500, the raw numbers are incredibly large in terms of the numbers of people increasing to be effective. Mr. HAUGHTON. As I said, the numbers are increasing, but at a slower rate than they were before. Remember, about 2 years ago, they were predicting that the numbers would double every 6 months. That has not been true in Houston. Mr. LELAND. Dr. Krim, does that give you much sense of relief? Ms. KRIM. No. It does not give me much pleasure to hear that because the double of 1 is 2, but the double of 400 is 800, you know. So, less than double 400 is still more than 2. Also, there is another thing that worries me is that in all this discussion, we always talk about cases of AIDS. As I explained, AIDS occurs years after infection occurs. And, biologically, the im- portant event is acquisition of infection and we do not know where that is. Mr. HAUGHTON. Well, one of the problems I have with the projec- tions that are made is and I quote this from an article published by Dr. Jim Kern of CDC in November, I believe it is, of 1986, in \"Public Health Reports.\" Their empirical model assumes that ev- erything will continue as is and that any educational efforts we make will make no difference. That is not the case. And, so, while the number is growing, we must keep up some perspective. 123 every month tends to reinforce that. The fact is that that is the way the picture looks. Mr. LELAND. Is our city as ignorant as our State legislature? Mr. HAUGHTON. No. Fortunately, our city is not. No. We have been allowed to, even though there are very few city funds that have been earmarked for AIDS, we have been allowed to use our resources to the maximum extent to put out the message about AIDS. As a matter of fact, we have had a lot of help from the gay com- munity, itself. The AIDS Foundation has done a terrific job of edu- cation in the gay community. And we use a surrogate set of statis- tics to show that. Our department has been screening for sexually transmitted dis- eases in gay bars and gay bathhouses in this city for some 10 years. And we do that because contact tracing has never been very effec- tive in the gay community. The names and addresses and tele- phone numbers we get never check out. And, so, what we do is, we in fact ask people where they had their contacts. And then we send teams of epidemiologists out into those communities to test for syphilis. Up until 21/2 years ago, we were finding 6 cases of syphilis for every hundred persons that we tested primary syphilis. In 21/2 years, that has dropped to less than one per thousand. So, we be- lieve that the gay community has done a good job of educating its own members. Mr. LEIAND. Now, Dr. Haughton, you have shown some invalu- able-you have given us some invaluable statistics about our mi- nority community and its affliction with the AIDS disease. Also, you obviously show some real concern about the proliferation of tht problem within the heterosexual and minority communities. Are we doing enough in the city? You said that the city of Hous- ton has given some limited funds to this problem. Should the city of Houston allocate more funding for this problem not only to help with the problem in the homosexual community, but also in the heterosexual and, particularly, in the minority communities? Mr. HAUGHTON. Well, I have about $100,000 of city funds ear- marked for AIDS. But, as I said, we've been allowed the freedom to apply our resources as necessary to dealing with the problem to the limits that we can apply. You must remember that in the State of Texas, when there is a hospital district in a county, no other unit of government within that county can spend funds for medical care. And, so, as a health department and a city government, we are limited to preventive aspects of AIDS: education and testing and so on. The question is: How much is enough? Our department took a 9.5 percent cut in our overall budget last year. I may have to take an- other cut going into 1988. So, to say that the city should spend more on AIDS, I would have to ask: Where will they take it from? I would not like to see a repeat in Houston of what has happened at the Federal level. Most of the funds that the Federal Govern- ment has spent so far on AIDS education and risk reduction and so have been taken from other programs. Mr. LELAND. Unfortunately, not from the Defense Department. 122 rock stations because that is where our young people listen. I am very concerned about the young people in our community who are about to begin sexual activity and who may be tempted to indulge in IV drug use. And I find that I can reach that population much better on the rock stations than on a news station. Last night, for example, NBC had a national network for infor- mation and we established a call-in bank here, a phone bank so people could call in. I had four epidemiologists sitting at those phones from 6 to 9 last night. We got 9 calls. That is because the NBC station here is a news station. The people who are interested in this problem listen to rock stations and those are the stations we should be using. Those are the stations we use. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much. Mr. LE.AND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Haughton, I am glad that we seem to be rather competitive at least in terms of the lesser number of minorities afflicted with this grave disease in the city of Houston. I hope indeed that we have made the point that this hearing, while it focuses on the prob- lems of heterosexuals afflicted with the disease, as well as minori- ties, that we do not lose in the scope of things the problems afflict- ing the homosexual community. In the city of HoLtston, I have been in politics and have been an elected official now for 15 years. And we go back a couple of years ago, we remember the infamous gay referendum and the problems that ensued subsequent to that and the prejudice that we had real- ized in the city of Houston against the homosexual population of our city. What I am concerned about is that when we hold hearings and expand on the interest of these hearings to other communities because of the facts, which show that more and more minorities are being afflicted as well as the heterosexual community now has come into play, we then realize that, in the city of Houston, this is not just a homosexual disease afflicting our city but also that it is expanded, that while other States and other cities, and let's refine that to other cities, have higher percentages of minorities and he- terosexuals afflicted with the disease that this city's homosexual population is more afflicted. Are we focusing, are we honing in on those specific problems, that specific problem? Mr. HAUGHTON. Yes. In fact, I think we are focusing it to the extent that it is causing us some other problems. It is true that 94 percent of thel cases in Houston are still gay and bisexual males. That has not changed since 1981 when the first cases of AIDS were reported in Houston, or at least were diagnosed in Houston. That has remained consistent over the 6 years. However, we are also aware of the possibility of that changing. And, so, in our education- al activities, we have shifted gears from talking about risk groups to talking about high-risk behavior. Because everybody is vulnera- ble if they pursue certain high-risk behaviors. Now, the reason I say it is causing us a problem to identify and publicize this distri- bution is that just 3 weeks ago, our legislature vote:' down two very modest requests from our State health commissior ;. He requested $1.2 million for services for the entire State of Texas with regard to AIDS and $675,000 for education for the entire State. Our legisla- ture voted both of those requests down. I think they still believe that it is a gay disease. And I think that the data that we publish 121 forts in educating the public? Has it been successful? Is it on target? Are we doing what we should be doing? Ms. KRIM. It has been late getting off the ground and I know from talking to CDC representatives, such as Dr. Lane, that the ap- proach is the thinking of these public health officials is correct. Es- sentially, you know, I think they are planning to do the right thing. We have not yet at the receiving end seen the effects of the program.9r. WAXMAN. This is 1987. We have had this disease since 1981. Certainly, within a year after 1981, we knew that there was some- thing happening. It was sexually transmitted. We didn't have a cure and we did not have a way to stop the spread through a vac- cine. Have we not known for a good number of years Ms. KRIM. That is right. This was the point I was making that we have known very early that this was not a gay disease: that anyone was susceptible. And we knew how the infection was trans- mitted. We have been, as a Nation I do not point a finger to any- body in particular we have had a reaction of denial to this situa- tion. We have not been particularly compassionate or interested in the first sufferers of AIDS, And we have wasted time. There is no question. Mr. WAXMAN. Let me ask you this. We have wasted time. We need an educational effort. What kind of educational campaign should the Federal Government begin to reach minority groups specifically? Ms. KRIM. You know, minorities have more of the problems of everybody else across the board, not just AIDS. I do not think I think the message is the same for everybody. What minorities needs is more of everything they need. Not just the AIDS message. Mr. WAXMAN. Dr. Haughton, what do you think we need to do? What how much money is coming at the local level for an educa- tional effort to stop the spread of this disease? Mr. HAUGHTON. Well, currently, we have about $100,000 from CDC for risk-reduction education. And we have used it to establish a program at the Montrose Clinic as well as to enrich our own edu- cational activities within the Department. We have a network of seven neighborhood health centers. And we have health educators at all of them. We also have medical directors, chief nurses, and other staff at those health centers. We have trained all of that staff to add AIDS to their educational agenda. In addition, we have been available to all groups in the city who need to hear about the problem. We have established a speaker's bureau. We have now made presentations to a large number of em- ployee groups. Employers are beginning to call us and ask us to come make presentation to their employees. Church groups have called us and asked us to make presenta- tions to their congregatiors. ! have personally conducted radio and TV shows in which the listeners can call in and get information. Mr. WAXMAN. Do you gear any of this specifically to minority groups or do you feel that a message for the whole population is the appropriate one? Mr. HAUGHTON. Well, we have done both. We have in our at-tempts to educate, made ourselves availabl, to all of the population of Houston. When I make presentations on the radio, I seek the 120 Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Dr. Haughton. Your full presentation, written presentation, will be part of the record. I notice that it is lengthy with a number of tables and we will have an opportunity to examine that. I am sure that will be very helpful to us. Dr. Lane, you have indicated there is a disproportionate number of AIDS cases among Black and Hispanic Americans. What ac- counts for that? Mr. LANE. Sir, I think, as Dr. Haughton has mentioned, first of all, it is geographic specific and mirrors rather considerably the prevalence of intravenous drug abuse, particularly in Black and Hispanic groups is some of our large east coast communities. But I also think that in other communities, AIDS is still some- thing of a ticking bomb. And we feel, after discussing with our col- leagues in several State health departments, that there is a, an under-education activity or situation about AIDS and its transmis- sion all over the country, in whites as well as Blacks, but particu- larly in Black and Hispanic minorities. Mr. WAXMAN. So, if we are looking at a time bomb that is going to explode on many, many people and especially the minority popu- lations, what educational campaigns has the Public Health Service begun that is directed towards minority groups to try to stop the spread of this disease? Mr. LANE. We look at education as being education focused to the general population, education focused towards risk groups, par- ticularly gay and bisexual and IV drug abusers and then also one- on-one counseling. And we are trying to assist with both money and technical assistance our colleagues in State and local health departments in all of those activities. And the predominant func- tion up to now has been, however, the one-on-one counseling. And that has perhaps not been more targeted toward minority commu- nities than anyone else. Anyone who comes in gets those services. We have asked the State health departments, who are our main grantees in this year's cycle of grants, to target minorities and show us their plans and show us what specific efforts they are going to do toward the Black and Hispanic communities. Mr. WAXMAN. We have an epidemic in this country of AIDS. We have known for several years there is no vaccine and there is none, at least, for at least another decade, if you are very optimistic. So, the only way to stop the spread of the disease is through education. Hlow much money are you sending to the States for an educational effort during this last couple of months? Mr. LANE. Yes. Sir, I will have to provide the details for the record because our money is fragmented in direct grants for health education and prevention, grants to school districts or school State school efforts. And then we are trying to undertake a national cam- paign not directed to the States of general information to the public. And I would like to give you those dollar figures broken down. Mr. WAXMAN. We would like to receive that. Let me ask Dr. Krim: You have been following the AIDS epidemic from the very beginning. And you know that education is our only way to stop the spread of this disease. How would you describe the Federal ef- 147 down to the John Sealy Hospital in Galveston, but that is a consid- erable way. And the facilities are limited there, as well. Mr. LELAND. What percent of the Institute's beds are occupied on most days? Mr. MANSELL. Well, we have the capability, currently, of looking at about 80-75 to 80 in-patients. We have never had more than about 20. And that is partly due to our philosophy, which is, as I pointed out, is to try to keep people out of the hospital in order to look after them, I think, better and more humanely and reduce costs. Mr. LELAND. Does your Institute receive Federal or State assist- ance in providing care or in preforming research? Mr. MANSELL. We have a contract from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases which pays some salaries and some supplies for basic research and clinical research, but nothing relat- ed to patient care. We have managed to get funds, in some cases, from private pharmaceutical companies to cover some patient-re- lated costs. B-.t they barely or seldom cover anything other than sort of bare minimum costs. Mr. LELAND. Let me ask Dr. Awe. Dr. Awe, roughly, what proportion of your AIDS patients have insurance? Mr. AwE. None of them. By definition, to come to the county hos- pital, they cannot have insurance. Mr. LELAND. Are they Medicaid beneficiaries? Mr. AwE. Well, see, that is the problem with Texas law. They- as soon as they are diagnosed as AIDS, they get on Medicaid. But, most of the AIDS patients have worked ard have had jobs and have paid into Social Security. Within 5 months of being disabled, they then get their disability through the Federal Government and Medicaid is cut off. When they get their Social Security Disability, this does not cover hospital care, so, that only a very small number of so-called \"patients'-our patients at Jeff Davis-pay. Even through Medicaid, it has been run out by then. Mr. LELAND. In that light, they are related to the gentleman who spoke earlier who was or is an AIDS victim? Mr. AwE. That is correct. Mr. LELAND. Who pays for the care of people with no insurance or Medicaid? Mr. AwE. The taxpayers of Harris County. Mr. LELAND. To what extent is that allowed over a period of time? Mr. AWE. I am sorry, I do not understand the question. Mr. LELAND. Well, the question is: How long, how many of these-are all patients allowed to come in to the Harris County Hospital? Mr. AwE. No, sir. They are not. There are very strict require- ments to get indigent care in this county. Number 1, obviously, you have to be indigent. Number 2, you have to have been a resident of' Harris County for at least 6 weeks. And you have to prove that. And, so, what we have is problems with patients coming from surrounding counties with AIDS, who we cannot take care of unless they are, you know, literally at death's door, because they are not residents of Harris County. 146 We have to stop it from spreading further. AIDS is a very simple disease not to get. But it is a very expensive disease to treat. AIDS is a national trauma and requires national mobilization and coop- eration. Rapid Medicare funding of newly diagnosed patients is des- perately needed. Better drugs than AZT are in sight. But, for now, assistance must be given to those who cannot afford to pay for it. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Awe follows:] STATEMENT OF ROBERT J. AwE The problem of IIV infection amorg the minorities and medically indigent of Pouston and Harris County, Texas, has not yet reached such proportions that it has overwhelmed the County Hospital District but if the current predictions of its in- crease are correct, it soon will. At present, the pulmonary medicine floor at Jefferson Davis Hospital has 54 beds. Eight of the beds are in the AIDS Unit, but it is always full and usually four to eight more beds are utilized by AIDS patients. This is despite a short average length of stay for most patients and increased out-patient treatment for their opportunistic infections. If this population of patients increases as projected, (estimated 10,000 cases in Harris County by 19911 the number of beds will have to increase considerably. Con- tingency plans are in place but will be extremely expensive. In 1996, 146 AIDS patients were admitted to our hospital; 30 were black, 25 were Hispanic, and 91 were white. Clearly. AIDS is affecting the minority population as wellas the white risk groups ard an increased effort to reach the black and Hispan- ic peaulations with effective education is needed. The average cost per patient day is $540 at Jefferson Davis Hospita'. Only two of the 146 people admitted in 1986 were \"paying patients\" through Medicaid. Most of our patients have worked before they got sick. Thus they qualify for Social Security Disability and, in Texas if their Social Security Disability check is greater than $340 per month, the Medicaid is stopped which means they have no medical coverage. They will not qualify for Medicare until they have been disabled for 2 years and most will not live for that long. One, and only one, possibility exists at present that may stem the inevitable tide of HIV infected patients progressing into AIDS. And this is Retrovir (AZTI. Current- ly, 35 patients at Jefferson Davis are on this drug and the results are truly remark- able. Only three patients on AZT for greater than 6 weeks have had to be readmit- ted, and all were fcr short stays (less than 5 days). Of the 35 patients, 9 are black, 6 are Hispanic, and 20 are white. The Harris County Hospital District has budgeted $50,000 to pay for AZT for next year because we projected about ,50 patients would be on it by then. However, with the recent release of Ret'ovir (the new trade-name for AZT) to a larger popula- tion, it is probable that well over 100 patients with AIDS will be placed on this drug in the next 6 months, at a cost of over $1 million. Although it can be justified that it is cost-effective to spend $10,000 per year per patient to keep them relatively healthy and out of hospitals, it will still place an overwhelming burden on the tax- payers of this county. lam afraid that many lower income patients who are now working but have inad- equate insurance coverage will become medically indigent because of the high cost of AZT. They will come into the public hospital system to obtain this life-sustaining drug. I do not feel the local government of the major cities (New York, San Francis- co, Los Angeles, Houston, etc.P should have the burden of this epidemic alone. AIDS is a national problem. It requires national coordination and mobilization. I strongly urge that AIDS patients be eligible fcr Medicare soon after the diagnosis is made, and that the cost of AZT be covered, at least partly, tinder this program. Mr. LELAND. Does the Institute accept patients whose only source of payment is Medicaid? Mr. MANSELL. Yes. Mr. LELAND. Where do you refer patients without insurance? Mr. MANSELL. Well, apparently, there is only one place in this area that I am aware of. And that is Dr. Awe's clinic at Jefferson Davis. I think that people who have the ability to travel can go 145 can, with an aid of a contract from the National Institute for Aller- gy and Infectious Diseases, to look for drugs other than, but common with, AZT, and other agents which I will not go into de- tails, to try to prevent and to treat this disease. We have an educational and a basic research arm. We have a prevention activity. We may, I hope, be one of the first, if not the first places to mount a trial of a vaccine against this virus. We have a screening clinic and we also have a hot line, And I hope very much that these activities can continue to help the people of Texas and surrounding States. Thank you. Mr. LELAND. Dr. Awe. STATEMENT OF ROBERT AWE Mr. AWE. T'nank you. Human infection in the indigent minority and majority popula- tion of Houston, if current projections are correct, will soon raise the cost of care to these patients to a prohibitive level in this county. At present, 20 to 30 percent of the medicine beds at Jefferson Davis Hospital are occupied by AIDS patients. About 30 to 40 per- cent of our AIDS patients are minorities. I have the strong impres- sion that my Black and Hispanic patients are not as well-informed as are the whites about AIDS prevention and the resources avail- able once they are diagnosed. More innovative education is needed to reach these groups. Due to current Texas 1a.v, only a small minority of indigent pa- tients can depend on State assistance to pay medical expenses. The public hospitals in counties lucky enough to have them must budget for this loss. Relief from the Texas legislature is a fantasy. One and only one possibility exists that can currently stem this inevitable tide. And that is AZT. About 40 percent of AIDS pa- tients at Jeff Davis, who are on AZT, are minorities. The cust of this drug is very high. And the taxpayers of the county currently are the only ones who are paying for it. However, only three or four of the patients seen at Jeff Davis last year were born in this county, and only a handful of AIDS pa- tients seen and paid for through the county facilities are from Texas. The medical staff at Jeff Davis is happy to take care of these patients. And we admire their struggle to fight against the impossible odds of this disease. But this fight is costly, both emo- tionally and financially. I do not think that the city and county officials of the dozen or so of the major cities devastated by this epidemic should be asked to bear the cost, alone. The sons and daughters of small town Amer- ica came to the big cities because they wanted a brighter life, less encumbered by small town prejudice. They came by the thousands and they have died by the thousands. In their exuberance of freedom, they were struck down by a virus that no one knew existed. One to 2 million people in this country, we assume or think, are infected with this virus. How many of these will develop disease is uncertain; but it may be as high as 50 percent. 144 And this, I think, is important because of cost considerations on the one hand and also because of the dignity and the qual\"y of care that can be given at home as opposed to in the hospital. Very recently, to my great regret and that of my colleagues, too, AMI, that owns the physical facility, was forced to insist that we see no new unfunded patients. And the reason for that, I think, is important to point out that AMI has spent $2.5 million on unfund- ed, indigent care between the beginning of September 1986 and March 1987, without any help from Federal, State, county or city sources. Now, I may-and, indeed, I do regret this necessity enormously and hope that it will only be temporary. But I think it points out the dire problem that we have in this country and in Texas. In January of 1982, my colleague, Dr. Guy Newell and I rang the Texas Department of Health in Austin to tell them that we thought, given what little we knew about AIDS at that stage, that Texas was likely to have a serious problem in the future. And, now, Texas is the fourth State and Houston the fourth city with num- bers of people with AIDS. And is still, so far as I am aware, apart from Dr. Bernstein's panel, which is a bright spot in an otherwise very murky situation, there really is no planning and no funding. And, indeed, there may actually be negative planning and negative funding, if that is something that one can think about. What I think bothers me even more than that is that given what we know about the incubation period of this disease and the laten- cy period, all those individuals-maybe 10,000 in Houston or in Texas who will be sick in 1991, are already infected by the virus. And we have so far no capability of caring or ameliorating the ef- fects of that infection. The necessity for education as a means for prevention is enor- mous. We have an educational activity at the Institute of which I am very proud. I was a founding board member of the AIDS foun- dation and was, at least in part, instrumental in helping some of the early and I think excellent educational programs that that or- gani7ation began and continues. Clearly, we need to educate people. Clearly, the heterosexual population and the teenage school population is of tremendous need of intelligent, factual, well-delivered, effective education. And, frankly, I do not see that happening, other than as a result of the city auspices, county auspices or State auspices. Finally, a word about the problem that indigent patients have. In our clinic, when people came to the clinic at diagnosis, before we had to stop seeing unfunded patients, approximately 12 percent had no funding. The problem really is that as the disease pro- gresses, as employment is lost, as insurance is lost, that percentage rises to well over 50 percent. And, unless something can be done to provide humane, effective, economic care for these people, I person- ally agree with the Hasting's Center report in October of last year which proposes that AIDS may be the one thing that drives this country's health care system into socialized medicine-a thing which I personally would applaud, but is regarded as heresy by a lot of my colleagues. The program at the Institute for Immunological Disorders con- sists mainly in clinical research. We are attempting, as best we 143 Mr. LELAND. I want to thank you very much. Ms. LovELL. Thank you. Mr. LELAND. The Chair would now like to ask that Dr. Peter Mansell from the Institute for Immunological Disorders and Dr. Robert Awe, from Jefferson Davis Hospital, please come forward for your testimony. Let me welcome both of you. Let me also apologize for the neces- sity for the Chairman to have left by this time, He assured me that he was as interested in your testimony as those who had appeared before you and, indeed, will look at your testimony, as a matter of record, when this record is completed. And for the purpose, too, of your testimony, the entirety of the testimony of the Subcommittee on Health and Environment of the Energy and Commerce Commit- tee will also be made available. Your testimony will have been available to the membership therein and to those who are con- cerned about this very dire, dire problem. Dr. Mansell, you may proceed. STATEMENTS OF PETER MANSEILI. INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOIAO- GICAI, I)ISORI)ERS; AND ROBERT J. AWE. CHIEF, PULMONARY MEDICINE, JEFFERSON DAVIS HOSPITAL Mr. MANSELL. Congressman Leland, it is a pleasure to-- Mr. LELAND. You might want to hold it very close, Dr. Mansell. Mr. MANSELL. There is a switch. If all else fails, follow the direc- tions. I speak about as softly as you do. It is a pleasure to meet you, again. I must admit that I sometimes wonder if I live in the same city as Dr. Haughton. But without going into that in any greater detail, I must say that I find some of his wishes highly desirable, but some of the facts on which he appears to base them are rather questionable. I do disagree with him intensely about his implication that M. D. Anderson, which is the State cancer center, abandoned AIDS pa- tients. This, in fact, is not the case at all. And the Institute, in which I have the honor to work, is a marriage between American Medical International, a private hospital owned company, and the University of Texas and M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Insti- tute, which still employs me, I am glad to say. I think that I would like by way of testimony to give a very brief outline of the history of the AIDS epidemic as I see it in Texas. We saw our first case at M. D. Anderson of a person with AIDS in No- vember of 1981. And 2 months later opened a clinic at M. D. An- derson. And, in the course of the last 5 years, we have seen 1,400 referred people with AIDS or with AIDS-related diseases. In September 1986, the clinical activity, I was moved to a new location, the Institute for Immunological Disorders. And we are currently seeing almost 400 new cases of people referred at that In- stitute and our current modus operandi philosophy of looking after people, as I think is becoming more common, is to put the great emphasis on out-patient care. We currently see over 1,000 out-pa- tient visits a month and never have more than approximately 15 or, at most, 20 in-patients. 142 to go One milmml Demsocratic ams- io unless mom mosey wW The cm \"h ap Wmm Py leaderip thA the city has abdicmed responsibility fot this pit- ticear health Can crisis.

But they are not past that, yet, unfortunately. Mr. LELAND. Mr. Perez. Mr. PEREZ. Well, I would just like to comment on Dr. Haughton's remarks about having done some considerable work into the city of Houston regarding AIDS. All the past 2 weeks we have looked for materials on AIDS, pamphlets and other documents in Spanish, and it is almost non-existent. I think the only pamphlets I have seen are the Foundation-the AIDS Foundation's, here in Houston, that have published their, I think three of the Spanish language pamphlets. The city of Houston has not provided anything. I have not seen anything anywhere in any of the multi-service, purpose- service centers or any of the other city facilities. There just has not been any real effort from the city. And I do not believe there will be unless they are really nudged into it. Mr. LELAND. Well, let me just thank all three of you for your participation and for the record, Reverend Lawson, for his partici- pation, also. You have been invaluable to the Congress of the United States. And let me assure you that your testimony will be very highly regarded. And, for the purpose of the record, too, I would like to insert into the record, without objection, an article that is dated March 1987, that was written by Miss Allison Cook, I think her name is, in \"Texas Monthly Magazine\" dated March 1987. I think it corroborates to some extent what has been said here with this panel. [The material referred to follows:] 139 But one person cannot do it alone. It will take a community effort from the Black community. It will take targeted, specialized pro- grams into those communities, not just a general informational brochure. The Hispanic community faces particular problems simply be- cause of a language barrier, different cultural problems. And, quite truthfully, the influence of the church-that will make it particu- larly difficult in educating and getting them to understand that this can effect them, but they can prevent it from happening. - Women need to take it seriously. Especially, we have seen the numbers effecting women of child-bearing age. I take that, you know, quite seriously. And so should everyone. So, quite frankly, the leadership in this city needs to stand up and say, \"This is a problem. And we are going to do something about it. And so are you. And we are going to show you how to pre- vent yourselves from getting that disease.' If that happened, we might withstand those statistics that Dr. Haughton would like to have. Mr. LELAND. I understand. Let me, before you pass the micro- p hone, let me ask you: Were you involved in the testimony at all fore the State legislature in an effort to try to get legislation passed where more funds would be or funds would be allocated by the State of Texas targeting this problem for resolution? Ms. LOVELL. Yes, sir. I was involved with that. Mr. LELAND. What was the prevailing attitude that you confront- ed with the State legislature in this matter? Ms. LOVELL. I think the prevailing attitude was the getting caught up on the statistics, again, of 95-96 percent gay men and IV drug users. And it seemed to be a real lack of concern simply be- cause IV drug use is illegal. And, in the State of Texas, we do have a sodomy law. So, it was like, \"We cannot justify giving this amount of money in hard times to two groups of people which are really considered criminals.\" I do not think that they understood that this disease isn't just limited to that group and we are very concerned about this ticking time bomb. Mr. LELAND. If I may, and it might be conjecture on my part, but having served in the body of the State legislature for 6 w-ars, it seems to me that by now-and I have been out of that body for now 9 years-that it would have evolved to contemporary times in 1987 when, in fact, our legislators should realize that even if thvse who are affected by this terrible, terrible disease are, as far as they perceive, undesirable, that in fact they should know that an epi- demic of this kind is pervasive and, thus, affects the universal pop- ulation of our city-our State, rather. I just find-I find it very difficult to understand their non-re- sponse to this very serious problem. Ms. LOVELL. So do we. Mr. KIHNEL. So do we. Ms. LOVELL. Yes. This is ;ind of where a trickle down theory comes into effect and is very effective. Obviously, there is homopho- bia in the Texas House. Because of that there is no money allocat- ed, which means that because of homophobia, people-minorities, women, children-also suffer. So, it trickles down from homophobia 138 ment is correct, Houston has only spent $21,000 in this matter, and reducing, I guess, to some extent, their commitment by $100,000 if in fact that is the case, where they have received $100,000 from outside sources. What is your opinion about this in each of your cases, particular- ly, the gentleman who has AIDS now? Mr. KIHNEL. Well, Mr. Leland, I think that due to the lack of the city, county and State in funding education that there is a great deal of ignorance and fear. And I believe most of the heterosexual community does not understand AIDS. They do not feel that it can effect them because of the lack of money that is being spent. And I feel that the city of Houston has completely turned its back on its community as far as addressing AIDS and educating its community. Mr. LELAND. Can you speak more specifically about the city of Houston and why you feel that it has not responded to the extent that it should? Mr. KIHNEL. I think Sue could probably be more specific. All I know is that they have not spent anything on educating the com- munity. And that has led to ignorance and fear. Mr. LELAND. But it seems to me, though, that, if it is a matter of fear, that-and I guess it is more because of the ignorance-that, if it was a matter of fear, then indeed a lot of money would be spent. Mr. KIHNEL. You would think so. You would think it would be one of the main issues on the city council's agenda; but, instead, they have ignored it. Mr. LELAND. Ms. Lovell, would you like to respond? Ms. LOVELL. Yes. I mean certainly the city has not paid the type of attention to this problem, nor is it a priority. That was verbal- ized today. Given the state of the economy in Texas and the finan- cial problems that we are facing, you need to prioritize. There is money available through the Federal Government in which this city could go and secure to do the type of educational programs that need to be done. Given the statistics in Houston, right now, of 95-96 percent of the cases still involve gay men, I believe that the general popula- tion is beginning to understand that this is not just a disease that affects gay men, but a disease which will infect them. But I do not think they have quite gotten it, yet, and, especially, when they listen to statistics. What needs to take place is the lead- ership from this city needs to point out to the general population that, indeed, it is a problem for them. And that they need to be educated and, through education, they can prevent the spread of this disease. Given those statistics that we have, we are in a unique position here in Texas to really show that education, indeed, can stop the spread of the disease. With the statistics of 95-96 percent, If we had a well-organized, well-funded educational program to the minority community-women, the general population, teenagers-we might be a model in showing that education does cut down the numbers. It is effective. We have a particular difficulty with the Black community. It is perceived as a white person's disease. Unfortunately, we have lead- ers like Reverend Lawson that are standing up and speaking out. 137 Mr. WAXMAN. Well, is it that they get misinformation and they do not think it could effect them because they think it is only a gay disease? Or are they getting misinformation about how it is trans- mitted? Mr. PEREZ. I think what it is, is that the publications in most of the Hispanic communities is not taking it serious at the moment. There is not enough energy being put into it and that is one reason I am here. I am not a professional educator. I am not a counselor. I am just an activist and a concerned citizen. And we have had to take these initiatives to educate the gay Latino and Hispanic com- munity, in general, because of that. We do not have the profession- als out there to do that. What we have had has been limited. Mr. WAXMAN. All right. I thank the three of you and Reverend Lawson for his testimony. It is clear that what is going on in Hous- ton is not all that unique, except this city, Los Angeles, San Fran- cisco, New York, Miami, are cities that are on the cutting edge of this epidemic. And the rest of the country will learn from your ex- periences and, hopefully, not from your mistakes. But, if need be, they will have to learn from mistakes. And one mistake is that if we do not educate people, inform them, about what is happening with the spread of this disease, the numbers of cases are going to multiply. And, with those people who have AIDS, we have to make sure that they get the treatment nec- essary. As a humane society, with the values that we hold, it is incon- ceivable to me that we would allow people to go without the one drug that could keep them alive. And, if we do that, then we are giving a lie to the values that we have claimed as a society, that we are not going to say to someone simply because they cannot afford health care that they are going to be condemned to death. I appreciate what you have had to tell us today. I am going to turn over the question to Congressman Leland, and the gavel. Un- fortunately, I have to leave to catch a plane: but Mr. Leland isgoing to chair the rest of the hearing, and we will share the tran- script of comments with our colleagues in Washington and be mindful of what is going on here in Houston as we try to figure outwhat is the appropriate Federal response. Thank you very much. Mr. Leland. Mr. LELAND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I may, having as- sumed the position as Chair, now, dispense with the policy that has been established earlier, just temporarily. I would like for you to give your thanks to Henry Waxman, our Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am particularly concerned about the information that was given by Dr. Haughton. I hope he is still here. But I am concerned about the political implications here. While I recognize Dr. Haughtoh as having spoken, not necessarily from his personal point of view, but from his representation of the city-I am con- cerned that, indeed, that if the city is taking an attitude that they are not prioritizing this in the highest way, not only the current situation with the AIDS epidemic in Houston, but the spreading of AIDS to all of our community will continue to increase in severity.I would like to just ask you to respond, if you will, more in full, about the implications here: The fact that the, if Ms. Lovell's state- 136 Mr. WAXMAN. -with this disease. And often survive outside of the hospital setting. And without this drug, people will die. Mr. KIHNEL. That is correct. Mr. WAXMAN. And, in Texas, under the Medicaid program, they are not paying for this drug. What happens to those people who do not have the drug paid for by the Medicaid program? Mr. KIHNEL. They will die. Mr. WAXMAN. They will die; no choice about it. Mr. KIHNEL. Yes, sir. And, even though I have insurance and do not qualify for Medicaid because my-supposedly, my Social Securi- ty income is so high at $627 a month, since my insurance does not cover it, I am considered indigent in that case, too. Mr. WAXMAN. MS. Lovell, your Foundation is dealing with people who come in for services. I assume that most of the services that the Foundation and the AIDS Clinic supply are to gay men. Is that correct? Mr. KIHNEL. I would say a majority, but not all. Mr. WAXMAN. You also provide services to heterosexuals? Mr. KIHNEL. Oh, yes, sir. Mr. WAXMAN. Are people afraid to be seen going into what they might consider a gay clinic or a gay facility? Mr. KIHNEL. I believe that is true. We get a lot of calls on the hot line, in fact. Probably over 50 percent of our hot line calls are from people, heterosexual people, that want information, but are afraid to go anywhere and get that information, so call on the hot line. Mr. WAXMAN. If someone wanted to be tested to see if they had the virus in their blood, in Houston, TX, where would they go? Mr. KIHNEL. They would go to the Montrose Clinic. The other- the program at the Montrose Clinic is voluntary, anonymous test- ing with pre- and post-test counseling. They have an excellent pro- gram. You may go to the Institute and be tested, of which there is a charge. But you are given the opportunity to pick either anony- mous or confidential, of which \"confidential\" means a name is taken. We have a hard time in referring people out there other than saying, \"Take it anonymously,\" because we all know the type of discrimination that takes place when your name is attached to an HIV antibody positive test: You can lose your insurance; you can lose your job. So, we inform people, if they want to take the test, to please take it anonymously. Mr. WAXMAN. And do you know if there is a waiting period of time for people to get rhe test if they wanted to take it? Mr. KIHNEL. I do not know at the Clinic if there is a waiting time, truthfully. I have not heard that there is. I know that there was an increase in the request for testing. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Perez, you think that we need a targeted cam- paign of AIDS education to reach the Hispanic community? Mr. PEREZ. Yes. All Hispanics. Maybe one to even reach the gay Latino. And, you know, the Hispanic Community. Because there is none at the moment. People are scared out there. They are fright- ened, you know. They do not-they get a lot of misinformation. The Latino publications which exists here in Houston are over-wrought with misinformation about AIDS. And they continue this, you know, problem. 135 The status of continued County funding for AZT and other such life-sustaining drugs is yet undetermined. Houston has a worldwide reputation as a medical center. The Public health care system in this part of the country is more like arris County's than systems in New York and California. The in- quiring eyes of the media are focused on how we in Harris County in Texas will mobilize to respond to these urgent needs. I know Mr. Waxman is concerned for my needs as he is for his own constituents in California. I met him in California. I hope Mr. Leland and Mr. Fields will follow his example and go back to Washington with the same compassion and dedication as my friend, Henry Waxman. Thank you. Mr. WAXMAN. Well, thank you very much for those generous words. And you can be assured by the fact that Mr. Leland and Mr. Fields are here that they, and that I am here as well-we want to learn what we can from the experiences here in Houston and give this information to our colleagues as we try to figure out the appro- priate Federal response. Let me ask you this question. You have insurance. You are work- ing with other people who have AIDS. Are they as fortunate as you are to have insurance? Mr. KIHNEL. No, sir. I would say over half the people I know, or possibly as high as 75 percent of them, are indigents and do not have insurance. Mr. WAXMAN. Now, if they do not have insurance, how do they get their health care for AIDS? Mr. KIUNEL. Well, currently, through the Harris County Hospital District at J. D. Hospital-Jeff Davis Hospital. Mr. WAXMAN. And is that-does that provide the whole range of services that are needed for these patients? Mr. KIHNEL. Although the staff out there has done an exception- al job with what they have to deal with, the quality of care ispretty good. I have some friends that go out there. I do not person- ally. I have some friends that go out there. And the quality of care is good at this time. But, of course, by the end of 1991, they will not be equipped to deal with the statistics-the number of cases. Mr. WAXMAN. Now, you have insurance, but you indicated your insurance will not pay for high-priced prescription drugs. Will they payfor any prescription drugs? Mr. KIHNEL. They will only pay for in-patient prescriptions. Mr. WAXMAN. In-patient. Mr. KIHNEL. And, since I am healthy and my life is being sus- tained by AZT, AZT and all my other out-patient prescription drugs are noteovered under my insurance. Mr. WAXMAN. Now, let us say you were on Medicaid, which is the health care deh.ery system for the people who have impover- ished themselves-- Mr. KIHNEL. Yes, sir. Mr. WAXMAN. Would, would the Medicaid program in Texas pay for AZT? Mr. KJHNEL. No, sir, I do not believe so at this time. Mr. WAXMAN. So, we are talking about a drug that means that people can survive-- Mr. KIHNEL. Yes, sir. 134 My name is Chris Kihnel and I am a 30 year-old native Houston- ian and Texan, and I am a person with AIDS. I am president of the People with AIDS Coalition of Houston, operating under the aus- pice of the National Association of People with AIDS in Washing- ton, DC. I was diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia on August 1, 1986. After three bouts of PCP, which nearly killed me, I recovered under the care of Dr. Gary Brewden and the staff of the Institute for Immunological Disorders. I was fortunate in having converted my group health insurance policy to a personal policy 3 months prior to my diagnosis after a job layoff. My policy covers every- thing but out-patient prescription drugs, including AZT, which has sustained my life up until now. I must find the means to pay for this drug after 2 more weeks' grace period, since the open drug study has ended and AZT has been approved by the FDA, and there is no local, count, State, or Federal funding yet for indigents on AZT. My only source of income is $627 per month Social Security Dis- ability, out of which approximately $200 goes to my insurance cov- erage. Due to my qualifications and my concerns as a person with AIDS, I would like to address the concerns of AIDS in our Black and Hispanic communities. According to national statistics, minorities take up 41 percent of the 33,000 confirmed cases of AIDS since 1981. Blacks and Hispan- ics are over-represented in AIDS cases. Blacks account for 12 per- cent of the U. S. population and 25 percent of AIDS cases. Hispan- ics make up 10 percent of the U. S. population and account for 14 percent of the total AIDS cases. Three out of every five children with AIDS are Black. Based on future predictions, the minority community will contin- ue to pay a heavy toll due to AIDS. Minorities in Houston in Harris County are imminently affected by AIDS and will continue to be affected in increasing numbers in the future. Of particular concern is Black and Hispanic youth in Houston, among many of whom sexual experimentation, IV drug use, the use and abuse of tattoo needles, chemical inhalants and others. As the numbers increase, so will these and many other problems. Great attention-local and national-has been directed on Hous- ton in Harris County and its proposed solution to the management of the current AIDS problem as it effects indigents. Considering the number of Blacks and Hispanics who depend upon public hospital and medical care, the fa:ts regarding minority groups require an even heightened awareness by Harris County. Currently, poor people with AIDS are provided treatment through the Harris County Hospital District at Jeff Davis Hospital and its 16-bed AIDS facility. There are current problems at JD's AIDS ward, including pa- tients having been turned away because they have been told JD is at capacity, inadequate social worker staff, inadequate equipment, insufficient bilingual staff to service the AIDS area. Discharges are not coordinated between social work, medical and pharmacy. Often, family members have had to wait excessive hours due to this breakdown. 161 As of September 17. .1 1,73.5 cases of AIDS were reported in the United States. Six years later into the epidemic. no government sponsored national educational pro- gram has been launched. Today. I have brought with me examples of educational TV spots which have been developed for use in government sponsored national education programs in several of the countries I have just mentioned. I could discuss with you at length the TV clips I am about to show you. Prepare you for their impact; god points and bad points Iowever. I think that the TV clips speak for themselves. The point I would make with you is that each of these Na- -tions have assumed the responsibility of educating its citizens. The Australian. United Kingdom s campaign have been effective tools in raising the publics awareness of AIDS. Some critics complain that the commercials have unjustly seared the public. However, we can learn from their mistakes, and move forward. A prime time television campaign creates an aware public. Public aware- ness is the first step to educate the public. Mr. Chairman, with your permission I would like to have the committee review these clips now. None of them are sexually offensive or explicit, instead, they are creative and compelling and provide accurate information about AIDS to the view- ers. In additi-jn to a media program, other educational programs are necessary to meet the challenges this epidemic poses. Targeted education programs represent a major challenge to our efforts. Fortunately, we have some models that hale been developed in the last few years that are working. Targeted education differs from general public education, by aiming at groups of people who are considered to be at higher risk of contracting or transmitting the virus. Programs for these groups must be culturally sensitive, very clear, explicit and provided in environments that are comfortable to the individuals who must receive the message. The gay community has done an excellent job of educating their members These programs are based on understanding peoples behavior, they provide clear informa- tion. respond to concerns of people regarding disease transmission and worked to develop a culture that decreases the risk of transmission. Programs have ranged from \"clean and sober\" campaigns to safer sex education. While has been very diffi- cult to quantify successes, a recent study in San Francisco has indicated about an 5 percent drop in the STI) rate among gay men; this shows that programs can have a substantial impact. Other groups that need specific, targeted programming include IV drug users. prostitutes. sexual partners of other persons in high risk groups, minority groups. school aged and college populations and health care workers. Ve have recently heard of tragic accidents leading to infection of health care workers. Training programs to ensure that appropriate body fluid precaution tech- niques are followed must be implemented. If health care workers rely on testing in- formation for patient management they will have a false sense of security Pro- grams for rescue workers, such as those in Montgomery, AL, should be offered edu- cation and training under this segment. Health care workers must also have accurate information to provide appropriate guidance and education to their patients. The expansion of school health programs is another area to be addressed. School boards around the country are beginning to develop core education programs, na- tional organizations are beginning to address the issues, a massive program is ur- gently needed. All school boards, PTA's and teachers associations should make a commitment to assure quality, accurate AIDS education in their school systems within the next year A substantial investment will be needed for teacher training. in order to accomplish this goal. Our Nation's commitment to informing and educating its citizens is paramount in controlling this epidemic. It is the only \"vaccine\" we have. Each day that we wait before v:e implement the educational programs I have described-additional people are being infected with the virus. In 1992, they will be part of the tragic statistics of AIDS. Mr. Chairman, people are dying of AIDS, one by one, every day. Our inac-ion today means that right now we are signing the death certificates of people who will die in the next decade-we must not allow this to continue. Thank you very much for the opportunity to discuss our views with you today. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much for your testimony. I gather those films were made by those countries, by their gov- ernments? Ms. McFARREN. Yes, they were. 160 Public health officials have repeatedly stated that to control the epidemic we must educate the American public about AIDS and its transmission. We have no cure for AIDS. We have no effective long-term treatment. Vaccines will not be avail- able until at least the mid 1990's; if ever. Thus, education is the cornerstone of our National AIDS prevention effort. Reducing hysteria adds another compelling reason for massive public education programs. The Ray Family lives in Arcadia, FL-Arcadia means peaceful-yet their lives have been far from peaceful. The tragedy of the Ray Family fire, is directly attribut- able to the total lack of appropriate education and leadership in the area of AIDS education. It is obvious that some Arcadians were frightened of the disease, clearly they did not understand HIV infection and transmission, and they believed that their children were at risk. Fear which resulted from a lack of information was our enemy and ended in needless tragedy. Political, religious, health and business leaders must join together to assure that all of us have the knowledge and understanding of this disease, so tragedies such as the Ray fire will never occur again. Another example of an inappropriate response to AIDS is the Montgomery Ala- bama Police listing of \"suspected AIDS people\" to protect rescue workers and police. Lists and tests won't protect service people from infection; education, and training will. The facts and problems before us make it imperative to launch a massive national education program now. The Council supports the National Academy of Sciences' recommendation to provide $1 billion of Federal funds for education by 1991. The goal: 1. Helping our citizens understand the disease, it's management and transmission. 2. Assuring that people who are ill receive appropriate and compassionate re- sponse from their neighbors, friends and health care workers; and :3. Identify resources so that any American can find out more about AIDS. A broad sweeping program should include the following components: Federal and private sector support for a national educational campaign on AIDS. Implementation of local public information programs as an adjunct to National campaigns. Development of targeted educational programs. Expansion of School Health Programs. Expansion of programs for the development and training of AIDS educators. The general public education campaign should include advertising spots that must be creative, tasteful, attention getting, compelling provide accurate information and shown during prime time. Continued prime time coverage of AIDS issues will enhance the public's aware- ness. Utilization of sitcoms is another educational opportunity that should be accessed. Print media efforts must parallel the electronic media. Nations around the world have informed their citizens about AIDS in an effort to control the AIDS epidemic. These countries have launched massive education cam- paigns. The most successful include campaigns that provide a coordinated approach with prime time televised messages, printed material, trained health professionals prepared to answer to the pulblics response to the campaign, house to house infor- mational mailing, and education campaigns in the schlIs. Wh:le Americans debate the appropriateness of educational materials-England, France, Australia, Uganda, Brazil, Switzerland and others have implemented pro- grams. The cases of AIDS reported ij, these countries are: S~itzerlaid 266 Aussialia 583 Brazil 1,625 Fiance 1,980 United Slates 41,735 159 -- out more about AIDS, if they would like to, or feel they need to know. We recommend a broad program, and most of the information in that is submitted in my written testimony. I feel that the programs that other countries have developed could help us and be a guide as we develop the programs that should be done in this country. While we have debated the appropriateness of education and what should be in the messages, England, France, Australia, Uru- guay, Brazil, Switzerland and other countries have in fact imple- mented programs. I have submitted to you information on the numbers of cases of AIDS in the countries that I just mentioned. I won't mention them all now, but Switzerland has 266 cases; Canada has 1,000; France has almost 2,000; and the United States has 41,700 and some cases. Surely those figures should help us move forward in this effort. The television clips and the movie clips that I am going to show you now are those that are developed and used in other countries. They may not all be appropriate here, but I think the thing that is important about them is that each one of these countries has as- sumed the responsibility of educating all of their citizens. I thought you would like to see them as samples of things that are available. The last tape that will be shown, which is the Swiss tape, is not a television spot; it is rather a spot that is shown in movie houses. We do have additional copies of the tapes if you would like them. If we could have the lights down and show the tapes now, please. [Media footage played.] Ms. McFARREN. Mr. Chairman, we do have additional informa- tion on education programs from these countries and others, but I felt that was just a sample that you might like. Our Nation's commitment to informing and educating our citi- zens is paramount if we are to stop this epidemic. Each day we wait to implement education programs like those I have described and others, additional people are being infected with the virus. In 1992 they will start to become the tragic statistics of this disease. People are dying one by one every day. Our inaction means that right now we are signing the death certificates for people who will die in the next decade. We must not allow this to continue. Thank you. [Ms. McFarren's prepared statement follows:] STATEMENT OF ANN E. McFARREN Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the privilege to appear before this subcommittee. I am Ann McFarren, Executive Director of the AIDS Action Council and Presi- dent of the AIDS Action Foundation. The Council was established 3 years ago by the AIDS service providers. Today the Council represents over 300 of these groups which provide direct social services, support services and community education in cities throughout the United States. Recently the Council established the AIDS Action Foundation as its educational arm. The Foundation is responsible for legislative research, training and education- al programs for public activities. During my time with you today, I will be discussing efforts to inform this Nation's public about AIDS. 158 Mr. BLILEY. No opening statement, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Dingell. Mr. DINGELL. I commend you for the hearings, and I wish you success in your undertakings. Mr. WAXMAN. And Mr. Coats. Well, we are pleased to call for our first witness, Ms. Ann E. McFarren, Executive Director of AIDS Action Council, and Presi- dent of the AIDS Action Foundation. Ms. McFarren, we are pleased to have you with us. We want to welcome you to the subcommittee hearing. I would like to ask you to proceed with your direct testimony. If you'll pull the microphone close to you, there is a button on the base, and push it forward. STATEMENT OF ANN E. McFARREN. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AIDS ACTION COUNCIl,. AND PRESIDENT, AIDS ACTION FOUNDATION Ms. McFARREN. Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the committee, thank you very much for having me speak with you today. I am Ann McFarren, Executive Director of the AIDS Action Council, and President of the AIDS Action Foundation. We represent 300 service providers around the United States that are providing social services and support services and educa- tion programs in the communities where they work. During the time I have with you today, I would like to discuss the national education program that I believe is important in ad- dressing this disease. Public health officials have repeatedly indicated that we must control this epidemic by education. As a matter of fact, it is the cornerstone of our prevention efforts. We have no vaccine, we have no treatment or cure. We must rely on education efforts. Reducing hysteria is another reason for a massive education campaign. The Ray family, who lives in Arcadia, FL, has not had a peaceful time, even though Arcadia means peace. Their fire was a tragedy. I believe it was a tragedy because of lack of good educa- tion programs. Obviously many people in Arcadia were afraid of the HIV virus. They did not understand the infection; they did not understand its transmission; and they were fearful for their children. I believe all of you have enough facts to know thai those fears are groundless and we need more education for our general public to help them understand that. Because of the fear and the lack of information, we had a very tragic situation and, in my view, it was needless. It is imperative that we have a national program starting now, and the council supports the recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences that there should be $1 billion spent on edu- cation by 1991. - I believe the appropriate goals are: helping our citizens under- stand the disease, its management and its transmission; assuring that people who are ill receive the appropriate care, compassionate response from their neighbors, from their friends, and from health care workers; and help people identify sources so that they can find 157 ing; however, the plug was pulled on this education mailing at the White House. The subcommittee staff has been informed that a mailing will not take place during this fiscal year which is the period for which the appropriation was voted on by the Congress. I would hope, Mr. Chairman, that the subcommittee would look into this matter and find out what has befallen this $30 million appro- priation. It is my understanding that the subcommittee staff has learned that it is not an education program that will occur, and I hope that we would inquire further into what has happened to that money. I thank the Chair. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Wyden. We will join you in that inquiry, and I think it is appropriate that we find out why that money has not been spent as Congress determined it should have been spent. Mr. Dannemeyer. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When Surgeon General Koop made his report to the Nation last October, as to what the Federal Government should be doing, one of the things that he mentioned in his report was the necessity of education. I think it is important that we pursue that. But there was a serious omission in Surgeon General Koop's report to the Nation last October, because he failed to recognize the inseparabil- ity of human sexuality and morality and ethics. That omission was corrected by a joint statement issued by Secretary of Education Bennett, joined in by Dr. Koop in January, and I think so long as the American government or any State or county government or school district in America seeks to educate the public of America on how not to get AIDS, so long as we recognize the inseparability of education or human sexuality with morality and ethics, we will be on the right course. But if we are curious as to how much educa- tion expenditures by the Federal Government have resulted in a decline of pregnancies among females in our society 15 to 19, we have only to look at the statistics that were gathered from what we spent in the decade of the 1970's, where we spent roughly-we in- creased expenditures from $80 million to $300 million, roughly a factor of four, and for that Federal expenditure of dollars we real- ized an increase of pregnancies of roughly 50 percent, and a dou- bling of abortions, and only a small decline of live births. What this date. tells me is this: When we seek to reduce human sexuality on the basis of Federal dollars spent on education, we have the assurance that we are going to produce one thing; namely, more human sexuality. I am not sure that is the course we should be taking, but in light of the seriousness of the epidemic, maybe the result of expenditure of Federal dollars in education to reduce AIDS would be appropri- ate. We will listen to the witnesses, and hopefully we will make the correct judgment. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Sikorski. Mr. SIKORSKI. Let me just thank you and the witnesses for doing their part in this fight. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Whittaker. Mr. Walgren. Mr. Bliley. 156 Before calling on our witnesses, I want to recognize members of the subcommittee for opening statements, and first I want to call on the ranking minority member of the subcommittee, Mr. Mad- igan. Mr. MADIGAN. Mr. Chairman, I think I have just unplugged somebody's microphone down here, and I apologize for that to who- ever the owner of the microphone is. Mr. Chairman, the vast bulk of Federal dollars earmarked for the AIDS crisis has been used to fund research. A significantly smaller amount has been dedicated for education and information programs. Almost none has been dedicated to public health regula- tion of the crisis. While I recognize that the focus of today's hearings is research and education, I would be remiss if I did not point out the recent actions taken in my State of Illinois to deal with the AIDS crisis. Governor Thompson of Illinois was presented with 17 bills relat- ing to the AIDS crisis which had passed both houses of the State legislature. He signed into law 10 of those 17 bills. The legislation he signed will allow public health officials to trace AIDS victims' sexual partners. It will require AIDS testing for couples wishing to marry. It will allow public health officials to quarantine AIDS vic- tims when there is clear and convincing evidence that the public welfare is significantly endangered, and it will allow judges to order that certain persons convicted of sex offenses or narcotics-re- lated crimes be tested for AIDS. And finally, it will require schools to teach youngsters in grades 6 through 12 about sexual abstinence in order to avoid the AIDS complications. I think that these actions are clearly more effectively handled at the State level than at the Federal level. I certainly do not urge that Federal lawmakers take the identical course that Illinois law- makers have taken, but I do think that the Federal Government has an obligation to assure that States have adequate funds to ad- dress the AIDS crisis on a number of fronts. Education and information efforts will be most effective if they are tailored to and by local areas. Testing programs will be most effective if they reflect the attitudes of local residents. I hope that we keep this in mind as we decide how much to au- thorize for the AIDS crisis, and how authorized programs are to be designed. We must be sensitive, Mr. Chairman, to local needs, whether we are talking about research, treatment, education or public health regulation. I hope that the witnesses will address the role of the Federal Government in assisting States during their presentations this afternoon. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Madigan. Mr. Wyden. Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, education is an absolute prerequisite for stopping AIDS, and I want to commend you for holding this hearing. The only point that I wanted to make at this time, Mr. Chair- man, is that this spring, for fiscal year 1987, Congress appropriated $30 million for an AIDS education mailing to all American house- holds. As of now, that mailing has not taken place. It is my under- standing that the Public Health Service put together such a mail- AIDS ISSUES AIDS Research and Education TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22. 1987 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met at 2:10 p.m., pursuant to notice, in room 2123, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Henry A. Waxman (chairman) presiding. Mr. WAXMAN. The meeting of the subcommittee will come to order. When this subcommittee first began its hearings on AIDS in 1982, the questions of research funding were controversial. Dollars- and-cents analysis were required for each proposal. Panels of scien- tific witnesses were needed to challenge the adequacy of budgets. Thankfully, those times are behind us. AIDS research funding is supported broadly. No one needs to be convinced of the need for such activity. Likewise, when it was first proposed, AIDS education-aimed at specific groups and the public at large, this was all extremely divi- sive at that time. Assuming that AIDS would only strike homosex- ual mel and drug abusers, public education was said to be too hot to handle. When the Surgeon General proposed to tell school chil- dren about AIDS, he was deserted by many of his political friends. When a debate on a Sunday news show turned to condoms, it was the first time that word had been used on the air. To some extent, those times are also behind us. Most people are convinced of the need for AIDS education, and most are prepared to be candid. No one believes that the same messages are needed for third graders as are used for drug addicts, but almost everyone agrees that targeted information is necessary. Today's hearings are to start the second generation of this work. Having demonstrated that AIDS research is necessary, we must now make the government support work quickly and well. Having understood that everyone should be educated about AIDS, we must now make the lessons widespread, clear, and effective. No doubt there will continue to be controversies about bureau- cratic structures, about budgets, and about who should educate whom about what. But we are making progress in the politics of AIDS, and I hope that over the next few months, we will make dramatically more. i155 163 phase I and 11 trials. While such conservative forms of scientific study serve to pro- tect patients from untoward side effects, drug interactions, and other unknown sources of harm and also serve to validate the scientific merit of such trials, this epidemic demands a more rapid and innovative response from the involved Federal agencies. Further restrictions, requirements, and exclusions denying patients drugs are based upon narrow and conflicting clinical definitions, concomitant therapies, and combinations with other investigational drugs in patients commonly needing cancer chemotherapy and/or antibiotic treatment for infectious diseases. In the face of a fast-growing, infectious, life-threatening epidemic predicted to af- flict two million Americans by 1991, it occurs to many of us that we must have the courage to move from traditional activities which have served us well in the past to a position that is dictated by the present and required by the future. There are sci- entifically-acceptable methods of testing these investigational drugs which are more humane. AIDS demands such innovations. And finally, there are overwhelming practical concerns to consider. One is simply adequate funding of these drug trials as quickly as possible in hopes of finding useful treatments before the epidemic expands to horrifying proportions, overbur- dening our health care and social service systems. Another very real practical con- cern is that potential participants in drug research protocols, facing impending suf- fering and death, and aware of restrictions, exclusions, and placebo controls, are seeking alternative ways of improving their health and survival. This exodus from research centers leaves drug trials stifled, and in the long run, we may all suffer the consequences. 152 very serious humanitarian problem of ignoring the problems of the homosexual community of our city, or State and our country. I think that we should have heeded the call a long time ago, re- gardless of the sexual preference of anybody who has been affected or afflicted by this incredible disease. We represent a country that is based on the moral authority in the world that we hopefully assume. We recognize that there are many faults with our system. And we hope to correct them. But I think that first and foremost, when any segment of our human so- ciety is at risk, this country should indeed pursue trying to resolve those problems as quickly as possible and as effectively as possible. So, with that, let me just thank all of you for your participation and hope that America will indeed become America for all of its people. Thank you very much. [Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., the hearing was adjourned, to recon- vene at the call of the Chair.] [The following statement was submitted for the record:] STATEMENT OF AIDS FOUNDATION HOUSTON BY MICHAEL B. WILSON, PRE-SIDENT EMF:RITUS Having AIDS anywhere is a physical, emotional, financial, and personal tragedy. Living with AIDS in Houston is punctuated by an apparent lack of concern, compas- sion, and response from those public and private agencies we expected to come for- ward with help. Since l!IS2, we have knocked on every door at City Hall; we have been told repeat- edly that such a health issue is not the responsibility of the city government. We have beaten the trail from health departments to health-related funding agencies; we have been told that AIDS was not a problem in Houston. We have prepared edu- cational materials on AIDS prevention to be informed such efforts were lewd and disgusting. We have developed and offered training programs, brochures, and policy manuals for businesses, school districts, and public health agencies only to have them tabled by frightened administrators. In the vacuum, we developed our own social service, assistance, counseling, and educational programs to fill in the gaps. All were funded by the efforts of community volunteers. Other than Federal social security and a few minimal county and State programs for the near-indigent, the prospects for a person with AIDS in Houston are bleak. I've heard it said, \"If you re gonna get AIDS in Houston, you'd better be rich or well-insured.\" For the Houston AIDS victim who has had insurance canceled, lost his job, or for whatever reason become indigent, there is precious little hope for medical care and treatment other than the strained resources of the county hospital district and the State cancer hospital. And the list of special problem of living with AIDS in Houston goes on and on- from dealing with workplace harassment to backlashes from our conservative com- munity, from the lack of intermediate nursing care facilities to difficulty getting around cur sprawling metropolis, from getting legal help to finding affordable coun- seling, and from buying groceries and cooking meals to finding a place to live when you're out of money. Where are the public funds to solve these problems, to support social services, to provide education, and to help the person with AIDS live and die with dignity? Where do you turn in a city that ignores you? Where do you hide in a community that shuns you? In vestiga tiona I )rug Protocols The policies, procedures, and bureaucratic sluggishness of the Food and Drug Ad- ministration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have delayed important human trials of investigational drugs to treat AIDS. At the same time, such regula- tions have kept experimental treatments away from patients who desperately need them. Such problems, at a time when the deadly epidemic continues to expand, is leaving researchers dismayed and patients distraught. Perhaps the most significant issue involves the insistence on prospective, parallel, placebo-controlled phase III cli;iical trials for drugs shown effective and safe in 151 practical extent that we can, we will hold an informal hearing on this matter or hearings on this matter in order that we can get the full participation of those who would want to participate. -This is not just a \"Show and Tell\" one-time affair, as far as I am concerned. This is something that we are going to have to concern ourselves with over a long period of time. And this one Member of Congress, anyway, is committed to further pursuing this matter. It has been over a year, now, that we have asked the Chair to come and participate in a hearing like this because of budget con- straints. I might add that we were hit as hard-those of us who are Chairs of committees and subcommittee Chairs were hit as hard with the Gramm-Rudman perpetration, if you will, as anybody. And, because of that, we were unable to travel to do many of the field hearings that we wanted to do last year. Things have loosened up to some extent and to that extent we want to pursue this matter further. We want to do some onsite visits, as well as holding further testimony and doing open forums so that we can get a greater participation. We apologize to those of you, by the way, in the audience who would want to participate at this hearing. But, hopefully, you will bear with us and understand that we are committed and that this is invaluable. This has been an invaluable hearing and hopefully it will illuminate the problem in the city of Houston to the extent that we will get some response for the powers that be. With that, let me just thank the two witnesses who have ap- peared here. Let me thank all of you. Again thank Texas Southern University for hosting this, and more particularly, Gene Harring- ton, who has been most gracious in facilitating this opportunity for us, today. Let me just say that some of the problems that we have incurred, too-also illuminate another problem. And that is that Texas Southern still remains, to some great extent, the bastard college of the college system of this State. And some of those problems that we have incurred today have been because of the lack of resources provided Texas Southern University. And, as an alumnus of this very distinguished institution, let me say that I hope that in the future we will have this proportionate- ly-especially regarding the past transgressions on the part of the State legislature-we will have proportionately the adequate funds to run this institution as a first-level institution in our State. The first level institution that indeed it is, at least in terms of the facul- ty and administration and the student body that matriculates here. I thank all of you. The Congress will continue to monitor the sit- uation and the Chairman, of course, is an outstanding leader in this area of concern and I associate myself to the extent that I am as committed to doing as much as I can as the Chairman is. Let me also issue one more admonition. Since I am a Member of the United States Congress who has a parochial interest in the city of Houston in that I represent at least 525,000 citizens of the city of Houston, and that is that, while we do concern ourselves with the spreading problem of AIDS amongst the heterosexual and minority communities, that indeed we should not-just because that prob- lem is spreading to other communities, we should not ignore the 150 Mr. LELAND. Well, may I suggest something to you. And I guess this is outside the purview of my responsibilities as a legislator in Washington, but I think it is my responsibility as an aspiring hu- manitarian, and that is that you might call on the Harris County delegation to the State legislature to do all that they can to rectify this horrible situation that has been imposed by the State legisla- ture by its inaction. Mr. AWE. Yes, sir. We will certainly try that. Mr. LELAND. Dr. Mansell, do you have any other comments you would like to make? Mr. MANSELL. Well, I think from the Federal point of view, set- ting aside more local considerations, one thing that is terribly im- portant is that the decision of the high court last year somehow be set aside: that employers can fire employees whom they think pose a health threat to the rest of the work force. This has adversely affected people with AIDS to a tremendous extent. Because, of course, what happens following that is these poor in- dividuals lose their health insurance and even the provisions of the Cober Act are totally inadequate, since they usually cannot afford to pay their own health insurance. I absolutely agree with everything that Dr. Awe said. I think that until the legislature and, perhaps most importantly of all, the people of Texas realize that this is a problem that affects every- body, regardless of race, color, creed, sexual preference, or any- thing else, we are really not going to get very far. I had the good fortune to attend a breakfast at the Governor's House at which Surgeon General Koop was a guest. And I over- heard a conversation from one of the Harris County legislators with him complaining about the fact that if money were given to solve the-as he put it, \"AIDS problem,\" then money would have to be taken away from crippled children and our cancer patients. And how would one not be able to make the kind of choice that he was suggesting? And I think that it is this attitude-more than anything else- which caused the disallowment or non-voting or negative legisla- ture on the part of Austin on funds to help people with AIDS. Mr. LELAND. It looks like we have to begin our education pro- gram with our politicians. Mr. MANSELL. Are you going to open this to other people on the floor? Is that a question I can ask off the record or not? Mr. LELAND. Well, no. You are very welcome to ask any question of the Chair that you so desire. We have very serious time con- straints. The recorder and the Chairman's assistant both have to get back to Washington, and, as an official hearing, we must adhere to the parameters that were set out prior to the hearing time. Let me suggest to you that what I can do, as an adjunct to this hearing and I will plan to do that because I understand that there are many concerns here that we have not, in Houston, adequately covered this topic, that this Member of Congress, and hopfully with the concerns that Congressman Fields has represented here, today, we will further pursue this matter by having possibly a county-wide hearing, or even with the concerns that Representa- t tive Fields has with those who are outside the county, to whatever 149 Mr. AWE. Well, it just seems to me, as I said in my Opening com- ment, that the cities-the big cities like Houston and San Francis- co and New York and Los Angeles are having to pay exorbitant amounts of money to take care of these folks. And as I-we just are not going to have the money in Harris County. If it is true that we are going to have 10,000 people by 1991, we are going to have to open up huge numbers of new beds and hire new staff to take care of these folks. And it looks now like those predictions are going to be accurate. And we are going to have to go, I guess, to the county taxpayers and ask them for more property taxes. But I do not think it is fair that Houston and the residents of Harris County have to pay all of this cost. I think this is a Nation- al, Federal problem. Mr. LELAND. Now, Dr. Awe, you are talking about-you are talk- ing about patient care, now. And, on top of that, we are talking about preventive measures like education. Mr. AWE. That is true. Mr. LELAND. We are talking about even a more massive amount of money. Mr. AWE. That is true. It is very expensive, but it is something that has to be done. These people are dying and probably most of the ones that are infected are going to eventually get the disease. And, once they get the disease, they are very hard to take care of and it is very costly. Mr. LELAND. I am concerned that the State legislature has done what it has done. Do you think that this problem is priority enough to the extent that we ought to expect and hope that the Governor of the State or Texas will call a special session-it seems that since this session of the legislature is so far spent-targeting or at least prioritizing this issue as one that should be regarded as substantial enough for the Governor to pay that kind of attention? Mr. AWE. Well, I do not know if I could recommend they have a special session. All I can say is: We went to them and asked them just to help us pay for AZT, which we estimate Harris County, alone, is going to cost $1 million in the next year, out of our local hospital budget just to support AZT for our indigent patients, which we, of course, intend to do. But, when we went there, they just said it is Houston's problem. It is not problem as far as Texas is concerned, not considering the fact that when Houston was the boom town, people came from all over the country to this city. And, now, many of them have AIDS. Mr. LELAND. Well, the last I looked, I did not realize that Hous- ton had seceded from Texas. Mr. AWE. That is what they said. They said, \"It is Houston's problem. I will not fund this.\" Mr. LELAND. Well, let me ask you something, Dr. Awe. Have you appealed to the Harris County delegation to the State legislature, which at one point-at one time in history, was reputed to be the most powerful delegation in the State legislature. Mr. AWE. We have written letters asking Mrs. Moore, who is the Administrator at Jeff Davis, went up there personally and testified, asking for help. And they, just, to say the least, were unsympathet- ic with our problems. 148 And it is my understanding that John Sealy in Galveston will not take patients from most counties in Texas. They only take them from three or four of the surrounding counties of Galveston. So. it is a tremendous problem for patients coming from outside of Harris County to get care anywhere, particularly, if they r.re indi- gent. Mr. Lm.AND. Will John Sealy take patients from Harris County? Mr. AwE. No, sir. They will not. Mr. LELAND. They will not. Then that goes right to the heart of the concern of my colleague, Mr. Fields, who was concerned about those outside of Harris County. Mr. AWE. Absolutely. M.'. IELAND. When-- Mr. AwE-. I am sorry. Mr. LLAND. No. I just wanted to find out where they go, then, if they cannot get help here in Harris County or in Galveston County? Mr. Aw.. Right now, I do not think there is any place they can go. I really do not. I think this is why it is so important that the Federal Government realize that this is a National problem. And the only solution that I know of is to get these folks on Medicare, which is Federally, funded, as early as they can. Right now, they can get on Medicare if they have been disabled for 2 years. But, as you well know, most patients with AIDS do not survive 2 years. So, very rarely, do they live long enough to even get on it. Mr. LEIAND. So, then, thre are people out there who are literal- Iv at the brink of death and some who have died because they do not have access to the kind of care that is provided through the county-through the Harris County Hospital District? Mr. AwE. I am convinced that that is true, yes. Mr. LELAND. What-maybe I should ask-well, before I ask this question of both of you, let me ask: Roughly, what percent of your hospital's-you said 20 to 30 percent; is that right? The Harris County Hospital District? Mr. AwE. And that is just medicine beds, obviously. Jeff Davis is really, mainly, an OB hospital. It is the largest obstetric hospital in the whole country. But the seventh floor of Jeff Davis is a medi- cine-of course, it is part of the Baylor program: Baylor teaching hospital. And there is about 55 medicine beds. And about 20 per- cent of them all are usually occupied by AIDS patients. Mr. LELAND. And what percent of them are minorities? Mr. AwE. It runs around 30-40 percent are minorities. When I made rounds Saturday, there were 10 AIDS patients in the house. Eight were Black, one was Hispanic and one was white. But, again, that was an unusual weekend. But it usually runs more like 40 percent. Mr. LELAND. About 40 percent. Mr. AwE. Right. Mr. LELANIN. Let me ask you something. I hear the resounding cry for politicians who are in positions of authority to do something about this in the State, Federal and local governments. Let me just ask you: What is your admonition to us, those of us who have some ability to hopefully do something about this program? 175 You have had children of your own, and many of the members on this panel have teenagers. What message should we be sending to our teens today about this disease, this virus that kills, and what steps they should take to avoid it? What would you tell your-I don't know the ages of your chil- dren. Ms. TAYLOR. Mine are all grown now, but I have grandchildren who are growing up. I think the mores, the morality today simply have to change. If it means taking a complete swing, as it usually does, from a permissive age to a more Victorian attitude. This is with a reason, not just a fashion. It is a life reason. People are going to have to change their ways. I think things like singles bars, massage parlors, are going to have to be a thing of the past. Careful sex: you cannot say to teenagers, people in their 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, that sex is completely out of the question. That is unrealistic. There have got to be ways of careful sex. We have to be more inventive, I guess, and have more fun in finding them. Mr. COATS. Don't we run the risk of not giving them the full truth, if we talk in terms of safe sex, or careful sex? Ms. TAYLOR. I think we have to tell them the complete truth. Mr. COATS. The complete truth is that any relationship carries the potential-- Ms. TAYLOR. If you are talking about intercourse, yes. Mr. COATS. Carries the potential of receiving the virus. Ms. TAYLOR. Yes. Mr. COATS. I am disturbed sometimes with the message that says, all you have to do is have one partner. Just make sure you don't have multiple partners. I am not sure I want to leave that message with my teenager daughter, becv,,se that one person may be carry- ing the virus. Ms. TAYLOR. Exactly. I am a single woman, and I think before embarking on a new relationship I would have the AIDS test myself. If I were serious about someone, in love with someone, I would ask that they have the AIDS test before 1 embark on an inti- mate relationship. Mr. COATS. The reason is because the consequence is death. No cure. Ms. TAYLOR. There sure isn't. Mr. COATS. It is not a matter of going to the doctor and getting a shot of penicillin. It's death. Ms. TAYLOR. Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no remis- sion. Mr. COATS. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Coats. Ms. Taylor, we have sent ou to talk to the President. We have asked you to speak to the eads of the networks. Usually witnesses tell us what to do, and we are telling you what to do. I think the important thing is that we need to work together, and your message to us is that we are the elected officials. The gov- ernment people ought to be showing the leadership. I think, in showing leadership, we can follow your example. Thank you very much for being with us. 174 I only mention it because I question whether or not a person who has exhibited that judgment in the past should be associated with an organization that, ostensibly, is designed to reduce the incidence of this disease among the American people. Ms. TAYLOR. I would like to know whether-excuse me-whether your facts are correct or not, because it is a reflection on the Foun- dation. I do know that Dr. Silverman does not believe in that today. And that's all I can speak of, as the Chairman of the Foun- dation, of which he is spokesman. I don't like to see his character maligned. Mr. MADIGAN. Would the gentleman yield? Mr. WAXMAN. The Chair yields to Mr. Madigan. Mr. MADIGAN. I would just observe, Ms. Taylor, that you hung in there very well. Thank you. Mr. WAXMAN. I think if you are going to question a man's judg- ment, he ought to give his rationale for his judgment; and also to know what his judgment was before we condemn him. Mr. Sikorski. Mr. SIKORSKI. No more questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Whittaker. Mr. Bliley. Mr. Bt ILEY. No questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Coats. Mr. COATS. Just one question, Mr. Chairman, and one statement to make. My colleague, Mr. Madigan, asked Ms. Taylor if she would participate in a program which would send a message that there are potentially 41,000-- Ms. TAYLOR. Seven hundred. Mr. COATS. Forty-one thousand people who currently have AIDS and that, if you had sex with them, it could kill you. That particu- lar message. I think it is important, and I know Congressman Mad- igan knows this, but I think it is important that everyone under- stand that the estimates are that, for every person currently infect- ed with AIDS, there are 100 people carrying the AIDS virus who don't know it. Ms. TAYLOR. Exactly. Mr. COATS. So we are talking about 4 million people, not 41,000 people. Ms. TAYLOR. All the people that have ARC and are carriers, and don't know it. The women, particularly there is a very high per- centage of women carriers with ARC, that have no idea they are carrying ARC, because they are not looking for the symptoms. Whereas a man may be more on the lookout for such things as swollen lymph glands, and various other things. It may not occur as readily to a female. I believe, in New York City, last week they tested at random in a hospital 5 percent of the pregnant women that had come to the hospital for treatment, and 5 percent of those women tested that were pregnant had AIDS. They couldn't inform the women, because they had not been told they would be tested. That's an amazing percentage, just from one hospital. Mr. COATS. I think iU is important to publicize the potential scope of this epidemic and the crisis that we are facing. The word you used was crisis, and I believe it is crisis, and we should act accord- ingly. 173 Mr. DANNEMEYER. Go ahead, Ms. Taylor. Ms. TAYLOR. That was before Dr. Silverman had anything to do with AMFAR, and the dates which you talk about, one knew so much less about the disease and how it was spread. What Dr. Sil- verman did then is entirely his own business. How he behaves as a member of our Foundation is my business, and the board's business. He certainly has never given any indica- tion that he would approve of those measures today. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Well, I mention it because-- Ms. TAYLOR. I think he realizes that the way the disease is being spread that those particular things are not really a good idea. Mr. DANNEMEVER. I mention it today because I probably won't have an opportunity of visiting with you again during our life- times. Ms. TAYLOR. Oh, I don't know. Mr. DANNEMEYER. It's not that I don't want to, but-you know. You have things to do and I have things to do. Dr. Silverman is not only associated with your corporation, but he is also a spokesman for the California Medical Association. I think it is a mistake a judgment for we Californians-if I may speak this way-to have a person of the philosophical persuasion of Dr. Silverman in a sensitive position of attempting to lead-- Ms. TAYLOR. But I don't believe Dr. Silverman believes that today. He has never expressed that opinion to AMFAR. Mr. DANNEMEVER. I only wish that were so. Ms. Taylor, I only wish that were so. It has been nice to visit with you. Mr. WAXMAN. The Chair will take this prerogative to-- Ms. TAYLOR. I think you are condemning a man for something-I mean, people do change their mind. Dr. Silverman shows no indica- tion that he thinks bathhouses should be open today. Mr. WAXMAN. The Chair will address this point. I didn't do the research because I didn't think Dr. Silverman was the topic for today's hearing. But, as I recall the events, and I didn't have a chance to check them, but I think as I recall reading the newspa- per that Dr. Silverman took the exact opposite position that is being attributed to him. Furthermore, I do know that he is not a spokesman for the Cali- fornia Medical Association, although I think he shares the same opinion that they have given, that has been the same opinion that Dr. Koop has expressed, and Secretary Bowen has expressed, with which Mr. Dannemeyer disagrees. I think what Mr. Dannemeyer is probably offended about is that Mr. Silverman doesn't agree with him on a lot of these issues. But I would think we all ought to check that information carefully, and hear from him-- Ms. TAYLOR. I wish you would, because-- Mr. WAXMAN. I don't think it is fair to attack a man's character without having given him an opportunity to be heard. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, you misunderstood my re- marks. I didn't talk about the character of Dr. Silverman. I talked about his judgment in performance of a role as the chief health of- ficer for the County of San Francisco. That's the only matter to which I speak. 172 the money accessible, that money, I think that it would be a tre- mendous boost to the educational effort. Ms. TAYLOR. It certainly would. I will try. Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Dannemeyer. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Taylor, I want to express my thanks to you in the work that you are doing with the American Foundation for AJDS Research, in the compassion you are exhibiting and the success I think you are having in focusing on what may be some solutions to this prob- lem in the country. I would like to ask you a little bit about the American Founda- tion for AIDS Research. Is a man by the name of Melwyn Silver- man working for it? Ms. TAYLOR. Melwyn Silverman? Mr. DANNEMEYER. Dr. Silverman? Dr. Silverman. Merv Silverman. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Merv Silverman? Yes. Is he working with the association? Ms. TAYLOR. Yes, he is spokesman. Mr. DANNEMEYER. What is his capacity with the association? Ms. TAYLOR. Spokesman. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Is that a full-time job for him? Ms. TAYLOR. No. Mr. DANNEMEYER. I see. And where does Dr. Silverman office in the capacity that he has, in California? Ms. TAYLOR. He lives in California, I believe, in San Francisco. He has another job. He is part-time with us. Mr. DANNEMEYER. I see. The reason I raised the question is be- cause in this era in which we live, which is new to all of us, namely, faced with an epidemic, it is important that we have lead- ership in Congress, in the public health world and in work that you are doing that reflects the sense of treating this epidemic as a public health issue rather than a civil rights issue. The reason I draw reference to Dr. Silverman is for you to take up with the board of directors of your association Dr. Silverman's status with your group. The reason I make that statement is that during a period of approximately from May of 1983 through Octo- ber of 1984, Dr. Silverman was serving as a health officer for the City and County of San Francisco. In May of 1983, in June of 1983, in March of 1983 and then again in March of that year, he was asked by the political leadership of that city to shut down the bath- houses of San Francisco as a means of controlling the transmissi- bility of this fatal virus, and he refused. He declined to do it. Hie was literally begged by the political leadership of that city to perform that act, which was within his jurisdiction as the chief health officer of the City and County of San Francisco. He finally made that decision in October of 1984 and resigned 2 months later because obviously there was some talk that he was on the verge of being terminated. I mention this because, as I said at the beginning of my com- ments, we are going to be successful in this battle if the leader- ship-- Ms. TAYOR. If I may interject? 171 Ms. TAYLOR. People in show business really are quite extraordi-nary. I don't consider myself in show business, I have been out of it so long. I am talking about the people that are working. We al- ready have 38 PSA's, not just for AMFAR, not asking for money, but informative PSA's, and we have 38 superstars that have volun- teered and done them. So I think the entertainment world has shown more than willingness; they have done something about it. They have given of their time and their energies and they are con-tinuing to do so, and they can be counted on for their continued support. Mr. MADIGAN. I appreciate very much what you and others have been doing and what I know you will continue to do. We may becalling on you to say some chosen things about some of the net- work producers, or not producers but whoever these people are that own these things. Thank you. Ms. TAYLOR. I'm here. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Madigan. Mr. Wyden: Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Taylor, I to want to commend you for a superb job. My col- league asked for your help with the entertainment industry and the networks in particular. I would like to ask for your help with the Executive Branch of the Government of the United States. Ms. TAYLOR. I have been trying. I was here a couple of years ago, and I must say the increase in the money has impressed me enor- mously since I was first here. It is wonderful. Mr. WYDEN. There is one thing in-particular that I think you could help us with tremendously. I noted that at the bottom of page 2 of your testimony, you said that $20 million is awaiting con- gressional action to support a mailing and education program of AIDS information to all households in this country. This spring Congress appropriated $30 million for an AIDS education mailing to all the American households for this fiscal year. Ms. TAYLOR. That is such an important way of getting the mes- sage across to the American household. It starts with the parents. The parents can teach the children. It has worked in Britain. I will do anything I can to help you get that money. I will ring doorbells. Mr. WYDEN. Well, I think perhaps one telephone call will do. Ms. TAYLOR. That easy? Mr. WYDEN. In fact, ringing the doorbell at 1600 Pennsylvania might help. Ms. TAYLOR. Oh, I know that address. Mr. WYDEN. I just want to commend you for a superb job, and ifthere is any way we could free up that money in the Executive Branch it would be wonderful. Ms. TAYLOR. Would that be the place to call? Mr. WYDEN. That would be just great. Mr. WYDEN. I want to emphasize what my colleague from Illinois said about pursuing this on a bipartisan basis. The fact is that there seems to be some kind of bottleneck in the Executive Branch given that this money was appropriated for fiscal year 1987, and our subcommittee counsel has learned that it is not going to bespent in fiscal year 1987. In particular if there were efforts to make 170 have in being honest with people and trying to give some leader- ship to try to stop this epidemic. Ms. TAYLOR. It is the behavior of tomorrow that is going to have to change, and I hope the behavior of today. I hope people start re- acting with compassion toward the people that have AIDS and start acting like human beings towards their human mankind and not show what is happening now, man's inhumanity to man. Mr. WAXMAN. I want to recognize other members of the subcom- mittee for questions they might have of you. Mr. Madigan. Mr. MADIGAN. At the outset, Ms. Taylor, let me assure you that to everybody over the age of 40, you are quite attractive with your glasses on. And I am going to leave mine on because I quickly want to read you some numbers. In 1981 the total expenditures by the Federal Government on AIDS-related programs was $200,000, and in 1988 it is proposed to be $790 million. So in response to the initial part of your statement as to whether or not the Congress is going to be responsive to providing sufficient money for this, I think those numbers should alleviate any concern that you have. This is a bipartisan effort. No Republican and no Democrat has spoken against this increase, and Republicans and Democrats have cooperated in making those increases possible. If the Centers for Disease Control and Dr. Koop and others want to come in and show us other ways that we can effectively spend more money, I am sure this subcommittee and the committee of which it is a part will be as responsive to those requests as we have been to all of the other requests that have been made since 1981. But as you point out, as that money is being spent on various kinds of research, including research in search of a vaccine, the ef- fective thing that can be done by American society is to deal with the education part of this effort. In your remarks you have suggest- ed that the education effort needs to be forthright and explicit, and it is in that regard that I would like to ask you if you would be willing to be a principal in that education effort that you describe as necessarily being forthright and explicit. Ms. TAYLOR. Yes, I certainly would, and I have tried to be in the past. Mr. MADIGAN. Would you be willing to make television commer- cials that say, for example, there are 41,000 people on the streets of America who could kill you through sex; you better be careful? Would you be willing to do that? Ms. TAYLOR. Yes, I would certainly do that. I have done PSA's in the past, and I have every intention of continuing to do them. I will say anything I have to that will help AIDS. Mr. MADIGAN. All right. Would you be willing to join with Mr. Waxman, myself and others in beating up on some of these net- work people so that those announcements will be seen by the public in large numbers? Ms. TAYLOR. I would be more than happy to. Mr. MADIGAN. Do you think you could enlist the assistance some of your colleagues in the Hollywood establishment in that kind of effort? 169 Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Ms. Taylor, for that excel- lent statement. Obviously, your organization has been trying to get the research funds to develop a cure or a vaccine, but what we now have as a way of stopping the spread of this disease is education and only education. Unless people know the information about how AIDS is spread and how it is not spread can they take the actions that will be necessary to protect themselves and not take actions that are based on irrational fears, which will be doing an injustice not just to them but to everyone involved. Ms. TAYLOR. Exactly. Mr. WAXMAN. What do you believe would be the most effective way of reaching American audiences with AIDS education? Ms. TAYLOR. I think the media can and has been very helpful, but I think they are also very misguided. Sometimes I am watching the news and I go through the ceiling. You hear facts that aren't substantiated, and I suppose they get their information from the CDC, but the information seems to change daily. The facts seem to change daily. We seem to be spreading panic and fear more than education, more than ways of preventing the spreading of disease. We do know that it is through sex, blood, drugs that it is spread, but we must learn the practical ways of avoiding that. It is all fine and well to say abstain from sex, but that is not a practical answer. I don't think everyone in America that isn't married is all of a sudden going to stop having sex. I think that is a totally unrealistic approach. It is a catastrophe that condoms aren't 100 percent foolproof, but they do help. It does lessen the chance, but some people still be- lieve that AIDS is a homosexual disease and that only homosexuals should worry about it, that it is in their court. That is totally untrue. It started out a heterosexual disease in Africa from eating the green monkey. If you really want to get down to it, everybody who isn't a vegetarian should be rounded up, I mean if you really want to get silly about it. It is a disease now that belongs to everyone, and it picks at random. The only way of slowing it down is through education. I don't believe myself in education in schools. I think it should be at home through parents. But I think this is a case where, because parents themselves know so little about it, it is going to have to be taught in schools in a way that doesn't spread fear and discrimina- tion. Mr. WAXMAN. In other words, we have to be honest about what we know, what we don't know, but what we do know is a great deal about this disease, and we have to be honest with people about how the disease is spread and ways to lessen the risk. I was troubled by some of those ads that I saw where they acted as if condoms were a sure answer to stop the spread of AIDS. Ms. TAYLOR. And unfortunately, it is not. Mr. WAXMAN. It is a way to lessen the risk. It is a way to protect oneself if they are going to undertake this risk. I noted that the educational efforts of your organization have pointed that out over and over again, giving the information that we know to be factual based on what the scientists have told us, not what people want to fear or what they want to conjecture, but what information we 168 Our most wished-for hope to stopping AIDS is obviously a cure and a vaccine. This requires an intensive, expeditious, well-funded, well-coordinated research effort. The battle to continue increased funding will obviously be difficult. I beg you to persevere in provid- ing the funds to find the answers that are so desperately needed. If the answers are not found quickly, all budgets will be totally over- whelmed. We must always keep in mind that we are facing an emergency. Federal research programs must not be only funded; they must be guarded against bureaucratic delays. Scientists at the CDC and NIH havi expressed their opinion that they must also pursue long-range plans that don't necessarily fit into the year-to-year plans. We have been told that even when re- search projects are improved, oftentimes the researchers cannot get staff or laboratory facilities. \"For want of a nail, the war was lost.\" Don't let it be that for want of a lab, the countless human lives are lost. In the absence of a cure or a vaccine, we have only one weapon to combat the spread of AIDS. That weapon is education. In Brit- ain, population 55 million, 750 cases of AIDS have been reported. Government-sponsored AIDS education campaigns have totalled $30 million. In the United States, population 234 million, 41,700 cases of AIDS have been reported. No public information or media campaigns have been initiated. One million dollars has been appro- priated to develop a national advertising campaign. In excess of $20 million is awaiting congressional action to support a mailing and education program for AIDS information to all households in America. AIDS education must be forthright and understandable. We must be explicit without being vulgar, yet we must use words that every- one will understand instead of euphemisms that are vague and un- clear, and we must not spread fear or panic in our education. We must separate the facts of AIDS education from the lessons of morality. We are not talking about a venereal disease for which one can take a pill or a shot; we are talking about life and death. The prevention of effective AIDS education due to claims of immo- rality may lead to the deaths of many Americans to whom morali- ty was emphasized over reality. There are many things that must occur in order to put an end to this epidemic that is just killing so many people. There are also some things that must not occur. There is no place in the fight against AIDS for business-as-usual complacency or politics. It has nothing to do with Democrats and Republicans. As election year approaches, AIDS is already becoming a politi- cal issue. There are those who say that those of us who want to educate and guarantee research to save lives are a special interest group. Those who are sick are being blamed for being sick. We are see growing numbers of examples of the most cruel and senseless mistreatment of people with AIDS. We are at war with a virus; we must not be at war with each other. I thank you for your hard work, and I urge you to continue to fight for the day when AIDS will be nothing but a painful memory. 167 Ms. MCFARREN. At this point the Surgeon General certainly has some excellent information. The National AIDS Network also has information on materials that are available around the country, and I believe, although I am sorry to say I do not believe it is yet funded, that eventually the Centers for Disease Control will have a major clearinghouse. It was originally my understanding that that was to be funded this year. I have not heard that the contract has yet been approved. Mr. FIELDS. Do you know, or perhaps the chairman may know, does the Surgeon General plan to update or amend his report? Ms. McFARREN. I am not aware that he is going to update it, but I haven't checked lately, either. Mr. FIELDS. Do you know, Mr. Chairman? Mr. WAXMAN. I am not aware of the Surgeon General making any changes or updating it, but I think the Public Health Service is working on keeping it up to date. Mr. FIELDS. Thank you very much. I yield back. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much for your testimony to us and sharing the film clips with us and talking about the education- al efforts. We appreciate you being with us. Ms. McFARREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Our next witness is well known to everyone, not just to everyone here but maybe everyone in the world. Ms. Eliza- beth Taylor has taken the opportunity of using her tremendous popularity and renown to turn America's attention to the problems of AIDS. She and the organization she chairs have begun a private effort to create a compassion and urgency in our response to the epidemic. I want to welcome you here today and commend you for your leadership and tell you how pleased we are to hear from you at this hearing this afternoon. STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH TAYLOR, NATIONAL CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR AIDS RESEARCH Ms. TAYLOR. Thank you. It is very nice to be here. Thank you for the introduction. I am Elizabeth Taylor, the National Chairman of AMFAR. We started about 2 years ago, and I am very pleased to say that we ha-,e already given away in 50,000 grants approximately $31/4 mil- lion, and we are very proud of that for a young foundation. Chairman Waxman, Mr. Madigan, I am very honored to be here and thank you. Let me begin by expressing my heartfelt gratitude and admira- tion for the Congress' success at increasing the levels of AIDS spending. Your remarkable achievements have not gone unnoticed. I am here today to discuss the AIDS crisis. I emphasize the word\"crisis.\" We must keep in mind the fact that AIDS is a crisis, an overwhelming crisis that grows with each new day, one that threat- ens hundreds of millions of people worldwide, a crisis that is meas- ured not only in human lives, tragic suffering and untold economic costs, but also one that tests our capacity for reason and compas- sion. 166 their own independent decisions and feel strong as they grow up. As they get older, they need more specific information. There are now some very excellent education programs out that make recommendations, K through 12, for AIDS education. I would be glad to provide some of those for you if you would like. Mr. COATS. Do any of these countries that are engaged in the na- tional program have different spots for different age groups? Are you just showing us an example of what is shown on national tele- vision? Ms. McFARREN. Those are national television films with the ex- ception of the last one, and there are other vehicles and education- al materials for age groups and for specific populations in most of those countries. Mr. COATS. Who has done the best job of all? What country do you look to in terms of educating and informing its citizens? Ms. MCFARREN. Certainly Great Britain's program has had all of the components that we think are so important, from the major tel- evision programs to education, educational efforts on TV, mailings to people's homes, and segmented education programs. So they de- signed a nationwide program, and I think that is very successful. I think we are still evaluating all of the programs, and each one of us can improve on the last person's and last country's efforts. Mr. COATS. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you. Mr. Fields. Mr. FIELDS. I really just have one question. I recently sent out a general newsletter, one of what are called Postal Patrons to my constituents, on the subject of AIDS which contained general infor- mation. I represent what would be termed a Bible Belt district in the South, in Texas. I was pleasantly surprised at the response I got. The people were grateful that I had sent out that particular type of information as a public service. So my question is: Are there other things that you might suggest that we as concerned members of Congress might be able to do to help in that educational effort? Ms. McFARREN. I certainly think that information that is sent out as part of your communication with your constituency is very helpful. Some members of Congress have sent out the Surgeon Gen- eral's report to all members of their area, and that has been help- ful. I think what we are going to have to realize and one of the di- lemmas we face on this is this has to be an ongoing process. First of all, people forget, we need reinforcement, there is new informa- tion coming out. People hear things differently at different times in their lives. If they are not involved in a relationship and they don't care much about AIDS and they start to move into a relationship, they need more information. So we must think in ternis of a long-term program with ongoing information to assure that all of our citizens have the information ti-at they need. All of those kinds of efforts are useful. Mr. FIELDS. What is the best clearinghouse for that information? Is it the Surgeon General's Office? 165 consideration by your board of directors as something we should be doing and hope you will find your way clear to support them. Thank you. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Dannemeyer. Mr. Sikorski. Mr. Bliley. Mr. BLILEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. McFarren, your Council and your statement has called for $1 billion for education by 1991. Is that $1 billion a year or is that the total to be spent between now and 1991 would be $1 billion? Ms. MCFARREN. Our goal and the recommendation of the Nation- al Academy of Sciences is that funds be increased in education to parallel the increase in research so that there would be, under their recommendation, $1 billion spent in research by 1991 annual- ly and $1 billion spent in education by 1991 on an annual basis. Mr. BLILEY. I am sure that you and your Council are aware of the budgetary constraints that we find ourselves, and it doesn't appear that we are going to get out of them anytime soon. Ms. McFARREN. Yes, sir, I am. Mr. BLILEY. Has your Council ever considered perhaps a tax on condoms to pay for it? After all, somebody has got to pay for it. Ms. McFARREN. Frankly, we have not. The concept has a kind of nice ring to it. On the other hand, because we are talking about death, I would prefer that we perhaps tax something else and give away condoms so people will use them. Mr. BLILEY. Well, perhaps if there is something else that is going to be taxed, they may not feel the same way as you do. Ms. McFARREN. I am sure that we might disagree on that. Mr. BLILEY. In my experience in government, most people would like somebody else to bear that burden. Ms. McFARREN. I understand that. I am just concerned about the public health implications on this one. Mr. BLILEY. Thank you, Ms. McFarren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Coats. Mr. COATS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome to a fellow Hoosier. Ms. McFARREN. Thank you. Mr. COATS. I appreciate your efforts in this regard. I am wonder- ing if you would comment more on the film clips that we saw. Those appeared to be directed to the adult population. Would you suggest that we might fashion a different message for different age groups? Is this something that you have considered, and if so, what would that different message be? Ms. McFARREN. Yes. I think that we do need to seriously think about what messages are appropriate for what age groups and for what populations. However, we should have a broad program that discusses education that is acceptable and done on national televi- sion and through national media and with sitcoms and every other way that we can. Then with specific groups, we would provide spe- cific education that would be more detailed and at a level of under- standing that would be appropriate for that group. Clearly, people in young grades need basic information and, more important, I think, a feeling of self worth so that they can make 164 to you that these are models from which we could draw to develop our own education program so that we could address this very seri- ous problem. -Mr. DANNEMEVER. There was a statement in one of the films with respect to the use of condoms. Did the film say the failure rate for condoms with anal intercourse? Ms. McFARREN. No, it did not. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Do you know what that is? Ms. MCFARREN. I'm not sure that we have any good data on that. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Would you believe that the estimate of 30 to 40 percent of failure with the use of condoms for anal intercourse is accurate? Ms. McFARREN. That would certainly be much higher than the pregnancy rate with using condoms, and that is the only, I think, relatively accurate data we have in terms of condom usage in this country. Mr. DANNEMEYER. The film also mentioned in the use of con- doms-well, it didn't mention anything about the failure rate of condoms for vaginal intercourse, did it? Ms. MCFARREN. No, it did not. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Do you know what that failure rate is? Ms. -McFARREN. Yes. That is about 12 to 15 percent use efficacy rate, which indicates not only those people-that takes a data of 100 couples having sexual intercourse for a year, and about 12 to 15 of them would become pregnant. A number of those would become pregnant because they did not use condoms rather than be- cause of the failure of the condom. Mr. DANNEMEYER. I only mention this point to point out that if our message to the American people is that we can avoid getting AIDS by use of a condom, we are deceiving ourselves and the people of the country. There is no such thing as safe sex. There may be safer sex-- Ms. MCFARREN. I would agree with you on that. Mr. DANNEMEYER [continuing]. But it is kind of like taking a pistol with one bullet in it when you use a condom and have inter- course with a person with a fatal disease. You might make it five times, but you might hit the unlucky time once. I think if we want to be fair with the people of our country, we should be telling them that. Don't you agree? Ms. MCFARREN. I certainly agree that condoms offer safer sex rather than safe sex. I would, however, prefer to have someone use condoms rather than nothing. The gun that you mentioned has one bullet in it if someone is using condoms. It would have six bullets in it if they were using nothing. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Your foundation is in business for the purpose of education; correct? Ms. MCFARREN. That is true. Mr. DANNEMEYER. May I suggest there is another agenda this Nation can pursue in order to control the epidemic, and it relates to the pursuit of normal, routine, customary responses that our public health authorities have pursued traditionally to control com- municable disease, such as-reportability, and since we haven't been reporting those with the virus, now we are talking about testing certain samples of our population. I would suggest those topics for 163 Mr. MADIGAN. Do you know what years, for example, with regard to France or Australia, what years these video presentations began to be displayed publicly? Ms. MCFARREN. I believe I have that data but I do not have it with me, and I can get it for you. Mr. MADIGAN. You use numbers. You said there are 2,000 cases of AIDS in France. Ms. MCFARREN. Almost 2,000. Mr. MADIGAN. And 41,000 in the USA. Ms. MCFARREN. Yes. Mr. MADIGAN. The inference in your remarks would suggest that you believe the difference between the levels of ilifections in the two countries has been the educational programs. Is that the infer- ence that you wanted me to draw? Ms. MCFARREN. No, sir, it was not. My concern is that we know we have many, many people who have already been diagnosed with AIDS, and we are aware that there are many people who are in- fected in this country, and in order to avoid further transmission, it is imperative that we start a major education campaign. When many of the people who are now ill were infected, we did not even know enough about the disease to tell people what they might do to prevent transmission. Mr. MADIGAN. From your work and interest in this issue, do you think these numbers for these other countries accurately reflect the situation in those countries presently? Ms. MCFARREN. My understanding is-and this is verbal and I don't have documentation on it-that the data basis for the coun- tries I mentioned, with the possible exception of Uganda, are fairly accurate. When we get to the emerging Nations, we have a differ- ent problem, but generally health data in the other countries that I mentioned is fairly accurate. Another problem may be Brazil. Mr. MADIGAN. Thank you very much. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Madigan. Mr. Wyden, questions? Mr. Dannemeyer, any questions? Mr. DANNEMEYER. Tell me, Ms. McFarren, does any of the money that finances the work of your foundation come from the Federal Government? Ms. MCFARREN. No, sir, it does not. Mr. DANNEMEYER. And how long have you been in business? Ms. MCFARREN. Three years. Mr. DANNEME:YER. I was interested in the films you showed, and I have a comment with respect to two points. At one point, one of the film narrators made the statement that the only means of transferring the virus is by sex or drugs. Are you aware that of the 41,000-plus AIDS cases in this country, CDC has categorized be- tween 3 and 4 percent as unknown as to source? Ms. MCFARRIN. Yes, I am. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Your film doesn't say that, does it? Ms. MCFARREN. Sir, I am aware that we don't know all the sources of transmission. I believe that in some cases when the his- tories were taken, people were ill and were unable to give appropri- ate information. However, these particular films are an indication of what another country elected to do. I am not suggesting that we should use these films as they are in this country. I am suggesting 162 Mr. WAXMAN. To try to inform their people about AIDS and ways to lessen the risk of the AIDS epidemic. Ms. McFARRFN. Yes. Mr. WAXMAN. low many film strips have been made by the U.S. Government? Ms. MCFARR:N. I am aware of one set of spots that Governor Bowen-excuse me, I'm from Indiana-Secretary Bowen has given that simply states that AIDS is a concern and gives a hotline number. None of this type of filming. Mr. WAXMAN. And then there are announcements for television being made by private organizations that are aired as public serv- ice announcements. Ms. McFARRIN. Yes, there are, although there is no campaign that is an integrated campaign that provides information at all levels and is targeted for prime time in key information slots, and that is one of our major concerns. Frequently public service an- nouncements are aired at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, and that is not when many of us are listening to television. Mr. WAXMAN. Are these spots being aired during the prime time television viewing hours in the respective countries? Ms. MCFARRI:N. A good share of them are. Some of them are not. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much. Mr. Madigan. Mr. MADIGAN. Ms. McFarren, with regard to the video announce- ments you have just shown us, can you tell us what the impact of those announcements has been in the countries in which they are shown? For example, has there been any community resistance to these commercials, and has there been any attempt made to meas- ure the effectiveness of the commercials? Ms. McFARREN. There have been studies done in England regard- ing the response to the English campaign, which included not only radio and television materials but a door-to-door mail campaign. It did increase people's awareness and knowledge, and there is a fairly extensive report on that entire program which I would be glad to submit to you. Australia has also done a fairly extensive response, and I don't happen to like that particular spot because I think it is very fright- ening, but over 97 percent of the population in Australia indicated that they had seen the spot and could describe it when they were tested in market surveys afterwards. Seventy-five percent said that it increased their knowledge, and 70 percent indicated that it did change their behavior. So it appears that there has been some effect from this type of effort in other countries. Mr. MAImGAN. In those countries :,ie networks are government owned, so I presume the networks had some say in determining at what time the announcements would be seen by the public. Ms. McFARREN. Yes, and that, of course, is a difference here. In our case I would hope there would be a public/private effort to assure that information was shown during prime time, but it would no doubt be much more expensive in this country than it would be in a situation like that of England. 188 Mr. WYDEN. Is it your testimony that renovation and construc- tion money are needed new expenses for AIDS research? Mr. MAKE. What I suggested is that in addition to grants and contracts to individual researchers and research projects, that one way of trying to build a cadre of AIDS researchers, in addition to the traditional method of training grants and new investigator grants, is, for example, one might build a modest amount of con- tainment facilities, so that different centers can do AIDS research who are not able to do it now. Mr. WYDEN. I understand in your testimony, that you believe that fellowship and training money for young investigators are much needed investments in the AIDS research field. Could you elaborate a little bit on why that is the case? Mr. MIJKE. Well, I guess one of the issues in the AIDS area is long-standing-the peer review process, who gets grants and con- tracts, and one way to bring in new people who have no track record in a particular area of research is traditionally to go through the training grants to build up the cadre of people. And anyone who has followed the training grant and fellowship pro- grams as part of the research establishment, that's always been the orphan in the research area. And I think that if we're looking long- term, one has to build up both facilities and people in the AIDS area. Mr. WYDEN. The theory is that you have to round up people into the field and not incessantly overwork the people who are already in the field. Mr. ZIMMERMAN. Mr. Wyden, may I just comment on the ques- tion of construction of facilities? In our contacts with the experts, particularly the ones that were affiliated with the Institute of Medicine study and also at hearings we've participated in in Florida last month, there was much discus- sion of the need for expanded research facilities. The amount of moneys that were presented, for example, by the Institute experts didn't seem to be overwhelming, somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 million, but they felt it was very essential if the research activities are going to go forward like they should. Without the right facilities, they felt they couldn't achieve the ob- jectives that they want to achieve. Mr. WYDEN. Well, I commend all of you for a very excellent job and an important contribution. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Wyden. Thank you both, all three of you, for your testimony and your work on this issue. It's been very helpful to us. [Testimony resumes on p. 208.] [The following information was submitted for the record:] 187 we test 100,000 people. Suppose the prevalence of HIV infection is 0.01 percent. We have a test, the ELISA test, that's now 100 per- cent sensitive, meaning it would pick up everybody who would be infected, and a specificity of 99 percent, meaning only 1 percent false positives. Even after the Western Blot, which itself has a false positive rate of 1 percent, one would find in that 100,000 people 20 positives, 10 of which would be falsely accused of being HIV posi- tive. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Well, I see my time has expired. I have some other questions. Perhaps we'll have another round. Mr. WAXMAN. Without objection, the gentleman might take an additional minute, because I'd like to not go for another round. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Have you estimated what it costs for each of these persons who have fully developed AIDS for health care costs? Mr. ZIMMERMAN. We have no estimates of what it costs. Studies have been done of past cost experiences, and it ranges from $25,000 say, to $150,000. Mr. DANNEMEVER. Per patient? Mr. ZIMMERMAN. Per patient. Mr. DANNEMEVER. And based on your analysis, what do you esti- mate the cost to the health care system for caring for patients- persons with AIDS, not ARC, not the virus, just AIDS in the next 4 or 5 years? Mr. ZIMMERMAN. Well, I think the most recent study was done by the Rand Corporation. Let me say first that the GAO has not done a study of the overall cost of AIDS, particularly one. over a period of 4 or 5 years. Maybe Ms. Bascetta can respond to the cost data. Ms. BASCETrA. The most recent data that the CDC have esti- mates that direct medical care costs will approach $8.5 billion in 1991, and that-- Mr. DANNEMEYER. In that year? Ms. BASCETTA. In 1991. And that including the indirect cost, the productivity losses associated with those cases of AIDS in 1991, total social costs will be approximately $64 billion. Another study that the Rand Corporation did, which used a slightly greater caseload projection for 1991, estimated medical care costs of $38 billion in 1991. Mr. MIjxE. Congressman Dannemeyer, may I add to that? Mr. DANNEMEYER. Yes. Mr. MnIE. Secretary Bowen ctimates that next year Medicare costs-Medicaid costs, I'm sorry-for treatment of AIDS patients will be about $600 million with another $75 million for AZT. And if you figure that Medicaid costs are approximately about 40 percent of the total cost, then were talking about $1.5 billion next year, direct medical costs. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you, Mr. Dannemeyer. Mr. Wyden. Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Miike, do I understand from your testimony that you believe renovation and construction money are necessary new expenses for AIDS research? Mr. MIIKE. I'm sorry. Would you rephrase that again? 186 seen is that it will be 70 to 80 percent of the virus will go on to develop frank AIDS. Mr. MIK'-.. One has to understand that those are based on very small numbers of people followed-you know, we're talking about maybe a few hundred people followed for a length of time, and so estimates are made based on whatever evidence is available. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Also we've heard estimates that the quantity of people that have ARC today, not yet fully developed AIDS, is roughly a factor of 10 times the number who have fully developed AIDS. Do you think that's a fair estimate? Mr. MIIKE. No. I think that's an overestimate. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Pardon me? Mr. MIIKE. I think that's an overestimate. Mr. DANNEMEYER. An overestimate? Mr. MUKE. I think that's an overestimate. But it also again gets into definitional questions about what is ARC. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Don't you think it would be good public policy for our public health authorities at the Federal and State levels to have a better knowledge of the people in the country that have the virus? Mr. MiJEE. Definitely. However, I think the basic issue, which you are well familiar with, is how to get that information and who to test. Mr. DANNFMEYER. Well, do you believe, therefore, that public policy would require that we begin testing people in certain groups in order to find out how many of the American people have the virus? Mr. MIKE. It would depend on who we would test, and I think that-- Mr. DANNEMEYER. Well, let me give you an example. Hospital ad- mittees between the age of 14 and 49, persons convicted of drug abuse or prostitution, persons visiting STD clinics, persons entering the prison population, persons applying for marriage licenses. It s been estimated that these groups would include roughly 50 million people. Do you believe it's sound public policy to test people in those groups in order that we have a better understanding of the number of people with the virus? Mr. MIIKE. Well, my personal opinion is that I might agree with testing some of those people, but in terms of blanket testing of cat- egorical groups, I have some problems with that. And, Congressman Dannemeyer, I'm not talking simply about the civil rights aspects, but I'm talking about the rate of return and the issue of the number of people who would be falsely identi- fied, even after confirmatory testing. And I can submit some infor- mation to you later for the record that would outline why my con- cerns are in that area, in testing low-incidence people. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Well, you're familiar, of course, with the fact that the ELISA test if normally used and if positive, is then con- firmed, and then a third test, the Western Blot. Are you familiar with that? Mr. MI1KE. Yes. But if you notice, when I gave my oral state- ment, there is no standard for the Western Blot. The Defense De- partment uses different criteria from the Red Cross, and I can give you some examples. If we're talking about a population-suppose 185 for nothing-it was an hour of prime time TV, and I think other insurance companies, particularly life insurance companies that are at high financial risk, I think they're going to take part. I also think State and local governments have a responsibility, too, though a lot of tl )ir money is Federal money. Nevertheless, I think they ought to take the lead, particularly communities that are hard hit now. I'm quite sure they are spending money, and I expect others to join in. Mr. WAXMAN. One observation I would make as someone who has been involved as a Congressman in this AIDS issue since 1981 is that all of these groups that stand to lose so much money finan- cially-the insurance industry, the health industry, and all its com- ponents-have not come to us and insisted that we appropriate the funds for research, appropriate the funds for education. They have been standing on the sidelines until very recently, and it as been small groups like the gay men's groups that have come in, seeing their own dying from AIDS, pleading that we do what we're now finally seeing everybody agree that we should have been doing for some time. Your point is well taken. They do have a clear financial incen- tive to want to have educational efforts succeed. Now whether some of these industry groups will back that up and take some leadership is an open question in my mind. Mr. ZIMMERMAN. To some degree, it is in mine, too, to be frank with you. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Dannemeyer. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Mr. Zimmerman, have either you or Dr. Miike produced any estimates of the numbers of people in America today that have the virus? Mr. ZIMMERMAN. We haven't. At the GAO-- Mr. MIIKE. There are some attempts, and it's really more or less on a theoretical basis on what kinds of models one might develop in the absence of good, broad data. So that's still an open question. Mr. DANNEMEYER. One rule of thumb that's been articulated is that if you multiply the number of people with fully developed AIDS, currently 41,000 plus, by 100, we'd have a rough analysis of the number of people in this country with the virus. Do you believe that's a correct assessment? Mr. MnKE. In terms of ballpark figures, I would say that might be a little bit overestimated, if you're talking about 100 to 1. But I'm really not the person to answer that question, because if we're talking about a conversion rate anywhere between 20 and 60 per- cent, it doesn't seem to match. You talk about an AIDS case with 99 others. But on the other hand, the numbers that we've heard, which is about 1.5 to 2 million, have not changed over the past 2 years, and we know that it has to change. Mr. DANNEMEYER. What did you say? A conversion rate of what? Mr. MIIKE. Well, the current estimates about people who go on from infection to frank disease, AIDS, now range anywhere from 20 to 60 percent over a 5- to 10-year period. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Well, you're speaking about what we heard, what we were told 6 months ago. The current estimates that I have 184 AIDS virus. We were questioned by some in the research community as to why we chose to address the issue, since in their opinion, it was a very minor question. But it is a major issue for the public, and we chose to attempt to provide objective infor- mation on the question instead of leaving it up to unsupported allegations as the primary means of \"informing\" the public. Fourth, we need better means of communicating research findings to the public, despite the difficulties of doing so when much of the public want absolute answers and the media is eager to report on any new twist to the AIDS epidemic. Fifth. we need to inform health care workers on AIDS before they are faced with the actual care of AIDS patients, and we need to infuse compassion, understanding, and a commitment to the care of AIDS patients in our future physicians and other health workers. In the early 1970's, attempts were made to develop a commitment toward primary care among medical students. Similar commitments are now needed toward the care of AIDS patients. Mr. Chairman, that completes my prepared testimony, and I would be happy to answer any questions you or other members of the subcommittee might have. Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Dr. Miike. Mr. Zimmerman, the experts whom you contacted said that the current budgets for information and education were inadequate. The National Academy of Sciences, for instance, suggested that the budget for public education should be more than tripled. Did anyone argue that the education effort currently planned will be adequate? Mr. ZIMMERMAN. No, sir, none of the experts that we contacted took such a position. Mr. WAXMAN. Did most of the experts agree that mass media public education is necessary and appropriate? Mr. ZIMMERMAN. Yes, sir. Mr. WAXMAN. Did you discuss with these experts the different ef- forts that may be needed for different audiences, say school educa- tion or drug addict education or education of gay men? Mr. ZIMMERMAN. They discussed with us that point rather em- phatically. Just about every group we contacted had a view that the media campaigns have to be tailored to the particular groups and the types of persons that you're trying to reach. Mr. WAXMAN. You have suggested that some of the mass media work might be done by urging the networks to donate public serv- ice announcements. Has this happened during prime time, and isn't prime time usually reserved for paid advertising? Mr. ZIMMERMAN. That's correct, but I thought your conversation earlier today would be a good start. It seems to me that some type of pressure has to be put on the media to join in and help. Mr. WAXMAN. You suggested that some of the education work on AIDS might be done by insurance companies. You say, however, that the experts you spoke to suggested multi-million-dollar budg- ets. I know that the insurance industry has done some work. But' do you believe that they will donate the $30 million needed for a house-to-house mailing or the $100 million needed for widespread TV advertising? Mr. ZIMMERMAN. I don't think they'll donate that much, but they are clearly concerned about it. And as the epidemic spreads, I think their concern is going to heighten, and I think you're going to see more participation, although I don't think it will be wide- spread by the insurance industry. Just last week, Metropolitan Insurance Company ran or spon- sored a show-I don't know what it cost them, but it clearly wasn't 183 III #the current name for the AIDS virus is IIIV, for \"human immunodeficiency viru.,\", has the greatest potential of limiting the spread of AIDS. So far, efforts to prevent AIDS through education have received minimal funding, especially efforts targeted at the groups at highest risk. In testimony before this subcommittee when OTA delivered its report, we empha- sized the importance of preventive education:Vp to this time. the major emphasis of the Federal Government's AIDS activities has been to seek a technological solution-to find the biological cause of AIDS, to develop effective drugs against the disease, and to develop a vaccine if possible. These efforts are its important now as when they were first formulated, but it has also become obvious that a quick technological solution is not at hand and that progress against AIDS will come in increments. Thus, to minimize the spread of AI)S. non-technological approaches also need more emphasis than they have re- ceived so far, such as educating persons at risk on how they can avoid being exposed to the AIDS virus. In the interval since we testified before this subcommittee in February 11i85, tests to identify persons with antibodies to the AIDS virus land presumed to be carriers of the AIDSvirusi have become available and are widely used, and the first drug against the AIDS virus itself azidothymidine or AZT, now called zidovudine, trade name Retrovir'I is now available. However, the availability of the AIDS antibody test has brought the issue of mandatory versus voluntary testing to the fore, and treatment with AZT has turned out to be unexpectedly costly (about $10,000 per pa- tient per year. Moreover, there is still wrangling over how to implement preventive straWgies and how much to invest in these activities. Finally, we made the following observation in February 1UK,5: If we are in for i prolonged battle against AIDS, then we must begin to think of strategies other than the one currently being followed. Currently, support for AIDS activities has been formulated on a year-to-year basis, and the Federal emphasis has been on developing methods to diagnose, prevent, and treat the disease. The tension among the individual PIUS agencies. IMFIS, and the Congress has stemmed largely from differences over the source of funds for AIDS activities and on the amount of funds that should be devoted to AIDS. The Department prefers to reallocate MIS agency funds from other activities to AIDS; and even when Congress has earmarked specific amounts for AIDS. the Department has at times ended up obligating more than these earmarked amounts to AIDS. 'rhe question is whether or not such reallocation and year-to-year funding will be sufficient in the future. General budgetary constraints mean that PHS agencies will be even more pressed to decrease their overall funding and staffing levels at the same time that the AIDS problem continues to increase. Should we begin to think of funding AII)S activities on a long-term basis, with multi-year instead of year-to-year budgeting? Is AIDS such a grave public health problem that it should be excepted from the general budgetary constraints that are being imposed on the PIS and gov- ernment programs. in general? Should legislation be enacted with a special budget for All)S? Such legislation Is now under consideration in the House and Senate, and reports by the Institute of Medicine and the General Accounting Office have emphasized the importance of preventive education. Now. let me make some further suggestions for Federal support for research and education First, enlarging the AIDS research budget will of itself bring in addition- al researchers into the AIDS area. In addition, efforts to bring in younger research- ers traditionally take place through training grants or through \"new investigator\" awards. However, these grants/contracts usually are awarded through centers al- ready known for their excellence. Facilities construction funds could be used to de- velop additional ways of infusing new blood into AIDS research. For example, some construction funds could be set aside to build containment facilities i.e., facilities that are necessary for laboratory work with the AIDS virus) so *hat more research centers could devote work to AlDS. Second more research needs to be conducted on the ways in which infection with the AIDS virus is transmitted. It is not enough to say, for example, that kissing and spitting cannot transmit the virus, even though scientists have found small amounts of the virus in saliva. Third, it is obvious that AIDS is of great concern to the public at large, and not only to the research and medical communities. Thus, public concerns and fears must somehow also be included in the criteria that funding Agencies develop when planning their AIDS research agendas. The issue of how infections with the AIDS virus can be transmitted is the foremost area of research that would be affected. Recently, OTA decided to address the issue of whether insects are transmitting the 182 Another area that I think we need to get into and which touches directly on the testing issue is that we need better tests for infec- tion. Recently, actually this morning, I gave a little talk about the accuracy of the AIDS antibody test, and everybody assumes that with what everybody now hears about the ELISA and the Western Blots, that everything is hunky-dory. I want you to know that there is no standard for what is a posi- tive Western Blot, and really the Department of Defense interpre- tation of a positive Western Blot is quite different from the Red Cross's interpretation of a Western Blot, and I am a little worried that significant numbers of the military people who have been identified through ELISA's and Western Blots as HIV positive may, in fact, not be infected with the virus. So I think we need better tests on who is infected or not. And finally all of these kinds of information tie into the educa- tional campaign area. We really need to find better ways of com- municating what are really probability estimates from research and translate that into language that the public can understand and can make their own judgments about risk. One other area for educational strategies, I think, is that we should-it brings to mind in the early 1970's our attempts to make physicians more compassionate and get them more into general practice and family practice rather than into the specialties. I think a similar effort is needed in our health profession schools to educate students now, so that they can be compassionate toward AIDS patients and don't turn away from them as they get into practice. [The prepared statement of Mr. Miike follows:] STATEMENT OF LAWlEN(F; MnIKE I am l)r. Lawrence Miike, Senior Associate in the Health Program of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA. and I am here today to comment on Federal support for research and education on AIDS. Among the AIl)S-related activities at OTA is a series of staff papers, initiated in June of this year at the suggestion of OTA's Congressional Board and with the en- couragement of the House Appropriations Committee. The first staff paper, ) In- st,,s Transmit AIDS. was released earlier this month. We expect to issue a second staff' paper, on the cost-effectiveness of preventive education programs, in early HISS. OTA first reported to this subcommittee on the Public Health Service's (PHS re- sponse to AIDS in February 1985. At that time, our conclusions were as follows: OTA concludes that although PIS has indeed undertaken a massive effort and made significant accomplishments, the statement that AIDS is DHHS's number one health priority has not always been supported by financial and personnel resources. The responsibility for this situation, however, appears not to rest with the Office of the Assistant Secretary in P11S, but instead reflects decisions made at higher levels of the Federal Government. The administration has not pursued an appropriation for the Public Health Emergency Act, choosing instead to rely on securing appro- priations for individual PIS agencies from Congress. Although sufficient and uncer- tain distribution of resources has not been the sole cause of delays or inadequacies in PIIS AI)S research, surveillance, and service provision, it has resulted in at least inadequate planning, increased competitiveness among Agencies, inadequate atten- tion to certain areas which are perceived by many to be important (e.g., public edu- cation and prevention), and a diversion of attention from other critical health areas. Although significant advances have been made in understanding AIDS, its pri- mary cause, and associated factors, it will be some time before this biomedical knowledge can be expected to be translated into effective preventive and therapeu- tic interventions In the interim, and probably even if biological remedies become available, prevention through education on ways of minimizing exposure to HTV- 181 livering care outside the hospital setting. This apxars to be occurring in several areas of the country This concludes my statement I will be happy to answer any questions you may have, Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Zimmerman. Dr. Miike. STATEMENT OF LAWREN('E MII KE Mr. MIIKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to congratulate you on some creative scheduling, having three Federal bureaucrats following Elizabeth Taylor. I consider that sort of a cruel and unusual punishment. Let me just summarize some of the points that I think should be consider in a research and education bill that the Congress could support. Number one. Two and a half years ago, we reported to this com- mittee on the Public Health Service response, and I am glad to see the progress that has been made since that time. We really do need multi-year funding for research and education, rather than year-to- year, for better planning purposes. One can never talk about efficiency of our research dollars be- cause of the very nature of research; although in this area we are trying to do that with much more directed research. But it still is the bottom line that, the more money you put into a research area, the more researchers you will pull into that area. I leave that up to you, in terms of where that cut-off should be. I also say in my testimony that one might use some construction funds creatively, as a method of bringing in new researchers, and trying to establish other than the established centers of AIDS re- search that exist at the present time. Also, another one of my points is that, with this particular dis- ease, when we develop the research agenda, we should not only pay attention to what the scientists tell us is important research, we should also be addressing public concerns. For example, earlier this month we distributed to all members of the Congress an analysis of the issue of whether insects transmit AIDS, because that was on the public consciousness. Even though scientists thought it was such a minor question, we thought that it was an important issue for the public. Let me use an example of the kinds of areas that we need more information on that are directed at public concerns, and that's basi- cally how the AIDS virus gets transmitted. Simply because it's found in blood raises the question of whether mosquitoes could transmit it, and I hope our staff paper on that issue addressed that question appropriately, so one can make their own judgments on that; but my judgment is that if it ever occurs, it is going to be a very rare and unusual event, and not something that is going to be a significant contribution to AIDS transmission. Also, the issue of saliva. We know that it can be found in small amounts in saliva, but I think it's essentially the same question as mosquito transmission. Simply because one finds it in a particular body fluid doesn't mean AIDS can be transmitted that way, the conditions have to be right before transmission can occur in that fashion. 180 These studies probably understate the total costs of treatment because they ex- clude the costs of services received outside the hospital, such as drugs, institutional or home-based long-term care, hospice care, ambulatory physician and ancillary services, and community support services. In fact, despite widespread concern about the financial repercussions of AIDS on the health care system, data on the costs for medical care of persons with AIDS are surprisingly scarce. Furthermore, no esti- mates are available of the costs associated with AIDS-related complex-AIDS-virus infections that do not meet the CDC definition of AIDS. Other factors, however. may raise or lower total costs. First, the distribution of cases of AIDS and AIDS-related complex by diagnosis may change over time. For example, according to CDC, the proportion of AIDS patients with certain cancers, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, may decrease while severe lung infections, such as pneu- mocystis carinii pneumonia, may increase. Since the latter is more expensive to treat, direct personal medical costs would be expected to rise. Other changes in case- mix may also raise or lower total treatment costs. Second, numerous drugs are being tested and are under development. Drugs like AZT iazidothymidinei affect treatment costs in two ways-by raising pharmaceuti- cal costs and by changing the clinical course of the disease. Patients on this drug may live longer but require different health care services, which may in turn raise or lower costs. Moreover, drugs like AZT may improve the quality of life and de- crease productivity losses if AIDS patients can continue to work longer than would have been possible without the drug. Obviously, development of a cure or vaccine will change the cost situation. A review of cost studies done between 1985 and 19,87 shows that the costs per case of treating AIDS vary significantly.4 Meaningful cost comparisons are difficult, how- ever, because the studies varied in their definitions of AIDS, the types of costs in- cluded, the time periods analyzed, and the geographic areas. The studies were con- ducted using data from New York, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota. Alabama. and New Mexico. Estimates of lifetime hospital costs ranged from $24,500 to A147,000. The variation is due largely to differences in lengths of hospital stays for AIDS treatment, for which there is no standard medical model. There is also some evidence suggesting that AII)S patients are now less likely to be admitted to intensive care units than they were less was known about the disease. According to two recent articles in the -Journal of the American Medical Associa- tion,\" the use of inpatient hospital treatment for AIDS appears to have decreased over time. As a result, lifetime treatment costs for AIDS patients seem to have fallen. Specifically, days in the hospital from diagnosis to death fell from 168 for the lirst 10,000 cases r to 3.5 days Ibased on San Francisco dataI and to 62 days based on Massachusetts dataI in 1984 and 1985. The average length of stay is also shorter in areas where alternatives to hospitali- /,ation exist, such as outpatient diagnosis and therapy and home- and community- based services In San Francisco, the mean length of hospital stay for all AIDS diag- noses was 11.7 days in 1984. Voluntary organizations in San Francisco provide sup- port services to AIDS patients that allow them to leave the hospital sooner or avoid hospitalization completely. Providers in Florida also have been able to cut hospital costs by setting up outpatient treatment services for AIDS patients. While it may be possible to increase home-based services in other communities where the caseloads are comprised of mostly homosexual men, it is more problemat- ic in areas where intravenous drug itsers account for a greater percent of cases. For example, the average length of stay for AIDS patients in New York City was i0 days in 1984. This may reflect, in addition to differences in severity of illness, a lack of outpatient or home-based care for AIDS patients in New York City, of whom 30 pe-rcent are intravenous drug users. In summary, although it is difficult to predict how the costs of treating AIDS may change over time, there is evidence that the costs per case can be minimized by de- 4 S.k. ,Jane \"The (osts of AIDS: A Review of the Estimates,'\" Health Affairs.

In the interim, less costly but also controversial meth- ods of reducing the spread of AIDS that do not involve changing drug users' basic behavior, such as teaching drug users how to disinfect needles, can be implemented. The experts told us that AIDS education for high-risk groups and the general pop- ulation should be pursued with a sense of urgency and a level of funding that is appropriate for a life-or-death situation. Moreover, to limit the spread of AIDS infec- tion, education must start or be expanded immediately in all geographic areas, in- cluding those where there are as yet few cases. In particular, because the virus can be spread through unprotected heterosexual intercourse., the experts believe that clear and direct messages about safer sexual practices, such as using condoms, can help prevent the spread of AIDS in the general public. According to the experts we contacted, the administration's budget request of $155 million does not provide sufficient funding for education of the general public and targeted groups. Experts from the Institute of Medicine's dIOM I Committee on a National Strategy for AIDS estimated that at least $100 milion-in contrast to the $21 million in the budget request-is needed to launch a massive public education campaign on how AIDS is spread. They suggested that the Centers for Disease Con- trol use paid commercial advertising in prime viewing hours instead of relying on public service announcements, which are generally not aired during prime viewing hours. American Medical Association 1AMA) experts suggested increasing funding for AIDS education by 3 to 5 times over the fiscal year 1987 spending level-$65 to $215 million more than the fiscal year 1988 budget request. Many experts expect the Federal Government to underwrite a major portion of funding for educational AIDS efforts. We believe, however, that private sector orga- nizations, such as insurance companies, have strong financial incentives to become involved in AIDS educational efforts because they will also have large outlays in the next few years if the AIDS epidemic goes unchecked. Also, the costs of the mass media campaign envisioned by the Institute of Medicine may be reduced if televi- sion and radio stations were encouraged to broadcast public service announcements during prime viewing hours as an alternative to paid advertising. Other relatively inexpensive measures, such as posting notices on public transportation. would pro- vide a constant reminder of the threat of AIDS. The experts expressed concern that individuals requesting testing and counseling typically had to wait several weeks to be tested. Citing unacceptable waiting periods at test sites in Chicago, for instance, the AMA recommended that testing capacity be increased by three to five times. The populations at high risk of contracting AIDS, such as homosexual/bisexual men, IV drug users, and their sexual partners, number nearly 10 million persons. according to recent ('' estimates. At an average cost of $45 per person, potential resources needed if these individuals request testing would approach $450 million. Assuming the States match the administration's budget of about $90 million, about $250 million more in total funding would be needed to meet this demand. Experts we contacted at CDC and IOM were unable to predict, however, the r tential demand for testing from either high-risk individuals or the general pub ic. Additional costs also would be incurred for heterosexuals who perceived themselves to be at risk for whatever reason; persons who received multiple blood transfusions in high-incidence areas before 198.5; and prostitutes. Moreover, intensive educational campaigns may increase demand for testing in relatively low-risk populations. Pre- cise budgetary needs are, therefore, difficult to estimate. Investing in prevention now can help contain the future direct medical costs of treating AIDS. A study prepared for the Centers for Disease Control projected that treating AIDS may cost $8.5 billion in 1991 (or 1.4 percent of total personal health expenditures, up from 11.2 percent in 1985). Including the indirect costs of losses in productivity associated with premature death, these researchers predicted the total social costs of AIDS may reach $64 billion by 1991.2 A more recent estimate of the total costs of treating AIDS predicted that cumulative medical treatment costs might reach $38 billion by 1991.- This study based its projections on recent research indicating that the future caseload may be greater than the Public Health Service originally predicted. 2Scitovsky.

ZIMMERMAN Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am pleased to be here today to discuss issues related to Federal efforts to limit the spread of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, commonly known as AIDS. My comments will primarily relate to the report I we issued last month on the adequa- cy of the administration's proposed fiscal year 19,\" funding levels for AIDS preven- tion activities in the U.S. Public Hlealth Service tPIIS). I will also discuss the cost of caring for AIDS patients and the possible implications of alternative treatments on those costs. My comments are based , n our review of the literature and the views of our 20 experts from the research and health professional communities, advocacy groups, and State and local health departments in New York, California. Florida, Massachu- setts. Illinois. and Washington, D.C. While the experts generally concurred with the prevention priorities as reflected in the budget, they told us that additional funds were needed for education, testing, and counseling services. These views are those of the individuals we contacted and not necessarily those of their affiliated organiza- tions. As of September 19tS7, over .40,M)00 AIDS cases had been reported to the Centers for 1)isease Control ('ID, up from about 3100 in 1981. Most of the cases were clus- tered in high-incidence areas, such as New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston. The Public Health Service predicts that there will be a total of 270,0)00 cases by 1911. While San Francisco and New York currently account for over half the cases, by 1991. SI) percent of the cases are predicted to be in other a reas The Public Health Service's budget for AIDS prevention and research has in- creased from $200,4)() in fiscal -year 1981 to over $790 million proposed by the ad- ministration for fiscal year 1988. Of this budget, about two-thirds ($-59 million) would be spent on biomedical research to find a vaccine and cure. The remaining one-third $5247 million) would be used for prevention and education activities--155 million for education ($55 million targeted at IV drug users) and $92 million for testing and counseling $515 million targeted at IV drug users). The budget request also includes $24 million for maintaining the safety of the blood supply and other Since development of a vaccine is at least 5 years away and probably longer, Fed- -ral, State, and local health department officials and experts in the research com- munity agree that education and prevention activities are the most powerful tools available to reduce the potential impact of the AIDS epidemic. Overall, the experts we interviewed concurred with the priorities reflected in the administration's AIDS prevention budget for fiscal year 1988-limiting the spread of AI)S among intravenous drug users, targeting education at high-risk groups and at the general population, and expanding voluntary counseling and testing. The ex- perts did not, however, agree with the proposed funding levels and, as I will discuss, suggested that the administration's budget be substantially increased. The experts made their funding suggestions without regard to competing health priorities or Federal budgetary constraints. Although GAO did not develop its own funding recommendations, we offer comments that may reduce the need for Federal cost increases suggested by the experts. The experts cited the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles by intravenous drug users as a dangerous and alarming problem because it represents the primary means of spreading the AIDS virus among the heterosexual population. Nationwide, 60 percent of heterosexual cases and 7:3 percent of cases in newborns were transmit- ted as a result of intravenous drug use. Methadone treatment can, the experts believe, reduce the spread of AIDS by re- ducing the number of addicts who inject heroin. Public health officials in New York suggested an additional $50 to $1540 million to expand methadone treatment in New York City, where about one-third of the Nation's IV drug users live. Officials in Boston and San Francisco also indicated that they need additional Federdil funds to expand methadone treatment, but did not cite a dollar amount. Many social, political, and financial barriers preclude expansion of drug treat- ment programs and other mean, aimed at intravenous drug users. For example, communities often resist expansion of methadone clinics in their neighborhoods. I I)S Prevention Views on the Administration's Fiscal Year 19X$ Budget Proposals. t(;AO' I RI)-,7-12;BR.

I might add that AMA officials suggested increasing funding for AIDS education by at least $65 million more than the budget request. Many experts expect the Federal Government to underwrite a major portion of funding for AIDS educational efforts. We believe, however, that private sector organizations, such as health and life insurance companies, have strong financial incentives to become involved in AIDS educational efforts, because they will also incur large expenses in the next few years if the AIDS epidemic goes un- checked. I understand the hearings yesterday focused on testing and coun- seling. Let me add that the experts advised us that intensive educa- tional campaigns may increase demand for testing in both high- and low-risk populations. The experts we contacted at CDC and IOM were unable to predict, however, the potential demand for testing. Thus, precise budgetary estimates are difficult to make. I Turning briefly to the cost of treating AIDS: despite widespread concerns about the financial repercussions of AIDS, data on costs of medical care, which may total $38 billion by 1991, are surpris- ingly scarce. A review of cost studies done between 1985 and 1987 shows that meaningful cost comparisons are difficult to make because the studies varied in their definitions of AIDS, the types of costs in- cluded, the time periods analyzed, and the geographic areas. Esti- mates of individual lifetime hospital costs varied from $24,500 to $147,000, largely due to differences in lengths of hospital stays for AIDS treatment. In summary, we believe that investing in education and preven- tion now can help contain the future costs of AIDS. In addition, al- though it is difficult to predict how the costs of treating AIDS may change over time, there is evidence that the costs per case can be minimized by delivering care outside of the hospital setting.

Senior Associate Office of Technology Assessment U.S. Congress Description of the Tests Tests to detect antibodies to the AIDS virus (HIV, for \"human immunodeficiency virus\") in blood consist of two types of tests applied in sequential order to the same blood specimen. If the first test is positive, it is repeated. If the repeat test is again positive, then the second test is performed. Testing is not repeated on specimens that are negative on the first test, nor is the second confirmatory test performed on initially negative specimens. The first tests are enzyme immunoassays (EL.s), in which antibodies to whole and partial virus are measured in the aggregate. The second, more specific test, called a \"Western blot,\" identifies antibodies to the major individual proteins which make up the AIDS virus. Most of the EIAs are IELISAN (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) assays. Here, serum is placed in wells or on beads that contain HIV antigen (derived from disrupted HIV that has been grown in cell cultures). If the specimen contains antibodies, they will bind to the test kit's antigens. After an incubation period, any unbound antibody is washed from the bead or well, and an onzyme-labeled antibody to human immunoglobulin (all antibodies are immunoglobulins) is added. The bead or well is again washed to remove any unbound antibody. A reagent is then added that will react with any bound, enzyme-labeled antibodies, and the reaction produces a color change that is measured by an instrument called a Ispectrophotometer.\" The color intensity Page 1 72-635 -88 -7 190 is quantifiable and the numerical value is called the \"optical density.* The result is interpreted by comparing it to positive and negative control samples containing known quantities of antibodies. There are also competitive ElAs, in which enzyme-linked antibodies to HIV are added to the well containing HIV antigens at the Atame time as--instead of after--the test specimen. If the specimen contains antibodies to HIV, they will compete with the test kit antibodies in binding with tho HIV antigens. If there is a lot of antibodies to HIV in the specimen, there vill be little enzyme-linked antibodies found bound to the HIV antigens. If tht specimen contains no antibodies to HIV, all bound antibodies will be the e-.xyme-linked antibodies from the test kit. Western blot testing is based on identifying antibodies to the major proteins of the AIDS virus. Purified HIV antigens are separated electrophoretically on a gel, which results in their separation by their molecular weights. They are then blotted onto special paper. A sample of serum is applied to the paper and if antibodies to HIV are present, they viil bind to the viral antigens. A radioactive- or enzyme-labeled antibody to immunoglobulin is then applied to the paper. If antibodies to HIV are present in the sample and have bound to the HIV antigens, they will appear as distinctive bands on the blot. The location of the band indicates reaction to a specific viral protein (See bands depicting the \"positive control' specimen in figure 1). HIV proteins are grouped into three classes, two structural and one regulatory. The structural proteins consist of: I) proteins that provide the internal, or \"core\" (also known as \"gag') structure of the virus, and 2) proteins that provide the external or 'envelope' (also known as \"any') structure of the virus. The regulatory proteins (also known as 'pol') Page 2 191 represent the regulatory enzymes (reverse transcriptase, endonuclease) of the virus. Envelope proteins also have non-protein elements (glycogen) incorporated into them. The core proteins include p17/18, p24/25, and pS5, which are shorthand designations for proteins with molecular weights in the thousands (or \"kilodaltonsO). Thus, \"p24/251 refers to a protein with a molecular weight of 24 to 25 thousand. The envelope proteins are gp4l, gpllO/120, and gpl6O, where Ngp\" refers to *glycoprotein* (the first vaccine undergoing preliminary testing produces antibodies against Xpl2O). The regulatory proteins are p31/32, p51/53, and p65/66. Accuracy of the Tests When performed in the best laboratories, the tests are very accurate. One estimate is that the false positive rate after both ELISA and Western blot testing is only I in 20,000 specimens tested (0.005 percent false positive --rate).' This is based on the assumptions: 1) that the ZIA test is 1001 sensitive (i.e., that it will identify all antibody-positive blood specimens)2 and 99.61 specific (i.e., that of 1,000 antibody-negative blood specimens, only 4 will be identified as positive for antibodi,s to HIV), and 2) that when EXA-positive blood specimens are tested by Western blot, the false-positive rate for the Western blot test is 1.171. Multiplying the false-positive rate for the EIA test (0.41) by the false-positive rate for the Western blot (1.172) results in a joint false-positive rate of 0.0051 (0.004 x 0.0117 - 0.0000468 -0.005%). One study of six commercially available EIA tests used to test blood donors found a false positive rate of zero to 0.42 percent However, there can be variations in the false positive rates for the EIA tests, even among different batches of one manufacturer's test kit., and the false positive rate Page 3 192 of the ETA test can be as high as 6.8 percent among ho3pitalized patients.' Thus, a false positive rate of 0.4% for the ETA test fpresents a best-case scenario. The 1.17% false positive rate for specimens that were repeatedly positive on ETA testing and then subjected to Western blot testing comes from a U.S. Army study.6 Only specimens that are repeatedly positive on the EIA test are subjected to Western blot testing, so labs perform the Western blot test on specimens that they know are already presumed to be positive. The false positive rate might be higher if specimens that were negative were also tested by Western blot; i.e., if laboratory personnel conducted the Western blot test on specimens that the labs did not know were positive or negative on EIA testing. For example, as part of the U.S. Army's quality assurance program for AIDS antibody testing, five large commercial laboratories that offered Western blot testing on a fee-for-service basis were sent 15 samples that were known to be negative for antibodies to the AIDS virus, and 5 samples that were positive. There were six false-positive results reported, all on different normal specimens, suggesting that the errors were due to technique. The most common error was detection only of p24/25, and labeling that result as a positive Western blot test. Four of the five laboratories reported at least one false-positive test result. One laboratory did not detect one of the positive specimens.7 False positive Western blot tests have resulted from reactivity to the cultured human cells in which the AIDS virus that is used in Uestern blot testing has been grown.6 For example, the American Red Cross reports that Western blot testing on specimens that are positive with Abbott's EIA test result in *indeterminate* readings 10 to 20 percent of the time, while Western blot testing on specimens that are positive with Cenetic Systems' or DuPont's Page 4 193 RI tests results in \"indeterminate\" Western blot readings 40 to 50 percent of the time.$ Furthermore, subsequent blood specimens obtained from the same patient can be Western blot negative after an initial specimen was Western blot positive.'0 The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has estimated that currently licensed EIA tests have a sensitivity of 99 percent or greater and a specificity of approximately 99 percent.11 The CDC also states that the sensitivity of the Western blot is comparable to that of the EIA. While no specificity is given for the Western blot (described as \"highly specific when strict criteria are used for interpretation'). CDC does state that: \"Under ideal circumstances, the probability that a testing sequence will be falsely positive in a population with a low rate of infection ranges from less than 1 in 100.000 (Minnesota Department of Health, unpublished data) to an estimated 5 in 100,000 (citing as references Meyer and Pauker and Burke et &I., see footnotes I and 6, supra).\" There is at present no standard for determining when a Western blot test is positive. A Consensus Conference from the Office of Medical Applications of Research, National Institutes of Health, stated that p24/25 together with gp41 (a \"gag\" protein and an \"env* protein) 'is unequivocally positive.\"1' The Department of Defense (DoD), in its mandatory testing of active duty personnel and civilian applicants for U.S. military service, classifies as positive those Western blot tests in which, at the minimum, either gp4l (an 'env\" protein) alone or p24/25 plus p55 (two \"gag' proteins) are detected.15 The American Red Cross requires that at least one protein from each of the three types of proteins (\"gag,\" \"pol,\" and \"env)--for example, p24/25 plus gp4l plus p51/53--be detected before the donor is notified that he/she has been found to be positive for antibodies to the AIDS virus.14 Page 5 194 The Red Cross standard applies only to whether the blood donor will be notified that he/she hai had a positive antibody test to llV. All repeatedly positive FIAs are discarded, regardless of the results of Vestern blot testing. If some antibodies to HIV antigens are detected but not against at least one protein from each of the three typos of HIV antigens, the results are reported to the blood bank as \"Indeterminate* (all of these specimens are also discarded, because all repeatedly positive B1As are discarded, and only repeatedly positive EIAs are subjected to Western blot testing). The individual blood banks determine whether to inform persons with indeterminate Western blots of their test results. Indeterminate Western blots that contain antibodies to p24/25 and gpl6O are tagged as probably representing the early stages of conversion to positive antibody statue. Approximately 80 percent of persons with this Western blot pattern have progressed to positive Western blots as defined by the American Red Cross. In reference to the NIH Consensus Conference definition that a positive Western blot consists of p24/25 plus gpl, and the DoD definition of either gp4l alone or p24/25 plus p55, there may not be that much difference in results. The American Red Cross reports that it is very unupal to find only these minimal types of proteins on the Western blot test. Nevertheless, American Red Cross and the Department of Defense have clearly different criteria for when a person will be labeled as being infected with liIV and being informed of the results, and research studies often use yet another criterion, the NIH Consensus Conference definition, for a positive Western blot (i.e., p24/25 plus gp4l).15 Figure 1 depicts a hypothetical situation involving three persons, two of which would be identified as having a positive Western blot by DOD and one of which would be identified as positive by the American Red Cross. In this Page 6 195 ?Lpwre I Western Blot! Hyothetical Situation In Which American Red Cross And Denartuent Of Defense Criteria For A Positive Test Kay Cross DoD DoD Positive Control I See text for explanatory details 196 hypothetical situation, note that: 1) neither of the DoD positives would be identified as positive by the American Red Cross, 2) the Red Cross positive would be negative by DoD criteria, and 3) neither the Red Cross nor DoD positives would be identified as positive according to the NIH Consensus Conference definition. Test Accuracy Depends On The Population Undergoing Testing Even when the tests are conducted under optimal laboratory conditions, there will be antibody-positive persons who will be missed, and some persons who will be incorrectly identified and hence, assumed to be infected and carriers of the AIDS virus. Furthermore, among persons identified as having antibodies to the AIDS virus, the proportion of incorrectly identified persons (i.e., the percent of false positives) will increase as the prevalence of antibody-positive persons among the population undergoing testing decreases. These unavoidable errors are illustrated in the accompanying figures. In figure 2, the relationship between sensitivity, specificity, false negatives, and false positives are summarized. In figures 3 to 6, the false positive rates after both ZIA and Western blot testing are calculated for populations where the prevalence of antibodies to the AIDS virus are 10 percent, 0.83 percent, 0.1 percent, and 0.01 percent, respectively. A population with 10 percent prevalence of antibodies to HIV would represent a high-risk population. The 0.83 percent prevalence represents the threshold for mandatory marriage license applicant testing under a law passed in Texas in 1987,15 and is the prevalence obtained if the 2 million persons estimated to be infected with HIV in the United States is divided by 240 million, the current estimated population of the U.S. The 0.1 percent represents the Page 7 197 lgure 2 SensitivitX. Socificitv. and Predictive Value of Temting Positive ILU NegativePresent Absent Sensitivity -A/(A + C) Specificity -D/(B + D) Predictive Value Of A Positive Result, Or Probability That A Positive Result Is Correct -A/(A + B) 198 prevalence of HIV infection that CDC has suggested may Justify premarital testing (see footnote 11, supra). The 0.01 percent might represent the prevalence rate in low-risk groups. In these examples, CDC estimates (see above) of the sensitivity and specificity of the EIA and Western blot tests have been used. For the EZA test, sensitivity and specificity are both assumed to be 99 percent (1 percent false negatives, 1 percent false positives). For the Western blot, sensitivity is assumed to be 99 percent, and specificity, from 99.5 to 99.9 percent. The false negative rate after both EIA and Western blot testing is 2 percent and is derived by jddin the false negative rates for each test, because Western blot testing is done only on specimens that test positive. After EIA testing, 1 percent of positive specimens will be missed (0.01 x (# of positive specimens)). Western blot testing of ETA-positive specimens will miss 1 percent of these specimens, or approxLatlely an additional I percent of the total number of positive specimens (0.01 x 0.99 x (f of positive specimens) -0.0099 x (f of positive specimens)). The false positive rate after both EIA and Western blot testing is derived by MUiaLRIJXng the false positive rates for EIA and Western blot testing, because Western blot testing is conducted only on those negative specimens that tested falsely positive on EZA. If the joint false positive rate is 1 in 100,000 (0.00001) to 5 in 100,000 (0.00005) and the EIA false positive rate is 1 percent (0.01), the false positive rate for the Western blot therefore ranges from 0.001 to 0.005, or 0.1 to 0.5 percent (0.01 x (0.001 to 0.005) -0.00001 to 0.00005), or 1 in 100,000 to 5 in 100,000). The examples all assume that 100,000 persons are being tested. For the group with 10 percent of its members having antibodies to HIV in their blood, an EIA test sensitivity of 99 percent means that, of 10,000 antibody-positive Page 8 199 persons, 9,900 will test positive (true positive), and 100 vii test negative (false negative). Of the 90.000 persons without antibodies to HIV. an ETA test with a specificity of 99 percent means that 89,100 viii test negative (true negative) and 900 viii test positive (false positive). The predictive value of a positive ZEA test is thus 9,900 divided by 9,900 plus 900, or 92 percent: i.e., after only EIA testing, the probability that a positive result is truly positive is 0.92. The results after Western blot testing are as follows. A test sensitivity of 99 percent means that, of the 9,900 persons testing positive after EIA testing and who actually have antibodies to HIV present, 9,900 x 0.99. or 9.801 persons will be correctly identified as positive, and 99 persons will be incorrectly identified as being antibody-negative. Therefore, after both EIA and Western blot testing, a total of 100 plus 99 antibody. positive persons, or 199 of 10.000, will be missed. Western blot specificity of 99.5 to 99.9 percent means that, of the 900 persons without antibodies that were falsely positive in the EIA test, 0.1 to 0.5 percent will still be falsely positive after Western blot testing or a total of 1 to 5 persons. Therefore, of the 90,000 antibody-negative persons, 1 to 5 persons will be falsely identified as positive, compared to 9,801 persons correctly identified as antibody positive. The predictive value after both EIA and Western blot testing ranges from 9,801/(9,801 + 5) to 9,801/(9,801 + 1), or from 99.95 to 99.99 percent, as compared to a predictive value of 0.92 after only EIA testing (see figure 3 for sumary). Similar computations have been made for populations of 100,000 each, with prevalence rates of antibodies to HIV of 0.83, 0 1, and 0.01 percent, respectively.

Sixteen of 830 antibody-positive specimens would be missed. As in the case of the 10 percent antibody-positive prevalence population, I to 5 persons would be incorrectly identified as antibody positive, compared to 814 persons correctly identified as antibody positive (see figure 4 for summary). In the 0.1 percent prevalence group, the probability of a positive test being correct after EIA testing would be only 0.09, but would rise to 0.951 to 0.990 after Western blot testing (98/(98 + 5) to 98/(98 + 1). Two of 100 antibody-positive specimens would be missed. One to 5 persons would again be incorrectly identified as antibody positive, but at a prevalence of 0.1 percent, only 98 persons will be correctly identified as antibody positive (see figure 5_for sumary). In the 0.01 percent prevalence group, the probability of a positive test being correct after KIA testing would be only 0.01, rising to 0.667 to 0.909 after Western blot testing (10/(10 + 5) to 10/(10 + 1). All 10 of the antibody-positive persons would be Identified. One to 5 persons would again be incorrectly identified as antibody positive, but only 10 persons will be correctly identified as antibody positive, even though no positives will be missed (see figure 6 for summary). In summary, the percent of false negatives and false positives will be identical in populations with different prevalences of antibody-positive persons. However, in higher prevalence populations, the absolute number of antibody-positive persons who will be missed (false negatives) after both HIA and Western blot testing will be much higher than in lower prevalence populations.

Turning to the false positives, the absolute number of false positives will remain essentially the ssa3 with varying prevalence of antibody-positivity, but false positives as a percent of total positives will increase as prevalence decreases. For example, if prevalence were 10 percent, only 1/9,802 to 5/9,806 positive results would be false positives, whereas if prevalence were 0.1 percent, 1/99 to 5/103 positive results would be false positives, and if prevalence were 0.01 percent, 1/11 to 5/15 positive results would be false. These are best-case estimates. In actual practice, laboratories can be expected to perform at lower levels of accuracy, missing more positive specimens and incorrectly identifying as positive more negative specimens. Page 11 206 Footnotes 1 Heyer, K.B. and Pauker, S.C., 'Screening for HIV: Can We Afford The False Positive Rate?\" New Entland Journal of Medicine 317:238-241 (1987). 2 The sensitivity of the tests--i.e., false negatives, or the percent of antibody-containing specimens that would not be detected by the test--is not at issue in this discussion of false positives. Moreover, while the ELISA tests are accepted as having a sensitivity of 100 percent, these tests cannot identify all persons infected with the AIDS virus, nor those persons in the early stages of antibody production. For example, HIV-infected persons may go as long as 6 to 14 months before they develop detectable levels of antibodies to HIV (Ranki, A., Krohn, M., Allain J.P., et al., 'Long Latency Overt Seroconversion in Sexually Transmitted Human-Iimunodeficiency-Virus Infection,\" Lancet i1:589-593 (1987)). Increased sensitivity results in decreased specificity. This relationship is reflected in the following two examples. First, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a clinical case-definition of AIDS, in which three major and six minor symptoms are used. AIDS is diagnosed if at least two major and one minor symptoms are present. Based on correlations with the presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus or with antigens of the AIDS virus itself, the sensitivity of this clinical case- definition is 54%, and its specificity, 921. By adding a fourth major symptom to the original three and continuing to use the requirement that at least two major and one minor symptom need to be present in order to make the diagnosis of AIDS, the sensitivity increased from 541 to 75%, but the specificity decreased from 92% to Schiodt, Clinical Case-Definition of AIDS in East Africa,' Lancet ii:569 (1987)). Second, the strength of a positive ELISA test is directly related to whether a subsequent Western Blot test will be positive. For example, in one study, highly reactive specimens in the ELISA test were strongly associated with a positive Western Blot, while moderate to weakly reactive ELISA tests were weakly associated with a positive Western Blot (Ward, J.W., Grindon, A.J., Feorino, P.M., et al., 'Laboratory and of an Enzyme Immunoassay for Antibodies to HrLV-III,' Journal of the American 256:357-361 (1986)).

Our next witness is Dr. Charles McKinney, Direc- tor of Education, Gay Men's Health Crisis, who will be accompa- nied by Mr. Tim Sweeney, Deputy Director of Government Rela- tions. We are pleased to welcome you to the subcommittee hearing this afternoon. Your prepared statement will be made part of the record in full. We would like to ask you, though, to summarize in no more than 5 minutes. Dr. McKinney. STATEMENT OF CHARLES McKINNEY, DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION, GAY MENS' HEALTH CRISIS, ACCOMPANIED BY TIM SWEENEY, DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR GOVERNMENT RELATIONS Mr. McKINNEY. Mr. Chairman, members of Congress, my name is Charles McKinney. I am Director of Education for the Gay Mens' Health Crisis in New York. I come to you from inside the epidemic. We have been dealing for the past 6 years with the crisis on a very first-hand basis. I thank you, on behalf of Gay Mens' Health Crisis and 300 community- based organizations throughout the country who have been fighting the fight against AIDS, for having us here today. I would like to take the tack of offering you our assistance, as- sistance that we feel is of particular value because of our experi- ence in dealing with the crisis. In Gay Mens' Health Crisis alone we have dealt with 5,282 clients, people with AIDS and ARC. This number from this single Agency is greater than the combined total number of cases diagnosed in all of Western Europe and the United Kingdom. We have had this experience from inside and offer you the value of that experience. We have developed over that period of time a level of expertise, an expertise that is sought out by the Western European countries. We have had visitations from the public health officers and public health officials from all of the Western Europe and European coun- tries, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Brazil. We have been asked to be the guests of governments of Norway, Canada and Australia and have presented our educational programs there. Our literature is reproduced around the world. The World Health Organization has sought our counsel in developing guide- lines in protocols for working with AIDS. While this is a tribute to the quality of the work we do, it raises a question as to what the role of government has been. We have developed a service delivery model that can provide an immediate response to the needs of individuals with AIDS and the needs of the community with regard to education about AIDS. We have de- veloped an education model that is immediately available to the people where the people are and when they are there. We do not maintain a program that is a program of service avail- able from 9 in the morning until 5 in the evening and require that people come to us for the information. Rather we go to where the people are when they are there. If that is 4:30 in the morning, if it is 12 midnight, if it is on Saturday, Sunday and holidays, and it is 209 all of those, we go to where the people are to take the educational programs to them. We can provide and have provided educational service at the lowest cost available. When you channel your funds through the bureaucracy of the Federal Government down to the State and the city bureaucracies, there is not very much left that has not been eaten by administrative costs when it is used to provide services. We have developed a model in which only a few pennies of any funded dollars is used for administrative costs, and the rest of that dollar goes for direct service. The way we have been able to do this is by enlisting committed volunteerism, volunteerism as it has never really existed before in this country. These are not volun- teers who push wheel chairs and deliver flowers to patients' rooms. These are volunteers who make presentations, who teach classes, who facilitate programs, who work directly with clients and do hands-on work. We are an agency of volunteers. The only way we are able to do the amount of work that we do is through volunteers. We use 76 paid staff members actually to facilitate the work of our 1,700 vol- unteers who do the work. We have developed and utilized information systems that have not been accessed by other agencies. Our materials are distributed through the public libraries, in correctional facilities, through the general post office locations throughout the City of New York. Our programs are documented to be empirically effective. Ourliterature, as I said, has been reproduced around the world. What we offer, in short, Mr. Chairman, is the use of these 300 agencies in promoting the education that must take place in our fight against AIDS. We urge you to consider NAN, which is the umbrella organi- zation located here in Washington that represents the 300 commu- nity-based agencies that are available to you. We would like to help. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. McKinney follows:] STATEMENT OF CHARLES MCKINNEY Mr. Chairman, Members of Congress: I am Dr. Charles McKinney, Director of Education, for Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York. I want to thank you on behalf of Gay Men's Health Crisis and over 300 community based organizations that are leading the fight against AIDS in this country, for the opportunity of testifying before you. My purpose today is to offer to the Congress our assistance in the fight against this dread disease. We offer you the benefit of our experience. Gay Men's Health Crisis was the first, and is the oldest AIDS-service agency in the world. In the 6 years of our existence, we have provided direct care to 5,282 people with AIDS and people with ARC. In fact, this one agency has provided services to a greater number of people with AIDS than the combined cumulative total of diagnosed cases in all of Western Europe and Great Britain. In addition, we provide educational services on an on-going basis, to a greater New York community of over 14,000,000 people. We offer you the benefit of our expertise. By arrangement of their embassies in New York, public health officers from all of the Western European countries, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Japan and Australia have visited the Gay Men's Health Crisis in the past 18 months. Their purpose has been to draw from our experience and expertise in the development of national policies by their respec- tive governments, for preventing the public health emergency that has occurred, by acquiescence, in the United States. Health educators from Gay Men's Health Crisis have travelled to Norway, Canada, and Australia, at the request and expense of those governments, to present 210 risk-reduction programs, on site, to leaders of State, and public health officers. The World Health Organization tapped our experience and knowledge when it convened a panel of experts in Geneva, Switzerland, last Spring, to develop guidelines on pre- and post-test HIV counseling. These citations are a tribute to the quality of the work we do. But they raise ques- tions regarding the locus of leadership in the fight against HIV transmission in the United States. We offer you the benefit of a service delivery model that is of proven effectiveness in providing education and services to the clients we serve. It is a model that has wide application as part of a National program of AIDS education. The Gay Men's Health Crisis model is one that is capable of immediate response to the needs of clients as these needs are identified. It is a model that makes serv- ices available at the time, and at the place they are needed. It is not a model that provides services between the hours of 9 and 5, Monday through Friday; rather, it is a model that takes services to the people where they are, when those services are needed. If educational intervention is most effective at 4:30 a.m., 12 midnight, holi- days, weekends, in bars, or in bathhouses, our services are provided at the times and places the populations we need to reach congregate. Ours is a service delivery model that uses the money available to it for the deliv- ery of services. A dollar filtered through the Federal bureaucracy to the State, andultimately to the city, provides only a few pennies for services. In our model, only a few pennies are used for administrative costs, and the major portion of the dollar is used to provide services. This is achieved through a concept of volunteerism that is exclusive with community based organizations. Gay Men's Health Crisis is a volun-teer agency, in which 1,700 volunteers provide direct services to clients, under the supervision of a small professional staff of paid employees. Within this model, GMHC has developed a system for disseminating educational information by utilizing pre-existing networks that reach into every neighborhood and ethnic community in our city. These include the public libraries, General Post Offices, athletic clubs, gymnasiums and health clubs as well as correctional facili- ties. In addition, we provide peer counseling at Community Information Tables that are stationed in the streets in high traffic areas of New York City. Our CommunitySupport Network utilizes delis, beauty parlors, barber shops and boutiques for the distribution of literature and dissemination of AIDS information.The risk-reduction programs we have developed demonstrate empirically that sexual behavior can be modified from high risk to low risk. These programs have been replicated world wide. The Ohio State Department of Health will begin usingour risk-reduction interventions this Fall in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus. GMIIC literature, which is published in a variety of languages and literacy levels is reproduced throughout the world. The September issue of the School Library Journal, which goes to every school library in the country, features GMHC publica- tions as a source of \"solid\" AIDS information for use in school libraries. The U.S. Public Health Service has purchased copies of Medical Answers About AIDS for dis- tribution to all health officers of that service. I have with me a selection of these publications which I request be made a part of the Congressional Record. While these citations are a tribute to the quality of our work, they raise questions again regarding the locus of leadership in the fight against AIDS in the United States. The Federal Government, by its inability and unwillingness to respond to a na-tional health crisis, has lost its credibility. It has lost the confidence of the people. The gap between what government says, and what it does, is blatantly illustrated inthe political pandering apparent in the selection of appointees to the Presidential advisory commission in AIDS. In the absence of a Federal initiative in the fight to contain the AIDS epidemic,the leadership role has been placed on grass roots organizations such as the GayMen's Health Crisis, and other community based organizations of the National AIDS Network that are located throughout the United States. These organizations, over 300 in number, are eager to assist the Federal Government in meeting its re- sponsibility; but, they cannot be a surrogate for governmental leadership in a na- tional health emergency. In short, the National AIDS Network of grass roots, community based organiza- tions, offers you the benefit of its experience and expertise, its service delivery sys- tems, and a model that is both cost effective and efficient. It is a model that has credibility with its constituency, and the confidence of its constituency. A mobilized grass roots effort, in combination with the resources and leadership of the Federal Government, provide the strategic elements for success in a national 211 campaign to contain and control the HIVirus. We ask the Congress of the United States to act on behalf of its people. That is the conclusion of my testimony Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Dr. McKinney. We appreci- ate yo ir testimony. The b ls have rung indicating that we have a vote on the House floor. Betore we begin any questions, I would like to recess for us to respond to that vote and then return as soon as possible to pursue questions and answers. [Brief recess.] Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you. The meeting of the subcommittee will come back to order. Dr. McKinney, let me ask you this: do you think that the same kind of educational efforts that you have been involved with should be used for the general public? Or do you think we ought to have tailored educational efforts to reach different groups? Mr. McKINNEY. Mr. Waxman, the general public is made up of many publics, and the materials that we have developed have been specifically tailored to each of those populations. I think it would be an error to think that the educational effort of Gay Men's Health Crisis has been targeted exclusively to the Gay and bisex- ual community. It has not. The major effort has been to the general public, to inform the general public. Our three missions, our three target au- diences, are the general public; health care providers and mental health workers; and, third, and specifically for Gay and bisexual men, risk reduction education. I would say yes, that many of the methods that we have devel- oped are quite applicable to the general public in the development of any educational program. However, the specific audience must be considered in tailoring the program, so that what we have learned will be useful. Whether or not this is the most useful approach via television is a question that would have to be deliberated. Whether it is for a classroom setting, yes: we found that to be so. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Dannemeyer. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Is the Gay Mens' Health Crisis in New York the one that received a grant this fiscal year for some $670,000 from the Federal Government? Mr. McKINNEY. No, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Have you received a grant at all, in any amount? Mr. McKINNEY. Yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How much was the amount? Mr. McKINNEY. We are in the second year of a research program that is funded by the Centers for Disease Control, and for a 15- month period. The continuation grant was $434,000. Mr. DANNEMEYER. I see. I have some material here. Do we have staff person that can hand this to the witness, please? Mr. McKNNEY. Yes, sir. I recognize this material. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Is this material published by the Gay Men's Health Crisis? Mr. McKINNEY. Yes, sir. 212 Mr. DANNEMEYER. When was it published? Mr. McKINNEY. There are a couple of different-it has been over the 1986-1987 fiscal year, and 1987-1988; each of these has come out, it has been timed about 2 to 3 months apart. It was not all published at one time. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Was it published and disseminated by the Gay Men's Health Crisis at a time when you were receiving this Feder- al money? Mr. McKINNEY. Yes. Mr. DANNEMEYER. How do you go about getting a copy of these documents that I have handed to you? Mr. McKINNEY. You may call or write to Information Services of the Gay Men's Health Crisis. On the basis of a telephone call, for instance, you would be informed that there are three packets of material that are already made up. I have brought a selection of those materials, which I would like to ask be entered into the record today. One is an Info Pack, which is an information pack, which is targeted to the general public. A second is a Gay Pack, which is targeted to the Gay and bisex- ual community. It contains everything that would be targeted to the general public, plus the safer sex comics, and a couple of other pieces that are targeted exclusively to the Gay and bisexual com- munity. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Did you mean to infer, sir, that the documents that I handed you fit within the category of the safer sex comics? Is that what you said? Mr. McKINNEY. Yes. That's what these-- Mr. DANNEMEYER. That's what you would call that? Mr. McKINNEY. That's what is captioned on what you gave me, yes. Mr. DANNEMEYER. There is no doubt in the mind of this member that the material that I handed you is pornographic. Mr. McKINNEY. Yes, sir. Mr. DANNEMEYER. The fact that you would distribute it-we live in a free country, we have a free press. If you can find somebody that has an interest in that literature, although-you distribute this literature by mail? Mr. McKINNEY. Yes. When requested specifically, we do. Mr. DANNEMEYER. I would submit, sir, that if you distribute that pornographic material by mail, you are violating a Federal law which prohibits the use of the U.S. Mails to mail pornographic ma- terial. I just don't think that Federal taxpayers' dollars should be di- rectly, or indirectly, assisting anf organization such as yours in dis- seminating pornographic material of this type. Mr. SWEENEY. Congressman, if I may? We do not use-- Mr. DANNEMEYER. You can answer this: why do you distribute this type of material? What's the purpose? Mr. McKINNEY. I think that the answer was given to you yester- day. We publish material at all literacy levels and in different lan- guages that are targeted for different groups, and that are effective and useful for different groups The safer sex comics have been designed for specific groups. They are the most effective way of communicating with those groups. 213 You have used the term pornographic material; we call that educa- tional literature. Mr. SWEENEY. Congressman Dannemeyer, we want to make it very clear. No Federal funds are used in the printing of these ma- terials whatsoever. You will see in the record of the materials that we submitted, an order form where you have to order this materi- al, should you want to get it. It is right here. Mr. DANNEMEYER. I think, in your analysis, that is probably a correct statement. But from this Member of Congress' viewpoint, I don't believe that the people of this country are comfortable with Federal taxpayers' dollars going to an organization that distributes this kind of material, with all due respect to the purpose you have in mind. Mr. SWEENEY. We believe it is our right and our responsibility to educate, and to reach people with lifesaving information. We be- lieve that the safer sex comics, in fact, do reach a certain person. They will hear a message and, hopefully, act responsibly, and pro- tect themselves and their sexual partners. Mr. DANNEMEYER. I guess we have a different point of view on that. Thank you, Mkr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAY. It is your position that Federal dollars are not being used, directly or indirectly, for these publications? Mr. SWEENEY. That is correct. The safer sex comics are not used in the research program, which is Federally funded. Mr. WAXMAN. You wanted to submit some information to us. We will pleased to receive that. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, may I ask that this material that I showed to the witness be placed in the record? Mr. WAXMAN. We will be pleased to review that material. [The material referred to may be found in subcommittee files.] Mr. WAXMAN. I have asked that a transcript nf the National AIDS Hotline tape message be included for the record. Without object? I would also ask that their materials that are sent to callers of that Hotline, if requested, be part of the record.

It's known as the Human Immunodeficilncy lirus: -I-V. Most people infected with the AIDS virus donTt feel sick or show any signs of illness... There are people who do get very sick. The AIDS virus damages part of their body's imune system and they get serious diseases which arerarely a threat to human beings. So far, in America, most of these people have been gay and bisexual men, intravenous drug users, people with the disease hemophillia... and sexual partners of all these groups. Also, some people did get the AIDS %Ovrsiq thrmioh h^nrw frqqfiiq4nn. And. more And more anes or AIDS are now 215 page 2 being seen in heterosexuals. Black Female What's the link between all these groups? (1) sexual contact and (2) exposure to blood. Because, that's how the AIDS virus Is transmitted or spread. You can get the AIDS virus by having unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected person... or by exposure to their blood.. mostlyy, that happens when intravenous drug users share needles or syringes.., and finally.. .an infected mother can give her child the virus during pregnancy or at birth. Women vho might be infected should talk to their doctor or family planning service before getting pregnant. Here's why: Character Male There is now a blood test that detects signs of the AIDS virus...It identifies\"antibodle- to the AIDS virus -that's what your body produces to try and defend itself against the infection. This blood test is insuring that America's blood supply is safe. Every unit of donated blood is now tested and, if positive, It's not used.

We'll give you the number for more test information. Announcer ...That's the basic story.. .The AIDS virus is not spread like the cold or influenza or the measles.. .it's spread mainly by sexual intercourse and by exposure to blood... If you don't want to get infected, there are only a few things to remember: Black Female One of the surest ways to avoid infection is not to have sexual intercourse or other sexual relations: That's called abst-inence.

No. 19, pp. 285-289 Update: Human Inmunodeficlency Virus Infections in Health-Care Workers Exposed to Blood of Infected Patients Six persons who provided health care to patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and who denied other risk factors have previously been reported to have HIV infection. Four of these cases followed needle-stick exposures to blood from patients infected with HIV (1-4). The two additional cases involved persons who provided nursing care to per- sons with HIV infection Although neither of these two persons sustained needle-stick injuries. both had extensive contact with blood or body fluids of the infected patient, and neither ob- served routinely recommended barrier precautions (5, 6). CDC has received reports of HIV infection in three additional health-care workers following non-needle-stick exposures to blood from infected patients The exposures occurred during 1986 in three different geographic areas Although these three cases represent rare events. they reemphasize the need for health-care workers to adhere rigorously to existing infection control recommendations for minimizing the risk of exposure to blood and body fluids of all patients (7-9) Health-Care Worker 1: A female health-care worker assisting with an unsuccessful at- tempt to insert an arterial catheter in a patient suffering a cardiac arrest in an emergency room applied pressure to the insertion site to stop the bleeding During the procedure, she may have had a small amount of blood on her index finger for about 20 minutes before washing her hands Afterwards, she may also have assisted in cleaning the room but did not recall any other exposures to the patient's blood or body fluids She had no open wounds, but her hands were chapped Although she often wore gloves when anticipating exposure to blood, she was not wearing gloves during this incident The patient with the cardiac arrest died A postmortem examination identified Pneumocys- tis cannot pneumonia, and a blood sample was positive for HIV antibody by enzyme immuno- assay (EA) and Western blot methods Twenty days after the incident, the health-care worker became ill with fever. myalgia, extreme fatigue, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, a 14-pound weight loss, and generalized lymphadenopathy which her physician diagnosed as a viral syndrome That illness lasted 3 weeks She f0lt much better 9 weeks after the incident, and, when she was examined 6 months after the incident, all signs and symptoms had re- solved She had donated blood 8 months before the incident and was negative for HIV anti- body by EIA She donated again 16 weeks after the incident and was positive for HIV by EIA and Western blot (bands p24 and gp4l) Serum samples obtained 20 and 23 weeks after the incident were also positive for HIV antibody She stated that for over 8 years her only sexual partner had been her husband, who denied risk factors for HIV and was seronegative for HIV antibody She denied ever receiving a blood transfusion, ever using intravenous drugs, or having any needle sticks or other significant exposures to blood or body fluids in the past 8 years Her serologic test for syphilis was negative. Fifteen other employees who assisted in the care of the patient were seronegative at least 4 months after the exposure Health-Care Worker 2: A female phlebotomist was filling a 10 ml vacuum blood collec- tion tube with blood from an outpatient with a suspected HIV infection when the top of the tube flew off and blood splattered around the room, on her face, and in her mouth. She was wearing gloves to protect her hands and was wearing eyeglasses so she did not think she got any blood in her eyes She had facial acne but no open wounds. She washed the blood off im- mediately after the exposure The outpatient's blood sample was positive for HIV antibody by EIA and Western blot, and a hepatitis B surface antigen test was negative The phlebotomist's EIA was negative the day after the incident and again 8 weeks later. When she donated blood 9 months after the exposure, she was positive for HIV antibody by EIA and Western blot (bands p24 and gp41). She has had no symptoms She denied having any sexual contact during the previous 2 years. ever using drugs intravenously, or ever receiving a transfusion 218 Two months after the incident, she scratched the back of her hand with a needle used to draw blood from an intravenous drug abuser of unknown HIV-antibody status She did not bleed as a result of the scratch and has not had any needle-stick injuries in over 2 years Her serologic tests for syphilis and hepatitis B were negative. A coworker who was splattered with blood on the face and in the mouth during the same incident remains seronegative 1 year after the incident. Health-Care Worker 3: A female medical technologist was manipulating an apheresis ma- chine (a device to separate blood components) to correct a problem that developed during an outpatient procedure when blood spilled, covering most of her hands and forearms. She was not wearing gloves She does not recall having any open wounds on her hands or any mucous- membrane exposure. However, she had dermatitis on one ear and may have touched it She washed the blood off herself and the machine several minutes after the spill The patient un- dergoing the apheresis had denied risk factors for HIV infection. However, a blood sample from the patient was positive for HIV antibody by EtA and Westem blot methods and negative for hepatitis 8 surface antigen the next day. The technologist's HIV-antibody tests were nega- tive 5 days after the exposure and again 6 weeks later Eight weeks after the exposure, she had an influenza-like illness with fever, myalgia. diarrhea, hives, and a pruntic red macular rash on her arms and legs. The illness resolved after a few weeks, and her physician thought the illness was probably a viral syndrome Three months after the incident, she was positive for HIV antibody by EIA and Western blot methods (band p24 alone). Four months after the incident, a Western blot was positive (bands p24 and gp41). She indicated that for more than 8 years her only sexual partner had been her husband, who denied risk factors for HIV infec- tion and was seronegative for HIV antibody. She denied ever receiving a transfusion, ever using intravenous drugs, or having any needle-stick injuries in over 2 years. Her serologic tests for syphilis and hepatitis B were negative. She has an immunologic disorder which had been treated with corticosteroids in the past, but she had not taken any immunosuppressive medi- cation for the past year. A coworker with a similar exposure during the sbme procedure re- mains seronegative after 3 months. Reported by. Hospital Infections Program endAIDS Program. Center for Infecrtous Oiseases, CDC Editorial Note: Three instances of health-care workers with HIV infections associated with skin or mucous-membrane exposure to blood from HIV-infected patients are reported above Careful investigation of these three cases did not identify other risk factors for HIV infection. although unrecognized or forgotten needle-stick exposures to other infected patients cannot be totally excluded The exact route of transmission in these three cases is not known. Health- Care Worker I had chapped hands, and the duration of contact with the blood of the patient experiencing a cardiac arrest may have been as long as 20 minutes. Health-Care Worker 2 sus- tained contamination of oral mucous membranes. This individual also had acne but did not recall having open lesions. in addition, she had sustained a scratch from a needle used to draw blood from an intravenous drug abuser of unknown HIV-infection status. Health-Care Worker 3 had a history of dermatitis involving an ear. Health-Care Workers 1 and 3 were not wearing gloves when direct contact with blood occurred. Health-Care Worker 2 was wearing gloves, but blood contaminated her face and mouth. Three ongoing prospective studies provide data on the magnitude of the risk of HIV infec- tion incurred when health-care workers are exposed to blood of infected patients through needle-stick wounds or contamination of an open wound or mucous membrane. In a CDC cooperative surveillance project (10), a total of 1,097 health-care workers with parenteral or mucous-membrane exposure to the blood of patients with AIDS or other manifestations of HIV iiifection had been enrolled as of March 31, 1987. Needle-stick injuries and cuts with sharp objects accounted for 969 (89%) of the exposures to blood; 298 of these had paired serum samples tested for HIV antibody. One (0.3%) seroconverted (2), indicating that the risk 219 of transmission during these exposures is very low. In addition, 70 health-care workers had open wounds exposed to blood, and 58 had mucous membrane exposed to blood. Postexpo- sure serum samples from 82 of these 128 workers have been tested for antibody to HIV; none was seropositive. In a study at the National Institutes of Health (I ) through April 30, 1987. none of the 103 workers with percutaneous exposures and none of the 229 workers with mucous- membrane exposures to blood or body fluids of patients with AIDS was seropositive. At the University of California 112). none of 63 workers with open wounds or mucous membranes exposed to blood or body fluids of patients with AIDS was seopositive. Although the precise risk of transmission during exposures of open wounds or mucous membranes to contaminet- ed blood cannot be defined, these studies indicate that it must be very low. The three cases reported here suggest that exposure of skin or mucous membranes to contaminated blood may rarely result in transmission of HIV. The magnitude of the risk is not known since data on the frequency with which such exposures occur are not available. Skin and mucous-membrane exposures are thought to occur much more commonly than needle sticks, and the risk associated with skin or mucous-membrane exposures is likely to be far lower than that associated with needle-stick injuries. Nonetheless, the increasing prevalence of HIV infection increases the potential for such exposures, especially when routinely recom- mended precautions are not followed. It is unlikely that routine serologic testing for H1V infection of all patients admitted to hospi- tals would have prevented these exposures since two of the three exposures occurred in the outpatient clinic setting, and one occurred during a resuscitation effort in an emergency room shortly after the arrival of the patient. At the time of exposure. Health-Care Worker 2 suspect- ed that the source patient was infected with HIV. but Health-Care Workers 1 and 3 did not. The hospital where Health-Care Worker 3 was exposed has a protocol for apheresis which normally involves HIV-antibody testing of donors; however, such testing was not done in ad- vance of the procedure Previous CDC recommendations have emphasized the value of HIV serologic testing for patient diagnosis and management and for prevention and control of HIV transmission (13) and have stated that some hospitals in certain geographic areas may deem it appropriate to initiate serologic testing of patients (7). Such testing may also provide an op- portunity to reduce the risk of HIV infection to health-care workers, but it has not been estab- lished that knowledge of a patient's serologic status increases the compliance of health-care workers with recommended precautions These cases emphasize again the need to implement and strictly enforce previously pub- lished recommendations for minimizing the risk of exposure to blood 3,rd body fluids of all pa- tients in order to prevent transmission of HIV infection in the workplace and during invasive procedures (7-9 ) 1. As previously recommended, routine precautions must be followed when there is a possi- bility of exposure to blood or other body fluids The anticipated exposure may require gloves alone ieg., when placing an intravascular catheter or handling items soiled with blood or equipment contaminated with blood or other body fluids) Procedures involving more extensive contact with blood or potentially infective body fluids (e.g. some dental or endoscopic procedures or p,)stmortem examinations) may require gloves, gowns, masks. and eye-coverings. Hands and other contaminated skin surfaces should be washed thor- oughly and immediately if accidentally contaminated with blood (7). These precautions desere particular emphasis in emergency care settings in which the risk o. blood expo- sure is increased and the infectious status of the patient is usually unknown (v 4). 220 2 Previous recommendations have emphasized management of parenteral end mucous- membrane exposures of health-care workers'. In addition, health-care workers who are involved in incidents that result in cutaneous exposures involving large amounts of blood or prolonged contact with blood -especially when the exposed skin is chapped, abraded, or afflicted with dermatitis-should follow these same recommendations. Moreover. serologic testing should be available to all health-care workers who are concerned that they may have been infected with HIV.

To accomplish this reduction an immense conceded effort by physicians, public health practitioners, business, and community organiza- ions is required to get across the simple prevention messages. Those messages are: (1) Any sexual intercourse (outside of mutually monogamous or HIV antibody-iegabve relationships) must be protected with a condom. (2) Do not share unsterle needles or synnges. (3) All women who may have been exposed shout-i seek HIV-antibody testing before becoming pregnant and, d positive, avoid pregnancy Only through a concerted, vigorous, and sustained prevention program that deals frankly with this problem will those indrvua!s at nsk be reached and motvated to take personal responsibility to protect themselves.

This appears to be a function of the concentration of infec- tious virus in blood, which is relatively low,\" and the amount of blood on the end of a needle, which is small. The lack of hospital- or laboratory-acquired HIV infections indicates that unbroken shin is probably a good barrier to Urrrus- ion, however, reports of presumptive infection through inflamed aksr are of potent concern.' Periratal Transmission Trurission from infected mothers to their infants can apparently occur in utero,\" during parturition,\" or during postpartum breast-feeding.\" The rela. tive efficiency of perinatal trmrrssion is probably quite high but has not been well established and may vary consider. ably between women.\" Other Routes of Transmission and Potential for Change Despite detailed serologic studies of close contacts ofirfected persons- and investigations ofAIDS csses,\" no other form of traisnission has been docu- mented.

Moreover Othee equally plausible evpl aons have some support in fact. For example, the apparent increased transss ion re- cently observed In urban Africa is Lkely due to social rather than vocaJ change. Over the past few decades there have been major population shifts ,rnm rural villages to urban centers in many A- sican countries. Tis urb&nizanon. to. gether with the proliferation of pros titution in cities, and possibly the ue )f contaminated needles and blood trarv. fusions in hospitas and cdatcs. could be the root causes of the amplifcation o transnission in Africa of a viru that may have changed little mer the years. Support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that despite considerable variation of the nucleotide sequ ences of various HIV isolates, te r.rarminsion patterns of the virus hae remained remarkably consistent. Indeed, since the arrival of HIV in the U rted States. the transmission patterns have been marked more by consistency than by change. The proportional datribution of csues among the various risk groupshas remained essentially constant despite a marked increase in the number ofcases, multiple generations of pwsge through humans, and wide dipersion through different racial groups. NATURAL HISTORY OF INFECTION Infection with HIV carries a poor prognosis. Although follow-up of serr- positive individuals in the United States has been limited by the relatively recent introduction of the virus into this coun- try, already it is clear that the mortality frort this virus is high. Between lf% and 34% of antibody-positive homosex. ual men, intravenous (IV) drug users, and hemophliacs followed up for up to sLx years\"' have developed AIDS. Such dramatic proportions of severe disease PI'MNsetof 0S iuSFiamt a Con 223 deielopinent among infected indvidu- aos arc frightening, making HIV among the mot. dangerous viruses affecting humans (Table I Plrthermore, when these mortality figures are joined with the high prevalence (25% to 40%) of other AIDS-related conditions, the pos- sibility ofeventual eneephalopa hic con- ditons. and the realization tat the current observation times fc', infected persons represent only a traction or the potential time dunng which diseases mVq become apparent in the natural history or this virus, concern regarding the seventy of HI gr-ows even greater Many have speculated that there may be cofactors for the development of AIDS Such cofactors could have a ma- jor effect at two quite separate times- one early on. affecting the acquisition of infection, and one later. affecting the progression to-ard disease once infec- tion has occurred Some have hypoth- esized that preexisting conditions, such as mmunosuppression or antigen expo- sure, may increase the Likelihood or becomirit tInected after exposure to HIV. Thri has net been confirmed in laboratoi experiments with clhrn- panres, %here infection has been read- ily established %ith IV or sotravagiral exposure to HIV vs the absence of irm- munosuppressivn or stimulation with other antigens.' Yet outside the labora- tory, certaLn conditions, especially those that facilitate transmitted virus Coming in contact with susceptible tar- get cells (macrophages or lymphocytes), may improve the chance of successful transmission. Thus, one could hypoth- esize that conditions that increase the populations of macrophages or lympho- c)ts at potential sites of virus exit and entry may well be cofactors for irdec- tion Few cofactors for disease prog-esalos have been found. Some have hypoth- esized that ree.posure to HIV may increase one's chances for disease, yet there are another models in virology, at least that we are fanliar with, that would support this. Flasthermore, such a h)lothesis is difficult to reconcile with the observation ofAl DS following expo- sure to I unit of infected blood.* Yet, some thing must determine why some infected persons progress rapidly to develop AIDS, while others either pro- gross slowly to the irreversible imnune state or do not develop AIDS. One major (actor is time,\" Those who have been infected the longest have the high- est risk of developing AIDS. Indeed, until cohorts of infected individuals are followed up long enough to observe the entire natural history or tUis infection and the collected information used to control for the time factor, it is ex. JAkVA t tch3 lso-o 257 No 10tremely difficult to sort the impor- tance of other possible cofactors Despite theie limitations, some other factors (eg, age) appear to be impor. tant Evidence indicates that infants may have extremely high rates of pro- gressive disease (M. Rogers, MD, wnt- ten communication, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, June 19861. At the other extreme of the age spectrum. older homosexual men appear to haie higher disease progression rates than younger ones.' Since pregnancy may adso increase the rates of AIDS in in- fected women,\" hormonal levels may also influence outcome. Repeated stim- ulation with foreign antigens, another possible cofactor, has often been hy- pothesized as a potential enhancer of viral replication since, in the laboratory, lymphocytes stimulated with mitogens replicate the virus more efficiently than do nonstimulated lynphocytes.a Other in-combirtion inluences have been studied in regard to Kaposi% sar- coma, since it is so prevalent in homo- sexual patients with AIDS as compared with others.

Likewise. no effective treatment exists for HIV infection once estab- Uished. Since there ae no known anrtnal or insect vectors and the virus is not trarsitted by the respiratory or feral- oral route, prevention of HIV to-swn-is- sion must be directed at person-to-per- son spread via sexual, blood-borne, and periznatal routes (Table 21.

There is no risk of sexual transmis- sion of HIV for those who practice sexual abstinence. flarthermore, there is no risk of infection if neither patner is infected. This would be the case for couples who have been mutually monog- amou3 since the introduction of HIV in the Uited States (presumably in the rnud-1970sh It would also be true (to the linutos current laboratory technology) for couples who have been shown to be free of section by serologic testing (see 'Couple Counseling' section) Outside of these situations, individu-als who choose to have sexual relations place themselves and/or their partners at risk ofinfection. However, the extent of that risk can be decreased by. first, cirtung the number of sexual partners. Statistically, the fewer different part. ners one has, the less likely that one will be exposed. Second, exposure can be further litited by selecting sexual part. ners at low or no risk of UfecLion, since the prevalence of infection varies greatly by sex, geography, an sex practices (Table 3) Third, the practice of \"protective sex' should be able to prevent trasnssion even if one part. ner is infected Epiderruologic studies 13U JAMi Malch 13 7S-Vo 257 No 10indicate sexually HIV in- fection is due to vagmal or axnal inter- course where semen, vaginal fluid, or blood is shared between partners. Yet such studies are not capable of detecting isolated transmission due to othertypes ofsexus acuvities The 'protective sex' guidelines given here are based on dat available as of early 1987. Unfortu- nately. true efficacy data evaluating these guidelines are notavailable. Thus, these guidelines must be unerstood to be interim ones, requiring periodicrevi- sion as evaluation data become avil- able. Protective Sex-Protective sex re- fers to sexual activity where no semen, vaginal fluid, or blood is exchanged be- tween partners. Since the skin &n oral mucosn appear to be relatively resistant to virus passage, protective sex can involve practices auch as kissing (if ro ora]l lesions are present), hugging and caressing, and genital maipulation (if no adn lesions exist. It also cas involve vagnnal and rectal intercourse, provideda condom is worn at all times. The recommendation for condom use is made because condoms (of high qual. ict') have been shown to be effective barriers to viruses, including HIV, and prehira-y data suggest that sex- ual partners of infected people may be protected by the use ofcondoms a How. ever, as with the use of condoms for pregnancy prevention, failures can be expected, especially if the condocs are not used consistently and continuously with a sexual partners. The use of nosoxynol S-containing jelly (sold as over-the-counter apernicide) may be a useful protective adjunct to condoms since this substa ce has been shown to inactivate HIV and kill lymopocytes.a Specific Issues and Problems.-Ho. sWsmeuol Men.-.-Trans mission of HIV among homosexual men appears to be due almost exclusively to receptive ana imercourse+ As of 198?, unprotectedreceptie taial intercourse with or bisexual cured a corud- ersble risk of infection. The prevlence or infection i this group today is ex- tremely high inmost urban areas Een with profound decreases in the number olseiual partners, the risk of ifecon in thiscommunity remains high because of the present high chance that any single sexual partner is infecLious.\" Considerfole contusion has sur. rounded the issue or what homosexual sex practices are sae. This contusion has been due to sever] factors: (1) the \"difficulty in obtaining and interpreting sex practice-epecific risk data, (2) dis- comufort on the part of the hetev-e ual majority regarding discussions a homo- sexual sex, and (3) the political %-u- nersb.lAy of government insticutions, including public health agencies, to claims of advocating homosc.uliy at they promulgate safety guidelines for homosexual s The result has been either absent or confusing recommen- dations from traditiona! public health authorities. In this vcuu, various lo- cal groups have made their own, often conflicting, guidelines. Controversy has surrounded the is- sue ofhonmsexnaal bathhouses. Any set- ting that encourats unse sexual practices between individuals will in- crease the transmission of HIV. As such, those bathhouses that ecoarage such practices adversely affect AIDS prevention. Yet those bathhouses that encourage protective su practices cam serve as important contact points for educational taterial and support for protective sea. Tlhe risk of oral-genital sex is appar- ently low, but, as aemen cn ha-bor virus, this practice may carry some risk of infection. Hferoacue-l Me usd Womens- The frequency with which a person chooses to practice unprotected -.- de- pends on the risk that he or the is wing to take. The current risk of infection ofa given heterosexual contact in the United States is low, but infec- tions and AIDS cases are certainly be- ing acquired by heterosexual contact. Logic would dictae that those outside of mutually monogamous relationships who wish to milimise their risk should limIt their total numbero(partuers and practice protective ex all of the time. The efficiency of heterosex-al -ans- mission, especially from women to men, continues to be an issue.

Needle and Syringe Sharing Needle- aind syringe-associsted HIV unfectioncould be avoided if unsterilized injection paraphernaba were not shared among individuals. The message for AIDS prevention is obvious: Stop the use of IV drugs, or, at a minimum, elminate sharing of unsterized irjec- tion paaphernalia. For some addicted IV drug abusers, this is difficult or -impossible, and other options, such as disinfection with readily available agents (eg, bleach), should be advo- cated. ftuithermore, addicted persons who desire to enter rehabilitation pro- gnsm should be encouraged and al. lowed to do so. Outside the addicted population, there is evidence that sub- atanitial numbers ofpersons experiment jOA 1s,,on programs towa-d teenagers, drug-using commutites, and staffs of drug clnics need to emphasize the potential dan. gers of sharing drug paraphernalia Specific Issues and Problems.-Ivn- travenous drug users often have ltle foresighted healthhnterest and, thus, may prove to be the greatest challenge for instilling behavior change. Intrsvenous drug use is illegal throughout the Uruted States. How- ever, systems hav been designed to deal with addicLs in medical faciles without threatened incarceration Discussions of drug use and, more specifically, of means by which to render drug use safer have been interpreted by some as an advocation of drug use As a result, many health educators have avoided the subject. Intravenous drug abusers often do r rot engender sympathy f-om those re- sponsible for providuig funding for in- tervention programs or those responsi- ble for pubbc health. SloLs for drug treatment clinics are often not available, preventing those who want to stop using IV drugs from doing so. Intravenous drug abusers, if HIV transmission persists, will likely serve as a major entree of the virus mto a segment ofthe heterosexual commu- nity, most prrrunently in the u-ban poor communities. Indeed, an early, aggressive prevention effort is required to prevent further extension of this vuws into socidl/ethric minority arban communities. Provision of sterile needles and sy. ranges to drug users is a controversial, yet possibly effective, control modalty that requires further evaluation. Drug use, in a broad sense, affects other AIDS prevention activitLies, espe- dally protective sex. The use ofdrug or association with sexual practices is prevalent or nay communities, includ. ong the homosexual male commuity. Perinatal Transmission Mother-to-infant HIV infection could be avoided if litfected women would not become pregnnt. Because of the po- tentiaJ high risk ofinfant infecton and the preliminary clical Eings that pregnancy itself may accelerate the de- velopment ofAIDS, it seems reasonable at this time to recommend that infected women postpone pregnancy until more is know about the risks and prevention of perinatal infection.' Th question is then, how can infected women be identi- fed? With the low infection roes in most female populations ochildbearing age, general, routine screening is not warranted at ths time. Ho ver, thereis general agreement that uomen ho are in high rsk groups (IV doig uers, prostitutes, women with muli;ole se.- ually transmitted infections. scmen from HIV endemic areas, or sexual contacts of hgh-risk-group men) should be screened and counseled - THE ROLE OF CONTACT TRACING/NOTIFICATIO N Purpose of Tacling The purpose o tracing senua] or nee- dle-sharing contacts of infected people is to truce the chain of tra-vsnussion to itsterrrunus Atthat pointthere maybe an infected person having nsk-promnl-i ing contact with another susceptuble person or persons With apprproae education and motivation ofthe infected and susceptible contacts, father tras- ission can be prevented The spe-/c guidelines to be given to the inte ac g contcts would be the sane r-sk-speci.,c ones presented above (Table 31 Specific Issues and Problems Although contact tradingnot icaoon could be useful for interrupting ctl4ns ofHlV ansrnnssion, the cost of firdLg, testing. ad ecaseing individual is. aul or needle-sharing contacts of in- fected individuals is considerable. Even under the best of circnmsunces, the task is expensive, but often with indi- viduals who have the largest nibe.-sof contact, the identifying olformauon on contacts may be limited, and the task becomes even greater. Thus, for tbese alst lane' Midviduasts, the assumpdon must be made that all wsitin the group should come in for testing and counsel- ing. For persons with fewer contact (iluding homosexual men aid lVdrug user in lower-risk settings and cope- dally women in the childbearing age) whose locating information may be more readlWy available, more Uintes.ve efforts, both by physicians and health departments, is justi able. There is concern, especially in the homosexuall commuruy regardir.g the ecnfidentality of contact a-acgmot6- cation. Few dispute the need or .the potential beneficial effect of referring contacts for testing and education. The concern rests with individuals who. be- ing uncomfortable with notafying their own contacts, ask the physidan or health department to do the tracing and volunteer the names to these third par- ties. TIs is a delicate situation, but one that has been succesflly addressed for decades in public health clinics. For thou physicians not comfortable or gained in contact racing, referral to highly experiences health department stuff should be available. Pe-emoin ot AoDS-Frarcs a Chin 131 226 about the slve of seroloic testing. the accuracy of the test, and the fears of violation of confidentiality' However, this controversy appears tobe dechning as the value and accuracy or the test are documented and as assur- ances of confidentiality are maintained and strengthened Indeed, encourage- ment of serologic testing has been rec- ommended' for several reasons, and they are outlined below according to the target groups involved Infected Persons Ifall infected (a ntibody-positive)indi- viduals could be identified through vol. untary and confidential testing pio- grams and if these individuals could be counseled on ways to prevent exposure to others, then a major step toward decreas:ng AIDS could be achieved Infected men and women could be ad- vised of their risk to sexual partners or those exposed to their blood Infected women could be advised to avoid preg- nancy Along with this beneficial pre- ventve effect, serologically identifying infected persons could have significant cLincall benefit to invndual patients. The knowledge by the patient and phy- uscian regarding infection by this virus could lead to earlier recognition and treatment of life-threatening oppor- tuntc infection, especially Petumo- cysliu cami pneumonia. Infected pa- tents who a tuberculin test positive could receive early prophylaxis, and parents of infected children could be informed about the relative contrain. dication of live viral or bacterial vac. 1907- S n 7 No east in the laboratory) immunotlgc stimula- tion of lymphc)les accelerates viral replcaton,' exposure n snt- gens may accelerate disease pros. sion in humans Thus, individuals who discover that they..ave been infected with HIV should be encouraged to de- crease their antigen exposure by de- creasing their number of sexual and IV druR encounters. Susceptible Persons If uninfected (antibody-negative) in- dividuals at increased risk of infection could be identified and counseled, their nsk-taking behavior might decrease substantially. The value of one-on-one onseling centered around knowledge o[ onei seroiogic status can enhance the effects of education programs on behav- ior modification. For example, seroloic testing, combined with counseling, can have a profound effect as encoa-ging low-risk sexual practices among some\" but not all\" I homosexual men Couple Counseling The serologic test also has a role for couples of which one partner has been possibly exposed If individuals desire to have unprotected sex an one or both have been at any risk of infection, it is reasonable to test the at-risk individual for HIV antibodies. If he or she has a negative result and has nct been at any continued risk ofexposureverthe paat six months, then one can presume the absence of infection. If a serosegatave individual has been possibly exposed in the past six months, then a second test stx months after the last possible expo- sure is required before infection can be confidently ruled out. For greatest safety, protective sex should be prsc- tic-ed during this interim period. A similar approach may be useful for women who may have been exposed to an infected person in the past and now want to become pregnant. Serologic testing with follow-up testing in six months, where indicated, should be helpful in giving advice to such persons Evaluation Serologic testing is also so important tool for evaluating the effect of any prevention program. For individuals, physicians, aL public health practi- tioners, periodic repeated testing of antibody.negative individuals is the only accurate measurement of the suc- cess of their prevention efforts. Unin- fected persons, especially those with presumed or known continuing expo- sure, need periodic reassurnce that their efforts to remain uninfected have been successful Moreover, physiciansand public health practitioners proiod ing adsee and guidelines toat-risk viodls need assurance that the pro- vided guavetines hve been effective. Testing Facilities The facilities for free or low-cost and confidential testing, together with nsl.- reduction eounselng. have been pro- vided by the national ,Lterate test site program. listing i also avalable through nuny phys,,ant offIces. The use of these facilities by at-risk ind hid- usls should be encouraged by all In addition to patient-initiated nerologtc testing, physicians should encourage at-nsk individuals who may benefit from testing tobe serologncallytested- either in their offices or at publc facili- ties Specific efforts should be directed at the highest-risk groups, homosedual or bisexual men, prostitutes. hetero- sexual men and women who hate multi- ple sexual partners, patients ,ith sex- ually transmitted diseases, patients known to use IV drugs. and patients from HIV-endenc areas such as Haiti and central Africa In summary, serologic testing alosss for knowledgeable clinical and preven- tive counseling of patients, including medical ev luation and early interven. tion, personal counseling regal-di decreasing transmission, contact trac inglnotihcation, and counseling to pre- vent perinstal transrrussior. Specific Issues and Problems For most individuals the process of testing is a stressful one. To ma.m e the use and benefit of test-U ed coun- soling, the stsf of these facilities must be sensitive to the stresses of the indi- viduals and provide counseling aid, where appropriate, referral. DISEASE AND INFECTION MONITORING (SURVEILLANCE) Conditions related to HIV ae of a wide clinical spectrm, ranging from asymptomatic infections, various AIDS-related conditions, fonk AIDS, and primary peripheral and central neu- rologic conditions.

PHYSICIAN. PUBLIC HEALTH, BUSINESS, AND COMMUNITY ROLES IN AIDS PREVENTION PhysIcian The physician% role in AIDS pre- vention is critical. At a mirmum. the physician must understand the myriad symptoms of HI V-related diseases and provide effective medical treatment and support for the individual and the farn- dy In addition, the physician must take a major lead position regarding preven- lion. Specifially, noniudgment.al dis- cussions of sexual orientation, sexual activities, IV drug use, and ways to prevent AIDS should become standard pans of medical care. These should include (where appropriate) recommen- dation: for serologic testing, protective sex guidelines, an contact tracing/noti- ficauon of sexual and IV drug-sharing contacts. As part of this process, physi- cians should become well verned in HIV transmission so tat individual and community questions regarding appro- prune preventive practices can be knowledgeably answered to maximize AMA Maicn 13 197-0v intervention and mirunimze ill-based and entrmist overreactio Public Health Th- central role that federal, state, and city/county health departments and lborAtones tradianally have held in communicable dLsease control will hase to continue for A I DS The necessities of infection and disease monitoring. edu. citing physicians and the public about AIDS, establishing appropriate guide. lines for prevention, and providing t'.e needed personnel and resources for ed- ucation, counseling, testing, and con- Lact tracisginotfeation wil be large tasks for public health agencies, espe- cially in these times ofconstrained fund. ing Business Te impact of AIDS on the private sector is large and gro ing The direct medical costs, the benefit support costs, and the general sociaJ upheaval (due primarily to unfounded concerns about the possibility of casual-contact trans- mission) will continue to take a major toll within the business community luch of this toll is presentable, includ. ing that related to unfounded fe;rs of infection. Indeed, the workplacee could serve as an important access point to convey the essentials of AIDS preven- tion. After all, working adults hase been the major target of this virus Education programs sponsored by bosi. nesses directed toward all sesLy ac- tive employees, regardless of sexual preference, together with information on the risks of needle ulaorinl, could have a major impact an HI ' trasrrus- sion. Furthermore, support by the busi- ness community for funding of public AIDS prevention program oalu: vroes invaluable in stiamulabig the trasi- tionally slow government fundmg pro- cess so that more extensive AIDS pre. vention programs could be started without undue delay. Community The need for rational community po- grams for AIDS prevention based on facts rather than fears is urgent. Too often schools, religious orgaurations, and other community groups have been reticent to discuss, or even obstructed from discussing, ways to prevent the sexual or needle-borne transmission of HIV for fear o seeming to support sex and drug use. Such issues are dicult. but denial ofreal-Lite practices cn serve only to extend further this already deadly epidemic. Community groups and public media are essential for spreading the rather simple words of A IDS p.eventin. In addition, togeLhersh business, their support of ,ei':h department efforts, their aid i Le defense against extremist measure,. and their support for additioal re source allocations for AIDS present on are essential. In summary. the concerted efor, of physicians, businesses, and cor-.-rr,-.:::, groups and public media together %i*t. provision of up-to-date education r.a. terials and casistent presen:on mes- sages issued by health departme,:s. ar essential to interrupt trainsmsion of this extremely severe svu's Vusection effectively. SOCIAL ISSUES AND CONFIDENTIALITY Quarantine/lsolalron The purpose ofAlDS present.on pro- grams is to irterrupt the trJ-rn-_.s.oi of HIV in a manner that nili eunnrioe social disruption and macmize urdistd. usl freedom. The of quau- ar:te (this wil be used Lnterchangealy with isolation or ensfrzed isolaz:oi) needs to be discussed openly because ti the concerns expressed by at.r- groups, especially the homosecual &is hemophiliac communities. and becatuie for extreme measures (eg. cuv- antine) to control AIDS. Many c\" tee over -active proposals have been due to unbalanced information that, altitou'\". appropriately stressing the da.re.n c HIV infection, has Lnapproprate: stressed the ease of acquisition. In :;ie hospital setting, recommendation are that blood and secretion precautions (a form of medical isolation) be tlen .for persons known or suspected to be in- fected with blood-borne agent such as hepauttis 8 viraser HI V. Butrithin the general community ; there has neser been any official pubLic etesh recoin- mendation or movement to,i ird the iso- lation quarantine of carriers of these diffiult-to-transnnit agents. QuLr-sr- tine has a Lmited role in the control of some communicable diseases, but there is little or no ro:e for it in the prevention of AIDS As mentioned above, except for pennata infection and (ci the past) blood product-associated inecton. HIV is transnutted almost enclusely between consenting adults, both of whom have some choice rega\"ing the AIDS risks they a stlllig to sake. Thus, trarnission of this -irus in our society is preventable by LndividuaJ sc- tin, \"ot government-imposed isolation. The thiat o( quarantine hir ers AIDS prevention. It turns a norssue into i wedge between advocates ofpreventon and the groups st risk for AIDS. The issue of mass quamtine aside. what should be done with the urcooper- P vesemon 01AICOS-Camive S & Cne 136 228 aLit Infected person who continues ti expose individuals through sexual inter course or needle sharing? For example what about the infected female or male prostitute who continues to ply the streets for business! Tnese are difficult Issues State laws generally forbid one from knowingly exposing others to In- fectious diseases, and local or state health officers generally have authority (following observance of due process) to incarcerate noncompliant individuals, In some situations, incarceration may be necessary, but in most situations there are tuo persons involved in the transmission of HIV. Thus, it could be said for the example given above that the client of the prostitute is \",olunteer- inr for infection. The major task ahead Is to get accurate information out to the public so that they can make informed choices. Considering the danger of this virus, most persons will presumably take L e personal steps necessary to avoid infection. Patlent- hy lcian-Pbllc He als*-Communlty Relations For physicians and public health workers to effect risk-reducing be- haior changes in individuals, consider. able patient trust is necessary, both to unitate contact and to seek advice and follow guidance. After all, the behavior changes sought to decrease AIDS risk involve the most personal of behaviors T stimulate individuals to take respon- sibility for themselves and make the necessary risk-reducing changes is often di'fcult and requires a good de'l of trust and understandiAg from both the Patient and the health worker. This relationship can be seriously jeopar- dLed if the individual in need of gwid- anc is frigtened away from profe'- sional services by threats o os1fdentiality is cen- Ltral to and ofparanmount importance for the control of AIDS. Information re- rding infection with a deadly virus, seUani activity, sxual contacts (oth thin and without primary relation- shpsi, and the iegal use of IV drugs and dginstic information regrding AIDS-related diseases are sensitive is- sues that, if released by the patient or by someone involved in health care. could adversely affect a patent per- so-il ard profesional life. Confidentuity has alwys been a Snctly observed principle in medicine and public health. Sensitive topics have always by necessity been a routine part of interviews andrecords iustiese fields However. for AIDS. because of the so- 1364 JAJA Ma1Ch 13 1 V-Vo 257 No 1tcial disdain the two highe..nsti groups. and the illegal status o\" IV drug * use, and the numerous astisodom laws. even stricter assurances ar * required. In some states, like Caldr- nia, legislation has been passed to strengthen these oofdentiality aSsur. ance:. In some situations such laws have caused problems and have prevented essential conmuncatuons between phy- sicians and prsctitioners of public health. But this is an evolving field and, as such, there is constant change and adjustment The pubUct confidence in the public and pnute sectors' protec- tion of their privacy depends on re- peated examples and public stands taken byall involved Ln AIDS treatment and prevention With positive examples many of the difficulties centered around serologic testing and contact tracing -noufication A-I] abate Insurance Insurance companies are considering requiring serologic testing for selected applicants for life and individual health poLcies.

Despite these observations, there has been much concern regarding *casua transmission in public places such as ices. public buildings, ad sclsools. In some sittations, a combination of misin. formation and a desire to structure \"no- risk' setings has resulted in consider- able social disruption, such as exclusion of child-n wih AIDS &om school. Pu- tux approsers-wilt have to take into- account existing information and move away from these extreme views These major issues wil be addressed by insti- tutioral category, PubIc Buildings, Offices, Schools, and Mental Institutions No risk of transmission has been dot. ur-ented (eit ier by as rologic studies or in estigation 1 AISS cases) outside of established modes. Indeed, aside from the possible spread from brother to brother,\" no trasanussion has occurred(outside ofsexual contact) in hou eo'o, infected wid ro ' transmission has occurred fton pa tients to their nurses except by ner.;e oropen wound exposure) in hospt.. If no transmission has occurred in these settings, which have traditonally been at-risk settings for sunilue-ly transmit ted agents like hepatitis B vlus'S, then one can be confident that no HIV ti-a,. mission occursin any more casual set. tings like offices and public faci ,t:es The purveyors of health tiforaLon need to maintain a high level of public Iowledge regarding the latest find.rgs of H IV transmission so that u.Joundec anixoetiescaa be allayed and appropriate actions can be taken. Schools are of special note because. in the past, they have served as a bat. tleground over the issue of exclidir-g pediatric patients with AIDS, More in- formation is now available, specllicai regarding the lack of tariunssion ft-rc children to their household contacts. including those with whom they have shared toothbrushes, towels, eucx, thus, schools, having far less intimate contact than households, become even more remote prospects for trainers. aion. With these data, the Centers for Dis ase Control hsc. promuitea guidelines for the handling of infected children in schools.1 The only remaining areo oftoncern vs children who, because of age or menu incompetence, do not have control of their bodily functions. Although these children ar very unlIlkelytobe at rL-u of HIV t,\"rnission, previous experience with a variety of infectious diseases in facilities for the mentally retarded and day care centers requires some concern for these areas. Before fins recommen- dations can be made for these latter facilities, further study is required. Prisons Especially on the east coast of the United States,\" prisons have had a con- sietable number of AIDS cases The acquisition of infection for these cases has. by history, been due to ?ugh-r-ok activity primarilyy IV drug use) before -enering prison. Yet. risk-pcosvning ex- posures such as percutaneouis ject;ons and homosexual sex do take place in prisons, and, in some Instances, these exposures occur in involuntary set- tingi. U provision ofAIDS prevention information and the motivation of all prisoners to avoid infection are essen- tial. The question is, can education alone prevent high-risk exposures, or will screening of prisoners and the pro- vision of separate housing facilities for persons with posiuve and neg2rave H rV antibody dings have to be consid- PIen .t A ol AIDS---,s & CvI. 229 the potent.] cxpense and the dificult) -n implcmeontng the latter option, and the lack of data to suggest a high nsk of H IV transmission un prisons, htther study of this situa- tion is clearly justified before objective decisions cant be made Bathhouses Business establishments such asi bathhouses, bars, and adult book stores, where multiple, usually anony- mous sexual encounters take place among a male homosexual clientele, have facilitated the spread of H IV infec- tions Pubbe health agencies in some ras, such as San Francisco and New York, have attempted to close these establishments Only a few such clos- ing-s have taken place, and they have, to a great extent, been lagely symbolic to iscourage the use or such facilities for unsafe sexual actuvities The dosing of such establishments should be requLed it un\"fe sexual activities cannot be eliai&4ed However, prior to com- pulsor closing, some type olregulaoar) inspecton of these establishments should be cared out to maintain env- ronmentaJ and sanitation standards (such as Improved lighting and removal ofdoors to privste rooms) to discourage unsafe sexual contacts CONCLUSION Human immunodeficiency virus is a dangerous Infectious agent that spreads effectively only through the sharing of blood, through sexual intercourse, and from infected mothers to their infants. The combined use of educatonhootiva. tion/aslol building, berologic screening, and contact trsngtootific-tion c*uld eliminate subetantally reduce at-risk behaviors and infection. The alcoct- plishment of this reduction requires a considerable effort by physicians, pub- be health practitioners, business, and community organizations to get across the relatively simple AIDS prevention messages. Only through a conerted effort by all of these groups will the reluctance of individuals and society to deal with the difficult issues inherent in AIDS prevention and cont o be over- come. The eventual extent o( HIV tansmission and the resulting mnor- bidity and mortality will be determined by how well we as a society can design .and implement a concert AIDS pre- vention effort and how we as individuals heed the messages of thit prevention effort and take personal responsibility to protect ourselves.

M.D. AIDS in children: a review of the clinical, epidemiologic and public health aspects MARTHA F. ROGERS, MD BACKGROUND In 1981 an epidemic of a severe form of acquired immune deficiency, now known as acquired immuno- deficiency syndrome (AIDS), began in homosmsual men and intravenous drug abusers in New York City. San Francisco and Los Angeles.' Since that time over 7000 cases from 45 states and 32 foreign countries have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The disease affects primarily the cellular it. mune system and in its severe form results in repeated opportunistic infections and mahgnancies. To date 107 cases of AIDS in children and sdoles- cents have been reported to CDC. Children with AIDS present a number of difficult problems to the pedis. tricisr regarding diagnosis, management and psycho- social issues This paper reviews the clinical, epide. miologic and public health aspects of AIDS in the pediatric population. ETIOLOGY Recent evidence strongly implicates a retroviris as the cause of AIDS. Two prototype viruses were ini- tially identified independently by investigators at the Institut Pasteur in France' and at the National Cancer Institute in the United States.' Evidence indicates that these two viruses are the sme. In 1983 investigators at the Institut Pasteur in Paris isolated a retrovirus from a homoezul man with lymphadenopathy syndrome. a syndrome thought to be a mild form of or precursor to AIDS.' This virus, morphologically different from the known human re. troviruses, was termed the lymphadenopathy-associ- ated virus (LAV). This virus was subeequently isolated from other AIDS patients, including one patient with transfusion-associated AIDS and one of the donors of the transfused blood.' A seroepidemiologic study Fros the AIDS Branch, Divison of Vaal Diseases. Center for Infectious Dmsases, Centers for Disease Control. Public Health Sroice. L's tod Stows Dep'ront of 30333Address Roeers, M D, at the aboe sddnsa 230showed that antibody to this virus was present in more than 70% of patients with AIDS or with symp. toms strongly suggestive of AIDS, in only 1% of healthy blood donors and in none of their patients with congenital immunodeficiencieas In 1984 investigators at the National Institutes of Health. United States, isolated a retrovirus, termed the human T-lymphotrophic retrovirus, type III IHTLV Ill, from a number of patients with AIDS, from patients with symp oms strongly suggestive of AIDS and from &symptomatic homosetul men.' The virus was not isolated from healthy heterosexual sub. jets. A seroepidemiologic study found antibody to the retrovirus in similar populations Retroviruses are RNA viruses which contain an enzyme, reverse trenscriptase, that tsnacribes DNA from RNA, a process used in the replication of these viruses, Although reroviruaes infect many animal species, only two other human retroviruses ars known- (11 human T cell Ieukemia/lymphome virus (HTLV) type I which has been isolated from patients with malignancies of the thymus-derived lymphot' and (2) HTLV type II which has been isolated from a patient with a T cell variant of hairy cell leukemia.s The AIDS retrovirs, lie %\"her human retioviruses, primarily lympbocyUs derived from the thymus IT lymphocytes), whh are responsible for cellular immunity. The AIDS virus preferentially in- fects the subset of T lymphocytes known as helper T lymphocytes which augment the immune response. The subset of T lymphocytes which suppresses the immune response, the suppressor T lymphocyte, is relatively spared and outnumbers the helper T -Lls. The bone marrowr-derived lymphocytes (B lympho- cytes), which are responsible for antibody production, an also relatively spared. CASE DEFINITION The CDC cas definition for AIDS, developed before the discovery of the etiology of AIDS. is based on clinical signs and symptoms. A case is defined as a child diagnosed as having an opportunistic infection 232 Vol 4 No 3 TABLE I D. cis -ie, Infections 4atoorr,.ua a. oum ji ,fe' i (apo s San 'Ma Lr mphoma the bra., Ploonar central nerois osenm or d.,eonaed infection or malignancy (Table I I indicating an underlying cel- lular immunodeficienc. Other causes of ammunode- ficienc% such immunodeficiencies, con- genital infections, medications, lymphoreticular ma- lirnancy and starvation must be ruled out Because this definition requires the presence of an opportun- istic infection or malignancy, the cases of AIDS retro- virus infection reported to CDC are the most severe, Less sev ere forms of the illness appear to occur. Symp. toms associated with AIDS such as generalized ymph. adenopathy. chronic diarrhea, weight loss or failure to thrive, recurrent infections, persistent oral candidi- asis. interstitial pneumonitis and hepatoaplenomegely have occurred in patients belonging to high risk groups This constellation of symptoms has been called AIDS-related complex and has been used to describe patients in high risk groups who have symp- toms that are associLed with AIDS but who have not developed rn opportunistic infection or malignaic:. Since develops-ent of the serologic tests for meruring antibody to the AIDS virus, antibody to HTLV 111/ LAV has been found in patients with AIDS-related complex and asymptomatic members of high risk groups a HTLV III/LAV has been isolated from these asymptomatic mropositive persons suggesting that a chronic carrier state can exist. In a recently reported atudy virus was also isolated from four persons who were aeronegative \" Lcng term follow-up of these individuals is needed to clarify the relationship be- tween antigen and antibody production and clinical symptoms PEDIATRIC HIGH RISK GROUPS AND ROUTES OF TRANSMISSION In adults and adolescents over 95% of cases have occurred in persons belonging to six high risk groups- Group 1, homosexual or bisexual men, Group 2, intra- venous drug abusers. Group 3. Haitians, Group 4,ROGERS 231 hemophilisci. Group 5. persons recei,ing blood or blood products. and Group 6, the sexual partners of infected persons This epidemiologc evidence indi- cates that, in adults and adolescents, AIDS is trans. mitted through sexual contact (both hetero- and ho- moaexual contact) or through parenteral exposures such as the sharing of needi used for injecting illicit drugs or through blood transfusions. In younger children two risk factors are primaril associated with infection- Ill receiving blood or blood products, and 121 birth to e mother whn has AIDS, &% a member of a high risk group or is a sexual partner of a member of a high risk group (Fig 11 The route of transmssior. in those childreai born to high risk parents is unknown. but the retrovirus may be ac- quired in ttero. from infective maternal blood ast the time of birth or postnatally Data from cases reported to MCD suggest that children born to high risk parents may acquire infection in utero The median time in. terval between birth and onset of symptoms in chil- dren of high risk parents is 4 months This is shorter than the median time interval uf transfusion-associ- ated illness in which the time between transfusion and onset of symptoms is 8 months Postnatal transmission, through infected breast milk or close contact between the mother and baby. could theoretically occur. However, none of the 7408 cases reported to the CDC is of December 13. 1984. has occurred in individuals who were household con- tacts Inonsexuall of other AIDS patients, suggesting that transmission through casual person-to-person contact, if it occurs, is rare. All the patients reported to CDC with no identifiable risk of exposure deny contact with a known AIDS patient Breast milk from infected mothers has not been cultured. INCUBATION PERIOD The i, cubation period for this virus appears to be relatively long Based on cases of transfusion-associ- ated AIDS in adults reported to CDC, the period between transfusion (infection with the virus) and onset of symptoms ranged from I month to 5 years (median, 28 months). In the 12 children with trans. fusion-associated AIDS, this time period was some- what shorter, ranging from I month to 2 years, 5 months (median, 8 months) The reason for the shorter incubation period in children compared with adults is not clear All 12 children were neonates. who may be at increased risk due to an immature immune system CLINICAL COURSE Prodrome. Before development of opportunistic infections and malignancies, adolescent and adult pa- tients usually experience a prodrome characterized by an insidious onset of weight loss', fey er. malaise. night sweats, chronic or recurrent unexplained diarrhea, fatigue, generalized yrmphadenopathy, arthralgias or 233 AIDS IN CHILDREN 40-, 38- ,36-34- 32 30- 28- 24 24 22 20 is 'a 'a 12100 0 0 UMay, rACTos' 1.f[WOPMMA candidiasis. The prodrome may last from weeks to months. Infants who are infected with HTLV Ill/LAY in the neonatal period usually develop signs and symp. toms before 1 year of age. typically failuri to thrive, recurrent or persistent thrush, chronic interstitial pneumonitis, hepatosplenomegaly. chronic or recur. rent diarrhea, lymphadenopathy and recurrent severe bacterial infections such as sepis and meningitis. A relatively uncommon finding is recurrent enlargement of the parotid glands. These prodromal signs and symptoms, as in adults, can last from weeks to months before development of an opportunistic infection or malignancy. Opportunistic disiasee. The most common dis- awes men in patients with AIDS are viral, fungal and parasitic opportunistic infections and malignancies. Pneumocystis conso pneumonia is the most common infection, occurring in 70% of pediatric patients re- ported to the CDC. The most common malignancy seen is an aggressive form of Kaposi's sarcoma occur- ring primarily in homosexual men, but it has been reported in children. Non-Hodgkins lymphoma also occur. Laboratory findings. Laboratory abnormalities characteristic of AIDS include lymphopenia, specifi- calty a decrease in the T helper lymphocytes, resulting in a reversal of the ratio of T helper cells (OKT8+, Leu3+) to T suppressor cells (OXT4+, Leu2+). Lym. phocyte function is also abnormal as measured by amarkedly depressed response to mitogens such as phy- tohemagglutinin and concanavalin A and to antigens. Moat patients also react poorly to skin tests with recall antigens. Serum immunoglobulin levels are normal or more commonly increased. DIAGNOSIS AIDS must be differentiated from other causes of immune deficiency Such as treatment with immuno- suppressive drus, congenital immunodeficiencies, congenital infections and saurvation. A history and physical examination should rule out immunode- ficiency secondary to recent oral or parenteral use of eroide or cytotosic agent. and starvation. that are with immunodeficiency, par- ticularly lymphoma, must be considered. Congenital infections and immunodeficiencies msy be more dif- ficult to differentiate. Cellular immunodeficiency can be associated with some congenital infections, such s cytomegslovirut,\" infection or rubella.5 However, this immunodefi- ciency is temporary and is usually less severe than that associated with AIDS. Unlike most congenital infections, symptoms associated with AIDS do not usually occur in the neonatal period, and develop. mental defects such as cardiac abnormalities have not been reported in children with AIDS. Infants with AIDS can acquire infections such a cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis as s result of AIDS, but acquisition is usually not in the neonatal period, and these mnfec.232 r 4 --I 234 Vol 4.

PROGNOSIS The prognosis for HTLV IlI/LAV-infected patients who develop opportunistic infections or malignancies is poor. Of the 7408 patients reported to the CDC since the epidemic began, over 40% have died. Of those patients diagnosed prior to 1982. over 80% have died Of the 103 children age Is years or younger with outcome reported to the CDC. 65q have died Al- though the long term prognosis of infection with HTLV IIILAV has not been determined, a few lon- gitudinal studies of high risk patients with symptoms of AIDS but without opportunistic infections have resealed that as many as 20% develop AIDS within 3 years of onset of symptoms and up to 501c of adult233 patients with oral candidiasis develop AIDS Is Similar longitudinal studies in children have not been re- ported OCCURRENCE Of the 7408 cases of AIDS reported to CDC as of December. 1984. 107 (1 4eS) were in children and adolescents, 18 years of age or younger. The number uf cases of AIDS in the pediatric population has been sceadil) increasing since diagnosis in 1979 of the ear- liest cav reported to CDC (Fig. 2). The apparent decrease in cases reported in the latter half of 1984 probably reflects the lag time between diagnosis and receipt of case reports.

New Jersey, Florida or California The majority of pediatric patients with AIDS were preschool-aged children (Fig. II Of the 107 children and adolescents with AIDS, 84 479%) were younger than 6 years of age at the time of diagnosis of AIDS. All of these children, in whom investigations hese been completed, acquired AIDS either from a blood transfusion (12 children or because they were born to a mother who had AIDS. was a member of a high risk group or was a sexual partner of someone in a high risk group (60 children). PREVENTION Since a large proportion of children with AIDS acquire the disease through exposure to their parents, prevention of AIDS in adults would be expected to prevent cases in children \"s well. Behavior modifica- tion in adults and adolescents such as reduction of the number of sexual partners, especially those in high risk groups, participation in drug rehabilittion pro- grams and avoiding the use of nonsterile needles may help reduce cases. Prevention of congenital cases through birth control and abortion are also important, however, the risk of AIDS in infants born to infected mothers is unknown In 11 mothers who had already delivered one child with AIDS. 12 subsequent pregnancies produced 4 affected infants, suggesting that the risk of transmis. sion of the agent is a continuing one and that each pregnancy may be at high risk fcr infection,\" Infected mothers at., often as niptomatic before and during the pregnancy and at the time of birth, making any interv-ention such as avoidance of pregnanc. or abr ion impossible Presnroi:; of AIDS through reduction of infected blood and blood product- would also significantly. re- 235 234 30. 25 20 15 i0AIDS IN CHILDREN May. 1985 1 1979 I 1180 I loll I 1912 1 1953 1 1,54 1 Fic 2.

Cases in hemophiliacs and children reviving transfusions account for 21% of cases in children reported to CDC. The United States Public Health Service currently recommends that per- sons belonging to high risk groups refrain from donate. ing blood. Blood banks anticipate being able to screen blood for antibody to HTLV II/LAV which is t- pected to eliminate 95% of infected blood. However, because of the long incubation period of the virus. cases attributable to blood transfusions will continue to occur. Heat treatment of Factor VII I conentrate has been shown to be an effective method of eiminating HTLV III/LAV from this product in laboratory studies.1 The Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the Na- tional Hemophilia Foundation has recently issued re- vised recommendations: (I) cryoprecipitata (because of the markedly fewer donors relative to Factor VIII concentrate) should be used in Factor VIII-deficient newborn infants and children younger than 4 years of age and in newly identified patients never treated with Factor VIII concentrates, (2) fresh frozen plasma should be used in Factor IX-deficient patients in the same categories; (3) desmopreasin should be used whenever possible in patients with mild or moderate hemophilia A; and (4) 'because heat-treated products appear to have no increase in untoward effects atiob- uteble to the heat treatment, treaters using coagula- tion factor concentrates should strongly consider changing to heat-treated products with the under- standing that protection against AIDS is yet to be proven.\"\"HEPATITIS S VACCINE Because this vaccine is made from pooled sera of persons who are at high risk for AIDS, many physi- cians have avoided the us,. of this vaccine for fear that it may be contaminated with the AIDS agent Rectnt studies show that the inactivation process used in preparing the vaccine will inactivate the AIDS virus.\" Other studies have shown that the vaccine contained no detectable AIDS virus-related nucleic acid se- quences at a sensitivity of less than I pg of DNA per 20-og dose of vaccine.'5 No seroconversions to the AIDS virus were detected in 19 individuals who had received vaccine.\" To dae 68 case of AIDS have occurred in persons who were vaccine\"te 65 of these cases occurred in persons with known risk factors for AIDS; the remaining 3 are under investigation.\" This evidence should reassure physicians and those at high risk for hepatitis B that the vaccine is safe. DAY CARE. SCHOOL AND POSTER ROME ISSUES Although there is no evidence that HTLV III/LAV is transmitted by casual person-to-person contact, the theoretical possibility of transmission in the school. day care and foster home setting creates difficult social problems for infected children. Cor. -erely these set. tings may increase the immunocompromised child's exposure to infectious agents. Physicians and health departments confronted with thete problems have often chosen to place children in foster homes without other children younger than 6 )ears of age, Day care attendance is generally not 236 ROGERS Vol 4.

In addition to the above general precautions, health care personnel and others caring for AIDS patients should avoid accidental wounds from sharp instruments contaminated with potentially) infectious material Based on reports to the CDC, most accidental needlesticks occurred while recapping needles This practice should be avoided Other detailed recommendations for health care per- sonnel have been published by the CDC.\" Health care personnel can be reassured by evidence suggesting that the risk of transmission from AIDS patients is ver) small. A recent study found that none of 52 hospital personnel with documented accidental blood or mucous membrane exposure to infectious material from an AIDS patient developed AIDS or signs and symptoms associated with AIDS. Thirty- three of these persons were seronegative for HTLV Ill /LAV when tested for a mean of & months (range. 0 5 to 20 months) after the accident.\" Of the 232 cases of AIDS in health care workers reported to the CDC, all but 23 belonged to known risk groups, and epide- miologic investigation of these 23 failed to document AIDS transmission through occuptional exposure to a patient suspected of having HTLV III/LAV infection Only one case of HTLV III/LAV infection in a hos- pital employee without other risks for AIDS and with documented parenteral exposure to an AIDS case has been reported \" The employee, a nurse, developed an acute illness about 2 weeks following a needJestck injury involving an AIDS case. The acute illness, characterized by fever, fluhike symptoms, macular rash. arthralgias and generalized lymphadenopathy. resolved without specific therapy A serum sample collected 27 da)s after the injury did not contaiti antibody to HTLV Ill/LAM.

The oulpatientie blood sample was positive for IY antibody by EIA and Western blot. and a hepatitis 8 surface antigen test ws negative The phlebotomist's ELA was negative the day after the incident and again 8 weeks later. When she donated blood 9 months after the exposure, she was positive for H1V antibody by BA end Western blot (bands p24 end gp4i) She has had no symptoms. She denied having any sexual contact during the previous 2 years, ever using drugs intravenousy, or ever receiving a transfusion. 247 Two months aftai the incodont she scratched the back of her hand with a needle used to draw blood from an intravenous drug abuse of unknown HIV-antibody status She did not bleed as e result of the scratch and has not had any reedle-stick injuries in over 2 years Her serologic tests for syphils and hepafiti B were negative A coworker who was splattered with blood on the face and in the mnoth during the same incident ramans aeronegative I year after the incident.

Her serologoc tests for syphilis and hpatrts 8 were negative She has an immunologic disorder which had been treated with corticostaroids in the past but s had not taken any innmunosuppresive medi- cation for the past year A co-worker with a wshie exposure during the same procedure re- mains seronegative of health-care workers with H infections associated with skin or mucous-membrane exposure to blood from HIV-infectd patients are reported above Careful investigation of these three cases did not identify other risk factors for HIV infectson although unracograzd or forgotten needle-sbck exposures to other infected patints cannot be totally excluded The exact route of transmission in thene three cases is not known Health- Care Worker 1 had chapped hands, and the duration of Contact with the blood of the patient experiencing a cardiac arrest may have been as l as 20 minutes Health-Care Worker 2 sus- tained contamination of oral mucous membranes This individual also had acne but did not recal having open lesions In addition, she had sustained a scratch from a needle used to draw blood from an intravenous drug abuser of unknown IV-ifaction status Health-Care Worker 3 had a history of dermatitts mvolving an ear Health-Care Workers 1 end 3 were not wearing gloves when direct contact with blood occurred Health-Care Worker 2 was weanng gloves, but blood contaminated her face and mouth. Three ongoing prospective studies provide data on the magnitude of the nsk of H infec- tion incurred when health-care workers are exposed to blood of infected patients through needle-stick wounds or contamination of an open wound or mucous membrane In a COC cooperative surveillance project ( 0, a total of 1.09 7 health-care workers with parenteral ci mucous-membrane exposure to the blood of patients with AJOS or other manifestations of MV infection had Wen enrolled as of March 31, 1987. Needle-stick injuries and cuts with sharp objects accounted for 969 (89%) of the exposures to blood; 298 of these had paired serum samples tested for HW antibody One (0.3%) aeroconverted (2), indicating that the risk 248 of transmission during these exposures as very low. In addition. 70 hetth-car workers had open wounds exposed to blood, and 58 had mucous membrane exposed to blood, Postexpo- sure soaur samples from 82 of these 128 workers have been tested for antibody 1o KV; none was soropositive. In a study at the Natonal Institutes of Halith (IfI through Api 30, 1987. none of the 103 workers with percutanom exposures and none of the 229 workers with mucous- membrane exposures to blood or body fluids of patients with AIDS was soropositive. At the University of California 112). none of 03 workers with open wounds or mucous membranes exposed to blood or body fluids of patients with AIDS was aeroposifv Although the precise risk of transmission during axposuret of open wounds or mucous membranes to contaminat- ad blood cannot be defined, these studies indicate that it must be very low. The three cases reported her suggest that exposure of skin or mucous membranes to contaminated blood may rarely rest in transmission of V. The magnitude of the risk is not known Simce data on the frequency with which such exposures occur are not available Skin and mucous-membrane exposures are thought to occur much more commonly then needs sticks, and the risk associated with skin or mucous-membrane exposures is likely to be far lower then that associated with noele-stick inurias Nonetheless. the increasing prearstence of MV infection increases the potential for such exposures, especially when routinely racom- mended precautions ar not followed It is unlikely that routine serologic testing for WV infection of all patients admitted to hospi- tats would have prevented those exposures since two of the thres exposures occurred in the outpatient cnic setting. and one occurred during a resuscitation effort in en emergency room shortly after the arrival of the patent. At the te of exposure, Health-Cars Worker 2 suspect- ed that the soure patient was infected with V. but Helth-Cere Workers 1 and 3 did not The hospital whar Health-Care Worker 3 wax exposed has a protocol for aphi ersis which normally involves MN-ntibody testing of donors, however. such testing was not done in ad. vance of the procedure Previous CDC recommendations have emphasized the value of MN serology casting for patient diagnosis and management and for pravantion and control of WV transmission 1131 and have stated that some hosals in certain geographic areas may deem it appropriate to initiate serologic testing of patients 171 Such testing may also provide en op- porturwt to reduce the risk of HV infection to hsealth-car workers, but it hax not been astab. lhed that knowledge of a patient's serologic status increase the compliance of health-care workers with recommended precautions Those cass emphasize again the need to implement and strictly enforce previously pub- hshad recommendations for maimizing the risk of exposure to blood and body flui s of all pa- itints in order to prevent transmission of H infection in the workplace and duri invasive procedures (7-9), i As previously recommended, routine precautions must be followed when there is a possi- bility of exposure to blood or other body fluids The anticipated exposure may reluve gloves lone (a 9, when placing an intravascular catheter or healing items soiled wth blood or equipment contaminated with blood or other body fluids) Procedures inolvn more extensive contact with blood or potentially infective body fluids lI g. some dental or tndoxcopic procedures or postmortem examinations) may require gloves. gowns, masks. and eye-coverings Hands and other contaminated skin surfaces should be washed thor- oughly and immediately if accidentally contaminated with blood (7). Then precautions deserve particular emphasis in emergency cars aettinga in which the risk of blood expo- sure Is increased and the infectious status of the patient is usually unknown 114). 249 2 Previous recommendations hive emphasized management of perentral and mucous- membrane expoeurea of healtl-care workers'.

Yesterday, it was mistakenly stated that the Hot- line tape refers callers automatically to Gay groups, including the one before us. The record will show that the Hotline is operated by the American Social Health Association, and that the materials given by that group are not the same those that were discussed yesterday. Mr. DANNEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, may I comment on that? Mr. WAXMAN. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. DANNEMEYER. The persons who brought this information to my office told me that the counselor at the American Social Health Association gave the phone number for the Gay Men's Health Center. I may have misspoken with respect to that phone number for the Gay Men's Health Center being on the tape itself. But the counselor working at the American Social Health Asso- ciation is the one who gave the telephone number for the Gay Men's Health Center; and, candidly, I don't think we should toler- ate that. Mr. WAXMAN. Was that given on request to the individual call- ing? Mr. DANNEMEYER. I don't know how else it would be given out. Mr. McKINNEY. Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. Yes, Dr. McKinney? Mr. MCKINNEY. I think that it is very likely that that could be, if the caller were looking for an agency that provides direct client services. It is well known that Gay Men's Health Crisis is the only such agency in the city of New York. It would be a very responsible reply to refer. Mr. WAXMAN. You're not called the Gay Men's Health Center? Mr. MCKINNEY. The Gay Men's Health Crisis. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Dannemeyer has referred to the Gay Men's Health Center. Do you know whether that is the same organiza- tion? Mr. DANNEMEYER. We believe it is the same organization. Mr. WAXMAN. You believe that it is the same organization. Where did you get this information? Mr. DANNEMEYER. A man named Duane Crumb, who identified himself as a Christian minister, was given the number for the Gay Men's Health Crisis Center. That organization sent him the litera- ture that I have introduced for the record. The counselor for the American Social Health Association was the one who gave Duane Crumb the telephone number that I have described. Mr. WAXMAN. First of all, the question came up yesterday about the transcript for the recording. Whatever transcript you have is not the transcript from the recording. It is a transcript that indi- vidual made of the conversation. Is that correct? Mr. DANNEMEYER. We have another witness, unsolicited, who brought this information to my office, that we have a recording of the conversation that took place. Mr. WAXMAN. It's a recording of the conversation, but not a re- cording of the tape? Mr. DANNEMEYER. The recording that we have is not of the tape. It is of the conversation that took place. Mr. WAXMAN. The National Gay-- 263 Mr. DANNEMEYER. This is a transcript of the National Gay and Lesbian Crisis Line. Mr. WAXMAN. Are you familiar with that organization? Mr. McKINNEY. Yes. Mr. SWEENEY. Yes, we are. Mr. WAXMAN. Who are they? Mr. SWEENEY. They are an agency in New York City that runs a national 800 number to respond to questions about Gay and Lesbi- an issues, as well as different AIDS issues. Mr. WAXMAN. Do you know whether they are Federally funded? Mr. SWEENEY. I do not believe they are Federally funded. Mr. WAXMAN. Would someone be referred to them if they called the original hotline number, and asked for services for a Gay indi- vidual? Mr. SWEENEY. It is quite likely that if an individual called and said I am a Gay person, I would like to get services or educational information because I am Gay, that they would be referred to that number. I think that is an appropriate referral, if asked for. Mr. WAXMAN. Let me see if I can understand. We have the American Social Health Association that has received some Gov- ernment funds to have a hotline. That organization, if they are re- quested for a referral for purposes of a Gay individual to talk to someone, do you know whether they would give out your phone number, or this other organization's phone number? Mr. SWEENEY. Sir, I would hope that they would give out our phone number if a Gay person asks for it. We receive between 5,000 and 7,000 on our hotline every month. Mr. WAXMAN. As I understand what Mr. Dannemeyer has is, someone made a transcript of a conversation with a Gay organiza- tion, and that is the transcript you want to put in the record? Mi. DANNEMEYER. No. I don t want to put this transcript in the record, Mr. Chairman. Mr. WAXMAN. You don't want to put that in the record? Mr. DANNEMEYER. What I have asked to be placed in the record was the literature that-- Mr. WAXMAN. I understand. But yesterday, you seemed to indi- cate that what you found offensive was being said by the American Social Health Association. Mr. DANNEMEYER. That is still my position. It think it is offen- sive for the American Social Health Association, using taxpayers' money, to be giving out the telephone number of the Gay Men's Health Center. I- Mr. WAXMAN. Even when asked for information for a Gay person to contact an organization? Mr. DANNEMEYER. That's where the stories differ. The person who brought this information to my attention identified himself as a Christian minister, not as a Gay person. The person working at the American Social Health Association gave the telephone number to this person who identified himself as a Christian minis- ter of the Gay Men's Health Center. Mr. WAXMAN. I don't know where they would refer Christian ministers to, but that was not the appropriate place to refer him. I just wanted all this on the record so people understood what tran- scripts, where, and whatever, belong to what organization. 264 I am going to take a short recess. Thank you very much for your testimony. We are going to take a short recess now before calling our concluding panel. We hope to reconvene in the next 5 minutes. [Brief recess.] Mr. WALGREN [[presiding.] Let me call us back to order and wake everybody up from that short hiatus. The last panel today in this hearing is made up of Dr. Irving Weissman, a professor of pathology at Stanford University and a member of the Steering Committee on AIDS of the NationalAcade- my of Sciences, and Dr. Lawrence Corey, the Director of the AIDS Treatment Unit and a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, and Michael Callen, Community Research Initiative and a founding member of the People With AIDS Coalition of New York. We want to welcome you to the committee and apologize for the interruptive nature of our process here, but that is the way it is and it is an imperfect process that we have. Your contribution to the record is very important to all of us. With that let's go through the panel in the order in which I in- troduced you, and I am sure you picked up the ground rules from the previous witnesses. If you would limit yourself to something in the range of 5 minutes and summarize however you feel comforta- ble, focusing on the points that you really believe deserve to be un- derscored, we would be happy to have your testimony. Dr. Weissman. STATEMENTS OF IRVING L. WEISSMAN, PROFESSOR OF PATHOL. OGY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY, MEMBER OF STEERING COMMIT- TEE ON AIDS, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES; LAWRENCE COREY, DIRECTOR, AIDS TREATMENT EVALUATION PROGRAM AND PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON; AND MICHAEL CALLEN, COMMUNITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE, PEOPLE WITH AIDS COALITION, INC. Mr. WEISSMAN. I am Dr. Irv Weissman. I have been on the facul- ty at Stanford University for nearly 10 years, and I have been an immunologist for 20 years. I was on the Steering Panel and wrote the background paper on the pathogenesis of AIDS for that com- mittee which produced the document that I think all of you have called \"Confronting AIDS.\" What I really want to say as briefly as I can is that despite some very major advances in understanding the isolation and the nature of the virus and the genetics of the virus that causes the. disease and some very striking clinical advances in at least describing what happens to AIDS patients, that we still have some very major problems that are not being addressed appropriately. The first point I want to make is that we do not yet have a suffi- cient knowledge base to develop an understanding which could lead to the development of vaccines, therapy for those people who have the disease already, effective therapy, prevention and other kinds of treatment, and we are not acting, I believe, appropriately to obtain that knowledge base. The second point is that we have not yet even begun to recruit the best minds and laboratories in fields that are certainly directly 265 related to AIDS, and there are very good reasons why we haven't done so. Most of the reasons, I think, are funding reasons, and some of them are structural: that is, how the structure of the fund- ing agencies works. Now, before I go too far into this, I would like to say that the second point I made, that is, the lack of the very best minds, is not just an invention of my own. A number of scientists, myself includ- ed, went back over the 20 best names, the 20 finest scientists in T cell biology alone, which is, of course, an area directly related to AIDS, and asked how many of those people who were so prominent in 1982 are now doing AIDS or AIDS-related research or research funded under the AIDS rubric? Very few of them are doing so. So there is a problem that we have not developed a structure, a funding strategy that attracts and recruits the very best minds we have. It would be like setting up a Manhattan Project with two or three really good people, fantastic people, but without tapping the resources the country has to offer. So let me move to my recommendations before I ramble much further, and then I will get back to the reasons why I think these are so. My first recommendation is that all AIDS research funding should be incremental to already established NIH funding levels plus inflationary increases backdated to 1982. 1 will show you docu- mentation a little bit later that in fact there has been a recommit- ment of funds to research which has greatly damaged our ability to develop the sufficient knowledge base. Second is that fundings for AIDS research should be broadly de- fined and certainly should include those areas of fundamental im- munobiology, virology, lymphocyte biology, developmental biology and neurobiology which could provide the knowledge base for future advances in AIDS research. Most of this broadened funding, I believe, should be by independent investigator-initiated grants, not through the contract route. Third, that construction and renovation costs should be added into the AIDS research budget, and the goal of such construction is first to provide safe containment areas for investigations with HIV, with HIV variants and with animals infected with HIV and HIV variants; second, to provide structural centers using high cost, high tech equipment to study the structures of the HIV molecules, also of those molecules on T lymphocytes which are utilized for infec- tion by the AIDS virus, and of those molecules that T cells recog- nize on infected cells so that they can wipe out the seat of infec- tion. Third, to upgrade and extend the breeding, genetic definition and high containment facilities for animals involved in animal models of AIDS, particularly simian and rodent species. The fourth point is to establish research fellowships and research training programs at the undergraduate, the graduate, the M.D.-Ph.D., the post-doctoral and the post-clinical training levels with sufficient slots and com- petitive salaries to attract the best young minds in America into AIDS and AIDS-related research. Already? Mr. WALGREN. That is all right. We have time to be flexible. Mr. WEISSMAN. So now I will just try to go briefly through a couple of the arguments before my 5 minutes is up. 266 Why do we have this paradox that we have this incredible epi- demic, we have funds coming in for research, and yet we are not attracting the very best labs and the very best minds into this field? The first barrier, I guess, is containment facilities. That is, a number of scientists, myself included, would very much like to do AIDS research. We would like to do it the way that we can do it. That is, we would like to do it by developing animal models or working in the closest animal models available, or working even in tissue culture with the AIDS virus, but you have to have a safe containment facility. At Stanford University and, I am sure, at many other institu- tions, those facilities simply are not available. When I approached our dean about developing such a facility, he said: Fine, you find the space, the building, and then the money to build it, and I will agree we should have that facility as a general use facility. As you know, the NIH does not have funds for construction or renovation. If we are going to work with this virus, we have to work under safe conditions. If we are going to make an animal model of it, we have to have high containment facilities for ani- mals. This is an incredible barrier for people to move into this area of research. We can't work with it safely. The second point is to develop an animal model is going to be expensive and it requires really high class animal facilities. You could get an animal model that is close to relevant, that is, either a simian model, where you have genetically-defined strains of mon- keys so that you could transfer cells from one animal to another to see what the course of the disease is, to ask, for example, what is the mechanism for infection when the semen contains the virus, is it in the seminal fluid, is it free virus, is it an infected cell, is it a sperm? We don't know those answers yet. Once it gets into the animal, how does the virus spread from one cell or one tissue to another? How does it get rid of all those T lym- phocytes that normally protect against infection? We don't know, and we cannot invade the human body to find it out. We have to have an animal model for that, and that takes money and takes time and takes people. So on and so on. We don't know yet how to identify those cells which could usually eliminate the virus infec- tion but in this case they don't. So there are tremendous needs to develop these kinds of models, and the brightest people would follow if the models were developed. Now, in the funding for AIDS research from 1982 to 1986, you have a document that was cited in this AIDS thing that was writ- ten by Richard Krause, who was the former head of National Insti- tutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, which shows that the fund- ing for AIDS at the NIH has largely been recommitted out of the already existing NIH budget, and very little add-on funds came about. AIDS is an add-on disease, quite clearly. It was not around, at least that we could see, as a clinical entity probably before 1978. It is an add-on research burden, yet there is very little add-on re- search money. Now, when NIAID or NCI, the institutes that mainly fund for AIDS research, had to develop these funds, they took it away from something else. What did they take it away from? Basic immunobiology, T cell biology, virology, neurobiology, 267 just exactly the areas that we must learn more about in order to develop the knowledge base, in order to develop the diagnostics, the therapeutics, transplantation, whatever we are going to need to be able to take care of those people who already have the disease, and, of course, to prevent the disease from spreading. In addition, there are some areas of research which deal with solving structures at a very, very microscopic level that require very high cost facilities, called x ray crystallographic facilities. There are a few tiny laboratories around the country and very little training money for people to go into this area; yet, it has proved crucial for our understanding how particular viruses can cause infection, how pa .icular viruses can get rid of T cells, and in fact, how T cells can recognize an infected cell and tell it apart from a free virus or from a normal cell. Solving that question isn't trivial. Solving that question is cen- tral to try to develop rational vaccines and rational therapies. So we have to have some way of developing both training grants and facilities for x ray crystallography at a number of places. I can see my time must be getting short, so I think I will just close there and take any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Weissman follows:] STATEMENT OF IRVING L. WEISSMAN, M.D. AIDS and ARC are human diseases caused by a retrovirus called HIV. A remar- kedly intense and effective collection of research efforts at both the basic science and the clinical science levels have led to the isolation of the virus, the definition of its genetic structure, the demonstration that it is associated with each of the disease complexes occurring in AIDS patien'.s, and especially that the virus appears to attack and cause the elimination of a critical subset of protective cells in the body- the CD4 T lymphocytes. The result of this depletion of most CD4 T lymphocytes is an unusual susceptibility to infection by foreign invaders that are usually easily eliminated. Because so much has been learned about the virus and the diseases it causes it is tempting to believe that we have sufficient knowledge to combat this epidemic at a scientific level; and that as a result of that focused combat we have an excellent chance to develop drugs to treat patients with the disease, to develop other drugs designed to restore the immune system in such patients, and to develop vac- cines that will prevent populations from being infected by HIV. The major thesis of this document is that these assumptions are not true, and that we do not have a sufficient knowledge base yet to guarantee an expeditious and appropriate set of re- sponses leading to the development of necessary vaccines, drugs, diagnostic, and therapeutic agents. Furthermore, one might assume that the great need to combat this epidemic would have resulted in the recruitment of the very best minds in im- munology, virology, clinical infectious disease, developmental biology, and neurobio- logy to work on AIDS and the diseases it engenders. That is not so. While the re- search carried out to date includes much which has been of the highest quality, no- where near the enormous talent pool available to work on this disease has in fact been effectively recruited. Thus there are very major barriers to completion of re- search adequate to stem the AIDS epidemic, both at the level of developing an ap- propriate knowledge base, and recruiting the talent necessary to develop that knowledge base. In this document I shall try to explain what those barriers are and how I think they can be breached. AIDS appears to be a new human disease, and as such it is an \"add-on\" to the Nation's health research agenda. We now have a strong national mandate to in- crease funding in all areas which might lead to an understanding of the AIDS virus infection, and the systems which it attacks, yet the current AIDS-research funding is not add-on. In fact, funds have largely been recommitted away from areas of re- search in basic immunobiology, developmental biology, virology, cancer biology, and T lymphocyte biology, and instead these funds have been committed to the urgent research on the AIDS viruses and the patients who have the disease. Thus we are in a funding mode which paradoxically must slow down the development of a funda. 268 mental understanding necessary to develop a knowledge base sufficient to respond to the challenge of the disease. How did this paradox come about? To illustrate the problem I shall use one exam- ple, although it is not limited to the Agency I cite. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) has had a major responsibility in developing and carrying-out AIDS related research. That responsibility came from mandated fund- ing from both the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. Government. The amount mandated was not fully incremental to the budget of NIAID, and therefore funds had to be taken away from other portions of the NIAID budget. Just prior to this mandate the majority of research funds distributed by NIAID went to investiga- tor-initiated grants (RO1 and PO1 grants) in laboratories mainly in academic set- tings and research institutes that are primarily staffed with graduate students, medical students, and postdoctoral fellows. In fact, historically, the development of new and useful fundamental knowledge in the areas of basic medical sciences has traditionally come primarily from these investigator-initiated grants. The investiga- tor-initiated grants represent the most important \"cottage industries\" for science, where each scientist develops his or her own hypotheses about what might be going on in the field, develops experimental models for testing these hypotheses, and sub- mits a grant which, if funded, should approach the experimental questions over a 3- 7 year period of research. These RO1 grants are reviewed by panels of independent scientists, almost all of whom are not employees of the government, who rank them for originality and scientific merit; ranked grants are then funded pretty much ac- cording to their order of merit. Each of the NIH institutes also funds intramural programs, mainly on the Bethes- da campus, as well as having the power to grant contracts on specific research or development areas which they deem most important. The intramural NIH programs are very much like the RO1 programs, although they do not face the same type of independent review as the RO1 grants. In contrast to the investigator-initiated grants the contract programs are initiated without a requirements for broad-based review. The contract programs therefore depend for their success on the wisdom and breadth of the NIH administrators to develop the project areas, to publicize their availability, and to select the successful contracts. during the past 5 years the NIAID intramural and contract programs have risen to be the major recipients of funding, at the expense of the ROl grants. Even for those ROl grants which are funded, for the past several years grants not classified by NIAID officers to be related directly to AIDS research have been under severe funding cutbacks, averaging 5-15 percent per year rather than the actual 10- 20 percent inflation for personnel and materials. The types of research not classified under the AIDS rubric, to name a few, include many fundamental studies in animal models of virus infections; molecular genetic research of several related virus types; the fundamental aspects of T cell development, including the origin and life history of CD4 T lymphocytes, and the kinds of T cells which carry out an; viral immunity in ways which wall off or eliminate virus-infected cells; research involving isolating and crystallizing the envelope proteins from members of the retrovirus family to un- derstand their structures, a prerequisite to defining how these viruses attach to and destroy CD4 T cells; the isolation and crystallography of the CD4 proteins; and the basic studies of the footprints viruses leave on the surface of infected target cells which allow immune T cells and other killer cells to recognize and destroy those virus infected cells. Although one might think that shifting these funds from ROl grants to contracts might lead the best of the independent external investigators to respond to requests for funding under NIAID contracts, in fact this is usually not the case. Most highly intelligent and accomplished investigators do not wish to surrogate their own ideas and projects to those dictated and administered by other scientists (most of whom may not be as bright or as accomplished as the external investigator). Thus on the basis of funding alone, most NIH institutes have not been successful in attracting outstanding and accomplished investigators to commit themselves to a long-term re- search program related to AIDS, or to developing the fundamental knowledge base important for AIDS research. The best people working in external research labs are bright young students who are beginning 1) undergraduate research experiences, 2) graduate studies in the bio- medical sciences, and 3) postdoctoral research training prior to obtaining a research or academic appointment. Unfortunately, the trend in Public Health Service and National Science Foundation funding for the past several years, and acutely in the past year, is to limit or decrease numbers of fellowships for undergraduates, gradu- ate students, M.D.-Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral fellows. 269 To summarize, while the increased funding for NIH intramural programs has paid off spectacularly in AIDS molecular virological and immunological research, these precious few laboratories cannot develop the required knowledge base on their own. The net affect of an AIDS funding mandate has therefore been a very signifi- cant shift in PHS funding away from external investigator-initiated grants and to NIH intramural and NIH directed contracts, neither of which involve broad-based peer review. As a result the payline for external investigator-initiated grants in some of these crucial areas has become even more stringent, resulting in a dampen- ing rather than an expansion of first-rate investigation and training. While it is clear to most members of the NAS/IOM panel that our commitment to fight the AIDS epidemic will require prolonged and intense research, these actions will deny creation of a long-lasting infrastructure necessary to develop the understanding of the normal physiology of those parts of the body attacked by the AIDS virus, and for understanding how AIDS and AIDS-related viruses are involved in the patho- genesis of AIDS. AIDS so far is a human disease, and much of what we know about the events that occur from the moment of contact with the virus to the time the patient reaches terminal stages of his or her illness in the hospital is fragmentary at best. Hospital care and autopsy analyses have taught us much about terminal stages of the dis- ease, yet we do not yet know i) the mechanism(s) by which the AIDS virus is trans- mitted from one person's cells to another person's cells; 2) the events that occur that spread the infection from one part of the body to the next; 3) the events that lead to a successful antibody response to certain parts of the virus, but an unsuccessful T cell-mediated elimination of the virus-infected cells; and 4) whether the virus elimi- nates the CD4 T cells during their development in the bone marrow and the thymus directly, or by some indirect means. In fact, published research shows that although over 99 percent of the CD4 T cells are eliminated during the course of HIV infection leading to AIDS, at no time can the virus be found to be produced by more than a rare subset of CD4 T cells (the highest estimates I have seen are still less than 1 in 10,000 of these cells). Because there are appropriately very important medical and ethical safeguards against unwarranted invasion of the human body to find answers to some of these questions it is likely that we shall continue to be largely ignorant about the full extent of the introduction, spread, and pathogenic consequences of HIV infection throughout the course of human disease. Even if it was possible to obtain rapid, complete, and sterile autopsies on HIV-infected individuals who die of other causes (for example, accident, suicide, myocardial infraction), the limitations on such research will not lead to the answers we need to have. Naturally occurring retroviral infections leading to significant acquired immuno- deficiencies have been found in several vertebrate species. Although only a few po- tentially produce a syndrome quite similar to human AIDS, none has been studied sufficiently to elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenesis, so that one could know whether the different types of the immune deficiency result from similar or differ- ent basic mechanisms. Simian AIDS and simian retroviruses are perhaps the most relevant potential examples. It is conceivable that a large scale effort on simian AIDS could be developed which would allow one to develop genetically defined mon- keys which would allow the transfer of immune rejection of virus-infected cells from one individual to the other, therefore allowing scientists to work out questions of the spread of the infection and the host immune response to it. Despite the emer- gency of knowledge of these important models, actual NIH funding for examples such as simian AIDS decreased for the several years leading up to 1986. A completely analogous animal model of H IV-induced human AIDS has not yet been found. Most of what has been learned about fundamental aspects of animal virology, immunology, lymphocyte biology, and to a lesser extent neurobiology has come from extensive investigations with genetically defined inbred strains of ro- dents. In these times of recombinant DNA manipulations of retroviruses and tissue culture cells and of transgenic mouse strains, it is possible that a completely analo- gous animal model of HIV-induced human diseases might be developed. The result of such a development would be the rapid entry of a large number of first-rate scien- tists at a number of levels into the AIDS field. HIV is a human pathogen, and its study requires high-containment facilities. The lack of such facilities is a barrier for many first-class scientists to enter the field. In the future, if HIV-infected animal models are developed, high-containment animal facilities will be required to guarantee safety and the full participation of the wider scientific community in AIDS research. For example, at Stanford University and Stanford Medical School (and probably elsewhere) there is no HIV containment facility available to qualified investigators who wish to follow their own lines of inquiry; and no fully developed high contain- 270 ment animal facility to house mice or other animals of an important animal model; and no funds to build such facilities for common use by qualified investigators. Fur- thermore, due to the repeated funding restrictions from NIH on purchase of new and high cost equipment many laboratories are still working with instruments such as ultracentrifuges which are 10-20 years old. Finally, there is no NIH funding available for construction of new or renovation of old laboratories. Thus many out- standing laboratory groups continue to work in overcrowded and underequipped fa- cilities. High cost special new facilities such as those required to do modern struc- ture analysis by x ray crystallography and related technologies do not exist at many academic and research campuses, and NIH moneys required to develop these facili- ties are not easily obtainable. Recommendations: 1. All AIDS research funding should be incremental to already established NIH funding levels plus inflationary increases back-dated to 1982. 2. Funding for AIDS research should be broadly defined, and certainly should in- clude those areas of fundamental immunobiology, virology, lymphiocyte biology, de- velopmental biology, and neurobiology which could provide the knowledge base for future advances in AIDS research. Mos )f thl., broadened funding should be via in- dependent investigator-initiated ROl or PO1 grants. 3. Construction and renovation costs should be added into the AIDS research budget, and the goal of such construction is first to provide safe containment areas for investigations with HIV, with HIV variants, and with animals infected with HIV and HIV variants; second, to provide multiple structural centers using high cost, high tech equipment to study the structures of HIV molecules, of molecules on T lymphocytes utilized for infection, and of molecules-used for targets of immune attack against HIV infected cells; third, to upgrade and extend breeding, genetic definition, and high containment facilities for animals involved in animals models of AIDS, particularly simian and rodent species. 4. Establish research fellowships and research training programs at the under- graduate, the graduate, the M.D.-Ph.D., and the postdoctoral and postclinical train- ing levels with sufficient slots and competitive salaries to attract the best young minds in America into AIDS and AIDS related research.

We appreciate that testimony and we are pleased to give you the flexibility to add to it, either as we close or even in after-thought by writing. There are some more bells that are ringing. Why don't I just go over there and vote and come right back, and this will take us about 5 minutes, and then we will be able to turn to the balance of the witnesses. I apologize for that, but we have no control over it. Be right back. [Brief recess.] Mr. WALGREN. Let's go back on the record and turn to Dr. Corey. Dr. Corey. STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE COREY Dr. COREY. Thank you, Mr. Walgren. It gives me pleasure to address you today concerning my and many of my colleagues' perception of some of our country's imme- diate research needs. I come to you in my role as Director of the University of Wash- ington's AIDS treatment program, as a physician who has been a researcher, medical educator and patient care advocate of persons with viral sexually transmitted disease for over 12 years, as a pro- 271 fessor of medicine who leads a research group in the AIDS treat- ment, is associated sexually acquired cofactors, and as the director of one of the few training programs in viral sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. The charge of your committee concerning our country's needs for solving this problem are extensive and many qualified persons have already addressed you. I am not going to minimize any of the importance of others' perceptions and concerns but will limit myself to a rather focused area, the necessity of providing facilities to perform clinical research for what we term secondary preven- tion of AIDS: that is, stopping the development of AIDS in those who have infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. By way of background, I think everyone realizes, and Dr. Silver- man has gone through this, that the agent that causes AIDS is a formidable opponent in that the AIDS epidemic or what should more appropriately be called the epidemic of HIV infection in viral sexually transmitted infections that we are experiencing in the United States will not be amenable to a quick fix. To develop the biological know-how on how this virus persists in the human host for an extended period of time and what are the host immune re- sponses that provide protection will, to adapt a phrase, take our best and brightest. These pieces of information are necessary if we are to develop a vaccine. To develop better therapies to slow down what appears to be a nearly inevitable progression of this infection will also take a concerted research effort involving scientists in nearly every con- ceivable discipline. The data that indicates that after 7 years, nearly 30 percent of those infected with HIV develop AIDS, an ad- ditional 25 percent of symptomatic illness spurs those of us who are involved in research toward the development of new therapies with an almost nightmarish urgency. However, despite our resoluteness concerning this task and our willingness to devote 80- to 100-hour workweeks to achieve this goal, we also are frustrated by the lack of facilities to accomplish this charge. I applaud the committee's insight in authorizing re' gional AIDS research centers; however, the nature and amount of money available to these centers is inadequate. Capital construction for specialized laboratories and clinical fa- cilities for AIDS patients and researchers is needed similar to the cancer Tesearch centers so successfully implemented about 15 years ago. It is not unusual-in fact, I find it common-to have many of the brightest of our graduate students or medical students come to us and ask to work in the area of AIDS research. They and I are willing to compete through the peer review system to obtain fund- ing to conduct the experiments. The money and sometimes even the equipment to perform their experiments are often available. What is not available, however, is the space to do the work. I am not talking about spaced used between 9 o'clock and 5 o'clock but space that is already occupied at night and on weekends. In the last year I have personally had five doctoral and post-doctoral per- sons with superb research training ask to participate in our treat- ment and vaccine-related research. All had to be referred else- where because of the lack of space. All are now working in other areas, lost to the AIDS research effort for years, if not fo,'ever. 272 In fact, recently I recalled one of these particularly excellent stu- dents who had previously approached me because we now had some money to fund her. She, however, was involved in another project with another organism and could not be persuaded to leave the bench for her work. When we talk about space, as you have heard earlier, we are talking about P-3 or high containment laboratory space, the kind of laboratory space that is expensive to build and, frankly, is more space per person. You cin not afford to have accidents in the labo- ratory when working with this virus, and we need these kinds of facilities. They are costly facilities. They are facilities that must be well staffed and cannot be crowded. As a scientist, I am trained as more of an observer than a predic- tor; however, it is apparent to those of us working in the field that in the next 5 years we will be faced with the administration of an- tiviral drugs to a large spectrum of persons infected with the aids virus. The monitoring of these patients will require sophisticated virology and immunology laboratories. We will be faced with train- ing primary care physicians in technologies of health care and ex- perimental therapy that are new to them. If we are to offer the latest available modalities of therapy to these persons, we must establish regional centers of excellence that possess the persons, the core laboratories and scientists to conduct these studies, to train health care personnel in the care of these patients and conduct the pioneering studies to extend the duration and quality of survival. Parenthetically, I would say having an ef- fective drug that can be given to the asymptomatic seropositive persons will, I think, go a long way towards solving the \"dilemma\" of resistance to testing for HIV. While there have been moneys appropriated for the conduct of these studies and even the establishment of regional centers, there has been none for the construction of the facilities in which to do the studies. The current problem is a longstanding one in which space for biomedical research has been inadequate for years. Ren- ovation moneys will not solve this problem. Frankly, it is not possible to proceed with the efficiency and pace which this problem deserves without the bricks and mortar to tackle the problem. The model of the cancer center is, in my opinion, an excellent one and one which has been successful in bringing the latest avail- able modalities of therapy to patients. I would envision at least 5 to 10 to even more regional clinical basic and research centers that would contain outpatient facilities for the conduct of clinical re- search, core virology and immunology laboratories needed for the support of these studies, and basic and clinical science laboratories to bring the bench scientists, the clinicians and patients. This ap- proach will speed research and optimize care. Specifically, I would even suspect that at least any facility would need approximately 40,000 square feet to house the appropriate fa- cilities, and approximations are made in the testimony I have sub- mitted. Without these types of centers, the time line to conduct clinical studies and to provide the latest available modalities of therapy to patients with this infection will not proceed with the 273 pace and the expectations of the American public and its elected representatives. I know there is at times resistance to the construction of build- ings. However, the cancer research centers, such as the Dana Farber and the various other ones, Hutchinson Center in our city, are successful models of the bricks and mortar that save lives in cancer therapy. A similar approach is needed for HIV infections, centers that mold a cohesive group of basic clinical scientists, phy- sicians, epidemiologists, educators and health care personnel trained in the prevention, and control and education of sexually transmitted diseases, persons interested and dedicated to as expedi- tious a solution to this disease as is humanly possible. Thank you. Mr. WALGREN. Thank you very much, Dr. Corey. Mr. Callen. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL CALLEN Mr. CALLEN. Four years ago I was one of three people with AIDS to testify before Representative Ted Weiss' Subcommittee on Gov- ernment Operations on the subject of the Federal response to AIDS. Anthony Ferrara and Roger Lyon have since died. I carry on their fight because they cannot. Sometimes I feel like the Elie Wiesel of AIDS. I feel compelled to testify to the world about an almost unspeakable horror. With AIDS the task is not merely to remember those who have died; it is to prevent more death. Not everyone dies from AIDS and AIDS-re- lated conditions, just mostly everyone. When asked to speculate on why I am still standing, I usually joke: \"Luck, Coca-Cola Classic and the love of a good man.\" One thing is for sure. My survival has nothing whatsoever to do with Federal treatment research efforts, and it is this problem of treat- ment research that I am here today to address. I am sure you will understand why those of us with AIDS are impatient. We do not have time to wait for the research systems already in place to move at the glacial pace for which bureaucra- cies are famous. While I do not doubt the personal commitment of many NIH scientists, it is clear that the U.S. Government's tack record in terms of treatments for AIDS is nothing short of scnndal- ous. More than 6 years into the AIDS crisis, we have fewer than 1,000 people enrolled in treatment trials' in the AIDS treatment evalua- tion units. More distressing still is the paucity of compounds tested. I would like to discuss an exciting development which might dra- matically speed up finding treatments for this insidious disease. One of my main criticisms of Federal efforts derives from the fact that treatment research priorities are set almost entirely by aca- demic, bureaucratic research scientists. The valuable insights of general practitioners who are dealing with the day-to-day patient management are undervalued or ignored. This is a waste of knowl- edge which we can ill afford. In an attempt to mine this largely untapped resource, the People With AIDS Coalition in New York has formed the Community Re- search Initiative. CRI has been set up to permit community physi- 274 cians to conduct treatment research in their own offices using their own patients. This should dramatically expand the number of people involved in treatment trials, which in turn will provide better answers faster. Briefly, here is how CRI works. In the United States, all research involving human subjects must meet certain appropriately rigorous standards. A protocol must be written outlining precisely what is to be tested, how and why. This protocol must then be reviewed by a scientific advisory body. In addition, an institutional review --board made up of community representatives must ensure that re- search subjects will not be exposed to unnecessary risk. Someone must also coordinate the enormous logistic details of recordkeeping, subject solicitation, coordination of appointments and procedures and the analysis of findings. All of these functions necessary to conduct FDA-approved re- search are normally present only in medical centers or at Federal research institutions, but the one things medical centers lack is the subjects themselves. They are forced to advertise for subjects or to rely on referrals. CRI proposes to bring the mountain to Mohammed, so to speak. Local physicians already have the patients. What they lack is the administrative structure to conduct trials in their own offices. The Community Research Initiative provides such a structure. There are several immediate advantages to this approach. One, while the ATEUs have some trouble filling trials, community physicians have large and willing patient populations from which to draw. Two, since community physicians would be responsible for coordi- nating day-to-day care, they would be more likely than a medical center researcher to know all the medications that a patient is on. Many patients who participate in the AZT trials concealed the fact that they were on other medications during that trial. This may have hopelessly undercut the value of those trials. This problem would be reduced or eliminated if general practitioners could con- duct research on their own patients. This would be an enormous advantage. Three, the major asset boils down to this. Community physicians have the trust of their patients, a major advantage given the gener- al level of suspicion which has surrounded Federal treatment ef- forts to date. The final advantages are these. CRI can conduct FDA-approved research faster and cheaper and perhaps better than more tradi- tional avenues, faster because the will to move quickly is there, cheaper because there is less overhead since doctors use their own offices to conduct the research, and perhaps better because a com- munity with its back against the wall of AIDS will not permit any- thing but the highest quality of science to occur in its name. We can avoid the bureaucratic entrenchment and silly turf battles which I believe have plagued AIDS research treatment to date. A founding principle of the People With AIDS self-empowerment movement is that people with AIDS ought to have a say in process- es where decisions are being made which directly affect our lives. If treatment priorities must be set, they ought to reflect input from those of us most directly affected, people with AIDS. 275 Lest anyone fear that people with AIDS are unable to objectively and effectively participate in the design and execution of clinical trials, I hasten to point out that the scientific advisory body which currently reviews CRI protocols contains individuals of the highest scientific caliber, many of whom also review protocols for the ATEU's. We have sought out and gained the support of many of the lead- ing AIDS experts in this country. We are committed to conducting top notch research. Our lives deserve no less. CRI would comple- ment, not compete with parallel Federal efforts. It can be done. Creative solutions are necessary for these crisis times. American history is replete with examples of what this country can accomplish if it puts its mind to something. I seek your support and welcome your questions. Thank you. Mr. WALGREN. Let me just ask for some short answers because these are second bells and it gives us just a couple of minutes and then I am going to have to go back over there. It only makes sense, I think, at that point to end. Mr. Callen, one of the concerns in AIDS drug evaluations is the protection of human subjects from harm. Can you describe the pre- cautions that your organization might take in protecting people from research risks? is there anything you would like to add in that area that would be helpful for the record? Mr. CALLEN. I am a member of the Institutional Review Board for the CRI, and I can tell you that we go over these issues in ex- cruciating ethical detail. One example is we were approached to be involved in a trial of DDC, and a group from our Scientific Adviso- ry Committee went up to the company and looked at the data and has rejected pursuing those trials further. There are people in the lesbian and gay community, and particu- larly the AIDS community who are arguing that we should deregu- late and that anybody should be able to take any substance they want. I am not of that view, nor is the Community Research Initia- tive. We believe that the regulatory system can work, that there need to be safeguards, and we would be committed to not pursuing any trial where the risks outweighed the potential benefits. Mr. WALGREN. Dr. Weissman, you indicate, and Dr. Corey as well, that we need these facilities, that these facilities will be sub- stantial. Obviously, there can be only several of them. How would you place them at that point? Do you have any shorthand for the guidance of those who argue that these facilities should be placed by picking a city or picking an institution? How do you pick among the institutions if we don t have enough to go around? Is that a problem that you feel deserves to be addressed? Mr. WEISSMAN. I think that for high containment, P-3 facilities, they are expensive but not so expensive that each medical center cannot afford having one or more. I would suggest that they be funded through investigator-initiated grants, going before the usual kind of review body justifying their need to have that kind of facili- ty at that school, and then take their chances with the peer review process. For something that might be very special and very expensive, that is, developing high-containment primate facilities and very large breeding facilities for what we would call histocompatible or 276 genetically defined monkey lines so that one could really do that important kind of research, obviously you can't do that every- where. Again, there are very fine primate centers at several places around the country that could carry this out if they had sufficient support. Mr. WALGREN. Let me on behalf of the committee thank you all for being a resource to us, and particularly Mr. Callen for being a very special resource to us. We appreciate very much your reach- ing out to us in this process, and we appreciate each of you being a resource that we can reach back to. I apologize for and I know Mr. Waxman would want me to ex- press his apologies for the interruptions and the fact that he had to meet another commitment at the time your panel came up, but that doesn't mean that we appreciate you any less. Thank you very much, and we will look forward to where we go from here. - [Whereupon, at 5:43 -p.m., the hearing was adjourned.] 0 72-635 (280 "}
