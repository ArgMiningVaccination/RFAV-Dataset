GENERAL GUIDELINES PRINCIPLES The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG) and are applicable to all Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines. A.1 Medical Care Medical care and treatme nt required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities with a focus on a return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre -injury s tatus in so far as is feasible. A.2 Rendering Of Medical Services Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work -related injuries and/or illnesses. A.3 Positive Patient Response Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of moti on, strength, endurance, activities of daily living (ADL), cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function may be considered and given relative weight when the pain has an atomic and physiologic correlation in proportion to the injury. A.4 Re-Evaluate Treatment If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results within a well - defined timeframe, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. These timeframes may be slightly longer in the context of conditions that are inhe rently mental health issues, and shorter for other non -musculoskeletal medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary, dermatologic etc.). Recognition that treatment failure is at times attributable to an incorrect diagnosis a failure to respond should prompt the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis in the event of an unexpected poor response to an otherwise rational intervention. A.5 Education Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the community s hould be a primary emphasis in the treatment of work -related injury or illness. Practitioners should develop and implement NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 8 effective educational strategies and skills. An education -based paradigm should always start with communication providing reassuring information to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self -management of symptoms and prevention of future injury. Time Frames A.6 Acuity Acute, Subacute and Chronic are generally defined as timeframes for disease stages: Acute - Less than one month Subacute - One to three month, and Chronic - greater than three months. A.7 Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation refers to the acute timeframe following an injury and is not used to define when a given physician first evaluates an injured worker (initial encounter) in an office or clinical setting. A.8 Diagnostic Time Frames Diagnostic time frames for conducting di agnostic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.9 Treatment Time Frames Treatment time frames for specif ic interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on the date of injury. It is recognized that treatment duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinical judgment m ay substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.10 Delayed Recovery For those patients who fail to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis and re -evaluation of the treatment program should be performed. When addressing a clinical issue that is not inherently a mental health issue, assessment for potential barriers to recovery (yellow flags/psychological issues) should be ongoing throughout the care of the patient. At 6 -12 weeks, alternate treatment programs, including formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation should be consid ered. Clinicians must be vigilant for any pre -existing mental health issues or subsequent, NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 9 consequential mental health issues that may be impacting recovery. For issues that are clearly and inherently mental health issues from the outset (i.e. when it is evident that there is an underlying, work -related, mental health disorder as part of the claim at issue), referral to a mental health provider can and should occur much sooner. Referrals to mental health providers for the evaluation and management of delaye d recovery do not indicate or require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological condition. The evaluation and management of delayed recovery does not require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological claim. Treatment Approaches A.11 A ctive Interventions Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Gener ally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.12 Active Therapeutic Exercise Program Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, sensory integration, coordination, cognition and behavior (when at issue) and education as clinically indicated. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings. A.13 Diagnostic Imaging And Testing Procedures Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection of imaging procedures and interpret ation of results. All diagnostic procedures have characteristic specificities and sensitivities for various diagnoses. Usually, selection of one procedure over others depends upon various factors, which may include: relative diagnostic value; risk/benefit profile of the procedure; availability of technology; a patient's tolerance; and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to estab lish an accurate diagnosis, a second diagnostic procedure is not required. However, a subsequent diagnostic procedure including a repeat of the original (same) procedure can be performed, when the specialty physician (e.g. physiatrist, sports medicine phys ician or other appropriate specialist) radiologist or surgeon documents that the initial study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. Therefore, in such circumstances, a repeat or complementary diagnostic procedure is permissible under the MTG. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 10 It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and/or to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the pathology when there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and/or therapeutic injections when clinically indicated, and post -operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding serial imaging , (including x -rays, but particularly CT scans), it must be recognized that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. A given diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as o btained by other procedures. Therefore, prudent choice of procedures(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize the likelihood of adverse effect on patients, and promote efficiency by avoiding duplication or redundancy. A.14 Surgical Interventions Consideration of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course and imaging and other diagnos tic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat pain, there must be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and ob jective evidence of its cause. In all cases, shared decision making with the patient is advised. The patient should be given the opportunity to understand the pros and cons of surgery, potential for rehabilitation as an alternative where applicable, evide nce-based outcomes, and specific surgical experience. A.15 Pre -Authorization All diagnostic imaging, testing procedures, non -surgical and surgical therapeutic procedures, and other therapeutics within the criteria of the Medical Treatment Guidelines and based on a correct application of the Medical Treatment Guidelines are considered authorized, with the exception of the procedures listed in section 324.3(1)(a) of Title 12 NYCRR. These are not included on the list of pre-authorize d procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 11 Second or subsequent procedures (the repeat performance of a surgical procedure due to failure of, or in complete success from the same surgical procedure performed earlier, if the Medical Treatment Guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures) also require pre -authorization. A.16 Psychological/Psychiatric Evaluations In select patients, mental health evaluations are essential to make, secure or confirm a diagnosis. Of course, the extent and duration of evaluations and/or interventions by mental health professionals may vary, particular ly based on whether: the underlying clinical issue in the claim is inherently a mental health issue; or there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question; or there i s a pre - existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question. Tests of psychological function or psychometric testing, when indicated, can be a valuable component of the psychological evaluation in identifying associated psychological, personality and psychosocial issues. Although these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis should only be made after careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. A professional fluent in the primary language of the patient is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a professional language interpreter must be provided. Frequency: When assessing for a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) a work - relate d, medical injury or illness, then a one -time visit for initial psychiatric/psychological encounter should be sufficient, as care would normally be continued by the prior treating provider. If psychometric testing is indicated by findings in the initial en counter, time for such testing should not exceed an additional three hours of professional time. For conditions in which a mental health issue is a central part of the initial claim, or in which there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequen tial to the work -related, medical injury or illness, that is part of the claim in question, then more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be clinically indicated, and are discussed in detail in the Medical Treatment Guidelines for such m ental health conditions. A.17 Personality/Psychological/Psychosocial Intervention Following psychosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, such intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 12 or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral goals, time frames and specific intervent ions planned . Time to produce effect: two to eight weeks. Optimum duration: six weeks to three months. Maximum duration: three to six months. Counseling is not intended to delay but rather to enhance functional recovery. For PTSD Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: nine to twelve months. For select patients, longer supervision and treatment may be required, and if further treatment is indicated, documentation of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authorized treating practitioner every four weeks during the first six months of treatment. For treatment expected to last six to twelve months, such documentation should be provided every four to eight weeks. For long -term treatment beyond twelve months, such documentation should be provided every eight to twelve weeks. All parties should strive for ongoing and continuous communications, in order to fac ilitate seamless, continuous and uninterrupted treatment. A.18 Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of fu nction as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as endurance, lifting (dynamic and static), postural tolerance, specific range -of-motion, coordination and strength, worker habits, employability, as well as psychosocial, cogniti ve, and sensory perceptual aspects of competitive employment may be evaluated. Components of this evaluation may include: (a) musculoskeletal screen; (b) cardiovascular job -specifi tolerance; (f) maximum voluntary effort; (g) pain assessment/psychological screening; (h) non - material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive and behavioral; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In most cases, the question o f whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. An FCE may be considered at time of MMI, following reasonable prior attempts to return to full duty throughout course of treatment, when the treating physician NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 13 is unable to make a clea r determination on work status on case closure. An FCE is not indicated early during a treatment regime for any reason including one to support a therapeutic plan. When an FCE is being used to determine return to a specific job site, the treating physic ian is responsible for understanding and considering the job duties. FCEs cannot be used in isolation to determine work restrictions. The authorized treating physician must interpret the FCE in light of the individual patient's presentation and medical and personal perceptions. FCEs should not be used as the sole criteria to diagnose malingering. A.19 Return To Work For purposes of these guidelines, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform s afely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of medical care , and should be included in the treatment and rehabilitation plan. It is normally addressed at every outpatient visit. A des cription of the patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan and should provide the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime goal in treating occupational injuries. The emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work, since the prognosis of returning an injured worker to work drops progressively the longer the worker has been out of work. A.20 Job Site Evaluation The treating physician may communicate with the employer or employer's designee, either in person, by video conference, or by telephone, to obtain information regarding the individual or specific demands of the patient's pre - injury job. This may include a description of the exertional demands of the job, the need for repetitive activities, load lifting, static or awkward postures, environmental exposures, psychological stressors and other factors that would pose a barrier to re -entry, risk of re-injury or disrupt convalescence. When returning to work at the patient's previous job tasks or setting is not feasible, given the clinically determined restrictions on the patient's activities, inquiry should be made about modified duty work settings t hat align with, the patient's condition in view of proposed work activities/demands in modified duty jobs. It should be noted, that under certain circumstances, more than one job site evaluation may be indicated. Ideally, the physician would gain the most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activities; but it is recognized that this may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the employer, these can contribute valuable information, as can video co nferences, conducted from the worksite and ideally workstation or work area. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 14 Frequency: one or two contacts 1st contact : Patient is in a functional state where the patient can perform some work. 2nd c ontact : Patient has advanced to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment. The physician shall document the conversation. Other A.21 Guideline Recommendations And Medical Evidence The Workers' Compensation Board and its Medical Advisory Committee have not independently evaluated or vetted the scientific medical literature used in support of the guidelines, but have relied on th e methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and referenced in these Guidelines. A.22 Experimental/Investigational Treatment Medical treatment that is experimental/investigational and not approved for any purpose, application or indication by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. A.23 Injured Workers As Patients In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients recognizing that in certain circumstances there is no doctor -patient relationship. A.24 Scope Of Practice These Guidelines do not address scope of practice or change the scope of practice. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 15 Hip and Groin Disorders Effective date will coincide with the launch of OnBoard: Limited Release B. Hip and Groin Disorders B.1 Overview The hip and groin disorders described in this section are covered in this guideline. Other prominent disorders, including lumbar radiculopathy and lumbar spinal stenosis (which can present as posterior and lateral hip pain), are not reviewed here in detail but should often be considered in the differential diagnosis of hip pain and hip symptoms (see the NYS WCB Mid and Low Back Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines for a discussion of these disorders). Additional diagnostic considerations arthropathies hydroxyapatite), and infections including septic arthritis. B.2 Introduction B.2.a History Taking and Physical Examination History taking and physical examination establish the foundation/basis for and dictate subsequent stages of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. When findings of clinical evaluations and those of other diagnostic procedures are not consistent with each other, the objective clinical findings should have preference. The medical records should reasonably document the following: History of Present Injury Mechanism of injury: This includes details of symptom onset and progression, and symptoms that may arise from postural or functional accommodation to the hip/groin injury; Relationship to work: This includes a statement of the probability that the illnes s or injury is work -related; Prior occupational and non -occupational injuries: To the same area including specific prior treatment; Ability to perform job duties and activities of daily living; and , Exacerbating and alleviating factors for symptoms; not limited to the hip/groin. Past History NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 16 Past medical history includes, but is not limited to, neoplasm, gout, arthritis, and diabetes; Review of systems includes, but is not limited to, symptoms of rheumatologic, neurologic, endocrine, neoplastic, and other systemic diseases. If applicable this should also include GI and GU (noting any incontinence issues) as well as appropriate musculosk eletal areas; Smoking history; Vocational and recreational pursuits including history of barotrauma; Prior imaging studies; and Past surgical history. Physical Examination Examination of a joint should include the joint below the affected area, including the opposite side for comparison. Physical examination should include accepted tests and exam techniques applicable to the joint or area being examined, including: Visual inspection; Palpation; Range of motion/quality of motion (active and passive) including issues with abnormal internal or external rotation and clicking, popping or catching with range of motion; Strength (weakness/atrophy); Joint integrity/s tability; Examination for deformity/displacement including leg length discrepancy; If applicable to injury, integrity of distal circulation; If applicable, neurological exam (i.e: sensory and motor function, reflexes) as clinically indicated ; If applicable, assess for testicular tenderness or swelling; and/or NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 17 Assess gait and weight bearing status B.3 Red Flags Certain findings, \"red flags\", raise suspicion of potentially serious medical conditions. Assessment (history and physical examination) should include evaluation for red flags. In the hip/groin these findings or indicators may include: fracture, dislocatio ns, infection or inflammation, tumors, or systemic rheumatological disorders; and neurological compromise. Further evaluation/consultation or urgent/emergency intervention may be indicated, and the New York Hip/Groin Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines inc orporate changes in clinical management triggered by the presence of \"red flags.\" Table 1 . \"Red Flags\" for Potentially Serious Conditions Associated with Hip and Groin Pain* Disorder Medical History Physical Examination Tumor/ Neoplasia Severe localized pain (often deep -seated, unrelenting bony pain) History of cancer (at any point in the lifetime) Age >50 years Symptoms consistent with disease in a specific organ system (e.g., cough, change in bowel habit, epigastric pain, early satiety) Consti tutional symptoms, such as recent unexplained weight loss, fatigue Pain that continues at night or at rest Pallor, reduced blood pressure, diffuse weakness Tenderness over bony landmarks and percussion tenderness (other than greater trochanteric pain syndrome or groin strain) New mass or tenderness Abnormal pulmonary examination (crackles, wheezes, rhonchi, decreased breath sounds) New findings at a distant site to the original complaints Infection Constitutional symptoms, such as recent fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss Recent bacterial infection (e.g. urinary tract infection ) History of recurring infections treated with antibiotics (e.g., repeated urinary tract infections) Foreign travel with exposure potential Insect bite s Fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension Elevated white blood cell count (may be decreased in elderly or immunocompromised) Shift in the white blood cell differential towards immature cells (\"left shift\") Abnormal urinalysis Abnormal body part examinat ion (e.g., pulmonary) Tenderness over bony landmarks Progressive Neurologic Deficit Severe spine or extremity pain Progressive numbness or weakness Complaints of new clumsiness of gait Significant and progressive dermatomal and/or myotomal (motor) involvement Evidence of cauda equina Hyperreflexia or other evidence of myelopathy Rheumatologic Disease Diffuse arthralgias Prior arthropathy Skin changes, lesions, or ulcers Fatigue, malaise Subtle mental status changes Polyarticular joint effusions (usually with warmth) Radiographic abnormalities consistent with erosive or degenerative pathology Elevated sedimentation rate (ESR) or C - reactive protein (CRP) NYS MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 18 Hematuria, proteinu ria Other specific abnormalities as appropriate (e.g., ANA, RF, anti -DNA, C3, anti-Ro, anti -La, abnormalities) Testicular Torsion Acute onset testicular and groin pain Tenderness Loss of blood flow on ultrasound Ectopic Pregnancy Acute onset lower abdominal or groin pain Pregnancy test Vaginal ultrasound *This list is not meant to be comprehensive; rather, it is a review of the more common suggestive historical and examination findings. B.4 Diagnostic Testing and Testing Procedures One diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as obtained by other procedures . Therefore, prudent choice of procedure(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize adverse effect to patients and promote cost effectiveness by avoiding duplication or redundancy. All diagnostic imaging procedures have a significant percentage of specificity and sensitivity for various diagnoses. None is specifically characteristic of a certain diagnosis. Clinical informati on obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection and interpretation of imaging procedure results. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient informatio n to establish an accurate diagnosis, the second diagnostic procedure will be redundant if it is performed only for diagnostic purposes. At the same time, a subsequent diagnostic procedure (that may be a repeat of the same procedure, when the rehabilitati on physician, radiologist or surgeon documents that the study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis) can be a complementary diagnostic procedure if the first or preceding procedures, in conjunction with clinical information, cannot provide an accur ate diagnosis. Usually, preference of a procedure over others depends upon availability, a patient's tolerance, and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and ot her tests may be warranted by the clinical course and to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g. imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess o r stage the pathology when there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and therapeutic injections when warranted, and post -operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding CT examinations, it must be recognized that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 19 When indicated, the following studies can be utilized for further evaluation of Hip and Groin injuries, based upon the mechanism of injury, symptoms, and patient history . B.5 Diagnostic Criteria and Differential Diagnosis The history, physical examination, and radiographs will effectively diagnose most hip disorders. If the diagnosis of a hip and groin disorder remains unclear, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; with or without gadolinium) is generally the imaging method used to diagnose most other intraarticular and extraarticular pathologies . Other postoperative radiography, and magnetic resonance and CT arthrography. The treating provider performing an initial evaluation of a patient with hip or groin pain should seek a discrete explanatory diagnosis. A review of systems that also involve the knee, spine, abdomen, and genitourinary tract is necessary. The examination of a patient with hip or groin pain generally needs to focus on the hip joint and include relevant neig hboring structures similar to the review of systems. Potentially serious disorders include infections, tumors, or systemic rheumatological disorders. Table 2. Diagnostic Criteria for Non -\"Red Flag\" Conditions Probable Diagnosis or Injury Symptoms Signs Tests and Results Hip Osteoarthrosis Nonradiating hip pain. Morning stiffness or stiffness on standing after sitting <1 hour. Sleep disturbance sometimes present; mood disturbance usually not present. Often other affected joints.

Radiographs are usually ordered a nd often sufficient for diagnostic purposes. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 21 Hip Instability Dislocation may have occurred. May have subjective weakness. ROM may be increased and findings present for ligamentous laxity. Increased hip external rotation (in extension during log roll or in flexion such as the FABER maneuver). Radiographs are usually ordered. MRI may be helpful. Ligamentum Teres Ruptures May be asymptomatic or have experienced pain if there was a ligament tear with a discrete traumatic event. Event usually involved exaggerated adduction and external rotation or abduction. Exam is usually normal in the absence of other findings. May accompany osteoarthrosis; thus, those exam findings may be present. Radiographs are usually ordered. MRI may be helpful. Adapted from Rondinelli RD (Ed.).

Conditions This Guideline covers conditions: C.1 Hip Osteoarthrosis C.2 Disease C.5 Pre / Post-Operative including Hip C.8 Hamstring Hip Osteoarthrosis C.1.a Related Terms Arthritis Arthropathy Arthrosis Degenerative Arthritis Degenerative Degenerative Joint Disease Non-inflammatory Arthritis Osteoarthritis Osteoarthrosis Rheumatism C.1.b Introduction Hip degenerative joint disease (DJD) is most commonly caused by osteoarthrosis (OA). Although osteoarthritis is the more common name for this entity, osteoarthrosis is considered to be more technically precise because classic inflammation is absent . OA may develop in only one joint after a significant traumatic injury such as fracture, in which case it is often delayed by many years. The common pathway for hip OA involves sufficient destruction of the joint by various causes that may be indistinguishable on radiograph. Thus, the correct interpretation of findings consistent with possible OA on radiograph is usually degenerative joint disease, but not osteoarthrosis. C.1.c Diagnostic Studies C.1.c.i Antibodies to Assist in Diagnosing Hip Pain, Including Differentiating Inflammatory Rheumatic Di sorders From Hip Osteoarthrosis Recommended - in select patients with acute, subacute, chronic or postoperative hip pain. Indications : Undiagnosed patients with either systemic arthropathies and/or peripheral neuropathies, or patients with incomplete evaluations. Diagnostic testing should generally include sedimentation rate. Other tests may include rheumatoid factor, antinu clear antibody level, and others. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 23 Rationale : Rheumatoid panels are helpful in select circumstances to confirm inflammatory arthritides and are thus recommended for use among those with symptoms suggestive of possible rheumatoid disorders. Evidence for use of antibodies to assist in diagnosing hip pain C.1.c.ii C-Reactive Protein to Assist in Diagnosing Hip Pain, Including Differentiating Inflammatory Rheumatic Disorders From Hip Osteoarthrosis Recommended - in select patients with acute, subac ute, chronic or postoperative hip pain. Indications : Used as a non -specific inflammatory indicator. Undiagnosed patients with either systemic arthropathies and/or peripheral neuropathies, or patients with incomplete evaluations. Diagnostic testing should generally include sedimentation rate, which is also non -specific. Other tests may include rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody level . Rationale : Rheumatoid panels are helpful in select circumstances to confirm inflammatory arthri tides and are thus recommended for use among those with symptoms suggestive of possible rheumatoid disorders. Evidence for use of C-Reactive protein to assist in diagnosing hip pain C.1.c.iii Erythrocyte Sedimentation R ate to Assist in Diagnosing Hip Pain, Including Differentiating Inflammatory R heumatic Disorders From Hip Osteoarthrosis Recommended - in select patients with acute, subacute, chronic or postoperative hip pain. Indications : Used as a non -specfic indicator of inflammation. Undiagnosed patients with either systemic arthropathies and/or peripheral neuropathies, or patients with incomplete evaluations. Diagnostic testing should generally include sedimentation rate. Other tests may include rheumatoi d factor, antinuclear antibody level, and others. Rationale : Rheumatoid panels are helpful in select circumstances to confirm inflammatory arthritides and are thus recommended for use among those with symptoms suggestive of possible rheumatoid disorder s. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 24 Evidence for use of erythrocyte sedimentation rate to assist in diagnosing hip pain C.1.c.iv Other Non-Specific Inflammator y Markers to Assist in Diagnosing Hip Pain, Including Differentiating Inflammatory Rheumatic Disorders from Hip Osteoarthrosis Recommended - to assist in diagnosing acute, subacute, chronic and postoperative hip pain. Indications : Undiagnosed patients with either systemic arthropathies and/or peripheral neuropathies, or patients with incomplete evaluations. Diagnostic testing should gene rally include sedimentation rate. Other tests may include rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody level, and others. Rationale : Rheumatoid panels are helpful in select circumstances to confirm inflammatory arthritides and are thus recommended for use among those with symptoms suggestive of possible rheumatoid disorders. Evidence for use of other non -specific in flammatory markers to assist in diagnosing hip pain Evidence for the Use of Antibodies, C -Reactive Protein, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, Other Non -Specific Inflammatory Markers C.1.c.v Arthroscopic Examinations Have Been Used Primarily for Treatable Hip Disorders and Have Been Used to Diagnose Hip Osteoarthritis Not Recommended - to solely diagnosis hip oseoarthritis . Rationale : The diagnosis of hip OA is generally straightforward and does not necessitate or benefit from arthroscopy. Thus, arthroscopy is not recommended as a rout ine diagnostic procedure. Evidence for use of arthroscopic examination to diagnosis hip osteoarthritis C.1.c.vi Bone Scanning to Assist in the Diagnosis of Osteonecrosis, Neoplasms, or Other Conditions with Increased Polyosthotic Bone Metabolism Recommended - in select patients with acute, subacute or chronic hip pain to assist in the diagnosis of suspected metastases, primary bone tumors, infected bone NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 25 (osteomyelitis), inflammatory arthropathies, or trauma (ie. occult fractures ) Indications : Patients with hip pain with suspicion of osteonecrosis, suspected metastases, primary bone tumors, infected bone (osteomyelitis), inflammatory arthropathies, or trauma (ie. occult fractures). Frequency/Dose/Duration : One evaluation. A second evaluation may be indicated with a significant change in symptoms, generally after more than three months. Rationale: Bone scanning may be a helpful diagnostic test to evaluate suspected metastases, primary bone tumors, infected bone . (osteomyelitis), inflammatory arthropathies, or trauma (e.g., occult fractures). Bone scanning is generally not indicated for evaluation of hip OA. It may be helpful in patients with suspected early AVN, but without x -ray changes. In patients where the diagnosis is felt to be secure, there is not an indication for bone scanning because it does not alter treatment or management. Evidence for use of bone scans to diagnosis early osteonecrosis C.1.c.vii Computerized Tomography Scans for Routine Diagnosis of Hip OA Not Recommended - for diagnosis of hip OA . C.1.c.viii Computerized Tomography for Evaluation of Recurrent Post-Arthroplasty Dislocations Recommended - to evaluate recurrent/chronic post - arthroplasty dislocations. Indications: Recurrent dislocations after arthroplasty. Patients with a need for imaging but with contraindicatations for MRI. Benefits : Imaging to help explain dislocations and plan treatment. Frequency/Dose/Duration : One evaluation. A second evaluation is rarely needed. Rationale: Computerized tomography is considered to be superior to MRI for imaging of most hip abnormalities where advanced imaging of calcified structures is req uired. A contrast NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 26 CT is recommended for select use of recurrent dislocations after arthroplasty. Evidence for use of CT scans to evaluate recurrent post - arthroplasty dislocations C.1.c.ix Helical C omputerized Tomography (CT Scan) for Advanced Imaging of Bony Structures Recommended - for select patients with acute, subacute, or chronic hip pain for whom advanced imaging of bony structure is thought to be potentially helpful. Helical CT is also recommended for patients who need advanced imaging, but have contraindications for MRI . Indications: Patients with acute, subacute, or chronic hip pain who need advanced bony structure imaging. Patients needing advanced imaging, but with contraindications for MRI (e.g., implanted ferrous metal hardware ) are also candidates. Frequency/Dose/Duration : One evaluation. A second evaluation is rarely needed. Rationale: Helical CT scanning has been largely replaced by MRI. However, it has been thought to be superior to MRI for evaluating subchondral fractures, although a definit ive study has not been reported . In addition, for patients who have contraindications for MRI (e.g., implanted ferrous metal hardware ) but require evaluation of AVN, helical CT is recommended. Evidence for use of helical CT for advanced imaging of bony structures C.1.c.x Local Anesthetic Injections for Hip Pain Diagnosis Recommended - to assist in diagnosising the cause of hip pain. Indications: Moderate to severe hip pain of uncertain cause. Frequency/Dose/Duration : One injection. A second evaluation is rarely needed. Intraarticular hip injections with anesthetic agents are generally thought to be better if performed with a glucocorticosteroid as it generally accomplishes both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes simultaneously, although occasionally a simple anesthetic injection may be helpful in select cases. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 27 Rationale: Local anesthetic injections for diagnostic purposes are helpful for confirming a diagnostic impression, although there are no quality studies evaluating these injections for purposes of evaluating hip pain (for therapeutic injections, see Injec tions). Evidence for use of local anesthetic injections for hip pain diagnosis C.1.c.xi Electromyography, Including Nerve Conduction Studies, Have Been Used to Confirm Diagnostic Impressions of Other Peripheral Nerve Entrapments, Including the Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve to th e Thigh ( Meralgia Paresthetica) Recommended - in select patients to assist in the diagnosis of subacute or chronic pheripheral nerve entrapments, including lateral cutaneous nerve to thigh (meralgia paresthetica). Indications: Patients with subacute or chronic paresthesias with or without pain, pa rticularly if the diagnosis is unclear. Generally, should not be obtained for symptoms of under three weeks duration. Frequency/Dose/Duratio n: Generally, only obtained at presentation. If a diagnosis remains unclear, symptoms progress, or months have passed re-assessment may be indicated. Rationale : Electrodiagnostic studies may assist in confirming peripheral nerve entrapments, such as the lateral cutaneous nerve to the thigh. Evidence for the Use of Electromyography/Nerve Conduction C.1.c.xii Magnetic Resonance Imaging is Used as a Test for Select Hip Joint P roblems MRI is considered the imaging test of choice for soft tissues ,it is the gold standard for evaluating osteonecrosis after x -rays. Not Recommended - for routine evaluation of acute, subacute or chronic hip joint pathology, including degenerative joint diseas e. Recommended - for select hip joint pathology, particularly involving concerns regarding soft tissue pathology or with symptoms lasting more than three months. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 28 Rationale : MRI findings consistent with OA are likely to be particularly helpful for soft tissue abnormaliti es. MRI has been suggested for the evaluation of patients with symptoms lasting more than 3 months. Because there are concerns that MRI is inferior to MR arthrography, particularly for evaluating the labrum, MRI without arthrography is recommended for evaluating the joint but not the labrum. MRI is not recommended for routine hip imaging, but it is recommended for select hip joint pathology, particularly involving concerns regarding soft tissue pathology. Evidence for use of MRI for evaluation of hip joint pathology C.1.c.xiii Radiog raphs (X -Rays) to Diagnosis Hip O steoarthritis Recommended - to assist in diagnosing hip osteoarthritis. Indications : Nearly all patients with hip pain thought to potentially have hip OA. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Generally, only obtained once at presentation. Rationale : X-rays are helpful for the evaluation of hip OA and to diagnose hip OA. Evidence for use of radiographs to diagnosis hip osteoarthritis C.1.c.xiv Ultrasound to Diagnose Hip OA Not Recommended - to diagnose hip OA . Rationale: There is no clear indication for the use of ultrasound to evaluate osteoarthrosis. Evidence for use of ultrasound to diagnose hip OA C.1.d M edications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. NYS WCB MTG Disorders 29 C.1.d.i Non-Steroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Hip OA Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute or chronic hip OA . Indications - For acute, subacute or chronic hip OA, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tr ied first. Frequency/Duration: As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of hip OA pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.1.d.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Ris k of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be s ubstantial differences in efficacy , between the agents for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding . Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.1.d.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Recommended - Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 30 Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the saf est regarding cardiovascular adverse effects . Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low - dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize t he potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.1.d.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Hip OA Pain Recommended - for treatment of hip O A pain, particularly in patients with contraindicati ons for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with hip OA pain, including acute, subacute or chronic. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. C.1.d.v Topical NSAIDs for Treatment of Acute, Subacute or Chronic Hip OA Recommended - for acute, subacute or chronic hip OA. Indications : For most patients, oral medications are recommended. However, for those with contraindications for oral NSAIDs or intolerance, topical NSAIDs may be a reasonable alternative. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Per manufacturer's recommendations. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of hip OA pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.1.d.vi Norepinephrine Inhibiting Anti -depressants Not Recommended - for the treatment of pain associated with hip osteoarthrosis . NYS WCB MTG - Hip Selective Serotonin Reuptake I nhibitors (SSRIs) Not Recommended - for treatment of pain associated with hip osteoarthrosis . C.1.d.viii Anti-Convulsant A gents for Hip OA Not - for hip OA pain patients . C.1.d.ix Gabapentin for Peri-Operative Pain Relief and Opioid - Sparing After Total Hip A rthroplasty. Recommended - for treatment of perioperative pain and to reduce the need for opioids post operatively. Indications: Perioperative use, e.g., arthroplasty . Frequency/Dose/Duration: Limited use to immediate peri - operative period, usually a few days. Indications for Discontinuation: Completion of course, sufficient recovery, resolution of pain, intolerance, adverse effects . C.1.d.x Opioids for Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Hip Pain Not Recommended - for acute, subacute, or chronic hip pain . C.1.d.xi Skeletal Muscle Relaxants Not Recommended - for acute and subacute, moderate to severe hip pain . Evidence for the use of Skeletal Muscle Relaxants C.1.d.xii Capsicum Recommended - for short -term treatment of acute or subacute hip pain as well as for acute exacerbations of chonic hip pain as a counterirritant. Indications: Temporary flare ups of chronic hip pain or acute or subacute hip pain. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Duration of use for patients with chronic pain is limited to an acute flare -up period, generally lasting no more than 2 weeks. Caution should be exerted to avoid application near the genitals. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 32 Indications for Discontin uation: Resolution of pain, completion of a cou rse, intolerance, other adverse effects. Evidence for the use of Capsicum C.1.d.xiii Lidocaine Patches Not Recommended - to treat hip OA pain . Evidence for the Use of Lidocaine Patches C.1.d.xiv Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthestics (EMLA) Not Recommended - to treat hip OA Pain . C.1.d.xv Glucosamine Sulfate, Chondroitin Sulfate and/or Methylsulfonylmethane Not Recommended - for the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis . Evidence for the Use of Glucosamine C.1.d.xv Complementary or Alternative Treatments or Dietary Supplements Not Recommended - for the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis . C.1.e Treatments C.1.e.i Cryotherapy / Heat C.1.e.i.a - for Acute, Subacute, or Chronic hip OA, as well as for hip arthroplasty and surgery patients. Frequency/Duration : Approximately three to five self-applications per day as needed. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution, adverse effects, non -compliance. C.1.e.i.b Heat Therapy Recommended - for acute, subacute or chronic hip OA. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 33 Frequency/Duration : Approximately three to five self-applications per day as needed. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution, adverse effects, non -compliance. C.1.e.i.c Diathermy Not Recommended - for the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis or for patients with acute, subacute or chronic hip pain. C.1.e.i.d Infrared Therapy Not Recommended for treatment of hip osteoarthrosis or for patients with acute, subacute or chronic hip pain . C.1.e.i.e Ultrasound Treatment Not Recommended for treatment of hip osteoarthrosis or for patients with acute, subacute or chronic hip pain. C.1.e.i.f Low Level Laser Therapy Not Recommended - for the treatment of osteoarthrosis or acute, subacute or chronic hip pain. C.1.e.i.g Self-Application of Heat T herapy Recommended - for the treatment of osteoarthrosis Indications: Hip OA and patients desiring to use non-medicinal treatments. Others may benefit as well. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Applications may be periodic or continuous. Applications should be home -based as there is no evidence for efficacy of provider -based heat treatments. Primary emphasis should generally be on functional restoration program elements, rather than on passive treatments in patients with chroni c pain. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 34 Indications for Discontinuation: Intolerance, increased pain, development of a burn, other adverse event. Evidence for the use of low -tech heat therapy C.1.f Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work - related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury status in so far as is feasibl e. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivere d by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The patient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.1.f .i Therapeutic Exercises - Physical / Occupational Therapy Recommended - strengthening exercises for treatment of hip OA. Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing f unctional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilita tion plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. C.1.f .ii Walking Aid: Cane / Crutches / Walker NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 35 Recommended - for select moderate to severe acute hip or groin pain or subacute and chronic hip or groin p ain. Indications : Disabling, moderate to severe chronic hip OA where risks of increasing debility are outweighed by device use that increases mobility. Benefits : Improve mobility, walking distance. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution (e.g., post -operative recovery) . Rationale: For acute injuries, crutches and canes may be helpful during the recovery and/or rehabilitative phase to increase functional status (e.g., from wheelchair to walker to cane ). For chronic hip pain, cr utches may paradoxically increase disability through debility. In those circumstances, institution or maintenance of advice for use of crutches or canes should be carefully considered against potential risks. Evidence for use of Canes and Crutches C.1.f .iii Orthotics, Shoe Insoles and Shoe Lifts Recommended - for patients with significant leg discrepancy and hip pain felt to be a consequence of that discrepancy . Indications: Significant leg length discrepancy (usually at least 2cm), with hip pain or another adverse health attribute thought to be related to the discrepant length. Indications for Discontinuation: Lack of efficacy . Rationale: They are recommended for select patients with significant leg length discrepancies felt to be producing or contributing to symptoms. Evidence: for Orthotics, Shoe Insoles and Shoe Lifts C.1.f.iv Magnets and Magnetic Stimulation Not Recommended -for treatment of osteoarthrosis or acute, subacute or chronic hip pain . C.1.f.v Manipulation or Mobili zation Not Recommended for treatment of hip osteoarthrosis . Evidence for the Use of Manipulation or Mobilization NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 36 C.1.f.vi Massage Not Recommended - for treatment of hip osteoarthrosis . Evidence for the use of Massage C.1.f.vii Reflexology Not Recommended - for treatment of hip osteoarthrosis or acute, subacute or chronic hip pain . Evidence for the Use of Reflexology C.1.f.viii Electrical Therapies Not Recommended - for the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis or acute, subacute or chronic hip pain. Evidence for the Use of Electrical Stimulation Therapies Not Recommended - for hip osteoarthrosis or acute, subacute or chronic hip pain. Evidence for the Use of Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation (TENS) C.1.f.ix Acupuncture Recommended -- for select patients in the treatment of chronic osteoarthrosis of the hip as an adjunct to more efficacious treatments . Indications: Moderate to severe chronic osteoarthrosis of the hip. Prior treatments should include NSAIDs, weight loss, and exercise including a graded walking program and str engthening exercises. Frequency/Dose/Duration: A limited course of six appointments with a clear objective and functional goals to be achieved. Additional appointments would require documented functional benefits, lack of plateau in measures and probability of obtaining further benefits. Additional sets of six appointments should only occur based on documented incremental functional gain. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution, intolerance, non -compliance including non - compliance with aerobic and strengthening exercises. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 37 Evidence for the Use of Acupuncture C.1.f.x Pre-Operative Exercise Recommended - for patients who exhibit evidence of weakness or unsteady gait. Flexibility components may be reasonable in those without fixed deficits . Indications: All arthroplasty patients may benefit, but particularly those with weakness or unsteady gait. Also particularly helpful for those needing supervised encouragement. Benefits: Improved speed of post -operative recovery. Potential for improved long -term results. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One pre -operative course . Two or three follow -up appointments for a dherence and additional exercise instruction may be needed for select patients. Patients with severe deficits may require two to three appointments a week for four to six weeks in advance of arthroplasty. Those with minimal deficits may benefit from a sing le appointment to teach programmatic elements for a self -directed program. Indications for Discontinuation: Achievement of program goals, resolution of strength or gait deficits, intolerance or non - compliance. Evidence for the Use of Pre - and Post -Operative Rehabilitation Programs C.1.f.xi Post -Operative Exercise and/or Rehabili tation Program Recommended - for hip arthroplasty surgery patients. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Duration based primarily on progress. Two or three times weekly in outpatient settings gradually tapered as home exercises are instituted and the patient's recovery advances. Courses of up to three months in more severe cases may be required. Indications for Discontinuation : Attainment of goals, achievement of plateau, non -compliance. Evidence for the Use of Post -Operative Exercise and/or Rehabilitation Programs C.1.f.xii Late Post Op erative Exercise Program After Art hroplasty or Hip Fracture NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 38 Recommended - for patients who exhibit significant evidence of weakness or unsteady gait. Indications: Ongoing significant deficits in function, gait, strength, and activity level beyond 3 months post -operatively. Indications for Discontinuation: Lack of progressive functional gain. Evidence for the Use of Late Post -Operative Exercises C.1.g Injection Therapy C.1.g .i Intraarticular Glucocorticosteroid Injections Recommended - for the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis . Indications: Hip OA pain where control with NSAID(s), acetaminophen, weight loss and exercise is unsatisfactory. Frequency/Dose/Duration: An injection should be adminstered and the results evaluated. Indications for Discontinuation: Generally one injection is performed. A second injection may be considered if there is improvement (increased function and decreased pain) that is incomplete. Evidence for the Use of Intraarticular Glucocorticosteroid Injections C.1.g .ii Intraarticular Hip Viscosupplementation Injections Not Recommende d - for the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis . Evidence for the Use of Intraarticular Hip Viscosupplementation Injections C.1.g .iii Intraarticular Platelet -Rich Plasma Injections Not Recommended - for the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis . Evidence for the Use of Platelet -Rich Plasma C.1.g .iv Prolotherapy Injections Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute or chronic hip pain. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 39 Evidence for the use of Prolotherapy C.1.g .v Botulinum Injections Not Recommended - for hip osteoarthrosis or other hip disorders . Evidence for the use of Botulinum Injections C.1.g .vi Glucosamine Sulfate Intra -Muscular Injections Not Recommen ded - for the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis . Evidence for the use of glucosamine sulfate intra -muscular injections C.1.g .vii Glucosamine Sulfate Intra -Articular Inj ections Not Recommended - for the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis . Evidence for use of glucosamine sulfate intra -articular injections C.1.h Surgery C.1.h .i Hip Arthroplasty Recommended - for severe arthritides, osteonecrosis with collapse or insufficient response to non -operative treatment, or substantially symptomatic hip dysplasia. Evidence for the Use of Hip Arthroplasty C.1.h .ii Osteotomy Recommended - for the treatment of hip osteoarthrosis in select patients. Indications: Indications include significant alignment abnormalities, dysplasia, osteonecrosis, nonunion of femoral neck fracture, slipped capital femoral epiphyses, and cox vara. Generally performed on younger patients in preference to arthroplasty. Rationale : For selective patients in the absence of other proven treatment for many of these advanced conditions . NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 40 Evidence for the Use of Osteotomy C.1.h .iii Post Operative Exercise and Rehabili tation Program Recommended - for hip arthroplasty surgery patients . C.1.h .iv Post Operative Assistive Devices - Walking aid, ADL Adaptive equipment (e.g. long -handled reacher or shoe horn or sock aid, elevated toilet seat) . Recommended - as needed post -operatively . C.1.h .v Treatment of Infected Prosthesis Recommended - an infected prosthesis is a serious outcome that usuall y requires surgical debridement, drainage and appropriate antibiotics . Treatment frequently necessitates prolonged IV antibiotics and may require removal of implanted hardware. C.1.h .vi Treatment of Dislocations Recommended - referral back to the treating surgeon, as appropriate, to reduce dislocation and incidence of recurrence. C.2 Hip Osteonecrosis C.2.a Related Terms Death C.2.b Introduction Osteonecrosis (aka, avascular necrosis) involves bone death . Some cases are considered occupational disorders, particularly in the setting of dysbarism (atmospheric compression/decompression) workers including divers and other workers in compressed air atmospheres who experience impaired blood supply to the femur du e to nitrogen gas in the blood during excessively rapid decompression. Major trauma is another reported cause. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 41 Significant, d iscrete trauma is thought to be a risk factor. However, nontraumatic job physical factors are controversial. Treatment is primari ly based on alleviating the exposure(s) thought to be responsible. A surgical \"coring\" procdedure, vascularized and unvascularized bone grafting, and osteotomy are sometimes utilized. Severe cases may require arthroplasty. C.2.c Diagnostic Studies Initial Assessment The history, physical, and radiographs effectively diagnose most hip disorders. Review of systems and examinations also should involve the knee, spine, abdomen, and genitourinary tract. Osteonecrosis is most commonly diagnosed on imagin g studies. If the diagnosis of hip pain remains unclear after radiographs , magnetic resonance imaging (MRI with or without gadolinium etc.) is generally the imaging of choice. The criteria presented below is an overview of the clinical thought process for evaluation of hip osteonecrosis. Diagnostic Criteria for Non -Red-Flag Conditions Probable Diagnosis or Injury Symptoms Signs Tests and Results Osteonecrosis Non-radiating hip pain. History of systemic factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, alcohol) Reduced ROM and pain with passive ROM usually present. May have pain with weight bearing. May be unable to bear weight if osseous collapse has occurred. Radiographs required. MRI and CT may be ordered for further evaluation of the femoral head. C.2.c.i Bone Scanning with SPECT Recommended - for select use in patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain to assist in the diagnosis of osteonecrosis and other conditions with increased polyosthotic bone metabolism, particulary when more than one join t needs evaluation . Indication / Rationale: Bone scanning is helpful to identify areas of increased bone metabolism; thus its primary use is for osteonecrosis cases. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One evaluation . Evidence for the Use of Bone Scans NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 42 C.2.c.ii CT for Evaluating Osteonecrosis Recommended - for evaluating patients with osteonecrosis, including patients who need advanced imaging, but have contraindications for MRI or where helical CT is unavailable . Indications: Hip pain thought to be from osteonecrosis, but with contraindications for MRI. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Generally, one evaluation. A second may be nee ded if there is a significant clinical change or to evaluate progress/resolution. Rationale: Computerized tomography is considered superior to MRI for imaging of most hip abnormalities where advanced imaging of calcified structures is required. For oste onecrosis, there is no clear preference of CT over MRI. However, helical CT is generally thought to be preferable to CT for identification of fracturing and thus use of CT is limited, including those settings without helical CT. Evidence for the Use of Computerized Tomography (CT) Scan C.2.c.iii Helical CT for Evaluating Osteonecrosis Recommended - for evaluating patients with osteonecrosis who have contraindications for MRI . Indications: Hip pain thought to b e from osteonecrosis, especially with concerns about fracturing and collapse. Also indicated for those needing evaluation of osteonecrosis but with contraindications for MRI. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Generally, one evaluation. A second may be needed if there is a significant clinical change or for evaluating progress/resolution. Rationale: Helical CT is considered superior to MRI for imaging of most hip abnormalities where advanced imaging of calcified struct ures is required. For osteonecrosis, there is no clear preference of CT over MRI. Helical CT is thought to be better than CT at identifying fracturing and is therefore recommended for select use. Evidence for use of Helical CT NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 43 C.2.c .iv MRI for Diagnosing Osteonecrosis Recommended - for subacute or chronic hip pain thought to be due to osteonecrosis particularly when the diagnosis is unclear or if additional diagnostic evaluation and/or staging is needed. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Generally one evaluation. A second may be needed if there is a significant clinical change or need to evaluate progress/resolution. Rationale: Helical computerized tomography is considered superior to MRI for imaging bone collapse. MRI is considered superior for imaging bone marrow edema, whi ch is inversely correlated with prognosis. Thus, both tests have their advantages. Evidence for the Use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) C.2.c.v X-Rays for Diagnosing Osteonecrosis Recommended - for all patients thought to have osteonocrosis . Frequency/Dose/Duration : Periodically obtaining x -rays to follow the course of the disease is customary. Rationale : X-rays are helpful to evaluate most patients with hip pain, both to diagnose and to assist with the differential diagnostic possibilities. Early stage osteonecrosis x -rays may be normal or show slight osteopenia. A high index of suspicion is necessary. Evidence for the Use of X -rays/Radiographs C.2.c.vi Ultrasound for Osteonecrosis Not Recommended - for diagnosing osteonecrosis . C.2.d Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. NYS WCB MTG Disorders 44 C.2.d.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment o f Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Osteonecrosis Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic osteonecrosis Indications - For acute, subacute, or chronic osteonecrosis , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over - the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of osteonecrosis , lack of e fficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.2.d.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - for concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histami ne Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding . Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.2.d.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse effects . NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 45 Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred ove r COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low - dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minute s after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.2.d.iv Aetaminophen for Treatment of Osteonecrosis Pain Recommended - for treatment of osteonecrosis pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with osteonecrosis pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommenda tions; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. C.2.d.v Opioids Recommended - for limited use ( maximum of seven days) as adjunctive therapy for NSAIDs . Indications - For pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatments (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen) is often required, especially nocturnally . Freque ncy/Duration - Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely . Rationale for Recommendation - some patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particu larly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use, primarily used at night to achieve sleep. C.2.d.vi Bisphosphonates Not Recommended - for treatment of Anti-Convulsant Agents (including Topriamate) NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 46 Not Recommended for treatment of pain associated with osteonecrosis . C.2.d.viii Gabapentin and Pregabalin Not Recommended for pain associated with osteonecrosis . Evidence for use of gabapentin and pregabalin for osteonecrosis C.2.d.ix Glucocorticosteroids Not Recommended - for the treatment of osteonecrosis . Evidence for use of glococorticosteroids for treatment of osteonecrosis C.2.e Treatments The early treatment focus for mild to moderate cases of osteonecrosis is to identify and treat reversible risk factors. Reduction or elimination of activities that significantly provoke symptoms including avoidance of dysbaric exposures is recommended. Mod erately severe or severe cases generally receive prompt surgical treatment, especially if collapse has occurred. C.2.e.i Initial Care Assessing disease severity i s the first step for osteonecrosis evaluation. Elimination of decompression atmospheres is a prominent early intervention. Nonprescription analgesics may provide sufficient pain relief for most patients with hip pain from osteonecrosis. If either the condition is progressing and/or disease severity is more advanced, surgical intervention is indicated. The primary activity of concern for acute and subacute cases of osteonecrosis is de/compression. Patients with osteonecrosis should not generally undergo any de/compression atmospheres until the condition is resolved. High force and/or high impact force (e.g., jumping) should generally be precluded in patients presenting with osteonecrosis (especially those with more severe disease at risk of collapse) until the condition is either substantially improved or resolved. Regardless of phase of the osteo necrosis (acute, subacute, chronic), adherence to decompression tables is highly advisable. C.2.e.ii Surgery NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 47 C.2.e.ii.a Core Decompression Surgery Recommended - for the treatment of osteonecrosis . Indications : Patients with generally moderate to severe osteonecrosis either (i) not responding to risk factor modification and/or (ii) felt to be at risk of collapse and further delay while treating risk factors or with hyperbaric oxygen is felt to be too risky. Evidence for the Use of Core Decompression C.2.e.ii.b Arthroplasty for Osteonecrosis Recommended - for the treatment of osteonecrosis with collapse or severe disease unresponsive to non -operative treatment . Indications : Patients with collapse of the femoral head are immediate candidates for arthroplasty. Additional candidates include those with s evere osteonecrosis who are: (i) unresponsive to risk factor modification, and/or (ii) felt to be at risk of immediate collapse. Rationale: Once the head of the femur collapses, the treatment is usually arthroplasty . Evidence for the Use of Arthroplasty Surgery C.2.f Other Treatments C.2.f.i Dysbaric Exposures or Other Symptom -Providing Activities or Other Risk Factors Recommended - reduction or elimination of activities that are significant risks for osteonecrosis, including avoi dance of dysbaric exposures. C.2.f .ii Non-Weight Bearing Activities Not Recommended - for patients with osteonecrosis. C.2.f .iii Hyper baric Oxygen Recommended - for treatment of osteonecrosis . NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 48 Indications: Osteonecrosis Ficat Stage 2. It may be reasonable to attempt HBO in patients with more severe osteonecrosis. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Up to 30 treatments . Indications for D iscontinuation: Completion of course, intolerance, clinical resolution, osteonecrosis collapse . Evidence for the Use of Hyperbaric Oxygen C.3 Hip Fractures C.3.a Overview Hip fractures include both frank and stress fractures. Occupational fractures most commonly result from falls or motor vehicle accidents. Stress fractures most typically involve repeated applications of unaccustomed force over a relatively shor t interval of hours to days. These are usually treated with elimination of the offending exposure and observation . Physical therapy to address movement system impairments, such as muscle performance and motor patterns, may assist in reducing forces on the affected site. C.3.b Related Terms Fracture Stress Fracture Hip Fracture Femoral Fracture Femoral Neck Fracture Intracapsular Fracture Intertrochanteric Fracture Subtrochanteric Acetabular Fracture C.3.c Initial Assessment The initial ev aluation of a pati ent with potential occupational hip fracture is generally straightforward as the history, mechanism of injury and inability to use the hip provide strong diagnostic evidence. Review of systems that also involve the knee, spine, abdomen, and genitourinary tract is necessary . C.3.d Diagnostic Criteria The criteria presented below is an overview of the clinical thought process for evaluation of typical occupational hip fractures. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 49 Diagnostic Criteria for Non -red-flag Conditions Hip Fracture Fall or motor vehicle accident. Severe pain. Unable to bear weight. Unable to bear weight. Lower extremity shortened and externally rotated. X-rays required. Bone scan or CT scan may be indicated after plain film if there is a high index of suspicion of fracture C.3.e Diagnostic Studies C.3.e.i Bone Scan Recommended - for use in select patient with acute, subacute or chronic hip pain to assist in the diagnosis of fractures. Indications: Patients with hip fractures also with suspicion of osteonecrosis, Paget's disease, neoplasm, or other increased polyosthotic bone metabolism. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One scan. Rarely, a second scan may be indicated after passage of at least three months and a clinically meaningful change in symptoms and signs that beget a material change in the diagnosis. Rationale: Bone scanning may be a helpful diagnostic test to evaluate trauma (e.g., occult fractures). Bone scanning is generally not indicated for evaluation of hip OA. In patients where the diagnosis is felt to be secure, there is not an indication for bone scanning as it does not alter treatment or management. Evidence for the use of Bone Scans C.3.e.ii Computerized Tomography (CT) Recommended - for evaluating hip fracture patients with concerns for osteonecrosis or following traumatic dislocations or arthroplasty -associated recurrent dislocations. CT is also recommended for patients who need advanced imaging but have contraindications for MRI . Indications: Hip fracture patients with pain from osteonecrosis with suspicion of subchondral fracture(s), increased polyosthotic bone metabolism, or traumatic hip dislocations, particularly when acetabular or femoral head fracture fragments are sought; arthroplasty -associ ated recurrent hip dislocations to evaluate the rotational alignment (anteversion) of the NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 50 acetabular and femoral components; patients with contraindications for MRI. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One evaluation. A second evaluation is rarely needed. Ration ale: Computerized tomography is considered superior to MRI for imaging of most hip abnormalities where advanced imaging of calcified structures is required. Evidence for the use of Computerized Tomography (CT) C.3.e.iii Helical CT Scan Recommended - for select patients for evaluating hip fractures thought to potentially have osteonecrosis or have need for advanced bone imaging, but who have contraindications for MRI (implanted hardware). Indications: Patients with hip fracture who are thought to have osteonecrosis, or have need of advanced bone imaging, but who have contraindications for MRI. Helical CT is generally helpful for vascular co ncerns , reduces motion artifact and speeds scanning time. Frequency/Dose/Duration: One evaluation. A second evaluation is rarely needed. Rationale: Helical CT scanning has been largely replaced by MRI. However, it has been thought to be superior to MRI for evaluating subchondral fractures. In addition, there are patients who have contraindications for MRI (e.g., implanted ferrous metal hardware ), and in those patients who require evaluation of AVN, helical CT is recommended. Evidence for the use of Helical CT for Evaluating Hip Fracture with suspected Osteonecrosis C.3.e.iv Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Recommended - for select hip fracture patients who also have subacute or chronic hip pain with consideration of accompanying soft tissue pathology or other diagnostic concerns. Indications: Patients with subacute or chronic hip pain who need imaging surrounding soft tissues, including e valuating periarticular structures or masses (generally not indicated for acute hip pain as radiographs usually suffice ). NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 51 Frequency/Dose/Duration: Generally, only one examination should be required. A second evaluation is rarely needed. Rationale: MRI has been suggested for evaluations of patients with symptoms over 3 months. Evidence for the Use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) C.3.e.v Radiographs Recommended - for evaluating hip fractures . Indications: All patients with potential hip fractures. Also i n the absence of red flags with moderate to severe hip pain lasting at least a few weeks, and/or limited range of motion. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Obtaining x -rays once is generally sufficient. For pat ients with chronic or progressive hip pain, it may be reasonable to obtain a second set of x -rays, particularly if symptoms change. Evidence for the Use of Radiography (X -ray) for evaluating hip fractures C.3.e.vi Ultrasound Not Recommended - for evaluating hip fracture patients . Evidence for the Use of Ultrasound (US) for evaluating hip fracture patients C.3.f Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSA IDs, although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.3.f.i Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Recommended - for treatment of pain associated with hip fracture . NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 52 Indications : For treatment of pain associated with hip fractures , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discon tinuation. C.3.f.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Ris k of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommende d - concomminent use of cytoprotective sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at h igh risk fo r gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s - For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patie nts include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding . Indications for Discontinuation - Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.3.f.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse effects . Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low - dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 53 prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at l east 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.3.f.i v Acetaminophen for Treatment of Hip Pain Recommended - for treatment of pain associated with hip fracture , particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with hip fracture pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding fou r gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. C.3.f.v Bisphosphonates Recommended - for select patients with osteopenia -related hip fractures. Indications: Patients with hip fractures thought to be d ue to osteoporosis or osteopenia to prevent additional fractures. Benefits: Increased bone mineral density. Reduced risk of secondary fractures. Frequency/Dose/Duration: As per manufacturer recommendations. Evidence for the Use of Bisphosphonates C.3.f.v i Calcitonin Not Recommended - for hip fracture patients. Evidence for the Use of Calcitonin C.3.f.vi i Opioids Recommended - for treatment of s elect patients with post - operative hip fractures . NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 54 Indications - For post -operative hip fractures , a brief course of a few days to not more than one week of an opioid is recommended for treatment. Opioids may be helpful for brief nocturnal use after surgery. For other hip fracture patients, opioids are not recommended. Most patients should attempt pain control with NSAIDs/acetaminophen prior to opioids. Discontinuation of opioids as early as possible is recommended. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Generally, patients require no more than a few days to not more than one week of treatment with opioids for mos t hip surgeries. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of hip fracture pain, sufficient control with other medications, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.3.g Treatments C.3.g.i Hot and Cold Therapies C.3.g.i .a Cryotherapy for Acute, Subacute, Chronic, or Post -operative Hip Pain Recommended - for acute, subacute, chronic, or post-operative hip pain . Indications - All patients with hip pain . Frequency/Duration - Approximately three to five self-applications per day as needed.

NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 55 Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution, adverse effects, non -compliance. C.3.g.ii Surg ery C.3.g.ii.a Surgical Intervention for Hip Fracture Recommended - as soon as the patient is medica lly stable. Indications: Hip fractures . Rationale: There are many different surgical approaches and products used for fixation. The type of surgical treatment (e.g., pin, screw, nail) or non-operative management is deferred to the treating surgeon. Evidence for the Use of Surgical Treatment for Hip Fractures C.3.g.ii.b Arthroplasty for Hip Fractures Recommended - especially for patients with displaced femoral neck and subcapital fractures . Evidence for the Use of Total Hip Arthroplasty C.3.g.ii.c Hemiarthroplasty Recommended - for patients with displaced femoral neck and subcapital fractures . Indications: Hip fractures, especially displaced femoral neck and subcapital fractures. Evidence for the Use of Hemiarthroplasty C.3.g.ii.d Systemic Antibiotics Recommended - for patients undergoing hip surgery; typically one day use . Evidence for the Use of Antibiotics for Hip Surgery NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 56 Recommended - for patient undergoing hip surgery, especially with prothesis. Indications: Systemic prophylatic antibiotics are considered mandatory and have been long utilized. Benefits: Reduced risk of joint or prosthetic infection. Evidence for the Use of Antibiotics Recommended - for wo und infection management (post operative complications) . Indications : For management of post operative complications and for recurrent infections. C.3.g.ii.e Treatment of Infected Prosthesis Recommended - an infected prosthesis is a serious outcome that usually requires surgical debridement, drainage and appropriate antibiotics. Treatment frequently necessitates prolonged IV antibiotics and may require removal of implanted hardware. C.3.g.ii.f Treatme nt of Dislocations Recommended - referral back to the treating surgeon, as appropriate, to reduce dislocation and incidence of recurrence. C.3.h Other C.3.h.i Acupuncture Recommended - after hip arthroplasty procedures . Indications: Hip arthroplasty patients. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Up to three post-operative days. Rationale: Two quality trials demonstrated efficacy of acupuncture for hip arthroplasty patients, including reducing opioid needs. Evidence for the Use of Acupuncture for Hip Arthroplasty NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders Thromboembolic Disease C.4.a Introduction Venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) is a high -risk complication among post -operative hip or knee arthroplasty patients resulting in morbidity and mortality. C.4.b Medications C.4.b.i Low-Molecular Weight Heparin Recommended disease . Indications: Post-operative arthroplasty patients, hip fracture patients and other major hip surgery patients, particularly those with either prolonged inactivity or prolonged reduced or sedentary acti vity levels. Patients with prior reactions to LMWH should generally receive other treatments first. Frequency/Dose/Duration: There is no consensus on duration of treatment, and individualization based on activity level appears indicated. Indication s for Discontinuation: Development of major complication (e.g., major bleeding) or other adverse effect. Rationale: Generally, major bleeding is the most significant adverse effect of most of the medications used to prevent VTED. Evidence for the Use of Low -Molecular Weight Heparin C.4.b.ii Factor Xa Inhibitors Recommended - venous thromboembolic disease . Indications: Post-operative arthroplasty patients, hip fracture patients, or other major hip surgery patients, particularly those with prolonged inactivity or prolonged reduced or sedentary activity levels. Patients with prior reactions should generally receive other treatments first. Patients with renal failure or renal insufficiency should generally receive a different medication due to renal excretion of this compound. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 58 Evidence for the Use of Factor Xa Inhibitors C.4.b.iii Warfarin and Heparin Recommended disease . Indications: Post-operative arthroplasty patients, hip fracture patients and other major hip surgery patients. Harms: Increased risk of bleeding. Risk of intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeds of particular concern, however, somewhat less concerning than some othe r treatment options as the treatment is more readily reversible than with low molecular weight heparins or Factor Xa inhibitors. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Subcutaneous injections of Heparin, which can be titrated to the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Warfarin dose titrated to International Normalized Ratio (INR ). Evidence for the Use of Warfarin and Heparin C.4.b.iv Aspirin Recommended - for deep venous thrombosis . Indications: Post-operative arthroplasty patients, hip fracture patients and other major hip surgery patients, generally after cessation of other treatments such as LMWH, heparin, or other anticoagulants. Evidence for the Use of Aspirin C.4.c Treatments C.4.c.i Devices C.4.c.i.a Compression Stockings Recommended - for prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Disease . Indications: All post -operative hip surgery patients (e.g., hip fractures, hip arthroplasties, or any other patients thought at increased risk of VTED in the post-operative period). NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 59 Indications for Discontinuation: One-month post- operative and/or resumption of all normal activities and activity levels. Use beyond four weeks is indicated for those who have not resumed normal activitie s. Evidence for the Use of Compression Stockings C.4.c.i.b Lower Extremity Pumps Recommended - for prevention of venous thromboembolic disease . Indications: Post-operative major hip surgical patients (e.g., hip fractures, hip arthroplasties, or any other patients thought at increased risk of VTED in the post -operative period). Frequency/Dose/Duration: Devices include foot pumps, foot plus calf pumps, entire lower extremity intermittent compression devices and various other combinations. Indications for Discontinuation: Discontinuation is generally recommended by 14 days unles s there are continuing ongoing issues, such as delayed rehabilitation and ambulation , that result in a judgment of increased risk. Evidence for the Use of Lower Ext remity Pumps C.5 Pre- and Post -Operative Rehabili tation , Including Hip Arthroplasty and Hip Fractures C.5.a Introduction Although there is probably overlap with characteristics and needs of arthroplasty patients, mobilization and exercises after hip fracture may differ somewhat and are considered separately below. C.5.b Treatments Therapy Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work - related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 60 meet th e patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therap ies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.5.b.i Post -Operative Ex ercise and Reh abiliation Program Recommended - for hip fracture patients . Indications: All hip fracture patients. Programs need to be individualized, based on factors such as preoperative condition, bone quality, immediate surgical results, contraindications, and other medical conditions. Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. Evidence for the Use of Post -Operative Exercise and Rehabilitatio n NYS WCB MTG Im pingement\" or Labral Tears C.6.a Introduction The criteria presented below is an overview of the clinical thought process for evaluation of femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears . Diagnostic Criteria for Non -Red Flag Conditions Labral Tears Nonradiating groin pain with ROM. Typically provoked with specific, predictable activities, such as specific position(s). May have buckling, clicking, catching. Pain may be worse with pivoting and walking. Variable findings; pain reproducible on ROM. Extent of ROM often restricted . Pain reproduced with hip into extension from flexion. Pain with hyperflexion, internal rotation, and adduction (impingement position) is present in most cases. Pain and/or click may also be reproduced with the labral stress test and/or wi th resisted straight leg raise. Radiographs are often ordered. MRI is sometimes ordered, and MR arthrography is often h elpful. Femoroaceta bular Impingement Nonradiating groin pain. Pain is often positional and worse with activity. Pain with hip flexion an d internal rotation. Decreased internal rotation and adduction with hip flexed to 90 degrees. Positive impingement test (pain with passive adduction and gradually internally rotating the flexed hip). Radiographs usually ordered. MRI and MR arthrography helpful. C.6.b Diagnostic Studies C.6.b.i MR Arthrogram Recommended - for diagnosing femoracetabular impingement or labral tears in patients with subacute or chronic hip pain. Indications: Patients with subacute or chronic hip pain and symptoms or clinical suspicion of femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, or other hip joint concerns. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Generally one arthrogram is needed. Rationale: MRA is helpful in evaluat ing and confirming femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears. Enhanced MR NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 62 arthrogram allows better labral evaluation and is recommended for diagnosing femoroacetabular impingement compared to other imaging procedures. Evidence for MR Arthrogram to diagnose femoroacetabular impingement C.6.b.ii MRI Recommended - in select patients with subacute or chronic lateral hip pain when there is diagnostic uncertainty as to the etiology and to assist in maki ng an accurate diagnosis. C.6.b.i ii Ultrasound Recommended - for evaluating patients with femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears . Indications: Patients with hip pain thought to be from impingement or labral tears. Generally arthrogram and MRI is/are the preferred diagnostic tests, yet selective use of ultrasound may be helpful. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Generally only once. Rationale: Ultraso und may be helpful in evaluating and confirming femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears and is thus recommended . C.6.c Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.6.c.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) tears and femoroacetabular impingement . NYS WCB MTG - Hip and - labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration - As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.6.c.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestina l bleeding. Indication s - For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a his tory of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding . Indications for Discontinuation - Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.6.c.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adv erse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear t o be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low - dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 64 prevention, to minimiz e the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or ejight hours before the daily aspirin. C.6.c.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Femoroacetabular Impingement or Labral Tears Recommended - for treatment of labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement , particularly in patients with contraindications for All patients with femoroacetabular impingement , Dose/Frequency - Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. Rationale for Recommendations - For most patients, generic ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Second -line medications should include one o f the other generic medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative for these patients, although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective for arthrosis patients . There is evidence that NSAIDs a re as effective for relief of pain as opioids (and tramadol) and less impairing . C.6.c.v Opioids Opioids rarely for patients with femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears . Recommend ed - for short term (less than one week) fo r patients with femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears . Rationale for Recommendations - Opioids cause significant adverse effects - poor tolerance, constipation, drowsiness, clouded judgment, memory loss, and potential misuse or dependence have been reported in up to 35% of patients. Before prescribing opioids, patients should be informed of these potential adverse effects and cautioned against operating motor vehicles or machinery. Opioids do not appear to be more effective than safer analgesics for managing most NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 65 musculoskeletal symptoms; they should only be used if needed for severe pain . Recommended - for select treatment of patients with post - operative femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears . Indications femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears , a brief course of a few days to not more than one week of an opioid is recommended for treatment. Opioids may be helpful for brief nocturnal use after surgery . Most patients should attempt pain control with NSAIDs/acetaminophen prior to opioids. Discontinuation of opioids as early as possible is recommended. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Generally, patients require no more than a few days to not more than one week . Indications for Discontinua tion - Resolution of pain, sufficient control with other medications, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.6.d Treatments C.6.d.i Rehabilitation Programs Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury st atus in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are depe ndent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized ove r passive interventions. The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 66 C.6.d.i.a Therapeutic Exercise - Physical or Occupational Therapy Recommended - for femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears , particularly post - operatively and to address any strength deficits. Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improve ment. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activit ies). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. Indications for Discontinuation - Improved function and reduced pain, post -operative healing, intolerance, lack of efficacy or non -compliance . C.6.d.ii Injection Therapy C.6.d.ii .a Local Glucocorticosteroid Injections Recommended - for treatment of hip impingement or labral tears in select patients . Indications: Hip impingement or labral tears generally not resolving over a period of a few weeks of treatment with activity modification and NSAIDs. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Generally one injection is performed. A second injection may be considered if there is improvement (increased function and decreased pain) that is incomplete. Evidence for use of local glucocorticosteroid injections for hip impingement C.6.d.ii i Surgery NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 67 Recommended - to diagnose and treat patients with hip pain if there is a suspicion of labral tear, intraarticular body, femoracetabular impingement, or there are other subacute or chronic mechanical symptoms for patients who failed conservative management are are tho ught to be best treated with arthroscopy. Indications: Patients with hip pain with suspicion of labral tear, intraarticular body, femoroacetabular impingement, or other subacute or chronic mechanical symptoms. Rationale: Arthroscopy of the hip is increa singly utilized to treat several hip disorders, especially ones with mechanical symptoms. Symptomatic labral tears and removal of foreign bodies have been reported as successfully treated. Femoroacetabular impingement is also a potential indication. Evidence for Arthroscopy to diagnose and treatment patients with hip pain. C.6.d.iii.b Surgical Repair Recommended - for hip impingement or labral tear cases that fail conservative management and either fail arthroscopic repair and/or are throught to be best treated with an open approach. Indications/Rationale: Patients with hip pain with suspicion of labr al tear, intraarticular body, femoroacetabular impingement, or other subacute or chronic mechanical symptoms that are thought to be best treated with an open approach. Evidence for Open surgical repair is recommended for \"hip impingement\" or labral tear cases C.6.d. iv Other C.6.d. iv.a Walking Aid: Cane / Crutches / Walker NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 68 Recommended - for select patients with moderate to severe femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears . Indications: Disabling, moderate to severe femoroacetabular impingement or labral tears where risks of increasing debility are outweighed by device use that incr eases mobility. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution (e.g., post-operative recovery) . Rationale: For acute injuries, crutches and canes may be helpful during the recovery and/or rehabilitative phase to increase functional status (e.g., from whee lchair to walker to cane ). For chronic hip pain, crutches may paradoxically increase disability through debility. In those circumstances, institution or maintenance of advice for use of crutches or canes should be carefully considered against potential risks. Evidence for use of Canes and Crutches C.7 Gluteus Medius Tendinosis Pain Syndome and Trochanteric Bursitis C.7.a Introduction The criteria presented below is an overview of the clinical thought process for evaluation of Gluteus Medius Tendinosis and Tears (\"Rotator Cuff of Trochanteric Pain Syndrome and Trochanteric Bursistis . for Non -Red-Flag Conditions Gluteus Medius Tears Nonradiating hip pain.

Other testing usually NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 69 climbing. Pain worse with activity. normal. Antalgic gait sometimes present and increased pain with stair climbing. not required for short - term and m ild cases. MRI sometimes helpful. C.7.b Diagnostic Studies C.7.b.i MR Arthogram Recommended - to diagnose gluteus medius tendinosis or tears, and for greater trochanteric pain syndrome in patients with subacute or chronic hip pain. Indications: Patients with subacute or chronic hip pain and symptoms or clinical suspicion of gluteus medius tendinosis or tears, and for grea ter trochanteric pain syndrome patients. It is a consideration as well in those with trochanteric bursitis, especially if it does not resolve readily . Frequency/Dose/Duration: Generally only one arthrogram is needed. Rationale: MR arthrograms appear helpful in evaluating and confirming gluteus medius tendinosis or tears, or greater trochanteric pain syndrome. As compared to other imaging procedures, e nhanced MR arthrogram allows better labral evaluation and is recommended for diagnosing gluteus medius tendinosis or tears, or trochanteric bursitis . It is likely the best imaging procedure avai lable for these patients and is recommended for select use. Evidence for use of MR to diagnose gluteus medius tendinosis or tears, and for greater troch anteric pain syndrome C.7.b.ii MRI Recommended - in select patients with subacute or chronic lateral hip pain where there is diagnostic uncertainty as to the etiology and to assist in making an accurate diagnosis. C.7.b.i ii Ultrasound Recommended - for evaluating patients with gluteus medius tendinopathies, greater trochanteric bursitis, and greater trochanteric pain syndrome/lateral hip pain. Indications: Patients with hip pain thought to be from these disorders. Generally, arthrogram and MRI is/are the preferred diagnostic tests, yet selective use of ultrasound may be helpful. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 70 Frequency/Dose/Duration: Generally only once. Rationale: Ultrasound appears helpful in evaluating and confirming gluteus medius tendinopathies and is thus recommend ed. Evidence for the Use of Diagnostic Tests for Trochanteric Bursitis or Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome C.7.c Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.7.c.i Non-Steroidal Anti medius or tears, trochanteric greater , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Ove r-the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration - As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of gluteus medius tendinosis or tears, trochanteric bursitis, and grea ter trochanteric pain , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.7.c.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s - For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medic ations should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 71 prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding . Indications for Discontinuation - Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.7.c.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse effects . Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non-selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low - dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID sho uld be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.7.c.iv Acetaminophen Recommended - for treatment of gluteus medius tears, trochanteric bursitis, and greater trochanteric , particularly in patients with co ntraindications for NSAIDs. Indications - All patients with gluteus medius tendinosis or tears, trochanteric bursitis, and greater including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency - Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. C.7.c.v Opioids NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 72 Opioids are rarely used for treatment of patients with gluteus medius tendinosis or tears, trochanteric bursitis, and greater trochanteric pain . They are more frequently used briefly in the immediate post -operative period . Not Recommended - for gluteus medius tears, trochanteric bursitis, and greater trochanteric pain . Rationale for Recommendations - Opioids cause significant adverse effects - poor tolerance, constipation, drowsiness, clouded judgment, memory loss, and potential mis use or dependence have been reported in up to 35% of patients. Before prescribing opioids, patients should be informed of these potential adverse effects and cautioned against operating motor vehicles or machinery. Opioids do not appear to be more effectiv e than safer analgesics for managing most musculoskeletal symptoms; they should only be used if needed for severe pain or for a short time (not more than one week) in the post -operative period . Recommended - for select treatment of patients with post - operative gluteus medius tendinosis or tears, trochanteric bursitis, and tears, trochanteric bursitis, and greater trochanteric , a brief course of a few days to not more than one week of an opioid is recommended for treatment. Opioids may be helpful for brief nocturnal use after surgery. Most patients should attempt pain control with NSAIDs/acetaminophen prior to opioids. Discontinuation of opioids as early as possible is recommended. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Generally, patients require no more than a few days to not more than one week, of treatment with opioids for most epicondylar surgeries. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of pain, sufficient control with other medications, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.7.d Treatments C.7.d.i Rehabili tation Therapeutic Exercise - Physical or Occupational Therapy Recommended - for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, trochanteric bursitis and gluteus medus NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 73 particularly to address any strength deficits in the lateral hip musculature . Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there i s documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in con junction with the therapy. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution, post-operative healing, intolerance, lack of efficacy or non -compliance . C.7.d.ii Injection Therapy C.7.d.ii.a Glucocorticosteroid Injections Recommended - as a treatment option for acute, subacute or chronic trochanteric bursitis, greater trochanteric pain syndrome and gluteus medius accompanying clinical bursitis. Indications: Symptoms of trochanteric bursitis of at least a couple weeks wit h prior treatment that has included NSAIDs or acetaminophen and avoidance of aggravating activities. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Maximum of three injections. Each injection should be scheduled separately and the effects of each evaluated before additional injections are scheduled rather than scheduling a series of three injections. The most tender location is recommended to be targete d. Fluoroscopic guidance is not necessary for an initial injection, although it is a more reasonable option for a second inj ection especially if the first injection is unsatisfactory. Glococorticosteroid injections provide an option for treatment, particularly after inadequate results from NSAID trials, exercise or other conservative interventions. Evidence Glucocorticosteroid Injections for Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Trochanteric Bursitis NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 74 C.7.d.iii Surgery C.7.d.iii.a Surgical Repair Recommended - for gluteus medius tears that are not-responsive to medical management . Indications /Rationale: Tears of the gluteus medius tendon with accompanying pain and/or functional deficits felt amenable to surgical treatment.

NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 76 Indications: Most patients with sufficient pain from hamstring or hip flexor strains needing treatment and medication, especially in the acute and peri-operative stages. Frequency/Dose/Duration: Generally tailored according to severity and patient preferences . Evidence for Ice or Heat or Wraps for Treatment of Hamstring or Hip Flexor Strains C.8.c.ii Rehabili tation Therapy Rehabilitation required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's dail y and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the individual to complete a specific exercise or task. This form of therapy requires supervision from a therapist such as verbal, visual and/or tactile instruction(s). At times, the therapist may help stabilize the patient or guide the movement pattern, but the energy required to complete the task is predominately execute d by the patient. Patient should be instructed to continue active therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. Passive intervent ions, those not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather dependent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concom itant attainment of objective functional gains. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.8.c.ii.a Therapeutic Exercise - Physical or Occupational Therapy Recommended - for greater hamstring and hip flexor strains, particularly to address any strength deficits in the lateral hip musculature . Frequency/Dose/Duration - Exercises are generally individualized and increased over time. Ma ny therapists combine exercises with other treatment NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 77 modalities. Stretching exercises are frequently included and progress to strengthening exercises. Frequency of visits is usually individualized based on severity of the disorder, prior response to treatm ent, and job functions. Two to three visits per week for two weeks are often used to initiate an exercise program. Total numbers of visits may be as few as 2 to 3 for mild patients or up to 12 to 15 with documenation of objective functional improvement. As part of the rehabili tation plan, patients should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapy, at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement .

C.11.b Medications For m ost patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.11.b.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Recommended - for treatment of lower abdominal strains . Indications : NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over - the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of lower abdominal strains , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 90 C.11.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointesti nal Bleeding Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestina l bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.11.b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular A dverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appea r to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse effects . Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low - dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or eight hours before the daily aspirin. C.11.b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Lower Abdominal Strains Recom mended - for treatment of lower abdominal strains , particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with lower abdominal strains , including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 91 Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. C.11.c Treatments C.11.c.i Hot and Cold Therapies C.11.c.i.a Cryotherapy Recommended - lower abdominal strains . Indications - All patients with lower abdominal strains . Frequency/Duration - Approximately three to five self-applications per day as needed. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution, adverse effects, non -compliance. C.11.c.i.b Heat Therapy Recommended - lower abdominal strains . Indications - All patients with lower abdominal strains . Frequency/Duration - Approximately three to five self-applications per day as needed. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution, adverse effects, non -compliance. C.11.d Rehabili tation Rehabili tation Recommended - for treatment of lower abdominal strains . Indications: Most patients may benefit from a course of therapy, but particularly those with strength deficits and/or significant functional impairments. Exercise is able to address functional deficits and is thus recommended for lower abdominal strains at least moderate in severity. NYS WCB MTG - Hip and Groin Disorders 92 Mild cases usually resolve with elimination of exposure(s), NSAIDs and time. Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals ( e.g., range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. C.12 Epididymo -Orchitis C.12.a Introduction The vast majority of cases of epididymitis or combined epididymito - orchitis have infectious origins. There is a small, but not insignicant minority of patients who report a history of a heavy lift or strain that precipitated the symptoms, thus giving rise to the possibility that this entity may sometimes be an occupational disease or injury outside of the obvious setting of direct work -related trauma. Patients with a clinical course that does not resolve should be evaluated by a urologist. Patients should be evaluated for testicular torsion (a surgical emergency), tumor and genitourinary infections. Those with evidence suggesting any of these conditions should be referred to a primary health care provider or urologist. C.12.b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.12.b.i Non-Steroidal Anti -orchitis .

N=138 ASA physical status 1 or 2 patients experien ced outpatie nt laparosc opy. Mean age: 32 years; 0 males, 138 females. Scopolamine group: patients received 1.5 mg scopolamine in a 0.2 mm thick unit with 5\u00b5g per hour delivery for 3 days (n=70) vs. Placebo group: patients received the same procedure as the scopolamine group but with no scopolamine involved (n=68). Follow up hourly after surgery until discharge. Repeated vomiting episodes in placebo group were more frequent tha n that in scopolamine group (41% vs. 23%; p=0.0213). The discharge time in the hospital reduced average of 4 \u00b1 1.3 hours in scopolamine group and 4.5 \u00b1 1.5 hours in placebo group (p=0.0487). \"The authors conclude that transdermal scopolamine is a safe and effective antiemetic for outpatients undergoing laparoscopy.\" Data suggest transdermal scopolamine is effective for use in outpatient laparoscopic surgery to decrease PONV compliance difficult to assess as at least 25%of study population breached protocol .
