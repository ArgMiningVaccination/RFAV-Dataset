Arthritis is a degenerative disease that can affect the joints in your body. Osteoarthritis is often age-related and progressive. [Rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648) is considered an autoimmune disease that can affect anyone of any age. Thankfully there are natural remedies for arthritis sufferers can do at home or with the aid of a health care provider. 1. Acupuncture If you are looking for a holistic whole body approach, maybe consider coming in for [acupuncture treatments](https://lakehealth.org/Services/Integrative-Medicine/Acupuncture) to care for your arthritis. [Acupuncture](https://www.ohionaturalhealth.com/traditional-chinese-medicine) is an ancient practice that involves using tiny needles pressed into the skin. While there is some debate about what the needles may actually do, there is no doubt that acupuncture may help limit the amount of pain arthritis sufferers feel. Acupuncture has been around since ancient times. It has grown in popularity as the population has aged. Many people experiencing pain have turned to acupuncture or traditional Chinese medical services. It may take several weeks for you to feel a difference in your pain. But it will be well worth that time. 2. Herbal Remedies When trying to find the right way to treat your arthritis pain, consider trying some [herbal supplements](https://www.ohionaturalhealth.com/botanical-medicine). Plants have been used to treat aches and pains for millennia. Used correctly they may improve your quality of life.

No matter what herb you try, always consult your healthcare provider for doses and uses. 3. Hot and Cold Treatments Temperature variances are effective ways to treat pain as well. If your arthritis is acting up consider taking a hot bath or using a heating pad on the affected area. When using a heating pad be sure to not leave it on your skin for too long. Cold compresses can help quite a bit too. But when using ice do not leave the compress on for longer than 15 minutes. Alternate during this time. Fifteen minutes on the skin, followed by 15 minutes off. This will ensure your skin is not damaged by the cold temperatures. Alternating between two different temperatures can help decrease swelling and pain. This is commonly referred to as contrast hydrotherapy. 4. Consider What Lifestyle Changes to Make Ultimately, managing arthritis pain comes down to lifestyle changes. Changing your diet so you're eating more fruits and vegetables will greatly improve your pain scale. Now might be a time to get introduced to wild caught fish as well.
