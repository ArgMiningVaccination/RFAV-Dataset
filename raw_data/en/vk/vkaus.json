If so, we want you to know about toxic release. After your first adjustment, you may experience slight cold or flu-like symptoms. No, this isn't because the practice is unclean or because your chiropractor didn't do a good job, but because of toxic release. Here's what you need to know. What Is Toxic Release? Nearly 20% of chiropractic patients experience toxic release after getting an adjustment. It might sound scary, but it is actually a positive reaction to treatment. The toxins in your body are being released by manipulations, which is great news for your body! Unfortunately, expelling those toxins comes with some temporary and unpleasant symptoms. You can take comfort in the knowledge that your body is adjusting to the expulsion of that negative energy and the symptoms will soon fade. What Are The Symptoms? If your body does go through toxic release (remember \u2014 the majority of people do not experience this), the symptoms include headache, fatigue, tight muscles, night sweats, and diarrhea. Feeling extremely tired is quite common after a chiropractic session. This is because your body is adjusting to the way your nervous system is responding to treatment. Before your alignment, your nervous system was most likely jammed up by subluxations. Through chiropractic manipulations, your nerves are now functioning optimally, which can be tiring to the body at first as it has been deprived of this for some time. Toxic Release 101 Your body is reacting to chemical signals between the brain and spinal cord all throughout the day. When that flow of energy is disrupted due to subluxations (aka dysfunctions of the spine), that action is slowed down. Clearing those blockages and returning that flow of energy to its optimal speed results in an adjustment period for the body, causing it to feel tired and even sick. Think about your nervous system as a garden hose. When there's a kink in the hose, the water gets jammed up and is unable to flow. This idea also applies to your nervous system. If there's a subluxation in your spine, it blocks the flow of energy and causes pressure to build up. That pressure can result in a number of ailments, from headaches to chronic issues. When the pressure is released through spinal manipulations, that new flow of energy is what ends up causing those cold-like symptoms. The good news is that toxic release doesn't last long, and it is an indicator your chiropractic treatments are working!
