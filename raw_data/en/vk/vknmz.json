ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 7 R077: Flu ACOL VOLUNTARY FLU IMMUNISATION PROGRAM As you are no doubt aware the flu can strike rapidly and extensively during winter. It can leave its victims ill for weeks. The best way to fight the virus is to have a fit and healthy body. Daily exercise and a diet including plenty of fruit and vegetables are highly recommended to assist the immune system to fight this invading virus. ACOL has decided to offer staff the opportunity to be immunised against the flu as an additional way to prevent this insidious virus from spreading amongst us. ACOL has arranged for a nurse to administer the immunisations at ACOL, during a half-day session in work hours in the week of May 17. This program is free and available to all members of staff. Participation is voluntary. Staff taking up the option will be asked to sign a consent form indicating that they do not have any allergies, and that they understand they may experience minor side effects. Medical advice indicates that the immunisation does not produce influenza. However, it may cause some side effects such as fatigue, mild fever and tenderness of the arm. ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 8 WHO SHOULD BE IMMUNISED? Anyone interested in being protected against the virus. This immunisation is especially recommended for people over the age of 65. But regardless of age, ANYONE who has a chronic debilitating disease, especially cardiac, pulmonary, bronchial or diabetic conditions. In an office environment ALL staff are at risk of catching the flu. WHO SHOULD NOT BE IMMUNISED? Individuals hypersensitive to eggs, people suffering from an acute feverish illness and pregnant women. Check with your doctor if you are taking any medication or have had a previous reaction to a flu injection. If you would like to be immunised in the week of May 17 please advise the personnel officer, Fiona McSweeney, by Friday May 7. The date and time will be set according to the availability of the nurse, the number of participants and the time convenient for most staff. If you would like to be immunised for this winter but cannot attend at the arranged time please let Fiona know. An alternative session may be arranged if there are sufficient numbers. For further information please contact Fiona on ext. 5577. Good Healt h ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 9 Fiona McSweeney, the personnel officer at a company called ACOL, prepared the information sheet on the previous two pages for ACOL staff.

The answer must do AT LEAST ONE of the following: (1) refer to one of the features in detail (layout, style of writing, pictures or other graphics; or other similar) - that is, to a specific part or quality of a feature; AND/OR (2) use evaluative terms other than \"friendly\" and \"encouraging\" . (Note that such terms as \"interesting\", \"easy to read\" and \"clear\" are not considered to be adequately specific.) Opinion about whether Fiona succeeded may be stated or implied. No, it was a bad idea to put a picture of a syringe near the beginning. That looks scary. [Refers to one specific part of the des ign: a particular picture (1). Uses own evaluative term: \"scary\" (2).] Yes, the pictures break up the writing and make it easy to read. [Describes a specific aspect of layout (1).] The cartoon-like picture of the virus is friendly. [Refers to a specific aspect (\"cartoon-like\") of one illustration (1).] No, the pictures are childish and irrelevant. [Uses own terms (\"childish\", \"irrelevant\") to evaluate one of the f eatures mentioned in the stem (2).] Yes, the written style is relaxed and informal. [Uses own terms (\"relaxed\", \"informal\") to evaluate one of the f eatures mentioned in the stem (2).] Yes, the style was warm and inviting. [Uses own terms to evaluate style (2).] There is too much writing. People wouldn't bother reading it. [Refers to a relevant feature of the presentation: am ount of text (1). Uses own evaluative terms (2).] She doesn't put pressure on people to get the injection, and that would encourage people. [Implicit reference to manner or register: an aspect of style (2).] No, the writing style is very formal. [Debatable but plausible application of own evaluative term: \"formal\" (2).] Partial credit Code 1: Refers accurately to the text and relates purpose to information and content (rather than style), consistent with \"friendly and encouraging\". Opinion about whether Fiona succeeded may be stated or implied. No, there is no way that a message about having an injection could be friendly and encouraging. Yes she succeeded. She's giving many opportunities and arranging times for a flu immunisation. She also gave suggestions about health. No credit Code 0: Gives insufficient or vague answer. Yes, it makes it sound as if it would be a good idea. Yes it is friendly and encouraging. [Terms not applied to specific features.] ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 11 No, it doesn't work. No because some of the information is not correct. [Refers to content without making any connection to the idea of \"friendly and encouraging\".] Yes, the illustrations are encouraging and the style of the announcement is also acceptable. [\"Illustrations are encouraging\" does not go beyond the terms of the question. \"The style of the announcement is also acceptable\" is too vague.] She succeeded, easy to read, and clear. [The terms used are not specific enough.] I think that she has succeeded well. S he has selected pictures and written interesting text. [Pictures are not evaluated in any way, and \"interesting text\" is too vague.] OR: Shows inaccurate comprehension of the material or gives an implausible or irrelevant answer. Yes everyone should have the injection. [Irrelevant and inaccurate.] No, the pictures have nothing to do with the message. [Inaccurate] Yes, because she wants people to be worried about getting the flu. [Conflicts with the idea of \"friendly and encouraging\".] It's good but it's only one opinion. [Irrelevant] Yes, it gave brief information on what they will do to stop flu. [Irrelevant - refers to content in a non-specific way.] Yes, she just tells the facts. [Irrelevant] Yes, because more people should be immunised. [Gives a general opinion on the subject of immunisation, does not refer to the style or to details of content.] Yes I do because no-one wants to be sick. Everyone wants good health.

Anyone interested in being protected against the virus. After Fiona had circulated the information sheet, a colleague told her that she should have left out the words \"Anyone interested in being protected against the virus\" because they were misleading. Do you agree that these words are misleading and should have been left out? Explain INTENT: Reflecting on the Content of a Text: evaluating appropriateness of a section of the text in relation to its overall meaning and purpose Full credit Code 2: Evaluates the section of text in relation to the term \"misleading\" by indicating that there is a potential contradiction . (\"Who should be immunised? Anyone...\" vs \"Who should not be immunised?\"). May or may not explain what the contradiction is. Agreement or disagreement may be stated or implied. Yes, because it would be dangerous for some people to have the immunisation (e.g. pregnant women). [Describes contradiction.] No, because you only have to read another couple of lines to realise that some people shouldn't have the injection, and on the whole she wants people to have it. Yes, because she says \"anyone\" can and later she states the people who should not be immunised. [Contradiction identified.] This line suggests that all people shoul d get the vaccine, which is untrue. [Contradiction briefly indicated.] Yes, to some extent! Maybe: \"Anyone in terested in being protected against the virus, but who doesn't suffer from any of the following symptoms or diseases.\" [Suggested rewording implies recogni tion of the contradiction.] OR: Evaluates the section of text in relation to the term \"misleading\" by ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 13 indicating that the statement may be an exaggeration . (i.e. Not everyone needs the immunisation, or the immunisation does not offer complete protection.) May or may not explain what the exaggeration is. Agreement or disagreement may be stated or implied. Leave out because having the immunisa tion is not a guarantee that you won't get the flu. I don't agree, even though it makes it sound as if you will definitely get the flu if you don't have the injection. Having the injection is not a complete protection. Leave out because not everyone gets the fl u, especially if you are fit and well. Yes I agree because it makes the shot sound better than it is. [Implies an exaggeration, though unspecified.] Partial credit Code 1: Evaluates the section of text, but not in relation to the term \"misleading\" . (1) Indicates that the statement is strong, effective and/or encouraging without mentioning potential contradiction or misleading element; OR (2) Indicates that the statement \"Anyone interested in being protected against the virus\" is redundant because it is stating the obvious. It was good to put it in, because it would encourage people. [1] It should be there because it makes the message stand out. [1] I think that these words should have been left out because it goes without saying that everyone wants to be protected a gainst the virus, even if this is not accomplished through immunisation. [2] No credit Code 0: Gives insufficient or vague answer, or restates \"misleading\" without explanation. Leave it in, it's good. [No explanation.] They should have put another pict ure there instead of the heading. [No explanation.] Yes, this sentence is misleadi ng and it could cause problems. [No explanation] OR: Shows inaccurate comprehension of the material or gives an implausible or irrelevant answer . It should have been left out because everyone has the right to decide for themselves. [Misunderstanding of register of the text: it is not an order.] I think the word FLU should have been put in between THE and VIRUS, because people just taking a glance at it might think that they are talking about another virus and not the flu. [Implausible explanation for \"misleading\".] Yes, people may be interested but may have a fear of needles. [Irrelevant] Code 9: Missing.

ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 15 R081: Graffiti I'm simmering with anger as the school wall is cleaned and repainted for the fourth time to get rid of graffiti. Creativity is admirable but people should find ways to express themselves that do not inflict extra costs upon society. Why do you spoil the reputation of young people by painting graffiti where it's forbidden? Professional artists do not hang their paintings in the streets, do they? Instead they seek funding and gain fame through legal exhibitions. In my opinion buildings, fences and park benches are works of art in themselves. It's really pathetic to spoil this architecture with graffiti and what's more, the method destroys the ozone layer. Really, I can't understand why these criminal artists bother as their \"artistic works\" are just removed from sight over and over again. Helga There is no accounting for taste. Society is full of communication and advertising. Company logos, shop names. Large intrusive posters on the streets. Are they acceptable? Yes, mostly. Is graffiti acceptable? Some people say yes, some no. Who pays the price for graffiti? Who is ultimately paying the price for advertisements? Correct. The consumer. Have the people who put up billboards asked your permission? No. Should graffiti painters do so then? Isn't it all just a question of communication - your own name, the names of gangs and large works of art in the street? Think about the striped and chequered clothes that appeared in the stores a few years ago. And ski wear. The patterns and colours were stolen directly from the flowery concrete walls. It's quite amusing that these patterns and colours are accepted and admired but that graffiti in the same style is considered dreadful. Times are hard for art.

ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 17 She thinks advertising is like graffiti. Because they don't ask your permission to put up billboards. [The comparison between advertising and graffiti is implicit.] Because advertisements are placed in society without our permission, as is graffiti. Because the billboards are like graffiti. [A minimal answer. Recognises a similarity without elaborating on what the similarity is.] Because it is another form of display. Because advertisers stick posters on the wa ll and she thinks it is graffiti as well. Because it is on the walls too. Because they are equally nice or ugly to look at.

It gives some information about PLAN's work in one of its regions of operation (Eastern and Southern Africa). Refer to the table to answer the questions below. Question 4a: PLAN INTERNATIONAL R099Q04A What does the table indicate about the level of PLAN International's activity in Ethiopia in 1996, compared with other countries in the region? A The level of activity was comparatively high in Ethiopia. B The level of activity was comparatively low in Ethiopia. C It was about the same as in other countries in the region. D It was comparatively high in the Habitat category, and low in the other categories. PLAN INTERNATIONAL SCORING 4A Note: The correct answer is B: \"The level of activity was comparatively low in Ethiopia\". This question is for information only and will not independently contribute to the student's score. The answer is taken into account in assessing the response to Question 4B. Question 4B: PLAN INTERNATIONAL R099Q04B- 0 1239 In 1996 Ethiopia was one of the poorest countries in the world. Taking this fact and the information in the table into account, what do you think might explain the level of PLAN International's activities in Ethiopia compared with its activities in other countries? ............................................................................................................................... .... INTENT: Reflecting on the Content of a Text: drawing on knowledge and experience to form a hypothesis which is consistent with given information ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 32 Full credit Code 3: Student has answered Question 4A correctly (Key B). Explains the level of PLAN's activity by drawing on ALL the information supplied , with explicit or implicit reference to the type of activity conducted in Ethiopia by PLAN. Answer must also be consistent with (though does not need to refer to) BOTH of the following: (1) PLAN's low level of activity in Ethiopia (information supplied in the table); AND (2) Ethiopia's poverty (information given in the stem). Aid organisations often start their work in a country by training local people so I would say PLAN had just started working in Ethiopia in 1996. Training community workers might be the only kind of aid they can give there. There might not be the hospitals or sch ools in which they could base the other kinds of aid work. Other foreign aid groups might be helping with medicine etc. and PLAN sees they need to know how to run the country. [Implicitly refers to training community leaders.] Partial credit Code 2: Student has answered Question 4A correctly (Key B). Explains the level of PLAN's work by drawing on MOST of the information supplied . Answer must be consistent with (though does not need to refer to) BOTH of the following: (1) PLAN's low level of activity in Ethiopia (information supplied in the table); AND (2) Ethiopia's poverty (information given in the stem). It might be hard to distribute aid there because things are in such a mess. There may be a war on so it would be hard to give aid. They don't know how to help there. If other organisations are helping in Ethiopia, there is less for PLAN to do. I could imagine that the other countries received help first and that Ethiopia will be helped in the near future. The people of Ethiopia may have a certai n culture which makes it difficult to interact with foreigners. I think they are giving a bit too much help in other countries and Ethiopia is missing out. Plan International might not have enough funding and money for all the countries in need. Code 1: Student has answered Question 4A correctly (Key B). Explains the level of PLAN's work by drawing on PART of the information supplied . Answer must be consistent with (though does not need to refer to) PLAN's low level of activity in Ethiopia (information supplied in the table). Ethiopia does not need PLAN's help as much as the other countries. [Draws on information in the table but does not ta ke into account the information about Ethiopia's relative poverty supplied in the stem.] Ethiopia is not as poor as the other count ries so it doesn't need PLAN's help as much. [Draws on information in the table but is inconsistent with information about Ethiopia's relative poverty supplied in the stem.] Ethiopia might only need more help with their community leaders than other countries. [Draws in detail on information in the table but does not take into account the information about Ethiopia's relative poverty supplied in the stem.] ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 33 OR: Student has answered Question 4A incorrectly (not Key B). Explains the level of PLAN's work by drawing on PART of the information supplied . Answer must be consistent with (though does not need to refer to) BOTH of the following: (1) the level of activity in Ethiopia which the student has indicated in Question 4A (the explanation itself need not be true); AND (2) Ethiopia's poverty (information given in the stem). [Answer to Question 4A: The level of acti vity is comparatively high in Ethiopia.] Ethiopia is poorer than other countries in the region and therefore needs more help. [Answer to Question 4A: It is about the sa me as in other countries in the region.] Aid is distributed equally so there is no rivalry between countries. No credit Code 0: Gives insufficient or vague answer. They don't do as much work in Ethiopia.

OR: Shows inaccurate comprehension of the material or gives an implausible or irrelevant answer. They should be giving more to Ethiopia. [Expresses an opinion rather than suggesting an explanation.] They are only training community workers. They don't seem to be doing anything for health or learning of the people there. [Does not explain the level of activity.] The level of PLAN International's activities in Ethiopia compared with its activities in other countries is higher.

ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 34 R100: Police Scientific Police Weapons A murder has been committed but the suspect denies everything. He claims not to know the victim. He says he never knew him, never went near him, never touched him... The police and the judge are convinced that he is not telling the truth. But how to prove it? At the crime scene, investigators have gathered every possible shred of evidence imaginable: fibres from fabrics, hairs, finger marks, cigarette ends...The few hairs found on the victim's jacket are red. And they look strangely like the suspect's. If it could be proved that these hairs are indeed his, this would be evidence that he had in fact met the victim. Every individual is unique Specialists set to work. They examine some cells at the root of these hairs and some of the suspect's blood cells. In the nucleus of each cell in our bodies there is DNA. What is it? DNA is like a necklace made of two twisted strings of pearls. Imagine that these pearls come in four different colours and that thousands of coloured pearls (which make up a gene) are strung in a very specific order. In each individual this order is exactly the same in all the cells in the body: those of the hair roots as well as those of the big toe, those of the liver and those of the stomach or blood. But the order of the pearls varies from one person to another. Given the number of p earls strung in this way, there is very little chance of two people having the same DNA, with the exception of identical twins. Unique to each individual, DNA is thus a sort of genetic identity card. Geneticists are ther efore able to compare the suspect's genetic identity card (determined from his blood) with that of the person with the red hair. If the genetic card is the same, they will know that the suspect did in fact go near the victim he said he'd never met. Just one piece of evidence More and more often in cases of sexual assault, murder, theft or other crimes, the police are having genetic analyses done. Why? To try to find evidence of contact between two people, two objects or a person and an object. Proving such contact is often very useful to the investigation. But it does not necessarily provide proof of a crime. It is just one piece of evidence amongst many others. Anne Versailles We are made up of billions of cells Every living thing is made up of lots of cells. A cell is very small indeed. It can also be said to be microscopic because it can only be seen using a microscope which magnifies it many times. Each cell has an outer membrane and a nucleus in which the DNA is found. Genetic what? DNA is made up of a number of genes, each consisting of thousands of \"pearls\". Together these genes form the genetic identity card of a person. How is the genetic identity card revealed? The geneticist takes the few cells from the base of the hairs found on the victim, or from the saliva left on a cigarette end. He puts them into a product which destroys everything around the DNA of the cells. He then does the same thing with some cells from the suspect's blood. The DNA is then specially prepared for analysis. After this, it is placed in a special gel and an electric current is passed through the gel. After a few hours, this produces stripes similar to a bar code (like the ones on things we buy) which are visible under a special lamp. The bar code of the suspect's DNA is then compared with that of the hairs found on the victim.

ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 42 R109: A Just Judge Just Judge Text Refer to the story A Just Judge, which starts on the next page, to answer the questions which follow it. A JUST JUDGE An Algerian king named Bauakas wanted to find out whether or not it was true, as he had been told, that in one of his cities lived a just judge who could instantly discern the truth, and from whom no rogue was ever able to conceal himself. Bauakas exchanged clothes with a merchant and went on horseback to the city where the judge lived. At the entrance to the city a cripple approached the king and begged alms of him. Bauakas gave him money and was about to continue on his way, but the cripple clung to his clothing. \"What do you wish?\" asked the ki ng. \"Haven't I given you money?\" \"You gave me alms,\" said the cripple, \"now grant me one favour. Let me ride with you as far as the city square, otherwise the horses and camels may trample me.\" Bauakas sat the cripple behind him on the horse and took him as far as the city square. There he halted his horse, but the cripple refused to dismount. \"We have arrived at the square, why don't you get off?\" asked Bauakas. \"Why should I?\" the beggar replied. \"This horse belongs to me. If you are unwilling to return it, we shall have to go to court.\" Hearing their quarrel, people gathered around them shouting: \"Go to the judge! He will decide between you!\" Bauakas and the cripple went to the judge. There were others in court, and the judge called upon each one in turn. Before he came to Bauakas and the cripple he heard a scholar and a peasant. They had come to court over a woman: the peasant said she was his wife, and the scholar said she was his. The judge heard them both, remained silent for a moment, and then said: \"Leave the woman here with me, and come back tomorrow.\" When they had gone, a butcher and an oil merchant came before the judge. The butcher was covered with blood, and the oil merchant with oil. In his hand the butcher held some money, and the oil merchant held onto the butcher's hand. \"I was buying oil from this man,\" the butcher said, \"and when I took out my purse to pay him, he seized me by the hand and tried to take all my money away from me. That is why we have come to you\u2014I holding onto my purse, and he holding onto my hand. But the money is mine, and he is a thief.\" Then the oil merchant spoke. \"That is not true,\" he said. \"The butcher came to me to buy oil, and after I had poured him a full jug, he asked me to change a gold piece for him. When I took out my money and placed it on a bench, he seized it and tried to run off. I caught him by the hand, as you see, and brought him here to you.\" ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 43 The judge remained silent for a moment, then said: \"Leave the money here with me, and come back tomorrow.\" When his turn came, Bauakas told what had happened. The judge listened to him, and then asked the beggar to speak. \"All that he said is untrue,\" said the beggar. \"He was sitting on the ground, and as I rode through the city he asked me to let him ride with me. I sat him on my horse and took him where he wanted to go. But when we got there he refused to get off and said that the horse was his, which is not true.\" The judge thought for a moment, then said, \"Leave the horse here with me, and come back tomorrow.\" The following day many people gathered in court to hear the judge's decisions. First came the scholar and the peasant. \"Take your wife,\" the judge said to the scholar, \"and the peasant shall be given fifty strokes of the lash.\" The scholar took his wife, and the peasant was given his punishment. Then the judge called the butcher. \"The money is yours,\" he said to him. And pointing to the oil merchant he said: \"Give him fifty strokes of the lash.\" He next called Bauakas and the cripple. \"Would you be able to recognise your horse among twenty others?\" he asked Bauakas. \"I would,\" he replied. \"And you?\" asked \"I would,\" said the cripple. \"Come with me,\" the judge said to Bauakas. They went to the stable. Bauakas instantly pointed out his horse among the twenty others. Then the judge called the cripple to the stable and told him to point out the horse. The cripple recognised the horse and pointed to it. The judge then returned to his seat. \"Take the horse, it is yours,\" he said to Bauakas. \"Give the beggar fifty strokes of the lash.\" When the judge left the court and went home, Bauakas followed him. \"What do you want?\" asked the judge. \"Are you not satisfied with my decision?\" \"I am satisfied,\" said Bauakas. \"But I should like to learn how you knew that the woman was the wife of the scholar, that the money belonged to the butcher, and that the horse was mine and not the beggar's.\" \"This is how I knew about the woman: in the morning I sent for her and said: 'Please fill my inkwell.' She took the inkwell, washed it quickly and deftly, and filled it with ink; therefore it was work she was accustomed to. If she had been the wife of the peasant she would not have known how to do it. This showed me that the scholar was telling the truth. \"And this is how I knew about the money: I put it into a cup full of water, and in the morning I looked to see if any oil had risen to the surface. If the money had belonged ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 44 to the oil merchant it would have been soiled by his oily hands. There was no oil on the water; therefore, the butcher was telling the truth. \"It was more difficult to find out about the horse. The cripple recognised it among twenty others, even as you did. However, I did not take you both to the stable to see which of you knew the horse, but to see which of you the horse knew. When you approached it, it turned its head and stretched its neck toward you; but when the cripple touched it, it laid back its ears and lifted one hoof. Therefore I knew that you were the horse's real master.\" Then Bauakas said to the judge: \"I am not a merchant, but King Bauakas, I came here in order to see if what is said of you is true. I see now that you are a wise judge. Ask whatever you wish of me, and you shall have it as reward.\" \"I need no reward,\" replied the judge. \"I am content that my king has praised me.\" Question 1: JUST JUDGE R109Q01 Near the beginning of the story we are told that Bauakas exchanged clothes with a merchant. Why didn't Bauakas want to be recognised? A He wanted to see if he would still be obeyed when he was an \"ordinary\" person. B He planned to appear in a case before the judge, disguised as a merchant. C He enjoyed disguising himself so he could move about freely and play tricks on his subjects.

Shows accurate understanding of the crimes. No, it is a much more serious crime to try to steal someone's wife than to steal their money or their horse. ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 46 All three criminals tried to cheat someone and then lied about it, so it was fair that they were punished in the same way. It's hard to say. The peasant, the oil merchant and the beggar all wanted to steal something. On the other hand the things they wanted to steal were not equally valuable. Code 3: Shows accurate understanding of the crimes and/or the punishments without evaluating them. The judge gave fifty strokes to the three criminals. Their crimes were stealing a woman, stealing money and stealing a horse. Code 2: Demonstrates a misunderstanding of the crimes or the punishments.

ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 51 R110: Runners FEEL GOOD IN YOUR RUNNERS For 14 years the Sports Medicine Centre of Lyon (France) has been studying the injuries of young sports players and sports professionals. The study has established that the best course is prevention ... and good shoes. Knocks, falls, wear and tear... Eighteen per cent of sports players aged 8 to 12 already have heel injuries. The cartilage of a footballer's ankle does not respond well to shocks, and 25% of professionals have discovered for themselves that it is an especially weak point. The cartilage of the delicate knee joint can also be irreparably damaged and if care is not taken right from childhood (10-12 years of age), this can cause premature osteoarthritis. The hip does not escape damage either and, particularly when tired, players run the risk of fractures as a result of falls or collisions. According to the study, footballers who have been playing for more than ten years have bony outgrowths either on the tibia or on the heel. This is what is known as \"footballer's foot\", a deformity caused by shoes with soles and ankle parts that are too flexible. Protect, support, stabilise, absorb If a shoe is too rigid, it restricts movement. If it is too flexible, it increases the risk of injuries and sprains. A good sports shoe should meet four criteria: Firstly, it must provide exterior protection : resisting knocks from the ball or another player, coping with unevenness in the ground, and keeping the foot warm and dry even when it is freezing cold and raining. It must support the foot , and in particular the ankle joint, to avoid sprains, swelling and other problems, which may even affect the knee. It must also provide players with good stability so that they do not slip on a wet ground or skid on a surface that is too dry. Finally, it must absorb shocks , especially those suffered by volleyball and basketball players who are constantly jumping. Dry feet To avoid minor but painful conditions such as blisters or even splits or athlete's foot (fungal infections), the shoe must allow evaporation of perspiration and must prevent outside dampness from getting in. The ideal material for this is leather, which can be water-proofed to prevent the shoe from getting soaked the first time it rains.

The survey, conducted between December 1994 and January 1995, involved some 19,000 parents, teachers and children at primary, junior and senior high schools where bullying has occurred. The survey, the first of its kind conducted by the Ministry, covered students from the fourth grade up. According to the survey, 22 per cent of the primary school children polled said they face bullying, compared with 13 per cent of junior high school children and 4 per cent of senior high school students. On the other hand, some 26 per cent of the primary school children said they have bullied, with the percentage decreasing to 20 per cent for junior high school children and 6 per cent for senior high school students. Of those who replied that they have been bullies, between 39 and 65 per cent said they also have been bullied. The survey indicated that 37 per cent of the parents of bullied primary school children were aware of bullying targeted at their children. The figure was 34 per cent for the parents of junior high school children and 18 per cent for those of the senior high school students. Of the parents aware of the bullying, 14 per cent to 18 per cent said they had been told of bullying by teachers. Only 3 per cent to 4 per cent of the parents learned of the bullying from their children, according to the survey. The survey also found that 42 per cent of primary school teachers are not aware of bullying aimed at their students. The portion of such teachers was 29 per cent at junior high schools and 69 per cent at senior high schools. Asked for the reason behind bullying, about 85 per cent of the teachers cited a lack of education at home. Many parents singled out a lack of a sense of justice and compassion among children as the main reason. An Education Ministry official said the findings suggest that parents and teachers should have closer contact with children to prevent bullying. School bullying became a major issue in Japan after 13-year-old Kiyoteru Okouchi hanged himself in Nishio, Aichi Prefecture, in the fall of 1994, leaving a note saying that classmates had repeatedly dunked him in a nearby river and extorted money from him. The bullying-suicide prompted the Education Ministry to issue a report on bullying in March 1995 urging teachers to order bullies not to come to school.

She could just faintly remember the beginning of the rain, driving in across the swamp from the south and beating against the shell of her house. Then the river itself started rising, slowly at first until at last it paused to turn back. From hour to hour it slithered up creeks and ditches and poured over low 5 places. In the night, while she slept, it claimed the road and surrounded her so that she sat alone, her boat gone, the house like a piece of drift lodged on its bluff. Now even against the tarred planks of the supports the waters touched. And still they rose. As far as she could see, to the treetops where the opposite banks had been, the swamp was an empty sea, awash with sheets of rain, the river lost somewhere in its 10 vastness. Her house with its boat bottom had been built to ride just such a flood, if one ever came, but now it was old. Maybe the boards underneath were partly rotted away. Maybe the cable mooring the house to the great live oak would snap loose and let her go turning downstream, the way her boat had gone. No one could come now. She could cry out but it would be no use, no one would 15 hear. Down the length and breadth of the swamp others were fighting to save what little they could, maybe even their lives. She had seen a whole house go floating by, so quiet she was reminded of sitting at a funeral. She thought when she saw it she knew whose house it was. It had been bad seeing it drift by, but the owners must have escaped to higher ground. Later, with the rain and darkness pressing in, she 20 had heard a panther scream upriver. Now the house seemed to shudder around her like something alive. She reached out to catch a lamp as it tilted off the table by her bed and put it between her feet to hold it steady. Then creaking and groaning with effort the house struggled up from the clay, floated free, bobbing like a cork and swung out slowly with the pull of the 25 river. She gripped the edge of the bed. Swaying from side to side, the house moved to the length of its mooring. There was a jolt and a complaining of old timbers and then a pause. Slowly the current released it and let it swing back, rasping across its resting place. She caught her breath and sat for a long time feeling the slow pendulous sweeps. The dark sifted down through the incessant rain, and, head on 30 arm, she slept holding on to the bed. Sometime in the night the cry awoke her, a sound so anguished she was on her feet before she was awake. In the dark she stumbled against the bed. It came from out there, from the river. She could hear something moving, something large that made a dredging, sweeping sound. It could be another house. Then it hit, not head 35 on but glancing and sliding down the length of her house. It was a tree. She listened as the branches and leaves cleared them selves and went on downstream, leaving only the rain and the lappings of the flood, sounds so constant now that they seemed a part of the silence. Huddled on the bed, she was almost asleep again when another cry sounded, this time so close it could have been in the room. Staring into the dark, 40 she eased back on the bed until her hand caught the cold shape of the rifle. Then crouched on the pillow, she cradled the gun across her knees. \"Who's there?\" she called. The answer was a repeated cry, but less shrill, tired sounding, then the empty silence closing in. She drew back against the bed. Whatever was there she could 45 hear it moving about on the porch. Planks creaked and she could distinguish the ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 63 sounds of objects being knocked over. There was a scratching on the wall as if it would tear its way in. She knew now what it was, a big cat, deposited by the uprooted tree that had passed her. It had come with the flood, a gift. Unconsciously she pressed her hand against her face and along her tightened 50 throat. The rifle rocked across her knees. She had never seen a panther in her life. She had heard about them from others and heard their cries, like suffering, in the distance. The cat was scratching on the wall again, rattling the window by the door. As long as she guarded the window and kept the cat hemmed in by the wall and water, caged, she would be all right. Outside, the animal paused to rake his claws 55 across the rusted outer screen. Now and then, it whined and growled. When the light filtered down through the rain at last, coming like another kind of dark, she was still sitting on the bed, stiff and cold. Her arms, used to rowing on the river, ached from the stillness of holding the rifle. She had hardly allowed herself to move for fear any sound might give strength to the cat. Rigid, she swayed with the 60 movement of the house. The rain still fell as if it would never stop. Through the grey light, finally, she could see the rain-pitted flood and far away the cloudy shape of drowned treetops. The cat was not moving now. Maybe he had gone away. Laying the gun aside she slipped off the bed and moved without a sound to the window. It was still there, crouched at the edge of the porch, staring up at the live oak, the 65 mooring of her house, as if gauging its chances of leaping to an overhanging branch. It did not seem so frightening now that she could see it, its coarse fur napped into twigs, its sides pinched and ribs showing. It would be easy to shoot it where it sat, its long tail whipping back and forth. She was moving back to get the gun when it turned around. With no warning, no crouch or tensing of muscles, it sprang at the window, 70 shattering a pane of glass. She fell back, stifling a scream, and taking up the rifle, she fired through the window. She could not see the panther now, but she had missed. It began to pace again. She could glimpse its head and the arch of its back as it passed the window. Shivering, she pulled back on the bed and lay down. The lulling constant sound of 75 the river and the rain, the penetrating chill, drained away her purpose. She watched the window and kept the gun ready. After waiting a long while she moved again to look. The panther had fallen asleep, its head on its paws, like a housecat. For the first time since the rains began she wanted to cry, for herself, for all the people, for everything in the flood. Sliding down on the bed, she pulled the quilt around her 80 shoulders. She should have got out when she could, while the roads were still open or before her boat was washed away. As she rocked back and forth with the sway of the house a deep ache in her stomach reminded her she hadn't eaten. She couldn't remember for how long. Like the cat, she was starving. Easing into the kitchen, she made a fire with the few remaining sticks of wood. If the flood lasted she would have 85 to burn the chair, maybe even the table it self. Taking down the remains of a smoked ham from the ceiling, she cut thick slices of the brownish red meat and placed them in a skillet. The smell of the frying meat made her dizzy. There were stale biscuits from the last time she had cooked and she could make some coffee. There was plenty of water. 90 While she was cooking her food, she almost forgot about the cat until it whined. It was hungry too. \"Let me eat,\" she called to it, \"and then I'll see to you.\" And she laughed under her breath. As she hung the rest of the ham back on its nail the cat growled a deep throaty rumble that made her hand shake. After she had eaten, she went to the bed again and took up the rifle. The house 95 had risen so high now it no longer scraped across the bluff when it swung back from the river. The food had warmed her. She could get rid of the cat while light still hung ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 64 in the rain. She crept slowly to the window . It was still there, mewling, beginning to move about the porch. She stared at it a long time, unafraid. Then without thinking what she was doing, she laid the gun aside and started around the edge of the bed to 100 the kitchen. Behind her the cat was moving, fretting. She took down what was left of the ham and making her way back across the swaying floor to the window she shoved it through the broken pane. On the other side there was a hungry snarl and something like a shock passed from the animal to her. Stunned by what she had done, she drew back to the bed. She could hear the sounds of the panther tearing at 105 the meat. The house rocked around her. The next time she awoke she knew at once that everything had changed. The rain had stopped. She felt for the movement of the house but it no longer swayed on the flood. Drawing her door open, she saw through the torn screen a different world. The house was resting on the bluff where it always had. A few feet down, the river still 110 raced on in a torrent, but it no longer covered the few feet between the house and the live oak. And the cat was gone. Leading from the porch to the live oak and doubtless on into the swamp were tracks, indistinct and already disappearing into the soft mud. And there on the porch, gnawed to whiteness, was what was left of the ham.

At a shop called R\u00e9s\u00e9da Soeurs, the Duchess, who is the Prince's aunt, has met a young shop assistant, Amanda, who looks amazingly like L\u00e9ocadia. The Duchess wants Amanda to help her set the Prince free from the memories which haunt him. A crossroads in the castle grounds, a circular bench around a sma ll obelisk...evening is falling... AMANDA I still don't understand. What can I do for him, ma'am? I can't believe you could possibly have thought...And why me? I'm not particularly pretty. And even if someone were very pretty\u2014who could suddenly come between him and his memories like that? THE DUCHESS No-one but you. AMANDA, sincerely surprised Me? THE DUCHESS The world is so foolish, my child. It sees only parades, gestures, badges of office...that must be why you have never been told. But my heart hasn't deceived me\u2014I almost cried out at R\u00e9s\u00e9da Soeurs the first time I saw you. To someone who knew more of her than just her public image, you are the living likeness of L\u00e9ocadia. A silence. The evening birds have now taken over from the afternoon birds. The grounds are filled with shadows and twittering. AMANDA, very gently I really don't think I can, ma'am. I have nothing, I am nothing, and those lovers...that was my fancy, don't you see? She has got up. As if about to leave, she has picked up her small suitcase. THE DUCHESS, gently also, and very wearily Of course, my dear. I apologise. She in turn gets up, with difficulty, like an old woman. A bicycle bell is heard in the evening air; she gives a start. Listen...it's him! Just show yourself to him, leaning against this little obelisk where he first met her. Let him see you, even if it's just this once, let him call out, take a sudden interest in this likeness, in this stratagem which I shall confess to him tomorrow and for which he will hate me\u2014in anything but this dead girl who'll take him away from me one of these days, I'm sure...( She has taken her by the arm. ) You will do that, won't you? I beg you most humbly, young lady. ( She looks at her, beseechingly, and quickly adds: ) And then, that way, you'll see him too. And...I can feel that I'm blushing again from saying this to you\u2014life is just too mad! That's the third time I've blushed in sixty years, and the second time in ten minutes\u2014 you'll see him; and if he could ever (why not him, since he's handsome and charming and he wouldn't be the first?) if he could ever have the good fortune, for himself and for me, to take your fancy for one moment... The bell again in the shadows, but very close now. AMANDA, in a whisper What should I say to him? THE DUCHESS, gripping her arm Simply say: \"Excuse me, Sir, can you tell me the way to the sea?\" She has hurried into the deeper shadows of the trees. Just in time. There is a pale blur. It is the Prince on his bicycle. He ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 75 passes very close to the pale blur of Amanda by the obelisk. She murmurs. AMANDA Excuse me, Sir... He stops, dismounts from the bicycle, takes off his hat and looks at her. THE PRINCE Yes? AMANDA Can you tell me the way to the sea? THE PRINCE Take the second turning on your left. He bows, sadly and courteously, gets back on the bicycle and rides away. The bell is heard again in the distance. The Duchess comes out of the shadows, very much an old woman. AMANDA, gently, after a while He didn't recognise me... THE DUCHESS It was dark...And then, who knows what face he gives her now, in his dreams? ( She asks timidly: ) The last train has gone, young lady. In any case, wouldn't yo u like to stay at the castle tonight? AMANDA, in a strange voice Yes, ma'am. It is completely dark. The two of them can no longer be seen in the shadows, and only the wind can be heard in the huge trees of the grounds.

Refer to the information to answer the questions which follow it. COLLECTING NECTAR Bees make honey to survive. It is their only essential food. If there are 60,000 bees in a hive about one third of them will be involved in gathering nectar which is then made into honey by the house bees. A small number of bees work as foragers or searchers. They find a source of nectar, then return to the hive to tell the other bees where it is. Foragers let the other bees know where the source of the nectar is by performing a dance which gives information about the direction and the distance the bees will need to fly. During this dance the bee shakes her abdomen from side to side while running in circles in the shape of a figure 8. The dance follows the pattern shown on the following diagram. The diagram shows a bee dancing inside the hive on the vertical face of the honeycomb. If the middle part of the figure 8 points straight up it means that bees can find the food if they fly straight towards the sun. If the middle part of the figure 8 points to the right, the food is to the right of the sun. The distance of the food from the hive is indicated by the length of time that the bee shakes her abdomen. If the food is quite near the bee shakes her abdomen for a short time. If it is a long way away she shakes her abdomen for a long time. ReleasedPISAItems_Reading.doc Page 85 MAKING HONEY When the bees arrive at the hive carrying nectar they give this to the house bees. The house bees move the nectar around with their mandibles, exposing it to the warm dry air of the hive. When it is first gathered the nectar contains sugar and minerals mixed with about 80% water. After ten to twenty minutes, when much of the excess water has evaporated, the house bees put the nectar in a cell in the honeycomb where evaporation continues. A fter three days, the honey in the cells contains about 20% water. At this stage, the bees cover the cells with lids which they make out of beeswax. At any one time the bees in a hive usually gather nectar from the same type of blossom and from the same area. Some of the main sources of nectar are fruit trees, clover and flowering trees.

That happened dramatically in 1945 on the destructive side of life with the atomic bomb, and is now happening on life's creative side with techniques to overcome human infertility. Most of us rejoiced with the Brown family in England when Louise, the first test-tube baby, was born. And we have marveled at other firsts \u2014 most recently the births of healthy babies that had once been embryos frozen to await the proper moment of implantation in the mother-to-be. It is about two such frozen embryos in Australia that a storm of legal and ethical questions has arisen. The embryos were destined to be implanted in Elsa Rios, wife of Mario Rios. A previous embryo implant had been unsuccessful, and the Rios es wanted to have another chance at becoming parents. But before they had a second chance to try, the Rioses perished in an airplane crash. What was the Australian hospital to do with the frozen embryos? Could they be implanted in someone else? There were numerous volunteers. Were the embryos somehow entitled to the Rioses' substantial estate? Or should the embryos be destroyed? The Rioses, understandably, had made no provision for the embryos' future. The Australians set up a commission to study the matter. Last week, the commission made its report. The embryos should be thawed, the panel said, because donation of embryos to someone else would require the consent of the \"producers,\" and no such consent had been given. The panel also held that the embryos in their present state had no life or rights and thus could be destroyed. The commission members were conscious of treading on slippery legal and ethical grounds. Therefore, they urged that three months be allowed for public opinion to respond to the commission recommendation. Should there be an overwhelming outcry against destroying the embryos, the commission would reconsider. Couples now enrolling in Sydney's Queen Victoria hospital for in vitro fertilization programs must specify what should be done with the embryos if something happens to them. This assures that a situation similar to the Rioses won't recur. But what of other complex questions? In France, a woman recently had to go to court to be allowed to bear a child from her deceased husband's frozen sperm. How should such a request be handled? What should be done if a surrogate mother br eaks her child-bearing contract and refuses to give up the infant she had promised to bear for someone else? Our society has failed so far to come up with enforceable rules for curbing the destructive potential of atomic power. We are reaping the nightmarish harvest for that failure. The possibilities of misuse of scientists' ability to advance or retard procreation are manifold. Ethical and legal boundaries need to be set before we stray too far.

NEW RULES SCORING 2 QUESTION INTENT: Developing an Interpretation Full credit Code 2: Mentions at least TWO of the following: (1) When the Rioses died, there was a controversy over what was to be done with the embryos. [Don't accept controversies in paragraph 4 (e.g., \"What was the hospital to do with the frozen embryos?\" \"Were the embryos entitled to the estate?\") unless the respondent explicitly links these controversies to the death of the embryo donors (the Rioses).] (2) A woman in France had to go to court to be allowed to use her deceased husband's sperm. (3) What should the rules be for a surrogate mother who refused to give up the infant she bore? It showed a need for the producer to specify what should be done to the embryos if something happens to them, and for laws about what is to be done should a surrogate mother refuse to give up the child. Partial credit Code 1: Mentions ONE of the examples given above relating to bio-technology ((1), (2) or (3)) AND (the destructive potential of) atomic power. No credit Code 0: Other responses.

[Unclear which part of the article these refer to. If both about Rios case, disallowed (see paragraph 2 under Code 1). If French case is referred to in the se cond point, it is a misinterpretation since the wife is not \"someone else\".] Code 9: Missing. Note: The following is for information only.
