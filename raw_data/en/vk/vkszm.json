HOCATT stands for \"Hyperthermic Ozone and Carbonic Acid Transdermal Technology,\" and the machine acts as an ozone steam sauna in which you sit with just your head exposed to the air, while your body receives the benefits of an infusion of ozone, carbon dioxide, steam, photon light, and oxygen\u2014all while undergoing pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF). While I was there, the proprietor of La Casa, Dr. Jane Goldberg\u2014a New York-based psychoanalyst and holistic health consultant\u2014commented that she wasn't too concerned about the mild amount of ozone one might breathe in while using this device. I asked her why, and she handed me a book. The book is called [The Hormesis Effect: The Miraculous Healing Power of Radioactive Stones](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/hormesiseffect-book). Yep, I know. Woo-woo alert. But on the plane ride home from New York, I read the book, and it was actually quite compelling. Turns out that for thousands of years people have been treating pain, injuries, and disease with low-radioactive stones. In The Hormesis Effect, Dr. Goldberg and her co-author, the late Jay Gutierrez (a noted Native American healer and CEO of [Night Hawk Minerals](https://nighthawkminerals.com) in Pritchett, Colorado) talk about rediscovering a forgotten ancient science that was supposedly once well-known to our ancestors: the healing power of low-level radioactivity. It also turns out that the concept of using low-dose radiation for therapeutic purposes, called in medical literature \"radiation hormesis,\" has 100 years of solid scientific research behind it, and thousands of medical studies to support it. It is easy, affordable, and highly effective. If you're like most people, you're afraid of radiation, and all it implies. Yet, in other countries all over the world, millions of people have benefited from using low-level radiation on everything from tennis elbow, joint pain and arthritis, to far more serious illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, spinal meningitis, autism, stroke, macular degeneration, heart disease, and cancer. The book discusses an inexpensive delivery system that can bring this powerful, proven healing modality directly to you within the comfort of your own home: the concept of radiation hormesis and low-level radioactive natural stones. So could radiation actually cause you to live longer and be healthier? That's exactly what we discuss in this podcast. [Dr. Jane G. Goldberg](http://drjanegoldberg.com/), Ph.D. is a licensed psychologist, a certified psychoanalyst, and an oncological psychoanalyst (having worked extensively with cancer patients). She is a Stone Carrier-Medicine Woman of the Nemenhah Native American Tribe. She is one of the founding conceptualizers of the application of psychoanalysis to group therapy. She is the author of 8 books, as well as writer and creator of a holistic newsletter called [Musings From 20th Street](http://www.musingsfrom20thst.com/). She owns and operates two holistic centers: [La Casa Spa and Wellness New York](http://www.lacasaspa.com/) (the oldest wellness center in NYC) and [La Casa Spa and Wellness Puerto Rico](http://lacasaspaandwellnesspuertorico.com/) in the El Yunque rain forest (established in 1986). For several years, she had her own television show called [The Really Real Reality Group Therapy TV Show](http://drjanegoldberg.com/the-really-real-reality-group-therapy-show/). She is also a documentary filmmaker, having produced and directed \"Because People Are Dying\" (watch [part 1 here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUf22K8vK2w&feature=youtu.be) and [part 2 here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZa7iG2eSaM&feature=youtu.be)), a film about radiation hormesis. Her latest project, about to be launched (but delayed by COVID-19), is a unique brain enhancement program called [Brainercize](https://brainercize.wordpress.com/the-science/). Accompanying the launch will be the publication of her most recent book, The Revolutionary Mind Project. Also, soon to be published is her book, co-authored with Karliin Brooks, on biohacking called Biohacking WW (Women's World).
