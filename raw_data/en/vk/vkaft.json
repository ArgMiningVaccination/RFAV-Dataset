Development Process : The original writing and development team comprised of professional staff representing the Coalition organizations (Rosalind Kalb, Kathleen Costello, June Halper, Lisa Skutnik and Robert Rapp) developed a draft for review and input by nine externa l reviewers (Brenda Banwell, Aliza Ben -Zacharia, James Bowen, Cohen, Bruce Cree, Dhib -Jalbut, Daniel Kantor, Flavia Nelson and Nancy Sicotte). The reviewers, selected for their experience and expertise in MS clinical care and research, were ch arged with ensuring the accuracy, completeness and fair balance of the content. The revised paper was then submitted for review by the medical advisors of the Coalition member organizations . The final paper, inco rporating feedback from these advisors, was endorsed by all Coalition members, and subsequently by Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), and published in November 2014. Updates with Reviews by External Reviewers and ACTRIMS for their Endorsement : March 2015 July 2016 March 2017 September 2018 June 2019 Conclusions : Based on a comprehensive review of the current evidence, the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition * states the following: Treatment Considerations: Initiation of treatment with an FDA -approved disease -modifying therapy is recommended: - As soon as possible following a diagnosis of relapsing multiple sclerosis, regardless of the person's age. Relapsing MS includes: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS): People with a first clinical event and MRI features consistent with MS in whom other possible causes have been excluded relapsing -remitting MS active secondary progressive MS with clinical relapses or inflammatory acti vity on MRI. - For individuals with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, with an agent approved for this phenotype Clinicians should consider prescribing a high efficacy medication such as alemtuzumab, cladribine, fingolimod, natalizumab or ocrelizumab for newly diagnosed individuals with highly active MS. Clinicians should also consider prescribing a high efficacy me dication for individuals who have breakthrough activity on another disease -modifying therapy, regardless of the number of previously used agents. * The Multiple Sclerosis Coalition was founded in 2005 to increase opportunities for cooperation and provide greater opportunity to leverage the effective use of resources for the benefit of the MS community. Member organizations include Accelerated Cure, Can Do Multiple Sclerosis, Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers, International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis Nurses, Multiple Sclerosis Association of America, Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, National Multiple Sclerosis Society and United Spinal Association. MS Views and News serves as an affiliate member (since 2015). 3 Treatment with a given disease -mod ifying medication should be continued indefinitely unless any of the following occur - in which case an alternative disease -modifying therapy should be considered: - Sub-optimal treatment response as determined by the individual and his or her treating clini cian - Intolerable side effects, including significant laboratory abnormalities - Inadequate adherence to the treatment regimen - Availability of a more appropriate treatment option - The healthcare provider and patient determine that the benefits no longer ou tweigh the risks Movement from one disease -modifying therapy to another should occur only for medically appropriate reasons as determined by the treating clinician and patient. When evidence of additional clinical or MRI activity while on consistent treatment suggests a s ub-optimal response, an alternative regimen (e.g., different mechanism of action) should be considered to optimize therapeutic benefit. The factors affecting choice of therapy at any point in the disease course are complex and most appropriately analyzed and addressed through a shared decision -making process between the individual and his or her treating clinician. Neither an arbitrary restriction of choice nor a mandatory escalation therapy approach is supported by data. Access Considerations: Due to si gnificant variability in the MS population, people with MS and their treating clinicians require access to the full range of treatment options for several reasons: - MS clinical phenotypes may respond differently to different disease -modifying therapies. - Different mechanisms of action allow for treatment change in the event of a sub -optimal response. - Potential contraindications limit options for some individuals. - Risk tolerance varies among people with MS and their treating clinicians. - Route of delivery, freq uency of dosing and side effects may affect adherence and quality of life. - Individual differences related to tolerability and adherence may necessitate access to different medications within the same class. - Pregnancy and breastfeeding limit the available o ptions. Individuals' access to treatment should not be limited by their frequency of relapses, level of disability, or personal characteristics such as age, sex or ethnicity. Absence of relapses while on treatment is a characteristic of treatment effective ness and should not be considered a justification for discontinuation of treatment. Treatment should not be withheld during determination of coverage by payers as this puts the patient at risk for recurrent disease activity. 4 Contents ABSTRACT ................................ and CNS 6 OVERVIEW AGENTS IN MS ................................ ....................... 8 DISEASE -MODIFYING THERAPY CONSIDERATIONS ................................ ................................ .................... 14 Disease Factors Highlighting the Importance of Early Treatment ................................ ........................... 14 Evidence Demonstrating the Impact of Treatment Following a First Clinical Event ............................. 17 Evidence Demonstrating the Impact of Treatment on Relapsing MS ................................ ...................... 17 Head -to-head comparison data in relapsing MS ................................ ................................ ........................ 26 Evidence Demonstrating the Impact of Treatment on Progressive MS ................................ ................... 27 Evidence Supporting the Need for Treatment to be Ongoing ................................ ................................ ... 29 Use of diatric MS ................................ ................................ ................ 30 Treatment Considerations in Women and Men in Their Reproductive Years ................................ ........ 31 Rationale for Access to the Full Range of Treatment Options ................................ ................................ .. 33 CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH MS ................................ ................................ .. 39 Treatment ................................ .......................... 0 Appendix B: 2017 M cDonald Criteria of Multiple Sclerosis ................................ .......... 4 APPENDIX C: Treatments Used Off -Label for Multiple Sclerosis ................................ 70 THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS COALITION ................................ ................................ ................................ ........ 79 5 INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and degenerative changes. Most people with MS experience relapses and remissions of neurological symptoms, particularly early in the disease, and clinical events are usually associated with areas of CNS inflammation .1-4 Gradual worsening or progression, with or without subsequent acute attacks of inflammation or radiological activity, may be present very early, but usually becomes more prominent over time. 5 While traditionally viewed as a disease solely of CNS white matter, more advanced imaging techniques have demonstrated significant early and ongoing CNS gray matter damage as well .6-9 Those diagnosed with MS may have many fluctuating and disabling symptoms (including, but not limited to, fatigue, impaired mobility, mood and cognitive changes, pain and other sensory problems, visual disturbances and elimination dysfunction), resulting in a sig nificant impact on quality of life for patients and their families. As the most common non -traumatic, disabling neurologic disorder of young adults - a group not typically faced with a chronic disease - MS threatens personal autonomy, independence, dignity and life planning, 10 potentially limiting the achievement of life goals. The free -spirited spontaneity so highly valued by young adults needs to shift to purposeful planning, taking into account the challenges posed by fluctuations in function and an unce rtain future. The patient's self -definition, roles and relationships may be co -opted by the need to adapt to an unpredictable disease requiring frequent healthcare visits, periodic testing and costly medications. Compared to patients with other chronic di seases, those diagnosed with MS have diminished ratings in health, vitality and physical functions, and experience limitations in social roles 11 Productivity and participation are affected for many, including early departure from the workforce and inabilit y to fulfill household responsibilities .12 In a study of disease burden, based on data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) - a public access, large -scale database that links direct cost information with information on productivity and health -related quality of life - Campbell and colleagues found that annual direct healthcare costs for people with MS were $24,327 higher than for the general population. In addition, people with MS had a significantly higher risk of being unemployed, spent signif icantly more time in bed, and lost on average 10.04 quality -adjusted life years compared to the general population. In a systematic review of 48 cost -of-illness studies, medications were the main expense for those with milder disease while loss of income c ombined with informal care needs contributed the biggest costs for those with more advanced disease .13,14 Furthermore, registry studies specific to MS and large population cohort studies of individuals untreated with a disease -modifying therapy have demons trated a reduced life expectancy of 8 -12 years .15 Epidemiology, Demographics, Disease Course It is estimated that there are more than two million people with MS worldwide 16 with the number approaching 1,000,000 in the United States. 17 Women are affected at least three times mor e than men 18 and Caucasians are affected more than other racial groups. 19 However, a recent study 20 suggested that African -American women have a higher than previously reported risk of developing MS and several studies have suggested that African - Americans 21-25 and Hispanics 26-30 may have a more active, rapidly progre ssive disease course . MS is typically diagnosed in early adulthood, but the age range for disease onset is wide with both pediatric cases and new onset in older adults. Historically, a geographic gradient has been observed with a higher incidence of MS wit h increased distance from the equator. 31,32 However, some recent studies have not demonstrated the same latitudinal gradient, 33,34 suggesting either a change in regional risk determinants for MS or a broadening of the prevalence and recognition of MS worldwide. The course of MS v aries . However, 85-90 percent of individuals demonstrat e a relapsing pattern at onset, which transitions over time in most untreated patients to a pattern of progressive worsening with few or no relapses or MRI activity (secondary progressive MS). Approximately 10 -15 percent present with a relatively steady progression of symptoms over time (primary progressive MS), of which some will subsequently experience inflammatory activity by clinical or MRI criteria. 1,2 This primary progressive course is generally diagnosed at an older age , is typically spinal cord -predominant, and is distributed more equally in men and women. The 2013 revisions to the MS clinical course descriptions 1 further characterize relapsing and progressive MS as active (new relapse s and/or new MRI activity) or not active , and worsening (disability progression) or stable based on clinical and MRI criteria . (See Appendix A for a full description of the revised disease courses). 6 Prior to the era of disease modifying treatments, approximately half of patients diagnosed with relapsing MS would progress to secondary progressive MS by 10 years, and 80 -90 percent would do so by 25 years. 35-37 Approximately half of patients would no longer be able to walk unaided by 15 years. 36 More recent data in the era of disease -modifying therapy demonstrate that the percentage of patients with relapsing MS who develop secondary -progressive MS may now be 15 -30 percent .38 Inflammation and CNS Damage At present, much of the CNS damage in MS is believed to result from an immune -mediated process. Although the cause of the immunological changes is not complete ly understood, Vitamin -D deficiency, which is commonly present in MS, is thought to enhance inflammation. Gut dysbiosis is also thought to contribute to MS pathogenesis through mechanisms that have yet to be defined. 39 This immune -mediated process includes components of the innate immune system (including macrophages, natural killer cells and others) as well as adaptive immune system activation of certain lymphocyte populations in peripheral lymphoid organs. 40 CD4+ lymphocytes , CD8+ lymphocytes and B lymphocytes are activated in the peripheral lymph tissues. Antigen presentation to na\u00efve CD4+ lymphocytes causes differe ntiation into various T lymphocyte cell populations, depending on the antigen presented, the cytokine environment and the presence of co-stimulatory molecules. The T lymphocyte cell populations include Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes (which are associated with a variety of inflammatory cytokines that activate macrophages and opsonizing antibodies) and Th2 lymphocytes and T regulatory cells (which drive humoral immunity or secrete anti -inflammatory cytokines). 40-42 In people with MS, there is a bias towards a Th1 and Th17 environment with T regulatory dysfunction that allows inflammation to predominate. 43 Secreted cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases disrupt the blood -brain barrier. 44 This disruption, along with up -regulation of adhesion molecules on blood vessel endothelium and activation of T cells, allows T cells to gain entry into the CNS, where additional activation takes place that initiates a damaging inflammatory cascade of events within the CNS. Multiple inflammatory cells become involved, including microglial cells and macrophages. In addition to CD4+ activation, CD8+ T lymphocytes have also been ident ified as important contributors to damaging CNS inflammation, and in fact have been identified by numerous researchers as the predominant T cell present in active MS lesions. 45 Mechanisms of remission and rec overy are not fully understood but are believed to be mediated by the expansion of regulatory cells that downregulate inflammation such as Foxp3 positive cells, Tr1 Th3 or oligodendroglia and remyelination contribute to recovery at least in the early stages of the disea se.46 Further contributions to CNS damage in MS are associated with B cell activation. B cells function as antigen presenting cells and also produce antibodies and pro -inflammatory cytokines that have damaging effects on myelin, oligodendrocytes and other neuron al structures. 47 The importance of B cells in MS immunopathogenesis is supported by the consistent finding of oligoclonal immunoglobulins in the CSF ; the successful clinical trials with B cell depleting monoclonal antibodies ( rituximab and more recently ocrelizumab) that showed efficacy in RRMS and a subset of patients with primary progressive disease ; and the presence of B -cell enriched meningeal follicles in progressive patients .48 Recent studies have also revealed that mit ochondrial damage, possibly as a result of free radical, reactive oxygen species and nitrous oxide (NO) activity associated with activated microglia, and iron deposition occur in MS , and make a significant contribution to demyelination and oligodendrocyte damage. 49-51 Immune -mediated responses leading to inflammation, with secretion of inflammatory cytokines, activation of microglia, T and B cel l activity, mitochondrial damage and inadequate regulatory function, are believed to be at least partially responsible for demyelination, oligodendrocyte loss and axonal damage - all of which occur in acute inflammatory lesions .51,52 Axons that survive acute attacks may require increase d energy to compensate for damage leading to later death from metabolic stress. 51 Axonal loss, which correlates best with disability, begins early in the disease process as evidenced by identified pathological changes as well as imaging studies .52,53 7 Figure 1: Inflammatory cascade in multiple sclerosis Blood Brain BarrierPeriphery CNS 1.

Cognit ive impairment and fatigue are common early in the disease process and cause disability independent of physical function. In addition, common physical comorbidities in MS are associated with persistent fatigue, and depression at baseline is associated with worsening fatigue over time. 81 3) Prognosis at the individual level remains highly variable and unpredictable. 4) Adherence to treatment is important to efficacy and may be impacted by a wide range of factors requiring early identification and interventio n. In 2018, the American Academy of Neurology published the Practice Guideline: Disease -Modifying Therapies for Adults with Multiple Sclerosis. The Guideline provides evidence -based recommendations for starting, switching and stopping disease -modifying agents . These recommendations consider the patient's perspective in the complex decision -making process in order to enhance shared decision -making. Refer to the full Guideline at AAN.com/gui delines .82 In the same year, ECTRIMS and the EAN (European Academy of Neurology) published the ECTRIMS/EAN Guideline on the Pharmacological Treatment of People with Multiple Sclerosis. 83 Refer to this guideline for additional expert recommendations for the adult MS population. 15 Disease Factors Highlighting the Importance of Early Treatment The goal of disease -modifying treatment is to reduce the early clinical and sub -clinical disease activity that is thought to contribute to long -term disability. 84,85 The following points highlight the importance of early treatment: Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration occur simultaneously throughout the disease course It ha d long been thought that MS was characterized by early inflammatory damage followed by later neurodegeneration. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that inflammation and degeneration occur simultaneously, that clinical recovery reflects reserve capacity, and that subclinical damage ultimately lead s to permanent clinical deficits. Evidence also indicate s that inflammation contributes to worsening progression, even if not the sole cause. Hence, inflammation and degeneration are inter -related rather than independent .86,87 Additional evidence to support neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative changes throughout the disease process include s: - Early in MS, new MRI activity, evidenced by gadolinium (Gd) enhancement, occurs approximately 7 -10 times more frequently than clinical activity. 88 - Early in th e disease process, a dvanced MRI techniques demonstrate a bnormalities in normal appearing white matter as well as gray matter in the absence of focal lesions seen on conventional imaging .7 - Brain atrophy has be en identified in early MS, even at the time of the first clinical attack. 85 - Atrophy has been seen in radio logically isolated syndrome ( RIS - the incidental finding of MS -like lesions in the absence of known clinical r elapses 90).91 - Inflammatory activity has been observed in patients with both relapsing and progressive forms of the disease. 3 Given the evidence that inflammation and neurodegeneration are interrelated and occur throughout the disease process, p rompt initiation and optimization of treatment help to minimize early inflammation and axonal damage. Individuals with a first clinical event accompanied by MRI findings consistent with MS have a high probability of experiencing further clinical disease a ctivity The term \"clinically -isolated syndrome\" (CIS) has been used to describe a first episode of neurologic symptoms that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation and demyelination in one or more sites in the CNS. Eighty percent of the p lacebo -treated patients in the four published p hase III CIS trials with injectable medications had subsequent clinical events, which was defined at the time as conversion to clinically -definite MS (CDMS). 92-95 Follow -up data for these patients indicated a variable disease course, with approximately one-third having minimal clinical relapses and physical disability after 15 -20 years , but 42 -50 percent converting to secondary progressive (SPMS) with increasing disability. 96,97 Furthermore, baseline MRI findings in CIS predicted the development of definite MS as defined at the time. Lesion volume and the rate of lesion development earlier in the disease course were found to correlate with disability after 20 years. 97 The importance of delaying and limiti ng additional relapses early in the disease process was further supported by a CIS trial with teriflunomide 98 published in 2014. The 201 7 revision of the McDonald diagnostic criteria (see Appendix B) facilitated an earlier diagnosis of MS based on a first clinical event , and MRI findings demonstrating dissemination in space and time. 99 Using these newer criteria, many individuals in the early CIS trials would already have been diagnosed with MS. Although the term \"CIS\" may be nearly obsolete today, th e importance of delaying and limiting additional relapses early in the disease process remains clear. Based on data from the published CIS trials, prompt identification of early relapsing patients with little or no disability is essential in order to achi eve the best possible short - and long -term outcomes. 85 16 Individuals with RIS are at significant risk for subsequent clinical disease activity Although RIS is not currently recognized as a separate MS phenotype (see Appendix A), e merging data 100,101 suggest that within five years, 30 percent of patients with an RIS presentation develop a symptomatic clinical event and two -thirds demonstrate new lesions on MRI. 90,102 -104 In these studies, younger individuals with RIS and spinal cord lesions, CS F inflammatory markers, abnormal visual evoked potentials, and/or contrast enhancing MRI lesions were more likely to have a subsequent symptomatic CNS demyelinating event. Notably , nearly 10 percent of people with RIS were found to have a progressive cour se, thereby fulfilling criteria for PPMS. 90,105 And, 20 -30 percent of RIS patients demonstrate cognitive changes similar to those seen in patients with RRMS. 106-108 In their review of these data, Lebrun and colleagues 100 as well as Labiano - Fontcuberta and Benito -Leon 101 recommended further study of RIS before a general recommendation for treatment can be made. Early disease activity and disease course appear to impact long -term disability Debate is ongoing about the ways and extent to which early disease activity impacts long -term disability. - Some evidence suggests that early disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 109 is the result of residual impairments from partially -resolved relapses. 84,110 -112 Natural history studies suggest that relapses in the first two years of disease impact early progression, 113 with the impact of early relapses diminishing later in the disease course. 114 However, Jokubaitis and colleagues found the effect of relap ses on disability accrual in a treated cohort of patients to be significant, even for relapses that occurred >14 years after disease onset , although earlier relapses had the greatest impact .115 - The onset and evolution of SPMS - in which inflammatory attacks decrease - also appear to have an important association with long -term disability. 116 From this perspective, earlier SPMS onset is a primary predictor of disability, which means that a person's prognosis is essentially determined befor e progressive symptoms become predominant. - Data from both early and late in the disease course highlight the impact of early disease activity on long - term outcomes. In patients identified as having CIS, Brex and colleagues 117 found that increases in lesio n volume on MRI in the first five years of the disease correlate with the degree of long -term disability. Data from the 16 -year follow -up cohort study of the pivotal trial of interferon beta -1b suggest that long -term physical and cognitive outcomes may be determined early in the disease. 118 Given the medications that are currently available - all of which primarily target inflammation - the optimal window for impacting long -term disability is during the early relapsing phase of the disease, with the goal being to slow the accumulation of lesion volume, decrease the number of relapses , and prevent disability from both unresolved relapses and disease progression. 84 Cognitive changes, depression and fatigue occur very early in the disease process It is currently recognized that approximately 60-65 percent of people with MS will experience cognitive impairment; 119 36-54 percent will experience a major depressive diso rder; 120 and up to 92 percent will experience significant fatigue, 121 contributing to increased disability and reduction in quality of life. - Evidence is accumulating that approximately 20 -30 percent of people with a first clinical event have already expe rienced cognitive changes. 122-128 In fact, cognitive deficits similar to those seen in RRMS have been found in 20 -30 percent of individuals with RIS .106-108 - Some studies suggest that cognitive deficits may precede the onset of MS by as much as 1.2 years. 122 More specifically, verbal deficits have been shown to occur early and may predict the presence of cognitive impairment in people with a first clinical even t.124 - Early cognitive changes are also known to progress, even in people with little or no physical changes, 127 and deterioration can be expected over a three -year period in approximately one -third of people with short disease duration. 129 - Cognitive deficits are detected in approximately 30 percent of pediatric MS patients. 130-132 - Depression a nd fatigue have been found along with cognitive deficits in early MS, with each having a significant impact on quality of life, employment and other important activities of daily life 130,131 - findings that highlight the importance of early treatment to help preserve people's ability to remain optimally engaged in everyday activities, including employment and social interactions. 85,127 17 So-called \"benign MS\" may not be benign for many people The most common working definition of \"benign MS\" - an EDSS <3 at 10 years 135 - is highly weighted for patients' motor abilities and fails to capture non -motor components of the disease, particularly mood, cognition and fatigue. - In one cohort of individuals meeting the criteria for \"benign MS,\" 45 percent were found to be cognitively impaired, 49 percent had significant fatigue, and 54 percent were found to be depressed. 136 - In another cohort of people with \"benign MS \" followed for 10.9 additional years, 81 percent (35/43) developed higher EDSS scores, cognitive impairment, pain and /or depression, as well as a significant increase in new or enlarging T2 lesions and gadolinium -enhancing lesions over time. 137 - Sayao and colleagues evaluated disease status in a \"benign MS\" cohort after 20 years and found that while 51 percent remained benign, 2 1 percent had progressed to EDSS > 6 and 23 percent had converted to SPMS. The authors concluded that appropriate criteria fo r determining which individuals will have a truly benign course of the disease have not yet been identified. 138 Based on these findings, benign MS can only be diagnosed retrospectively, after a minimum of 20 years . Therefore, the term should only be applied - if at all - in retrospect, and any decision to delay treatment for a given individual needs to take into account non -motor as well as motor variables. 139 Evidence Demonstrating the Impact of Treatment Following a First Clinical Event Although no ne of the available treatments are fully effective in stopping MS disease activity or disease progression, evidence points to the favorable impact of treatment following a first clinical event: Delaying conversion to CDMS Each of four published placebo -controlled p hase III trials of injectable medications 92-95 in patients with CIS , 92-95 as well as the CIS trial with teriflunomide , 98 demonstrated that early treatment successfully delayed conversion to CDMS (as defined at the time of these trials) by 37-45 percent at two to three years compared with placebo. The eight -year, open -label follow -up of the early intervention study with interferon beta -1b, which compared the immediate treatment group with the delayed treatment (placebo) group, further demonstrated a reduced risk of CDMS and longer median time to CDMS in the early treatment group, 140 although the greatest differences occu rred in the first year of treatment. A follow -up open -label phase of the early intervention study with glatiramer acetate demonstrated a reduced risk of CDMS and a delay in conversion to CDMS in the immediate treatment group as compared with the delayed tr eatment (placebo) group. 141 Reducing brain atrophy and disability worsening In meta -analys es of CIS treatment trials, each of two years duration (ETOMS, PreCISe, TOPIC) , 92,98,142 the rate of brain atrophy was attenuated after one year of treatment. 143 In a large cohort of CIS patients, disease -modifying treatments reduced 3 -month confirmed and 12 -month sustained disability worsening. 144 Evidence Demonstrating the Impact of Treatment on Relapsing MS Each of the approved disease -modifyin g therapies has been shown to provide significant benefit s in relapsing forms of MS . Due to differences in patient cohorts, trial designs and outcome measures, as well as changes in diagnostic criteria, these data should not be used to compare efficacy between specifi c agents except where they are compared in the same trial . 18 Impact on clinical outcomes (relapse rates and disability progression) Table 2: Disease -modifying therapies: pivotal trial data on relapse rate and disability progression (in alphabetical order within route of administration) .* Primary outcomes are identified with a +.

MS relapses produce a measurable and sustained impact on disability .112,115 While it re mains unclear the extent to which reducing relapses impacts long -term disability levels, it is evident that relapse reduction translates into increased comfort and quality of life, fewer days lost from work and other essential activities of daily life, and reduces the risk of residual deficits. 112,161 Impact on MRI parameters MRI is a sensitive indicator of disease activity in relapsing forms of MS that can detect new lesions and predict risk of future clinical changes. Brain MRI is now recommended at least annually for patients with relapsing MS to more accurately measure dise ase activity and inform therapeutic decision -making - and more often as needed to address specific clinical questions .1,162 The 2018 Revised Guidelines of the Consortium of MS Centers MRI Protocol for the Diagnosis and Follow -up of MS provides detailed recommendations for the use of MRI in CIS, diagnosis, and ongoing MS management. 163 21 Table 3: Disease -modifying therapies: pivotal trial data on MRI parameters (listed alphabetically within route of administration)* Agent - Self -Injected Effect on G d+ data) 40mg tiw 146 29% reduction in mean total # of new contrast enhancing lesions: 36.8 placebo; 25.96 GA 20mg 11 GA 20mg (p=0.003) Cumulative number 13.7 placebo; 9.4 GA 20mg (p<0.003) 164 not reported in PI Cumulative new or enlarging T2 at months lesions per patient per scan: 2.25 placebo; 0.5 44mcg dose (p<0.0001) 60 Median percent change of Mean number of contrast -enhancing lesions at two years: 1.65 placebo; 0.80 treated (p=0.05) Median percent change T2 lesion volume from study entry to year 2: -6.55% placebo; -13.2% treated (N.S.) interferon beta -1b 61 No Gd outcomes from p hase III pivotal trial Median percent change in MRI area (n=52, scans q contrast enhancing lesions at 48 wks: 1.4 placebo; 0.2 treated (p<0.0001) Mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions at 48 wks: 10.9 placebo; 3.6 treated (p<0.0001) Agent - Oral Effect on Gd Effect on per patient per scan: 0.91 placebo; 0.12 treated (3.5 mg group) (p<0.001) Mean number active T2 lesions per patient per scan: 1.4 3 0.38 treated (3.5 mg group) fumarate 150,151 1: Mean number two years: 1.8 placebo; 0.1 240mg bid dose (p<0.0001) 150 Study 2: Mean numbe r of Gd+ lesions at two years: 2.0 placebo; 0.5 240mg bid dose (p<0.0001) 151 Study 1: Mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions at two years: 17 placebo; 2.6 240mg bid dose (p<0.0001) 150 Study 2: Mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions at two years: placebo; 5.1 240mg dose (p<0.0001) Study 1: Mean number of T1 + at month 24: 1.1 placebo; 0.2 0.5mg dose (p<0.001) 152 Study 2: Mean number of T1 Gd + lesions at month 24: 1.2 placebo; 0.4 0.5mg dose (p<0.0001) 153 Study 1: Mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions over 24 months: 9.8 placebo; 2.5 0.5mg dose (p<0.001) 152 Study 2: Mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions over 24 months: 8.9 placebo; 2.3 0.5mg dose (p<0.0001) 153 siponimod 71 Cumulative number of G d lesions up to/including month 24 (adjusted mean): 0.60 placebo; 0.08 treated (p<0.0001) Mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions over all visits (adjusted mean): 3.60 placebo; 0.70 treated (p<0.0001) teriflunomide 0.261 14mg (p<0.0001) 155 Median change from baseline in total lesion volume (ml) (T1+T2) at Enlarging (compared to 44mcg tiw) Percent of patients with Gd + lesions at 24 months (tertiary outcome): Study 1: with Study (p=0.022) Change in number of (month 24 Median number Gd+ lesions at two years: 0 placebo; 0 treated Percent with two or more lesions: 16% placebo; 1% treated placebo 1.2; 0.1 (p<0.001) 158 Median number new or enlarging T2 lesions at two years: 5 0 treated (p<0.001) Mean number new or enlarging T2 lesions at MS: comparison Relapsing MS : Mean number of T1 Gd + ocrelizumab 0.016: of new and/or enlarging T2 lesions : Study 1 : 1.413 IFN; 0.323 ocrelizumab: 77% 0.325 ocrelizumab: 83% relative reduction (p<0.0001) 159 Primary progressive MS : Study 3: Mean change in volume (cm 3) of T2 lesions from baseline to week 120: 0.79 placebo; - 0.39 treated (p<0.0001) 80 Mean percent change in brain volume from week 24 to 120: -1.09 placebo; -0.90 treated (p=0.02) 160 agent: Copaxone (201 9), Glatopa (201 9), Avonex (201 9), Plegridy (201 9), Rebif (201 9), Betaseron (201 9), Extavia (201 9), Gilenya (201 9), Aubagio (2019), Tecfidera (201 Lemtrada (201 Novantrone 54,55,57,60 -63,66,68-70,72,74,78 -80 *Comparison across clinical trials is unreliable due to differences in patient populations, diagnostic definitions, primary and secondary endpoints, and outcome metrics. After the pivotal trials, several investigations have demonstrated an impact of treatment on the evolution of persistent T1 hypointens ities (known as \"black holes\") - which are associated with disability as measured by EDSS and considered to be indicative of tissue damage - and on changes in brain volume: In a placebo -controlled trial with monthly cerebral MRI, glatiramer acetate was sho wn to limit the evolution of newly formed lesions into chronic black holes. 165 In a p hase III trial comparing BG -12 with placebo, which also included glatiramer acetate as an active reference arm , BG-12 and glatiramer acetate significantly reduced the numbers of new T1 hypointense lesions as compared with placebo. 151 Data analysis from phase III clinical trials and subsequent studies demonstrate a variable effect on brain atrophy . 75,76,152,166 -172 Table 4 summariz es the impact of disease -modifying therapies on brain volume loss 23 (BVL) in relapsing -remitting patients in p hase III clinical trials - with the following caveats: comparisons across studies cannot be made due to differences in assessment measures and study design; and current methods of MRI brain atrophy quantification provide sufficient precision for cohort stu dies but are not adequate for assessing changes in individual patients over months or a few years. Of note, in a two -year, placebo -controlled trial, brain atrophy was greater in year one and less in year two in natalizumab -treated patients, 145 leading so me researchers to suggest that the brain atrophy seen in year one may have been \"pseudoatrophy\" - a reduction in sub -clinical inflammation in response to treatment. However, De Stefano and Arnold 173 assert that a complete understanding of pseudoatrophy req uires further study to clarify the possible underlying pathology.

They found that disease progression in patients with moderately advanced and advanced M S occurs irrespective of prior disease activity and that lower relapse rates and greater time on higher efficacy a de creased risk of further disability progression. 190 A retrospective cohort study of 84 RRMS patients treated with natalizumab or INFB -1a 44 mcg tiw for at least 12 consecutive months demonstrated that both agents reduced A RR, but the effect was stronger in the natalizumab -treated group (p=0.0125). EDSS reduction favored natalizumab (p=0.0018). MRI 27 outcomes were decreased with both agents. In the seco nd year, ARR and EDSS progression were similar to year one; however, Gd -enhancing lesions decreased more significantly with natalizumab (p=0.008). 191 Nixon and colleagues used a statistical modeling approach to account for differences in baseline charact eristics and predict indirect relative risk of achieving NEDA (No Evidence of Disease Activity) status for fingolimod vs. dimethyl fumarate or teriflunomide in an average patient from their respective phase III trials. Results estimated that the relative r isk of achieving NEDA status was greater with fingolimod than with the other therapies vs. placebo in each respective trial population . 192 Evidence Demonstrating the Impact of Treatment on Progressive MS Many agents have been investigated for use in secondary progressive or primary progressive MS. 67,71,193,194 Sub- group analyses from some of these clinical trials indicated benefits in patients of younger age with more recent progression, recent relapse and/or MRI activity. 194 Mitoxantrone, which is se ldom used in the United States because of its high risk profile, has an FDA indication for secondary progressive MS. 78 Cladribine and siponimod are both indicated for active secondary progressive MS. 66,70 Only ocrelizumab has FDA approval for primary progr essive MS. 80 The remaining medications are approved for relapsing forms of MS, including progressive MS in those patients who experience relapses or MRI activity. Impact on long -term clinical outcomes In addition to being expensive and difficult, it is u nethical in the current treatment era to carry out long -term randomized controlled studies to assess the value of disease -modifying treatment compared to p lacebo on the course of MS. Hence, alternate methods for studying natural history in the treatment era need to be employed. Following a n observational cohort of people over an extended period has limitations, including non-randomized design, difficulty accounting for dropouts and , in some studies, retrospective assessments conducted on individuals seen at divergent time periods . However, important data have emerged demonstrating that early and ongoing treatment has a significant impact on long -term clinical outcomes : In a cohort observational study of 3 ,060 pati ents, disease -modifying therapies delayed long -term disability, as measured by the EDSS, in patients treated either early or, to a lesser extent, in the later phase of the disease compared to untreated patients .86 In a longitudinal prospective study of newly -diagnosed MS patients at Karolinska Hospital between 2001 - 2005, early treatment was correlated with longer time from diagnosis to EDSS >4. 195 The 10 -year follow -up of the early intervention trial with interfer on beta -1a (intramuscular) found a delayed conversion to clinically definite MS and reduced relapse rates in the early treated group compared to the delayed treatment group, but no difference in disability outcomes, most likely because both groups received treatment relatively early in the disease course. 196 In a nine -year follow -up of the pivotal p hase III teriflunomide trial (TEMSO), a positive effect on disease activity persisted in the original treatment group as well as in the placebo patients who sw itched to active treatment in the open -label extension. 197 A long -term follow -up (greater than seven years) of a p hase II fingolimod study demonstrated a persistent positive effect on relapse and MRI activity. 198 The 2 -year extension study from phase III study (CLARITY) demonstrated a sustained impact on MRI outcomes and ARR. 199, 200 Approximately 90 percent of untreated RRMS patients will have SPMS after 15-26 years. 201,202 Evidence from several studies now indi cates that disease -modifying therapies have an impact on the conversion from relapsing to progressive MS: - In a study comparing the time interval from disease onset to secondary progression in relapsing - remitting patients treated with disease -modifying the rapy and patients receiving no treatment, a signifi cantly longer time to secondary progression was seen in the treated group. 203 - A study comparing treated and untreated patients over a 10 -year period prior to the endp oint of conversion to secondary progressive MS found that treatment with a disease -modifying therapy significantly reduced the risk of disease progression in patients considered high - or low -risk at disease onset. 204 - In a study comparing patients treated with interferon beta for up to seven years with untreated patients, the treated group had a significant reduction in the incidence of secondary progression as well as in the incidence of EDSS progression. 205 28 - In a single center prospective observational study of 517 actively treated relapsing MS and CIS patients at a median time point of 16.8 years after disease onset, only 10.7 percent reached an EDSS >6.0, and 18.1 percent evolved to SPMS. 206 The impact of early treatment on other clinical outcomes is also important. Extension study data from the early treatment trial with interferon beta -1b suggest that early treatment helps to preserve cognitive function compared to delayed treatment, 207-208 with evidence suggesting that long -term (physic al and cognitive) outcomes may be largely determined early in the disease course. 118 Another study demonstrated decreased mortality in patients treated early in the course of their disease compared with those treated later, 15 a finding that needs to be confirmed with the newer agents in long -term studies. Most of the extension studies from the pivotal trials indicated a positive impact on time to a second attack or new lesions , relapse rates and disease progression, 118,140,174,207 although much of the impact has been thought to take place early in the disease course. 118 In a more recent study, using data extracted from the global MSBase Registry, Jokubait is and colleagues 115 examined median EDSS score changes in 2 ,466 relapse -onset patients initially treated with either interferon -beta or glatiramer acetate. The patients (including those who stayed on their initial treatment, those who switched to other th erapies and those who stopped treatment altogether) were treated an average of 83 percent of the follow -up period. The cumulative time on treatment was independently associated with a lower EDSS score at 10 years, demonstrating that increased exposure to treatment predicts better disability outcomes in the long -term. The authors also found that annualized relapse rate was the strongest predictor of increases in median EDSS scores, with on -therapy relapses being more predictive than off -therapy relapses - and concluded that persistent relapse activity on a first -line therapy is prognostic of increasing disability . Impact on NEDA NEDA is a term used to describe disease stability, including no new relapses, no disability progression and no new or enlarging MRI lesions. 209,210 In addition, some researchers have proposed adding no additional brain volume loss to this definition (NEDA -4). 211,212 Post -hoc analysis of several MS treatment trials has suggested that the goal of NEDA may be achievable fo r some individuals. 209,210,213 The evidence to date suggests that NEDA is difficult to sustain over the long term even with treatment. On the basis of their seven -year longitudinal study, Rotstein and colleagues conclude that NEDA status at two years may be a good predictor of long -term disease stability and may be useful as a treatment outcome in investigations of new treatments for MS. 210 However, in a prospective single center observational study of 517 actively treated relapsing MS patients, NEDA at two years was not associated with better long term measures of disability by EDSS. 206 In the 16 - and 21 -year follow -up from the pivotal tria l of interferon beta -1b study patients, NEDA based on clinical features predicted long -term disability outcome; however adding MRI changes to the NEDA criteria did not increase predictive validity. 214 Although NEDA is a compelling concept and shared goal among people with MS and their healthcare providers, no consensus has yet emerged for the role of NEDA in making clinical decisions . Imp act on quality of life Clinical and MRI outcomes do not fully capture the i mpact of MS disease -modifying therapies for people with MS. Unfortunately, efforts to assess the impact of treatment on quality of life have been limited. In one study of newly - diagnosed patients beginning treatment with an interferon medication, quality o f life scores on the MSQ oL-54 showed overall improvement at 12 months. 215 Not being on a disease -modifying therapy was one of the factors identified as contributing to a decrease in health - related quality of life in the NARCOMS database, although quality of life generally remained fairly stable for most people over the five year s of the study. 216 Health -related quality of life scores on physical and mental components of the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF -36 - a patient -reported survey of health outcomes) improved in the pivotal trials of natalizumab. 217 In the pivotal trial of dimethyl fumarate, patients on treatment evidenced a significant improvement in SF -36 physical component summary scores compared with placebo -treated patients whose scores worsened, and similar benefits were seen in other measures of functioning and gen eral well -being as early as week 24. 218 29 Early treatment to reduce loss of mobility has been shown to help preserve people's ability to carry out instrumental activities of daily living, 219 and the ability to work was found to improve after one year of t reatment with natalizumab. 220 In a review of existing data on the relationship between inflammation, patterns of CNS lesions and the effects of immunotherapeutics on MS fatigue , the disease -modifying therapies were observed to \"effectively and sustainably stabilize and ameliorate fatigue in parallel to their dampening effects on the neuroinflammatory process.\" 221 Benefits gained through early treatment may never be equaled in those whose treatment is delayed Data suggest that benefits gained through early treatment, including delay of a second clinical event or MRI activity in CIS patients, reduced relapse rates and disability, may not be equaled in those who start treatment later in the disease course, 92,94,115,196,222 -225 suggesting that pe ople who start treatment later may not \"catch up\" with those who start treatment immediately. As stated earlier however, the 10 -year follow -up to the early intervention trial with interferon beta -1a (intramuscular) found no difference in disability outcom es between the early - and delayed -treatment groups, indicating that the delayed treatment group did appear to experience a \"catch up\" in this particular outcome. 196 It remains to be determined the extent to which the older medications - and the newer medications for which we have limited long -term data - impact longer -term disability outcomes for people with MS. Similarly, 11 -year follow -up data on the CIS cohort trea ted with interferon beta -1b or placebo for up to two years prior to open label active therapy demonstrated no significant difference in EDSS outcome between groups. 226 Evidence Supporting the Need for Treatment to be Ongoing Once a disease -modifying treatment is initiated, evidence suggests that treatment needs to be ongoing for benefits to persist. Cessation of treatment has been shown to negatively impact clinical and MRI outcomes. Non -adherence and gaps in treatment are as sociated with an increased rate of relapses and progression of disability. 227,228 In a review of studies looking at treatment discontinuation, Tobin and Weinshenker concluded that discontinuation of treatment early in MS could lead to re -emergence of disease activity. The impact of treatment discontinuation in patients over the age of 60 with long -term progressive disease is less clear. 229 In a review of the adhere nce results , relapse rate and progression were greater in those who stopped injectable disease -modifying treatment , and several reviewed trials showed an increase in emergency department utilization by patients who had stopped treatment. 230 In one study, relapses and MRI activity returned to baseline following cessation of interferon therapy, although there was a several month refractory period before activity resumed. 231 In another study, active patients treated with interferon beta promptly returned to pre-treatment levels of disease activity following discontinuation of treatment, 232 leading the authors to recommend that treatment not be stopped in patients who are responding to treatment. A similar return to baseline disease activity in interferon -treated pat ients was observed in secondary progressive MS, with an increase in EDSS scores and MRI activity in the year after discontinuation of treatment. 233 Relapse rates returned to baseline following interruption of natalizumab treatment in three large studies, 234 and in a partially placebo -controlled exploratory study of disease activity during an interruption of natalizumab therapy, patients whose treatment was interrupted had an increased risk of disease and MRI activity compared with those on continuous treatment. 235 In a retrospective study of patients refractory to interferon or glatiramer who had been switched to natalizumab and then stopped it, some patients had significant relapses - indicating that simple withdrawal of this medication wi thout early implementation of an alternative treatment strategy may risk return of disease activity or rebound, typically within the first six months. 223,236 -238 In a study of 32 patients with MS who stopped natalizumab treatment, rebound was identified w ith an increase in relapses and high MRI activity compared to baseline. 239 Cessation of fingolimod after a period of stability was followed by clinical relapse and multiple enhancing lesions on MRI in two patients, 240 and both patients had a significan t worsening in EDSS score s associated with their clinical activity. In another report of six cases of fingolimod discontinuation, five patients returned to pre -treatment disease activity within three months, and one patient had both clinical and MRI reboun d activity. 241 A recent review reported five individuals experiencing increased disease activity within 4 -16 weeks following discontinuation of fingolimod therapy (10.9 percent of 46 patients discontinuing the drug during the two -year observation period) and identified 11 other reported cases of rebound disease activity. 242 30 Severe exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after discontinuation of a S1P reception modulator (fingolimod) similar to siponimod. 70 These studies and case reports illustrate the need for ongoing disease -modifying treatment in MS. Regardless of the reason for the discontinuation of treatment - a decision by the treating clinician, patient non -adherence, cost or insurance coverage issues - these findings indicate that discontinuation or interruption of treatment will provoke a return of disease activity in many people. Situations in which discontinuation of treatment might be considered While there is ample evidence to support the benef its of ongoing treatment for the majority of people with MS, there may be some situations in which clinicians and their patients might consider stopping treatment. 82 In a 2015 review of relevant studies, Tobin and Weinshenker 229 conclude that although freedom from subsequent relapse is impossible to guarantee, treatment cessation may be considered in patients who: Are over 60 years of age Have experienced a progressive disease course for five years or longe r Have no accumulating T2 lesions or gadolinium enhancing lesions on MRI of the brain or spinal cord after a period of observation over several years Earlier discontinuation, particularly in patients with active disease, may lead to increased disease activity . Clinical and MRI moni toring for recurrent disease activity is clearly warranted in those patients. Use of Disease -Modifying Therapies in Pediatric MS Studies have estimated the incidence of pediatric MS to be between 0.18 and 0.51/100,000 children per year. 243,244 Three to 10 percent of adult patients retrospectively report a possible first attack prior to age 18. 245 More than 97 percent of children and adolescents experience a relapsing -remitting disease course, 243 with annualized relapse rates 2 -3 times that of adults with MS during the first three years of disease. 246 In addition to motor and other physical symptoms that occur during relapse (and often resolve with relapse therapy) , 30-40 percent of children with MS demonstrate cognitive impairment early in th e disease course. 130-132 The interferon beta medications and glatiramer acetate have traditionally served as the initial treatment options for children with MS. 243,247 The recently completed PARADIGMS trial, a double -dummy randomized trial comparing fingolimod to interferon beta -1a by subcutaneous injection demonstrated a clear superiority of fingolimod over interferon (82 percent reduction in relapse rate). Superiority of fingolimod was also demonstrated by MRI endpoints. The FDA has now approved fingolimod for pediatric MS, the first FDA approval for any MS therapy in this age group. While data regarding how the PARADIGMS results will alter clinical practice have yet to be accrued, the option of oral therapy will appeal to many children. Safety considerations, however, must be carefully considered. Structured screening protocols, such as ensuring up to date vaccination status (not ably confirmation of vaccination against varicella zoster), ophthalmological and dermatological evaluations, and monitoring for first -dose effect bradycardia are critical. Pediatric centers may need to partner with adult MS centers to ensure consistent car e programs for fingolimod use. As in adults, however, evidence of ongoing relapses, MRI activity, and increasing disability (which is less common in pediatric MS patients) indicate the need to escalate to higher potency therapies. Considerations include switching from interferon or glatiramer acetate to oral or infused medications. 247 In one study involving 258 children over a mean observation period of 3.9 years, a little more than half were successfully managed on the first medication they were given, wh ile 25.2 percent were switched once, 11.2 percent were switched twice, and 7.8 percent required three changes in medication. While some were switched from one injectable medication to another, others required more aggressive treatment in order to control t heir disease. 247 Several retrospective analyses regarding safety and tolerability of natalizumab support the use of natalizumab in pediatric MS patients with active or aggressive disease. 248-251 Case report and case series data have advocated use of ritu ximab for patients requiring escalation of therapy, 252-254 while future study of ocrelizumab in pediatric MS patients is awaited. The importance of high quality data regarding therapeutic safety and efficacy has been emphasized 243 and pediatric clinical tr ials of all new agents are mandated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the 31 European Medicines Agency (EMA). 255-257 The PARADIGMS trial not only informed on the impact of fingolimod vs . interferon beta -1a on clinical and MRI disease activit y in pediatric MS patients, it also provided new insight into the challenges of pediatric MS clinical trials. Enrollment took longer than anticipated, a multinational site study was required owing to the rarity of pediatric MS, and the burden of rigorous clinical trial monitoring and visits challenged patients, parents and providers. Nonetheless, it is imperative to determine how best to ensure that all trials produce informative data on therapeutic safety and efficacy, and the International Pediatric Mult iple Sclerosis Study Group is preparing a working group manuscript that addresses these key considerations. It is noteworthy that access to certain medications for pediatric MS patients in some world regions may be limited by regulation. It is hoped that clinical trial data will enhance regulatory approval and access. Treatment Considerations in Women and Men in Their Reproductive Years None of the FDA -approved disease -modifying therapies are approved for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding (see Tab le 1). Several observational studies, including pregnancy registries , have been done to identify potential risks of the disease -modifying therapies for fetal development and breastfeeding (Glatiramer acetate injection) Should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Interferon beta -1a (Avonex) Interferon beta interferon ( Plegridy) Should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. AGENT \u2014ORAL PREGNANCY INFORMATION Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) Fingolimod (Gilenya) Should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Cladribine (Mavenclad) Contraindicated in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception; pregnancy should be excluded before initiation of each treatment course; women should use effective contraception (hormonal and/or barrier contraceptives) for at least 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course. Men of reproductive potential should take precautions to prevent pregnancy of their part ner during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course. Siponimod (Mayzent) Counsel female patients of childbearing age on the potential for a serious risk to the fetus and the need for effective contraception during t reatment and for at least 10 days after stopping treatment. Teriflunomide (Aubagio) Contraindicated in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception; pregnancy must be avoided during teriflunomide treatment or before completion of an 32 accelerated elimination procedure after teriflunomide treatme nt. AGENT \u2014INTRAVENOUS PREGNANCY INFORMATION Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) Should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies risk to the fetus. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming preg nant. Natalizumab (Tysabri) Natalizumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) There are no adequate data on the development risks associated with use of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) in pregnant women. *Table adapted from Academy of Neurology Practice Guideline: Disease -Modifying Therapies for Adults with Multiple Sclerosis 82 Glatiramer acetate does not cross the placenta and is likely safe for use during breastfeeding. 258 Confirming earlier findings in small studies, 261 a prospective cohort study of 246 pregnancies (from the German Multiple Sclerosis and Pregnancy Registry) , in which 151 women were exposed to glatiramer acetate and 95 were taking no disease -modifying therapy, found no impact on several major pregnancy outcomes (risk for congenital anomaly, lower birth weight, pre -term birth or spontaneous abortion). 262 Beta -interferon crosses the placenta in minimal quantities; it is unkno wn whether it is excreted in breast milk. 263 Using the same German Multiple Sclerosis and Pregnancy Registry database, a prospective study of 445 pregnancies, in which 251 women were exposed to interferon -beta and 194 were taking no disease - modifying ther apy, found no differences in mean birth weight and length, pre -term birth, spontaneous abortion or congenital anomalies. 264 Teriflunomide carries a boxed warning about the risk of teratogenicity (see Table 1). This medication crosses the placenta; it is unknown whether it is excreted in human milk. 72 A study of 105 pregnancy exposures (83 female and 22 male) to teriflunomide for varying lengths of time found no increase in spontaneous abortion rate or fetal abnormalities. 265 A rapid elimination program using oral cholestyramine over several days is recommended for women to lower teriflunomide levels to less than 0.02 \u00b5g/ml. Men taking teriflunomide should stop the medication before trying to conceive and discuss rapid elimina tion with their healthcare providers. The 2018 AAN Practice Guideline includes a Level B recommendation th at clinicians should counsel men with MS regarding the implications of their t reatment decisions for their reproductive plans before initiating treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent such as teriflunomide or cyclophosphamid e. Refer to . 82 Fingolimod crosses the placenta and is excreted in breastmilk. A pregnancy registry is ongoing and patients are advised to use effective contraception and wait at least two months before attempting conception. 69 It is unknown whether dimethyl fumarate cr osses the placenta or enters breastmilk. 68 Animal studies of teratogenicity have shown conflicting results. 259 Because of its short half -life (approximately one hour), no washout may be necessary. 68,260 Natalizumab crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. 79,258 Compared with historical controls, no significant difference has been found in the rate of fetal malformations in MS and Crohn's clinical trial programs or the Tysabri Pregnancy Exposure Registry. 266 Mitoxantrone crosses the placen ta in limited amounts and is excreted in breast milk. 78 Patients should be instructed not to become pregnant while taking mitoxantrone and for at least six months after discontinuation. 258 Alemtuzumab crosses the placenta; it is not known whether it is excreted in breast milk. Because alemtuzumab has the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants, women should be advised not to breastfe ed while on this medication . 74 There are no adequate and w ell-controlle d studies in pregnant women . 74 Ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody of an immunoglobulin G1 subtype and immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. Following administration to pregnant monkeys, at doses 2 -10 times 33 the approved human dose by weight, increased perinatal mortality, depletion of B -cell populations, renal, bone marrow and testicular toxicity were observed in the offspring. Women of childbearing age should use contraception while rece iving ocrelizumab and for six months after the last dose. There are no data on the presence of ocrelizumab in human milk; it is excreted in the milk of ocrelizumab -treated monkeys. Human IgG is excreted in human milk, and the potential for absorption of oc relizumab to result in B -cell depletion in infant s is unknown. 80 Cladribine is contraindicated in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception. 66 Women taking siponimod should use effective contraception during treatment and for 10 days after stopping treatment. 70 Although there are no data on the presence of siponimod in human milk, a study in lactating rats has shown excretion of siponimod and/or its metabolites in mil k. The current standard of care is to avoid the use of disease -modifying therapies during pregnancy and breastfeeding. 259-261,267 -270 Based on exponential decay, the commonly accepted timeframe for drug discontinuation before conception is five maximal ha lf-lives - approximately two to six weeks, 269 with two months recommended for fingolimod and at least three months fo r natalizumab . 267 However, there is increasing evidence that glatiramer acetate and interferon -beta may be continued safely during conception and pregnancy in a wom an with very active disease . 267,268,271 -273 The risks and benefits of continuing therapy during pregnancy require careful discussion , taking into account the level of disease activity, personal preferences and the patient's and doctor's risk tolerance . 274 Similarly, a discussion about the risks and benefits of postponing resumption of treatment in o rder to breastfeed is important, particularly for women who had active disease in the year p rior to conception . 260 In a recent study, natalizumab started within eight days of delivery successfully prevent ed post - partum relapses in five of six wo men with very active disease . 275 Rationale for Access to the Full Range of Treatment Options At present, 1 5 medications are FDA -approved to treat MS ( see Table 1), with ten different mechanisms of action that are thought to address distinct components of the immune -mediated disease process. These medications also differ in their route and frequency of administration as well as their side effect s and risk profiles. None of th ese medications are curative and the efficacy of any given medication varies considerably from one individual to another and for any given individual at different points in time . In addition, people with MS differ in their tolerance for different routes of administration and side effects, and clinicians and patients vary in their tolerance for risk, with risk tolerance likely undergoing shifts as the disease progresses. Access to the full range of options is essential to optimal management, for the followin g nine reasons. 1. Non -responders need access to other options The goal of treatment is to control disease activity and prevent irreversible damage as quickly and effectively as possible. When a person's medication does not provide sufficient suppression of disease activity or provides initial benefit and then ceases to do so - as determined by the individual and his or her clinician in light of continued clinical and/or MRI disease activity - the reasons for lack of efficacy need to be explore d276 and alternative options need to be considered. 84 It is known, for example, that disease activity which occurs in spite of treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate is associated with unfavorable long -term outcomes. 115, 277,278 Furthermore, MRI activity as well as relapses are key indicators of progression 279,280 and the presence of Gd -enhancing lesions has been shown to correlate with worsening disability after 15 years. 277 2. The effort to achieve NEDA requires access to the full range of treatment options To achieve NEDA or the lowest possible level of subclinical disease activity, the authors of \"Brain Health: Time Matters in M ultiple Sclerosis \" (endorsed by the MS Coalition ) recommend swift action in the face of disease activity, including consideration of switching to another disease -modifying therapy with a different mechanism of action. 281 3. Treatment with interferon beta and natalizumab is associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) Although comparisons are challenged by lack of standardization in assays and lack of consensus concerning the relevant threshold of NAb concentration, 282 the p hase III trials of the interferon beta medications, 147-149 34 as well as subsequent direct comparison studies, 283,284 have demonstrated that NAbs are a common occurrence with these medications and that there is significant variability between the medications in terms of their occurrence. Further more, the studies suggest that the presence of NAbs reduces the clinical efficacy of interferon beta - although the impact may not be clear for some time. 282 Determining the impact of NAbs for any given individual is further complicated by the fact that N Ab-positive patients may revert to NAb -negative status or fluctuate between positive and negative NAb status. 283 However, the fact remains that a person who has persistent disease activity on interferons, regardless of whether or not this is due to NAbs, requires access to non -interferon treatment options. 285,286 In two p hase III clinical trials of natalizumab, 158,287 the incidence of persistent antibody positivity associated with the drug was 6 percent . Compared with antibody -negative patients, those wi th persistent antibody positivity had a significantly higher relapse rate and more activity on MRI in both studies, as well as significantly greater disease progression in one of the studies. 288 Persistent antibody positivity was also associated in both studies with a higher incidence of infusion -related adverse events, including hypersensitivity reactions. 288 Of the 58 percent of patients in a prospective observational study of 73 consecutive patients 289 who developed NAbs , the vast majority reverted to antibody -negative status on follow -up. In this study, the presence of NAbs was inversely correlated with serum natalizumab concentration, and high antibody titers and low serum natalizumab concentrations were associated with an increase in relapses and Gd -enhancing lesions on MRI. 4. Individuals at high -risk for PML need access to other options People who are or become JC antibody -positive need access to treatments that do not put them at risk for PML. The boxed warning for Tysabri (natalizumab) states that the risk factors for the development of PML include duration of therapy , prior use of immunosuppressants an d the presence of anti -JCV antibodies - and that these factors should be taken into account when initiating and continuing treatment with this medication . 79 The prescribing information for Gilenya (fingolimod) states that the medication should be withheld at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML. 69 It is not known whether individuals with anti -JCV antibodies taking fingolimod are at highe r risk of PML given the limited number of PML cases to date with this agent. The prescribing information for Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) states that the medication should be withheld at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML. 68 It is not known whether individuals with anti - JCV antibodies taking dimethyl fumarate are at higher risk of PML given the limited number of PML cases to date with this agent. The prescribing information for Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) states that PML is possible with this medication .80 No cases of PML have been rep orted in siponimod -treated patients. However, PML has been reported in patients treated with another S1P receptor modulator. A PML risk stratification for disease -modifying therapies is summarized in Table 6. 290 35 TABLE 6: A PML risk stratification table for disease modifying therapies. * Legend PY - Patient year exposure.

Individuals with contraindications need access to suitable options For a variety of reasons (cited as contraindications in medication labeling), 54,55,57,60 -63,66,68 -70,72,74,78 -80 individual s may not be suitable candidates for one or another of the available disease -modifying therapies: Hypersensitivity to glatiramer acetate or mannitol, precluding the use of glatiramer acetate Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta, album in or other component of the formulation, precluding the use of interferon medications Hypersensitivity to dimethyl fumarate or to any of the excipients, precluding the use of dimethyl fumarate Cardiac or ocular conditions , or treatment with Class 1a or Cl ass III anti -arrhythmic drugs, precluding the use of and siponimod Hypersensitivity fingolimod its excipients, precluding fingolimod or siponimod Current use of leflunomide, precluding the use of teriflunomide Infection with HIV, precluding the use of alemtuzumab or cladribine Hypersensitivity reaction to natalizumab, precluding the use of natalizumab Current or past diagnosis of PML, precluding the natalizumab and teriflunomide Positive tuberculosis screening requiring standard TB treatment prior to teriflunomide dosing Active hepatitis B infection, precluding the use of ocrelizumab History of life -threatening infusion reaction to ocrelizumab, precluding its use Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III/IV heart failure, p recluding the use of siponimod Presence of Mobitz type II second -degree, third -degree AV block, or sick sinus syndrome, unless patient has functioning pacemaker, precluding the use of siponimod Current malignancy, precluding the use of cladribine Pregnant women and women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of each treatment course, precluding the use of cladribine Active chronic infections (e.g., hepatitis or tuberculosis), precluding the use of cladribine, alemtuzumab, or ocrelizumab History of to use of cladribine Women intending to breastfeed on a treatment day or for 10 days after the last dose, precluding the use of cladribine In addition to these contraindications, post -marketing Extavia )57,60 -62 have led many clinicians to avoid the use of interferon beta medications in individuals who are depressed or have a history of significant depression. Although several studies have found no increased frequency of depression in patients taking interferon b eta medications compared with those not taking these medications, interferon beta medications may exacerbate or precipitate depression in some patients as warned in the FDA prescribing information. 291-294 Other co -morbid conditions may impact use of a par ticular disease modifying therapeutic agent in individual circumstances compromising safety, efficacy or tolerability and necessitating ac cess to an alternative option . 6. Because severity of disease varies at onset - with some adults experiencing early aggre ssive disease - patients and their treating clinicians need access to all available options Although MS remains a highly unpredictable disease, certain clinical and MRI outcomes seem to be associated with a higher risk of disease progression: Scalfari and colleagues found that time to EDSS 3 highly and independently predicted time to EDSS 6, 8 and 10. The same group found that higher early relapse frequencies and shorter first inter -attack intervals increased the probability of - and hastened conversion to - secondary progression, and that although long -term outcomes were highly variable, some individuals who experienced frequent relapses and/or accumulated a large number of focal lesions on T2 MRI within the first five years were at greater risk of disabil ity. 113 Fisniku and colleagues 97 found lesion volume and its change at earlier time points to be correlated with disability after 20 years. In their study, lesion volume increased for at least 20 years in relapse -onset MS and the rate of lesion growth was three times higher in those who developed secondary progression than in those who remained relapsing -remitting. A prospective study in British Columbia that utilized three possible criteria for aggressive MS - confirmed EDSS 6 within five years of MS onset; confirmed EDSS 6 by age 40; and secondary progressive MS within three years of a relapsing -onset course - identified aggressive MS in 4 -14 percent of people depending on the definition used. 295 Although the majority were males and those with PPMS, there were also a significant numb er of female patients and patients with RRMS. In a retrospective database study of aggressive onset MS, defined as two or more relapses in the year after onset and two or more Gd -enhancing lesions on MRI or one relapse if resulting in an EDSS of 3 along with two or more Gd -enhancing lesions , those pat ients who received or were switched to one of the following therapies - natalizumab, rituximab, alemtuzumab or cyclophosphamide - maintained a NEDA status during the 54 -month mean duration of follow -up. 296 Utilizing a different definition of aggressive MS that requires one or more of the following features, Rush and colleagues recommend more aggressive treatment agents to manage this challenging group of patients. 297 - EDSS of 4 within five years of onset; - Multiple (>2) relapses with incomple te resolution within the past year; 37 - More than two MRI studies showing new or enlarging T2 lesions or Gd -enhancing lesions despite treatment; - No response to therapy with one or more DMTs for up to one year. Given these findings, patients with highly infl ammatory and potentially aggressive disease may determine with their treating clinician that the benefit -to-risk ratio warrants starting or switching to a therapy with a higher potency and risk profile. 298 In fact, the 2018 AAN Guidelin e82 states as a Level B recommendation that \"Clinicians should prescribe alemtuzumab, fingolimod, or natalizumab for people with highly active MS.\" Data also support the use of mitoxantrone . 299-302 However, as noted previously , mitoxantrone is seldom prescri bed because of its high risk profile . The 2018 AAN Guideline states as a level B recommendation that \"Because of the high frequency of severe AEs, clinicians should not prescribe mitoxantrone to people with MS unless the potential therapeutic benefits greatly outweigh the risks.\" Refer to AAN.com/guidelines . 82 7. Some children experience very active disease from onset As previously mentioned, some children may experience very active disease that does not respond to the medications generally considered to be first -line treatment options for pediatric -onset MS. 8. African -Americans and Hispanics appear to have more active disease Several studies have now pointed to a more active disease course in African -Americans and Hispanics with MS. In a multicenter study of retinal damage and vision loss, African -Americans with MS were found to have accelerated damage compared to Caucasian MS patients , suggesting a more aggressive inflammatory disease course. 21 In a different cohort, primary prog ressive MS was more common in African -American patients, as was cerebellar dysfunction and a more rapid progression of disability. 22 Compared to Caucasians, African -American patient s have also been found to have a greater likelihood of developing opticospinal MS and transverse myelitis and have a more aggressive course. 23 More than one study has shown i ncreased lesion volumes in African -Americans ,24,25 with one also showing more tissue damage. 24 Given that there are also preliminary indications that African -American s may not respond as well to some of the available disease -modifying therapies, 303,304 it is essential for African -American patients and their clinicians to have access to the full range of treatment options in the event that one or another does not provide sufficient benefit. Hispanics as well as African Americans could be at greater risk of greater disease burden early in the disease course, while also facing greater barriers to care .26-29 Hispanics, along with African Americans and Asians, are more likely to develop opticospinal MS than Caucasians, often leading to greater ambulatory disab ility .30 9. People who for one reason or another are not adhering to a treatment regimen need access to other treatment options. In a retrospective cohort study of people starting treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, only 30-40 percent were adherent to treatment after two years. 305 People who do not adhere to their treatment regimen are unlikely to receive the full benefit of the treatment. 306,307 Factors associated with non -adherence include: Perceived lack of efficacy in relation to expectations 307,308 Route of administration 309,310 Perceived risks 308,311,312 Tolerability issues with self -injectable medications, including flu -like symptoms and injection -site reactions 313-316 Length of time on treatment 312 38 Costs 317 Psychosocial factors, including coping style, 318 mood, 319,320 and \"forgetting\" 312,315,316 Addressing adherence issues begins with identifying the non -adherent patient so that the cause(s) can be addressed. In some instances, this may require an alternative treatment option that is likely to enhance the person's ability to adhere to the treatment plan. Under certain circumstances, other off-label agents may be needed to modify the disease course For all the same reasons that clin icians and their patients need access to the full range of approved disease - modifying therapies, they may also need to turn to non -approved options that have demonstrated efficacy in people with MS ( see Appendix C for further information about th ese off -label options). 39 CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH MS Although there is still much that we do not fully understand about the pathophysiology of MS, the last 20 years have provided a significant number of treatment options that improve prognosis and quality of life for people with MS. Furthermor e, the growing body of evidence highlights the importance of early and ongoing access to and treatment with disease -modifying therapies. Treatment Considerations Initiation of treatment with an FDA -approved disease -modifying therapy is recommended: - As soon as possible following a diagnosis of relapsing multiple sclerosis , regardless of the person's age . Relapsing MS includes: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS): People with a first clinical event and MRI features consistent with MS in whom other possible cau ses have been excluded relapsing -remitting MS active secondary progressive MS with clinical relapses of inflammatory activity on MRI. - For individuals with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, with an agent approved for this phenotype Clinicians should consider prescribing a high efficacy medication such as alemtuzumab, cladribine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab or natalizumab for newly diagnosed individuals with highly active MS . Clinicians should also consider prescribing a high efficacy me dication for individuals who have breakthrough activity on another disease -modifying therapy, regardless of the number of previously used agents. Treatment with a given disease -modifying medication should be continued indefinitely unless any of the followi ng occur (in which case an alternative disease -modifying therapy should be considered): - Sub-optimal treatment response as determined by the individual and his or her treating clinician - Intolerable side effects, including significant laboratory abnormaliti es - Inadequate adherence to the treatment regimen - Availability of a more appropriate treatment option - The healthcare provider and patient determine that the benefits no longer outweigh the risks Movement from one disease -modifying therapy to another should occur only for medically appropriate reasons as determined by the treating clinician and patient . When evidence of additional clinical or MRI activity while on consistent treatment suggests a sub-optimal response, an alternative regimen (e.g., different me chanism of action) should be considered to optimize therapeutic benefit. The factors affecting choice of therapy at any point in the disease course are complex and most appropriately analyzed and addressed through a shared decision -making process between the individual and his or her treating clinician. Neither an a rbitrary restriction of choice nor a mandatory escalation therapy approach is supported by data. Access Considerations MS clinical phenotypes may respond differently to different disease -modifyi ng therapies. Due to significant variability in the MS population, people with MS and their treating clinicians require access to the full range of treatment options for several reasons: - Different mechanisms of action allow for treatment change in the eve nt of a sub -optimal response - Potential contraindications limit options for some individuals - Risk tolerance varies among people with MS and their treating clinicians - Route of delivery and side effects may affect adherence and quality of life - Individual diff erences related to tolerability and adherence may necessitate access to different medications within the same class - Pregnancy and breastfeeding limit the available options Individuals' access to treatment should not be limited by their frequency of relapses, level of disability, or personal characteristics such as age, sex or ethnicity Absence of relapses while on treatment is a characteristic of treatment effectiveness and should not be considered a justification for discontinuation of treatment Treatment should not be withheld to allow for determination of coverage by payers as this puts the patient at risk for recurrent disease activity 40 REFERENCES 1.

The updated disease courses are clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing -remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary progressive MS. Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) - a first episode of inflammatory demyelination in th e central nervous system that could become MS if dissemination in time and space are established. According to the 2017 revisions to the diagnostic criteria for MS, 2 the diagnosis of MS in a patient with CIS (with evidence of > 2 lesions) can be made when establishing dissemination in time - when there is an additional clinical attack; or simultaneous presence of both enhancing and non - enhancing, symptomatic or asymptomatic MS - typical MRI lesions; or new T2 or enhancing MRI lesion compared to baseline sc an (without regard to timing of baseline scan); or CSF -specific (i.e., not in serum) oligoclonal bands. In a patient with CIS (with objective clinical evidence of 1 lesion), the diagnosis can be made if dissemination in space and dissemination in time are established. Dissemination in space would be established by an additional attack implicating a different CNS site or > 1 MS -typical symptomatic or asymptomatic T2 lesions in > 2 areas of the CNS. Dissemination in time would be established by when there is an additional clinical attack; or simultaneous presence of both enhancing and non - enhancing, symptomatic or asymptoma tic MS - typical MRI lesions; or new T2 or enhancing MRI lesion compared to baseline scan (without regard to timing of baseline scan); or CSF-specific (i.e., not in serum) oligoclonal bands.

RRMS can be further characterized as: Active - showing evidence of new relapses, new gadolinium -enhancing lesions and/or new or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI over a specified time OR Not active - showing no evidence of disease activity AND Worsening - increased disability confirmed over a specified time following a relapse OR Stable - no evidence of increasing disability over a specified time following a relapse 2 Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) - steadily worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms without initial relapses of remission. PPMS can be further characterized as: Active - showing evidence of new relapses, new gadolinium -enhancing lesions and/or new or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI over a specified ti me OR Not active - showing no evidence of disease activity AND With progression - evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of change, confirmed over a specified time, with or without relapses OR Without progression - no evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of change over a specified time 3 Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) - following an initial relapsing -remitting course, the disease becomes more steadily progressive, with or without relapses. SPMS can be furthe r characterized as: Active - showing evidence of new relapses, new gadolinium -enhancing lesions and/or new enlarging T2 lesions on MRI over a specified time OR Not active -showing no evidence of disease activity AND With progression - evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of change, confirmed over a specified time, with or without relapses OR Without progression - no evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of change over a specified time 4 Appendix B : 2017 McDonald Criteria for the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis 70 APPENDIX C: Treatments Used Off -Label for Multiple Sclerosis The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved medications for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, as well as one medication for secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and one for primary progressive MS (PPMS). However, response to these medication s is variable and each has contraindications, side effects and risks that restrict their use for some people. In addition, barriers to access may exist for some people with one or another of the approved medications. Over the past few decades, several med ications have been prescribed for the treatment of MS that have FDA approval for diagnoses other than MS. For each of these agents, there is some, but often limited clinical trial evidence of efficacy in MS. The available information is summarized here. Information about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is also provided. Azathioprine (Imuran\u00ae) Azathioprine 1 is an oral immunosuppressant drug that targets activation, proliferation, and differentiation of both T and B lymphocytes. Azathioprine is FDA -approved for use in combination with other medications to prevent organ rejection after kidney transplant and f or the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis. It is used outside of FDA approval for conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, neuromyelitis optica, myasthenia gravis and multiple sclerosis. Azathioprine has be en used in MS for over 30 years; however, the results of clinical trials with this agent have been mixed. 2 A meta -analysis of placebo -controlled, double -blind, randomized trials in MS 3 concluded that azathioprine is probably effe ctive in reducing relapses and may reduce the risk of progression. In a study comparing interferon beta -1a used alone vs. interferon beta -1a plus azathioprine or interferon beta -1a plus azathioprine and prednisone, no difference was found between the grou ps in annualized relapse rate, cumulative probability of sustained disability progression, change in percentage of brain volume loss or T2 lesion volume. 4 Follow -up after 6 years of treatment yielded similar results. 5 Lus and colleagues 6 evaluated the impact of azathioprine plus interferon beta -1a in three groups of relapsing -remitting patients: 1) a group with no prior treatment; 2) a group with inadequate response to prior treatment with azathioprine; and 3) a group with inadequate response to prior treatment with interferon beta -1a. The combined treatment reduced the mean number of relapses in all t hree groups and reduced the mean Delta EDSS score in groups 2 and 3. The combined treatment also resulted in significantly reduced MRI activity. A small two -year pilot study 7 of azathioprine combined with interferon beta -1b in patients with secondary progressive MS whose disease had not been adequately controlled wi th interferon beta -1b alone reported a reduction in annual relapse rate of about 50 percent in year 2, a significant trend for an increase in EDSS, a decrease in lesion load on MRI at 12 and 24 months and a significant improvement in neuropsychological tes ting after 24 months. The investigators concluded that the combination treatment was safe and generally well tolerated; however, they recommended strict clinical and laboratory monitoring during treatment with this combination. In an open -label pilot tria l8 to evaluate the addition of oral azathioprine to interferon beta - 1b in patients who had break -through disease on interferon beta -1b alone, patients had a 65 percent reduction in the number of Gd -enhanci ng lesions compared to their baseline values. A total WBC count less than 4800/mm 3 was the best predictor of MRI response. 71 In a single -blind study 9 comparing azathioprine with interferon beta over one year, the proportion of relapse -free patients was greater in the azathioprine group and the mean EDSS was also improved in this group. Azathioprine is approved to treat MS in parts of Europe. Side effects and risks include abdominal pain, severe nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, mouth sores/ulcers, increased risk of infection, hair loss, change in hair color and texture, and risk of malignancies and blood abnormalities. Azathioprine can cause fetal abnormalities. Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan\u00ae) Cyclophosphamide 9 is an alkylating agent related to nitrogen mustard that binds to DNA and disrupts cell replication. In MS, the treatment serves as a general immune suppressant impacting cell-mediated and humoral immunity. 20 It is given intravenously or orally. Cyclophosphamide is FDA -approved for the treatment of various types of cancers. It is used off - label to treat autoimmune conditions such as Wegener's granulomatosis, myasthenia gravis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Placebo -controlled trials in progressive MS populations with different dosing regimens have found no benefit over placebo. 21,22 However, several trials in people with active relapsing MS have demonstrated a reduction in relapses, fewer new areas of CNS inflammation and a variable effect on disease w orsening, highlighting the usefulness of cyclophosphamide in younger, inflammatory and less progressed patients. 2 Monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide led to improvement and neurologic stability within six mont hs, sustained for at least 18 months after treatment onset, in patients with rapidly deteriorating relapsing -remitting MS. 23 In a combination trial of cyclophosphamide and interferon beta, with follow -up at 12 and 24 months, Reggio and colleagues 24 found that the combination treatment halted disease progression in active, deteriorating MS patients who had received insufficient benefits from interferon beta alone. In a study of 10 patients with very active disease and severe frequent attacks who had not benefited from interferon beta alone, Patti and colleagues 25 used pulsed cyclophosphamide to obtain a chronic lymphocytopenia, resulting in a marked and significant relapse reduction, improvement in disability and reduction of T2 burden of disease. Th irty-six months after discontinuation of cyclophosphamide, clinical and MRI benefits were maintained. 26 In a randomized single -blind, parallel -group, multi -center trial, co mbination therapy using pulsed cyclophosphamide with methylprednisolone along with interferon beta -1a significantly decreased the number of Gd -enhancing lesions and slowed clinical activity in patients who had experienced active disease on interferon beta alone. 27 Side effects and risks include n ausea, v omiting , hair thinning/loss, low white blood cell count, risk of infections, risk of cancers, infertility, and inflammation of the bladder with blee ding. Cyclophosphamide causes fetal abnormalities. Minocycline Minocycline 28 is an oral tetracycline antibiotic that is FDA approved for the treatment of a number of different types of bacterial infection. It is used off -label as a treatment for rheumatoid arthrit is. 72 Minocycline has also been studied in conditions such as osteoporosis, schizophrenia, cystic fibrosis and multiple sclerosis. In patients with RRMS, interferon beta -1a plus minocycline was found to be no more effective than interferon beta -1a plus plac ebo in time to first relapse, annualized relapse rate, number of new or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI, or change in brain volume. 29 In patients with RRMS, minocycline plus glatiramer acetate was found to be safe and well - tolerated, and reduced the number of T1 gadolinium -enhanced lesions, the total number of new and enlarging T2 lesions, and the total T2 burden of disease compared to glatiramer acetate plus placebo. 30 Side effects and risks include gastrointestinal problems, liver damage, mild to severe skin conditions, respiratory problems, kidney toxicity, muscle and joint pain , blood cell abnormalities and central nervous system disorders. Minocycline is a pregnancy category D medication, indicating potential for fetal abnormalities. Mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept\u00ae) Mycophenolate mofetil 31 is an immunosuppressant given by m outh twice daily that selectively inhibits an enzyme responsible for the de novo synthesis of the DNA nucleotide guanine within T - cells, B -cells and macrophages. It is FDA approved for preventing rejection in patients receiving organ transplants and is use d off -label for lupus, certain types of skin diseases and immune system -related diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Mycophenolate mofetil has been studied in small, open -label trials as a monotherapy or in combination with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate 32-34 and in two blinded, placebo - controlled pilot studies in combination with interferon beta -1a. 35,36 Mycophenolate mofetil has also been compared with inter feron beta -1a in a small randomized, blinded, parallel group pilot trial in patients with relapsing -remitting MS. 37 The results of these studies suggest that mycophenolate mofetil may reduce the annual number of MS relapses, limit new areas of CNS damage and may slow disease worsening, however additional studies are needed to confirm the se benefits. 2 Side effects and risks include increased risk of infection (including opportunistic infections such as PML), nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, weakness, dizziness, difficulty sleeping, increased ri sk of skin cancer and lymphoma, stomach ulcers and bleeding, elevation in liver enzymes and jaundice. Mycophenolate mofetil can cause fetal death 38 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets CD20 on the surface of B-lymphocytes, which are known to cause inflammation and damage in MS. Rituximab is FDA approved for the treatment of several conditions including non -Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis and granulomatosis with polyang iitis, and microscopic polyangiitis. It has been used successfully off -label to treat neuromyelitis optica, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune encephalitis, and autoimmune neuropathies and myopathies. 39 Sever al clinical trials in MS have demonstrated that rituximab is effective in reducing clinical relapses and limiting new inflammation in the central nervous system. 40 73 In a phase 2, double -blind, 48 -week trial in relapsing -remitting MS, a single course of rituximab reduced inflammatory brain lesions and clinical relapses for 48 weeks. 41 A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study of rituximab in primary progressive MS came close to meeting its endpoint, suggesting that selective B -cell depletion may slow disease progression in younger patients with inflammatory lesions. 42 Rituximab was found to be more effective than fingolimod in reducing the risk of clinical relapses and contrast -enhancing lesions in stable relapsing -remitting MS patients who switch from natalizumab after becoming JC virus antibody positive. 43 In a retrospective uncontrolled observational multicenter study that included relapsing - remitting, secondary progressive and primary progressive MS patients receiving different doses of rituximab, the treatment was generally well -tolerated, with a low incidence of serious side effects, and was effective in controlling relapses. 44 Rituximab is given by intravenous infusion. A common dosing regimen is two intravenous infusions separated by 2 weeks, repeated every 6 months. Side effects and risks include infusion reactions, infections (including opportunistic infections such as PML), allergic reactions, headache, fatigue and anemia. Rituximab is a pregnancy category C. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) HSCT uses autologous, hematopoietic stem cells, deri ved from the bone marrow or blood, to repopulate the body's immune cells and stop the inflammatory process that contributes to active relapsing MS. While the procedure varies somewhat depending on the medical center and doctors who are performing it, the e ssential steps include: outpatient chemotherapy by intravenous infusion for up to 10 days to stimulate the production of bone marrow stem cells and promote their release into the blood; storage of stem cells from the blood for future use; inpatient chemoth erapy for up to 11 days to suppress the body's immune cells; infusion of stored stem cells into the bloodstream; administration of antibiotics to combat infection; immune reconstitution completed within three to six months. In a multicenter, single -group phase 2 trial 45 involving 24 patients with aggressive relapsing MS that had not respond ed to other therapies, investigators reported a 69.6 percent MS activity -free survival rate at three years following transplantation, with no relapses and no Gd -enhancing lesions or new T2 lesions on 314 MRI sequential scans over a median follow -up of 6.7 years (range 3.9 -12.7 years). The rate of brain atrophy decreased to the level expected in healthy controls and 35 percent of patients had a sustained improvement in EDSS. One patient died of transplantation -related complications resulting in liver failure ; one patient required intensive hospital care for severe liver complications; all participants developed fevers typically associated with infections. In a 5 -year multi -center study, 25 people with active relapsing MS that had not been controlled by disea se-modifying therapies underwent HSCT with high -dose immunosuppressive therapy. After five years, 69 percent of participants remained free of disease activity and required no disease -modifying therapy. Reported side effects included blood cell reductions a nd infections. 46 Other studies using a low -intensity lympho -ablative regimen 47 or a non -myeloablative regimen designed to reduce toxicity, 48 demonstrated some improvement in some trial participants, with fewer adverse events, leading investigators to conclude that these technique may not be optimal for individ uals with highly aggressive disease or disease of long -standing. 49 74 Scolding and colleagues, on behalf of the a ttendees at the International Conference on Cell -Based Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis, concluded the following based on their review of I/AHSCT (Immunoablation followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) studies: The available evidenc e suggests substantial efficacy in suppressing inflammatory disease activity; however, the benefit/risk/cost profile is not completely known. Patients most likely to benefit include those with active relapsing -remitting MS, < 50 years of age, with < 5 year s disease duration, who are ambulatory and have ongoing disease despite disease -modifying therapy. Additional study is needed, particularly head -to-head comparisons with high efficacy disease -modifying agents. If HSCT is performed in clinical practice, sa fety and efficacy data should be collected, reported and published. However, the group strongly encouraged enrolling patients in ongoing clinical trials when available. 75 REFERENCES 1. IMURAN\u00ae (azathioprine) [prescribing information].
