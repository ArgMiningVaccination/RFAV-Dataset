Characteristic of the southwestern U.S., Albuquerque is also a very family-focused area. Many families prefer to keep their aging loved ones in their home to be cared for by the younger generations. However, as this is not a viable option for every family, Albuquerque assisted living communities strive to be as family-forward as possible. Many assisted living facilities in and around Albuquerque have care staff and management that strive to make personal connections, not only with residents but with their loved ones. Many of Albuquerque's assisted living communities offer amenities like movie theaters, barber shops and beauty salons, fitness centers, and restaurant-style dining so residents can keep their usual routines and pleasures without the hassle of a commute. Many of the city's assisted living communities also welcome pets, so residents with fur-babies can feel even more at home. Check out some more features Albuquerque assisted living communities are known for: Residential settings A Place for Mom partners with 10 residential care homes in Albuquerque. Unlike larger assisted living facilities, residential care homes are typically single-family homes that have been modified to accommodate a limited number of senior residents. As micro communities, residential care homes generally offer a higher staff-to-resident ratio in a family-like setting. Residential communities' neighborhood settings give them a cozy, often quiet atmosphere, and their small size can give residents a sense of normalcy rather than being in a larger, more populated community where they may feel overwhelmed. Albuquerque residential care homes are kept to the same regulation standards as other assisted living facilities. Residents are offered quality meals, care services, laundry and housekeeping, and enrichment activities, but seniors may also receive more one-on-one attention due to the size of the community. Multiple levels of care Many of Albuquerque's senior living communities feature multiple types of care all on one site. Out of our partnered communities offering assisted living, 74% feature multiple care types. These communities typically offer some combination of independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing, and memory care, so that if a resident's care needs ever change they can easily transition to a support level that fits them \u2014 ideal for aging in place. Assisted living facilities within multi-tiered communities typically strive to foster as much independence for as long as possible for each resident. Multiple care types together also offer more variety among residents, often giving more opportunity for friendships and community engagement, regardless of an individual's specific level of need. "}
