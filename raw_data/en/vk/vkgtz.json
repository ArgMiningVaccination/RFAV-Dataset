Adults and teens who wish to avoid conventional braces are increasingly turning to Invisalign\u00ae aligners. It has shown to be a successful therapy for those who have misaligned or gapped teeth, but don't want to opt for the costly route of braces. Invisalign is a custom-made, transparent aligner system made using molds of your teeth. These aligners are made of gentle BPA-free polymers that comfortably shift your teeth into place. Throughout their Invisalign treatment, patients are given new aligners every few weeks. Treatment times vary depending on the condition of your teeth and your aesthetic goals. One of the reasons this treatment is so popular is thanks to their subtlety \u2014 in fact, they are practically invisible. If you or your child is undergoing Invisalign treatment, it is critical that you understand how to care for the trays in order to maintain good dental hygiene and oral health. You must also maintain daily cleaning habits for the treatment's efficacy. This guide discusses everything you need to know about how to clean your Invisalign using Invisalign cleaning crystals \u2014 the premium cleaning solution for Invisalign. What Are Invisalign Cleaning Crystals? While there are numerous benefits to using the Invisalign system, you'll be tasked with learning how to clean Invisalign retainers to ensure optimal oral hygiene and be expected to keep up with their maintenance. To help users follow dental hygiene best practices while using their products, Invisalign has created specialized crystal packets that are used to remove plaque and eliminate bacteria forming on your trays over time. Only non-toxic components are used to make the crystals, which are meant to remove plaque and break down germs. If not cleaned carefully every day, bacteria can become trapped in crevices and along the surface which can cause plaque and other problems. Cleaning your aligners on a daily basis will keep them safe from buildup and avoid discoloration or bacterial growth. The Invisalign cleaning crystals were designed with a patented formula to clean the aligners' surfaces of all types of plaque and germs, and learning how to clean Invisalign is the only method to guarantee that your aligners remain bacteria-free. How to Use Invisalign Cleaning Crystals The general Invisalign care instructions and the steps for how to use cleaning crystals are described here. However, before using the following Invisalign cleaning crystals instructions, we urge that you consult with your dentist. Always follow your dental professional's recommendations to ensure that your treatment is successful and that you get the best outcomes possible. First, rinse the aligners or retainers with warm water to eliminate any residual food particles. Fill a cup or a bowl with warm water. In that water, submerge one packet of Invisalign cleaning crystals. Ensure the cleaning crystals thoroughly dissolve in the water by briskly stirring the water in the glass or bowl. Dip your aligners in the Invisalign crystals dissolved in warm water. Soak for at least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes. Stir the solution once more before removing the aligners and rinsing them under warm running water. Check to see whether the aligners have any residue on them. With a soft-bristled toothbrush, carefully scrub all surfaces of your aligners. You can now wear your aligners, which have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. It's recommended that you clean your aligners each time you take them out. Cleaning them twice a day when you brush your teeth (in the morning and at night) should be adequate. The Invisalign cleaning crystals will remove all dangerous bacteria and germs from your aligners, making them safe to wear. Not only do you need to think about oral health, you could get foul breath or gingivitis if you don't clean your aligners properly (more on this later). And there's no excuse not to do it \u2014 it only takes 15 minutes! What Are the Benefits of Invisalign Cleaning Crystals? Cleaning crystals for Invisalign aligners and retainers are completely safe, made of non-toxic ingredients that dissolve plaque and germs. Here are benefits of using Invisalign cleaning crystals in more detail. Removing plaque The food debris and bacteria within your mouth may cause plaque to form when you wear the Invisalign trays. The cleaning crystal eliminates plaque that has already formed and prevents it from forming in the future. Eliminating germs Invisalign cleaning crystals were designed specifically for this purpose. Chemical compounds in the crystals eliminate bacteria and other germs, keeping the aligners (and your mouth) germ-free. Removing any sticky food residue While your aligners may look clean, there are likely food particles and residue stuck to the surface that you can't see with the naked eye. The cleaning crystals will dissolve to efficiently remove sticky food particles, without any hard scrubbing required on your end. Removing stains If you use Invisalign cleaning crystals on a regular basis, you can eliminate surface stains and keep them from happening. It can even help to avoid stains caused by acidic drinks, like soda and coffee. However, keep in mind that if you consume acidic beverages regularly, discoloration quickly becomes difficult to avoid. Maintaining a fresh and odor-free breath Because the solution removes germs and plaque from the aligners, it keeps that much-dreaded bad breath away. Everyone knows that in order to keep your breath fresh, it's important to maintain excellent dental hygiene. If you're using Invisalign, cleaning your aligners is now part of your daily hygiene routine. So keep the bad breath at bay and clean your trays daily. Preventing tooth decay and gum disease If you don't clean your Invisalign on a regular basis, plaque and germs will build up. It will gradually degrade your oral health, causing disorders such as plaque collection along the gum line which can lead to tooth sensitivity, decay, and even gum disease. Using Invisalign cleaning crystals isn't just crucial for keeping the aligners clear of plaque and germs, it's also important for minimizing your risk for larger dental health issues down the line. Keeping the aligners invisible Remember that one of the benefits of Invisalign is that it is virtually undetectable and provides a natural look. Cleaning Invisalign trays with the crystals on a daily basis will help keep them undetectable. If you don't clean your aligners regularly, they'll start to become discolored and as a result, your teeth will look discolored. So keep those trays squeaky clean for a sparkling smile throughout your Invisalign treatment. General Invisalign Cleaning Tips While Invisalign cleaning should be done twice a day to keep them clean (in the morning before putting them on and at night after removing them), you should also take them out before drinking or eating. This will minimize the risk of your retainers suffering damage or becoming stained. As we mentioned earlier, food particles might become lodged in your aligners the same way they get stuck in your teeth. These particles can settle on your teeth and gums over time, and the end effect will be a build-up of plaque that can lead to serious oral health issues if left untreated. If you don't get rid of the plaque, it will harden and become tartar. You'll need the assistance of a professional to remove the tartar before gingivitis sets in. This might cause your gum health to deteriorate over time. Simply taking off your aligners before eating or drinking, as well as using Invisalign cleaning crystals twice a day, can help to reduce this risk significantly. Aligner cleaning crystals are required to keep your aligners clean and free of plaque. You may keep your aligners in your case while you're not using them. This is the most effective technique to ensure that your aligners are not damaged and remain bacteria-free.
