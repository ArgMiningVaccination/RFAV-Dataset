As there is a large number of startups working on a wide variety of solutions, we want to share our insights with you. This time, we are taking a look at 4 promising wireless charging solutions for electric vehicles (EVs). Heat Map: Wireless Charging Solutions For our 4 top picks, we used a data-driven startup scouting approach to identify the most relevant solutions globally. The Global Startup Heat Map below highlights 4 interesting examples out of 25 relevant solutions. Depending on your specific needs, your top picks might look entirely different. Wave - Wireless Charging For Commercial Vehicles EVs are penetrating the markets for both personal and [commercial vehicles](https://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-guide/5-top-machine-learning-startups-out-of-450-for-commercial-vehicles). Electrification is impacting commercial vehicles such as taxis, shuttles, public buses, and medium and heavy-duty vehicles. Wireless charging solutions for commercial vehicles bring the benefits of wireless charging to enterprises. The US-based startup [Wave](https://waveipt.com/) builds commercial wireless charging systems to address the issue of different plug positions in various EVs. Their charging systems are available in capacities of 50 kW and 250 kW. These systems power electric buses, industrial vehicles, and off-road electric vehicles and are available across various routes. MAGMENT - Dynamic Wireless Charging Wireless charging systems for Electric Vehicles are limited by the grounds where they are installed. Cement and other building materials are non-conductive and leak energy during charging. Solutions that make the ground conductive and safer address this challenge while also enabling self-charging roads. [MAGMENT](https://www.magment.de/en-dynamic-wireless-charging) is a German startup that develops a concrete material for EV charging. Their product is an amalgamation of current cement technology with recycled magnetic particles. It provides effective energy transfer with high safety - while charging the vehicle in motion. Wireless Energy Protocol - Wireless Charging The use of cables for charging electric vehicles adds to their inconvenience. Wireless charging solutions for EVs address this issue and improve their adoption among users. [Wireless Energy Protocol](http://wirelessenergyprotocol.com/about) is a Bulgaria-based startup that offers a wireless EV charging solution that starts the charging process in approx. 1.5 seconds. Users can choose from a variety of public and private charging points with a pay-as-you-go option currently in development. HOFA - Wireless Docking Stations For eBikes eBikes are trending globally because of their ease of use and availability. It is the most attractive alternative for eco-friendly commuters who want to minimize their carbon footprint. Solutions that improve accessibility to public wireless docking stations make use of eBikes hassle-free. The Chinese startup [HOFA](http://hofatech.com/Productlist.asp?sortid=122) improves the accessibility of wireless docking stations for public eBikes as their solution does not require any human intervention. It charges the eBikes when parked at the correct spot, eliminates the need for cables and minimizes vandalism at public eBike charging stations. What About The Other 21 Solutions? While we believe data is key to creating insights it can be easy to be overwhelmed by it.
