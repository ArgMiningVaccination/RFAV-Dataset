Fear of side effects, eroding trust are factors Dr. Dung Trinh, an internal medicine specialist and owner and founder of the Healthy Brain Clinic [in Long Beach, California](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california), was not involved in the new study but outlined several key reasons patients refuse vaccines. \"Older adults may fear side effects or adverse reactions from the vaccine due to their age and health status,\" he told Fox News Digital in an email. \"They may be more susceptible to developing complications such as fever, muscle aches and dizziness after receiving a vaccination,\" he said as well. \"In addition, they may have pre-existing conditions that can make them more vulnerable to serious side effects.\" \"Older adults may fear side effects or adverse reactions from the vaccine.\" They may also feel they don't need to get a vaccine because they have already received it in the past or because they've been exposed to the virus and built up an immunity, the doctor added.

Older adults may be concerned about not only the cost of the vaccines, but also any associated doctor visits, Dr. Trinh said. \"It is important that these individuals know what resources are available to them and that adequate support is provided in order for them to access the vaccine if desired,\" he also said. \"Hesitancy to get vaccinated is largely due to distrust of the medical establishment.\" Finally, older adults may have a lack of trust in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines as well as the medical community in general. Dr. Marc Siegel, professor of medicine at [NYU Langone Medical Center](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york) and a Fox News medical contributor, said he believes hesitancy to get vaccinated is largely due to distrust of the medical establishment among Latinos and other minorities, as well as confusing information delivered about the purpose of vaccination.
