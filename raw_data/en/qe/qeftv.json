SIDS & vaccines so before anyone gets all hot and bothered because I know these are both kind of hot topics.. first let me say I plan on vaccinating my son. he will be 2 months on Monday and will be getting his shots. I'm nervous but I know it's the right thing to do. anyway, I was scrolling through Facebook and this video came up of a little girl around 4 months I think that passed away in her sleep. for some stupid reason I decided to click on the comments and I found out that she had her 4 month shots 4 days before she passed.. and there were a few people saying that SIDS has been linked to vaccines. now I'm freaking out!! I looked it up and on the CDC website it states it does they are not in correlation with eachother but idk.. sometimes it's just so hard to wrap my head around the fact that a baby can just die in their sleep :( while being perfectly healthy. it scares me. Any thoughts on this?? I don't really have a point to this post just wanted to vent I guess. now I have super bad anxiety about his shots:( [20+ Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=SIDS+%26+vaccines+) I shared this with my husband and he found this for you. [http://www.npr.org/2011/07/15/137859024/rethinking-sids-many-deaths-no-longer-a-mystery](//www.npr.org/2011/07/15/137859024/rethinking-sids-many-deaths-no-longer-a-mystery) That's a really interesting article... it breaks my heart how many mothers are so scared of SIDS when SIDS is so misunderstood. It has absolutely no explainable cause and that is why it can be scary, there's some underlying medical reason babies pass from SIDS that hasn't been discovered. You just have to take care of your baby, be safe, and trust God that he'll keep them safe and healthy. There are absolutely things that can contribute to unexpected death, but that is not SIDS That is so helpful- thank you! It's amazing how scared I have felt of SIDS since we left the hospital. YES! Thank you for such a necessary article! I appreciate you sharing! Great article. The CDC also has information about Vaccine safety and FDA regulation. thank you for this! I appreciate it. Please go on the CDC website and look at all the ingredients in the vaccines. Maybe you don't want aborted human fetal cells in your vaccines. Or mercury (which they've recently taken out) or aluminum (which is a neurotoxin.) the amount of aluminum in the tdap vaccine for example is 250 times the amount that is 'safe'. (For lack of a better word.) If you put that much aluminum in your baby's formula bottle and CPS somehow finds out you will be jailed, yet it ends up in your vaccines. If you put that much aluminum in an ecosystem, like a running water source, you will be jailed. Yet it's 'okay' for the amount of that neurotoxin to be concentrated into a single injection. Sources? I just am watching the Truth About Vaccines documentary and all of this info plus much more is in it with board certified drs speaking truth and about specific studies that have been done on the link between the neurotoxicity of the aluminum and other adjuvants in vaccines and the injuries that are occurring after vaccines even death or autism and epilepsy and ADHD or add and allergies and so many more. I'm trying to educate myself so I can make an informed decision. The vaccine companies can't even be sued or help liable for any vaccine reactions now because of a bill passed in 2002 o believe that removes all liability so really they can put anything in vaccines and there's no accountability. It's scary! And you get pushed at the drs to just do it but many people have no idea what's in the vaccines and what the possible side effects could be - it's. It really informed consent if you don't own these things and most pediatricians don't know it either. They are taught in med school that vaccines are safe and needed and just to do them. Lookup the package inserts on the manufacturers website of each vaccine. SIDS is listed as a possible adverse reaction on some. The information sheet the doctor gives you is not the package insert with the real info from the manufacturer. The government has set up a National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and paid out over 5 Billion to families who's children have died or had life altering reactions to vaccines. You can't sue the pharmaceutical companies if your child dies or has a life altering reaction to their product. The government gave them Legal immunity in 1986. Listen to your gut, momma. Look up the ingredients on the CDC website. If you don't know what one is, look it up until you know exactly what is being injected. Don't assume your doctor knows either. I've asked several doctors, 3 pediatricians too, about what's in them and they couldn't tell me. They do not get taught anything about vaccines in med school, I've asked, except to give them and possible fever or redness at injection site, etc. If you're unsure, just wait. You can always vaccinate later but you can never undo it once it's done. You should certainly look up the ingredients in vaccines and then take the time to look at the SCIENTIFIC reason for the ingredient is being used. Fear mongering has convinced many uneducated people to not vaccinate their children because buzz words like neurotoxins are thrown about and then people confuse what form of the ingredient is being used, but most of all they don't take the time to look up the scientific research behind the ingredient. That said, OP please looks up more information regarding SIDS. Let's be surface here for a second and see that SIDS deaths have dramatically decreased since the 1990s but antivaxxers like to tout that the amount of vaccines received nowadays is multiplied by a gazillion. *eyeroll* I understand your fear. We all get that way sometimes but please do the research from credible sources. Good to see anther critical watcher/reader! Such a great point. I never watched the business of being born for that very reason. After looking it up and seeing the sources, subjects, etc. I decided not to bother. As I always tell my husband, everyone has an agenda. We all have goals/desires. Some good, some bad, but it is basically impossible to remove ALL bias from something! I know all about the \"documentary\" The Truth About Vaccines. I would encourage you to look at the actual research and studies they are referring to and speak personally to healthcare professionals and if you know any academics. The Truth About Vaccines distorted and misrepresented a lot of the information. Side note: This is what frustrates me about people simply watching documentaries and because the information is presented a certain way others take it as the gospel truth. The Business of Being Born was one of those documentaries that also sent folks into a tail spin but upon further research wasn't telling the whole truth. Just because something is a \"documentary\" doesn't make the information or stories true. I think it depends on the area you live in with SIDS. Here in Reno there has been a spike in SIDS in the last few years and so they are working hard to inform us about the risks of it. Check out the documentary the Trurh about Vaccines. It's pretty amazing and there are credible drs and many studies mentioned about the neurotoxicity of aluminum and then safe amount the FDA says is ok versus the amount in each vaccine given (varies but all are way over the safe amount). It's scary. Our kids are sicker now than they ever have been. 1 in 50 kids is diagnosed with autism. In countries where they wait to vaccinate until 2 rates are 1 in 1000. There is direct correlation there! Vaccines actually reduce the risk of SIDS. Look up the American Academy of Pediatrics info on SIDS. Yes! Vaccines do NOT cause SIDS. Studies are showing that they might reduce SIDS risk! There are potential side effects- like fevers, but that's their body's immune system responding to the vaccine so they're prepared if they meet the disease. There are some rare and scary possible side effects too that will be listed- but to put it in perspective, hoe many shots have you had in your life and the people you know- has anyone had one of these rare side effects. Read up about vaccines (from reputable sites- Mayo Clinic, CDC, WHO etc) and I think you'll feel better about it! [http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/detection/immunization_misconceptions/en/index4.html](//www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/detection/immunization_misconceptions/en/index4.html) Hayley's article basically hits the nail on the head. SIDS is used to put a label on an explainable death. Vaccines are a necessary evil full of cost-benefit analysis. The thing you found on Facebook is one baby out of millions. There were over 10 thousand mom's on this April forum alone. It's had to remember how rare and small the risk is when social media keeps throwing shock value scare tactics in our faces. You're making the best decision for your baby. I remember seeing the one on fb about the baby who died because the parents were breastfeeding and baby wasn't getting milk. It scared me to no end about feeding our baby. People make *** up! That whole vaccines = autism thing? Look it up. The person who \"claimed\" it came out later and said they were wrong. Because no real connections have been made. Don't listen to people on here or fb. Talk to your dr. Vaccines do not cause SIDS unsafe sleep practices cause SIDS. Its important to get your child vaccinated, not only for their sake but the sake of other children around them. Just because they are immune to something doesn't mean every child they come in contact with is, especially smaller children. No one likes to see their baby get hurt but shots are a necessary evil. I have included some helpful links below. CDC website: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/sids.html](//www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/sids.html) WHO website: [http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/detection/immunization_misconceptions/en/index4.html](//www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/detection/immunization_misconceptions/en/index4.html) You can go here to look up any adverse reactions: Not trying to start a fight... SIDS can happen following the safest sleeping guidelines. It can happen to the healthiest baby. Unfortunately babies do die from poor sleeping situations, but those aren't SIDS deaths. This is what is says on the VAERS website... More than 10 million vaccines per year are given to children less than 1 year old, usually between 2 and 6 months of age. At this age, infants are at greatest risk for certain medical adverse events, including high fevers, seizures, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Some infants will experience these medical events shortly after a vaccination by coincidence. thank you everyone for all the helpful responses. it helps me feel better. I 100% will be vaccinating my child just so nervous about it :( unfortunately yes it is a necessary evil. I will agree though that some of the things that are found in vaccines are a little off putting but none the less I understand how important they are. SIDS terrifies me but my anxiety has gotten better about it. thank you everyone! not trying to be rude btw, just stating my opinion. I do appreciate everyone's different outlook though. I understand it's important to be educated on the matter and I feel like so many parents choose not to because they are afraid of what they'll find. I may not agree with everything in the vaccines but I trust modern medicine. I will be splitting up the vaccines but I looked up the pros/cons of vaccines and yes on the cdc website it states there is mercury and aluminum but there is more aluminum found in breast milk than there is found in vaccines. in my opinion it's just a necessary evil. kids have been getting vaccinated for years and years, in my opinion it really is one of the greatest medical advances of the 20th century. even with some of the questionable things in them I would rather vaccinate my child then have him get extremely sick from measles (which there has been a recent outbreak) or whooping cough. there is no link between vaccines and autism. that has been debunked so many times. im tired of hearing about it. you can't get all of your information from one documentary. I would rather do my research on actual government/medical sites and talk to his doctor but thank you for the information. That is exactly what I'm doing. I'm splitting mine up...1 at a time. My 6 year old daughter cried an ENTIRE day after getting all her 2 month shots in one day. Never again will I do that. You can ask to split up the vaccines at least so that the immune system isn't overwhelmed with all the negative things like aluminum in them. I am not doing the hep b vaccine for my LO until she goes to school and will be splitting up the vaccines so that she doesn't get 8 in one sitting.
