Published research is limited, incomplete, and at times conflicting. It can also be overwhelming and written with a vocabulary and acronyms unfamiliar to many readers. Experts may be able to fill in a few gaps and interpret research for you. Clinical practice guidelines bring together experts to review research evidence on a therapy or set of therapies. They are written to guide health professionals regarding which treatments and therapies to offer to their patients. As a result, they are typically more conservative than expert programs. If you wish to use only therapies with stronger evidence of benefit, these guidelines will be good sources of information for you. Integrative oncology programs have been created by one or more integrative experts, drawing on training and published research as well as their experience from decades of clinical practice. These programs are published in books or articles which you can buy or perhaps access through your local library. These programs and approaches share knowledge and experience not available from research studies. They package together conventionalthe cancer care offered by conventionally trained physicians and most hospitals; examples are chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy care, self carelifestyle actions and behaviors that may impact cancer outcomes; examples include eating health-promoting foods, limiting alcohol, increasing physical activity, and managing stress, and complementaryin cancer care, complementary care involves the use of therapies intended to enhance or add to standard conventional treatments; examples include supplements, mind-body approaches such as yoga or psychosocial therapy, and acupuncture care into a cohesive program or approach. If you are a person with cancer wanting to explore all options, you will likely find these published programs and approaches very helpful. New information about cancer care and therapies is published very frequently. Programs and guidelines start going out of date as soon as they are published. Consider the publication date of guidelines and programs when evaluating them, especially if you find more recent evidence in our therapy reviews. Why seek integrative oncology programs and expert guidelines? Medical research is an ongoing process. Even with hundreds of thousands of studies published, we are far from knowing all we need to know about any therapy\u2014its medical benefits, safety profile, interactions with other treatments, application among different types of cancer, and more. The language of research studies can also be difficult to understand for someone with no medical or research background. Expert recommendations and programs summarize and interpret research findings for you if you don't want to or can't read hundreds or even thousands of studies yourself. Expert programs can also can give further information from experience. The expert guidance on this site comes in three types. You'll find one or more of these types of recommendation or advice on the \"expert\" page within every therapy review and self-care practice. Clinical practice guidelines are the result of expert review of the research evidence available when the guidelines were written. They typically review each therapy in isolation and do not offer a program approach. To use a recipe analogy, these guidelines evaluate only the individual \"ingredients\" of cancer care and do not typically evaluate how to mix them together or what happens when you do, although some may include interactions with chemotherapy and other conventional treatments. Published protocols, programs, and approaches from integrative oncologists draw from decades of clinical practice of integrative oncology. These experts share their experience and observations, often packaging many therapies and approaches into a comprehensive program. These programs are the \"recipes\" that guide how and when to combine individual therapies. Programs may include conventionalthe cancer care offered by conventionally trained physicians and most hospitals; examples are chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy care, self carelifestyle actions and behaviors that may impact cancer outcomes; examples include eating health-promoting foods, limiting alcohol, increasing physical activity, and managing stress, and complementaryin cancer care, complementary care involves the use of therapies intended to enhance or add to standard conventional treatments; examples include supplements, mind-body approaches such as yoga or psychosocial therapy, and acupuncture care in any combination. Expert commentary includes notes and comments from many CancerChoices advisors, invited experts, and others who have written on a topic and whose advice is relevant to our readers. Clinical practice guidelines Guidelines are usually created by a panel of experts looking at all the evidence related to a therapy. They are written to guide health professionals regarding which treatments and therapies to offer to their patients. As a result, they are typically conservative, requiring a high level of evidence behind a therapy to recommend that health providers include it in a treatment plan. Because of this, guidelines may not include cutting-edge therapies and those with less rigorous\u2014but promising\u2014evidence. Guidelines typically do not recommend therapies that have only preliminary or modest evidence supporting their use. Many guidelines categorize their recommendations into various levels such as these. |Grade A||Recommend to offer/provide this therapy to patients| High certainty that the net benefit is substantial |Grade B||Recommend to offer/provide this therapy; high certainty that the net benefit is moderate| Moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial |Grade C||Recommend to offer/provide this therapy for selected patients, depending on individual circumstances| At least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small |Grade D||Discourage the use of this therapy| Moderate or high certainty that the therapy has no net benefit |Grade H||Discourage the use of this therapy| Moderate or high certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits Guidelines identify and describe generally recommended treatment approaches. They are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable healthcare professional or practitioner. Guidelines we reference Within our therapy reviews and self-care handbooks, we summarize what these and several other guidelines recommend or conclude about use of each therapy or practice.
