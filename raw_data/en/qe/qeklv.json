When used in aromatherapy, these oils can help to reduce stress, anxiety, and insomnia. - Pain relief: Aromatherapy can also be used to help relieve pain. For example, peppermint oil has been shown to have pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties, and can be used to help relieve headaches, muscle pain, and joint pain. - Boosts immune system: Certain essential oils, such as eucalyptus and tea tree, have antimicrobial and immune-boosting properties.
