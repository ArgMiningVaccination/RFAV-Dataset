Continuing this theme, the followi ng article offers a comprehensive perspective on the significance of fine grinding in the production of the horn silica preparation. _____________________________ 1. Introduction In a recent article in BIODYNAMICS,1 Harvey Lisle writes that when the horn-silica preparation (\"501\" ) is made with finely ground silica or quartz, this dest roys the quartz' crystalline structure and thereby destr oys \"the very properties we are after.\" Specifically, if a quartz crystal is ground so finely that it can pass through a 200- mesh screen, he claims that the quartz is then transform ed into an amorphous, \"clay-like powder,\" which will bring about \"clay/earth results\" rather than the \"silica/ sun results which we are after when we use 501.\" In su pport of this argument he cites three experiments that he con- ducted using kinesiology (muscle testing) and dowsi ng. Lisle's overall conclusion is not only that coarse grinding is superior to fine grinding, but that a g ood horn silica preparation can be made even without an y grinding\u2014either by using the circa millimeter-sized quartz crystals embedded in the clay mineral rector ite, or by using any fine-grained beach or river sand. This recent article is very similar to a much brie fer article of Lisle's that appeared already in 1985 in a small, now-discontinued biodynamic newsletter. 2 In that article he expressed his basic conviction quite cle arly and succinctly: \"The crux of the crystal is its for m. If we destroy the form we have nothing.\" He then went on to say, \"I am sure that [200-mesh powder] is muc h finer than Steiner had in mind when he stipulated t hat the silica be 'ground to a fine mealy powder'.\" Li sle also reported at that time that he had performed co pper chloride crystallization tests and alfalfa growth t ests on 200-mesh and 100-mesh silica powder, and that with the coarser 100-mesh silica the results were \"good, \" but that with the 200-mesh silica the results \"did not appear good.\" Regrettably, he did not provide any further details about these experiments. I know Harvey Lisle as a true gentleman, and I thi nk that the questions he raises about this preparation are fully legitimate, but I cannot concur with his conc lu- sions and recommendations against fine grinding. H e may be correct that if we destroy a crystal's form and reduce it to amorphousness \"we have nothing,\" but i t does not follow from this that we should refrain fr om creating such amorphousness in the process of makin g the horn silica preparation. As Faust said to Mephistopheles in Goethe's famous drama, \"In your Nothing I hope to find the All,\" 3 so will I try to demonstrate in this article that bringing about amorphousness or chaos is one of the keys to achieving the particular effects that Steiner expected from t he horn silica. Inasmuch as currently produced horn s ilica preparations do not always lead to these effects, however, I certainly support Lisle's efforts to re- examine this question. In any case, I thank him fo r stimulating me to pull together my own thoughts regarding the significance of fine grinding within the whole concept of this preparation. 2. The Effects of Grinding Crystalline Materials The most obvious effect of grinding or crushing a crystalline material is that the pieces become smal ler and smaller. At the same time, certain structural changes may occur, but in order to appreciate these latter changes, it is necessary to have a clear ide a of the scale of the small particles produced by such grind ing. Table 1 gives a survey of the terminology and size equivalents for some selected particles over a rang e of eight orders of magnitude (from 2000 microns [2 mil li- meters] to 0.00001 microns [0.1 angstroms]). From this table one can see, for instance, that those pa rticles that can just pass through a 200-mesh sieve are abo ut 75 microns in diameter, which is roughly the size o f the particles of very fine sand or pastry flour. One c an also see that these particles are considerably larger (b y more than an order of magnitude) than what are called cl ay- sized particles, which are 2 microns or smaller. 4 On the basis of size , therefore, it is certainly not pos- sible to say that 200-mesh silica or quartz powder is \"clay-like,\" as Lisle does in his article. He make s the argument, however, that 200-mesh silica powder \"has lost its crystalline structure and is amorphous,\" a nd that WINTER 2 TABLE 1 Selected Particle Size Equivalents US Standard Mesh Size Maximum Particle Diameter (microns [= micrometers]) USDA Soil Particle Size Classification Approximate Common Size Equivalents (and Resolution Limits ) 10 2000 (= 2 millimeters) very coarse sand millet seeds 18 1000 (= 1 millimeter) coarse sand poppy seeds 35 500 medium sand business card thickness 60 250 100 150 fine sand human vision limit; fine spray droplets ---- 100 170 90 bread flour particles; office paper thickness 200 75 230 63 very fine sand pastry flour particles; potato starch granules ---- 50 325 45 lycopodium powder; fog droplets ---- 10 silt human red blood cells ---- 2 E. coli bacteria ---- 0.1 light microscope limit ---- 0.01 (= 10 nanometers) polio virus ---- 0.001 (= 1 nanometer) DNA helix diameter ---- 0.0001 (= 1 angstrom) small molecules; electron microscope limit ---- 0.00001 (= 0.1 angstroms) clay x-ray is clay-like because \"clays are amorphous.\" This is a very peculiar argument, if o nly because since at least the 1940s it has been widely ac- cepted that most natural clay minerals are in fact crystalline, although the individual clay crystals are always microscopic (see Figs. 1a & 1b). Lisle does not mention this at all and yet quotes from a book by C. Edmund Marshall in which the view that clays are crystalline is clearly endorsed. 5 Indeed, this view is implicit in the very passage that he quotes from th is book. When Marshall wrote that \"the constitution a nd properties of the amorphous products [of grinding] are quite distinct from those of the original minerals, \" he was not talking about grinding silica but rather about grinding clay. This is apparent from his next sentence, which Lisle does not quote: \"Thus, few conclusions regarding the [original] constitution of the clays can legitimately be drawn from [x-ray diffraction] expe ri- ments on the ground products.\" 6 Lisle thus misuses Marshall's remarks about grinding clay crystals (of less than 2 microns) to support his own ideas about grin ding silica crystals down to 75 microns (200 mesh). The fact that 75-micron silica particles are at le ast an order of magnitude larger than either clay crystals or their ground products turns out to be quite significant. In a recent technical review of the e ffects of Figs. 1a & 1b. Scanning electron micrographs of kaolinite clay crystals (scale bar in Fig. 1a = 2 microns) 3 Fig. 3 Relation of Particle Size and Surface-to-Volume Ratio 050000 100000 150000 200000 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 Particle Diameter (microns) Surface-to-Volume Ratio grinding quartz, Deane K. Smith explains that researchers have consistently found a correlation between the particle size of the ground products an d their degree of crystallinity (as measured by the x -ray diffraction response). The general interpretation is that quartz parti- cles develop an x-ray amorphous layer on the surface, and as the particles become smaller, the volume of the amorphous fraction becomes a larger fraction of the total particle volume. Only the crystalline volume contributes to the diffracted peaks, so the [diffracted] intensity response versus weight of sample becomes proportionally smaller [as the particles become smaller]. . . . The [amorphous surface] layer is estimated to be 0.03 microns thick, and for particles 2 microns or less in diameter, the diffracted intensity is appreciably diminished. 7 In other words, ground quartz particles remain most ly crystalline until they are reduced to about 2 micro ns in diameter, and only below this \"threshold\" does the amorphous surface layer begin to become dominant. this means that, if the amorphous surface layer rem ains 0.03 microns thick, then all regularly shaped parti cles half this size (0.06 microns) should be fully amorp hous (because the surface layers from either side of the particle will have met in the middle), while the ir - regularly shaped particles should be fully amorphou s at slightly larger sizes. Conversely, however, Lisle' s 75- micron particles will still be almost 100% crystall ine. Lastly, besides affecting the size and structure o f the particles, grinding also increases their surface-to- volume ratio . When a crystal is broken into ever smaller pieces, its total volume remains the same, but its total surface area greatly increases. For example, if we assume for simplicity's sake that the crystal is a 1-milli- meter cube with a surface area of 6 square millimet ers (1 mm x 1 mm x 6 sides), then if it is subdivided i nto eight \u00bd-millimeter cubes (see Fig. 2), each of thes e cubes will have one eighth of the original volume, but each will still have a surface area of 1\u00bd square mi lli- meters (\u00bd mm x \u00bd mm x 6 sides), i.e., one quarter of the original 6 square millimeters. In short, by su b-dividing the original cube, the volume of the small er cubes diminishes faster than does their surface are a. Hence their surface-to-volume ratio increases; it doubles from 6 (6:1) to 12 (1\u00bd:1/8). If we plot th is trend on a graph, we can see that when the subdivid ed particles get smaller than about 1 micron, their su rface- to-volume ratio starts to skyrocket (Fig. 3). The surface-to-volume ratio of a particle expresse s its relationship to its environment. Through its volum e, which is proportional to its mass, it is related to the force of gravity. Through its surface it is related to t he forces of its surroundings. A pebble sinks in a lake beca use it is denser than the surrounding water, but the rate at which it sinks is determined not only by the viscos ity of the water but by its own surface-to-volume or surfa ce- to-mass ratio. Smaller pebbles or particles sink m ore slowly than larger ones because they have proportio nally larger surface areas; there is proportionally more \"drag\" between their surface and the surrounding water. W ith very small particles the drag becomes great enough and the mass small enough that the particles stay in su spen- sion for years if not centuries. For quartz partic les in water, this happens when they are reduced to about 0.1 microns. 8 Such particles, however, lose their identity as separate particles and instead become one with the sur- rounding medium; together the particles and the wat er form what is known as a colloid or colloidal suspension. In this fashion the quartz particles overcome their solidity and become like fluids. Unlike solids, ho wever, fluids are not subject solely to the physical force s of the earth, according to Steiner, but are also influence d by the etheric forces that emanate from the planets. 9 For quartz in relation to water, therefore, 0.1 microns repre- sents another threshold. Whereas the 2-micron Fig. 2 Subdividing a Cube 4 threshold concerns the inner structure of the parti cles, the 0.1-micron threshold concerns the particles' re lation to their environment. 3. Steiner's Instructions for Grinding Crystalline Materials Having examined the effects of grinding crystalline materials, we will now review the practical instruc tions that Steiner gave for doing such grinding. In the fourth lecture of the Agriculture Course, Steiner's instru ctions for making the horn silica preparation were very concise: Once again one takes cow horns, but this time, instead of filling them with manure, fill them with quartz or silica\u2014or also feldspar (orthoclase)\u2014that has been ground to the fineness of flour. Make this into a paste that has the consistency of a very thin dough and fill the cow horn with this. 10 Here we may note that in addition to the somewhat vague word \"flour,\" Steiner also refers here to a \" paste\" and \"dough.\" What are these really? They are not merely mixtures of solids and liquids, but are mixt ures in which the solids remain suspended; they are, in short, colloidal suspensions. If the silica (or ortho- clase) were in this condition, it would, presumably , be more receptive to the etheric forces of the planets during the time the horn was subsequently buried in the earth. There is also a hint that Steiner expected the silica still to be in colloidal condition when it w as later stirred in water and sprayed out. In response to a general question about stirring and spraying, Stein er emphasized the necessity of stirring vigorously (fo r an hour) in order to achieve an \"intimate permeation\" between the water and \" any kind of thickened sub- stance \" (emphasis added). This description could certainly apply to a thin colloidal paste of silica as well as to the thick colloidal mass of the horn manure preparation (\"500\"). 11 Making the silica into a colloid already implies t hat the silica must be very finely ground, but Steiner also made this explicit the next day in response to the question: \"How does one grind quartz and silica? I n a small mill, or with a mortar and pestle?\" Steiner replied: In this case it's best to do it first in a mortar\u2014you will need an iron pestle for this\u2014 and in the mortar grind it to a very thin flour. With quartz you will first need to grind it as far as possible with the mortar and pestle, and then also grind it further on a glass plate, for it has to be a very fine flour, and with quartz this is very difficult to achieve. 12 Thus, in Steiner's instructions for making the hor n silica preparation, there is no suggestion that the silica should not be ground beyond a certain point. Simil arly, there seems to be no other evidence from Steiner's life and work that he ever recognized such a limit (Lisl e certainly does not cite any). Quite to the contrar y, what other evidence is available only reinforces the ide a that Steiner believed that the more finely the silica we re ground, the better it would be for the preparation. Consider, for instance, the instructions Steiner ga ve many years prior to the Agriculture Course for grin ding paint pigments. Steiner was concerned not only about the quality o f our earthly food but also about the quality of the colors we surround ourselves with in our buildings. Up un til about the middle of the nineteenth century, all the pig- ments used by artists and house painters were deriv ed from natural minerals, plants or even animals. By the beginning of the twentieth century, however, these pigments had been almost entirely supplanted by syn - thetic pigments derived from coal tar or petroleum, which were cheaper to produce and more convenient t o use, but whose colors could also be experienced as being much \"colder\" and \"harder.\" In 1911 Steiner began encouraging and helping certain painters and chemists to develop a more living palette of colors , namely, a palette of colors derived solely from pla nts, which would be luminous, translucent and also light - fast. In 1912 a research and production laboratory was started for this purpose. The basic manufacturing procedure was to extract a pigment from a suitable plant, precipitate this liquid extract with a miner al substance and then dry and grind the precipitated crystalline aggregates into a fine powder. The fin al paint was made by mulling the pigment powder with a binder consisting of an emulsion of various oils, r esins and waxes. (\"Mulling\" is a combination of grinding and mixing performed with a circular motion using a pestle or \"muller\" on a slab. This circular motion causes shearing and smearing as well as crushing an d thus allows each particle of the powder to become s ur- rounded by and suspended in the liquid binder.) 13 What is of particular interest here are Steiner's specific instructions regarding the grinding and mulling. It is reported that Steiner reluctantly a llowed the initial coarse grinding to be done mechanically , but insisted that the final mulling be done by hand. F urther- more, in some cases he stipulated that the mulling had to be done in bright sunshine and for up to 100 hou rs! 14 This stipulation was understood to be part of a lon g 5 tradition; one of the painters commented, \"Already the old masters placed great emphasis on grinding the p ig- ments as long as possible, because in this way the lu- minosity of the colors can be considerably enhanced .\" 15 A further explanation for the extensive grinding wa s offered by one of the chemists working on the devel op- ment of the pigments. It was necessary to obtain the colors from the plant, yet in the process of extracting them, to lose as little as possible of the plant's etheric forces, and to restore, by means of the pre- paratory steps (the grinding, etc.), the quantum of etheric forces that was lost in the extraction. 16 It is not known exactly what particle fineness was achieved after the many hours of mulling, but it is com- monly accepted that the particle size for oil-paint pig- ments should be less than 10 microns, and some watercolor pigments are even ground to 0.01 microns . 17 Interestingly enough, pigments tend to become most opaque (reflective) when their particle size is around 0.3 microns, but if the particles are further reduc ed in size they become increasingly translucent and ulti- mately (below 0.01 microns) become transparent to visible light. 18 Since Steiner as well as the old masters wanted their pigments to have a translucent quality , it is likely that they were in fact trying to reduce the pigment particle size considerably below 0.3 micron s. Achieving submicron fineness with quartz is more difficult than with most pigments because of its gr eater hardness and toughness. 19 Steiner acknowledged that grinding quartz finely enough for the horn silica p repa- ration \"would be very difficult to achieve,\" but as the above history shows, he did not shrink from requiri ng many hours of hand grinding and he reckoned with ve ry small particle sizes. 20 At the same time, however, it appears from the foregoing that he had in mind a slightly different\u2014and probably more effective\u2014 grinding procedure than the one usually followed in biodynamic circles. Steiner's instruction to do th e final grinding of the quartz on a glass plate is usually under- stood to mean a \"dry\" grinding, while his other ins truc- tion to make the quartz flour into a \"paste\" is usu ally taken to mean adding water to the finished flour in or- der to facilitate the process of filling the horn. 21 In re- ality, however, both of these instructions may well refer to the same process, namely, wet grinding or mullin g. On the one hand, in order to make a true colloidal paste, the flour and the water cannot just be stirred toge ther, they must be mulled in order to break up the aggregates and properly disperse the particles. On the other hand, mulling is also a form of grinding, and wet grindin g is in fact easier than dry grinding because the liquid acts as a lubricant. Wet grinding is also safer because it controls the dust, which in the case of quartz is e spe- cially hazardous to inhale. (Further details about grinding techniques will be discussed in Section 6. ) 4. The Significance of Chaos In the area of medicine, Steiner again emphasized t he necessity of transforming quartz and other silicate s by means of \"splitting, dividing and grinding,\" 22 and he also gave some important hints as to the significan ce of these procedures. For example, in a medical lectur e given shortly before the Agriculture Course, he dre w a parallel between the \"chaos\" that can come from pulverizing quartz and the \"chaos\" that he said naturally arises during seed formation in plants. Take a quartz crystal. It is an earthly thing . Well, why is it an earthly thing? The quartz crystal is something that pedantically holds on to its form. The quartz has its form through its inner force; and if you take a hammer and break it up, the single pieces still retain the ten - dency to be six-sided prisms, capped by six- sided pyramids. This tendency exists. . . . The quartz does not allow itself to be taken so far that the cosmos can do something with its forces. Therefore the quartz does not live. [But] if the quartz were to be pulverized to such an extent that the pieces no longer had the tendency for each piece to follow its own forces, then something living and cosmic would grow out of the quartz. That is what happens in seed formation. There matter is driven so far into chaos that the etheric forces of the cosmos can intervene. One must regard the world as a continuous process of coming into chaos and then coming out of chaos. The quartz crystal also once emerged from the cos- mos, but it has become stationary . . . it no longer exposes itself to the cosmic forces. However, as soon as it enters the living realm, it must always pass again through chaos. 23 What Steiner means by quartz emerging from the cosmos becomes clear when one recalls that in his b asic works he described the evolution of the earth as consisting of great periods of alternating condensa tion and spiritualization. During the periods of spirit uali- zation, the whole material manifestation of the ear th is raised to a condition of pure warmth or chaos, whil e during the periods of condensation the material ear th 6 essentially precipitates out of the warmth and beco mes ever more differentiated. 24 In addition, Steiner said specifically that the earth's quartz and other sili cious minerals were formerly in a more fluid and waxy condition and were in a certain way actually united with the ancestors of today's plant kingdom. At th at time there was a single mineral-plant kingdom that shared a common life. When in the course of evolut ion this kingdom split in two, the physical-material fo rces became concentrated in the present mineral kingdom, while the etheric life forces became concentrated i n what we now know as the plant kingdom. Thus, although the mineral kingdom today is largely cryst al- lized and lifeless, it was alive and chaotic in the distant past and will again be so in the distant future. 25 Moreover, what the whole mineral kingdom has experienced in the past, or will experience in the future, also takes place in miniature whenever crystalline minerals are ingested by living beings\u2014be they plan t, animal or human. In these beings the minerals are at least to some degree \"chaoticized\" so that the spir it of each being can then work from within the minerals t o congeal or precipitate them appropriately for that being's physical organism. 26 In a similar way, forces of the past or of the future are brought into the pres ent when a mineral is properly made into a remedy. 27 Pulverizing quartz, therefore, is a way of bringin g it back into a condition where it can again be enliven ed by the etheric forces from the cosmos, as well as b y the spiritual forces that work within these etheric for ces. Although Steiner did not make this point so explici tly in the Agriculture Course, he did declare in the se cond lecture, after again describing the chaos of the se ed: If ever we want the forces of the cosmos to take effect within earthly substance, then it is necessary that we drive this substance as strongly as possible into chaos. Everywhere where we want to bring the cosmos into effect, we must drive the earthly as strongly as possible into chaos. 28 When the cosmos takes effect, however, it cannot leave the earthly substance unchanged. The etheric and spiritual forces of the cosmos act to overcome the earthly chaos and to create a new whole, within whi ch they are then anchored. Hence the final substance of a successfully made medical or agricultural preparati on will not be the same as the original substance. In another medical lecture, Steiner illustrates this p rinciple with silica: Although silica is not often used in modern medicine, it is used. But in doing so, one thinks only of what the chemist has in mind, namely, this compound of silicon and oxygen, SiO 2. This is all that one has in mind. In truth, however, when one dispenses silica, one is dis- pensing an outer material substance that does not hold together the spirit but rather only allows it to pass through itself. One must know this. If one offers silica to a human being as a [true] remedy, one must shape the preparation in such a way that the spirit becomes seated in it in the proper way. 29 In the course of making a silica preparation, the r elation of the spirit to the silica must change, and in doi ng so the physical silica changes as well. The original silica is transparent to the spirit because it is crystall ine; the spirit passes through it \"like an express train thr ough a local station.\" 30 The final silica preparation, on the other hand, should have the spiritual forces \"seate d\" within it, and for this very reason it cannot be crystalline. The overcoming of the intermediate st age of chaos, therefore, cannot consist merely of a pro cess of recrystallization. The original substance must change in some more fundamental way. In the agricultural lecture following the one in w hich he introduced the horn silica preparation, Steiner offered a tantalizing clue as to the nature of this change. He mentioned in passing that in a living organism t here is a process whereby \"silicon . . . is transmuted i nto an extremely important substance, one which is current ly not counted at all among the chemical elements.\" 31 Although he made this remark in connection with one of the compost preparations (dandelion), it is like ly that this transmutation takes place in many living organ isms and it is quite conceivable that Steiner also expec ted such a process to take place in the buried horn sil ica, for he regarded the soil as a living organ within t he organism of the farm. 32 Biological transmutations involving silicon have been described by Kervran, b ut no such process has been documented in either the dandelion or the horn silica preparation. 33 At least in the case of the horn silica, however, it seems evid ent that unless we properly transform the silica's form \u2014 i.e., pulverize the silica crystals to chaos\u2014there is little likelihood of our ever discovering that the spirit has subsequently transformed the silica's substance. 5. Steiner's High Expectations Whatever the exact nature of the transformation und er- gone by the silica in the horn may be, Steiner cert ainly expected a lot from the resulting substance. In fa ct, he apparently expected it to be more powerful than the horn 7 manure preparation, for when he introduced these preparations in the fourth lecture of the Agricultu re Course, he first instructed the farmers to use one hornful of horn manure for about a third of an acre , but with the horn silica he stated: In this case . . . you will need much smaller quantities; you can take a portion the size of a pea, or perhaps only as big as a pinhead, and disperse it by stirring it into a bucket of water. This too needs to be stirred for an hour. He then described how to use the horn silica and ho w he expected it to act upon the plants: If you use this to spray the plants them- selves\u2014it will prove its value especially with vegetables and the like ... you will see how its effect complements and supports the influence coming from the other side, from the soil, as a result of the cow-horn manure. And if you were to extend this also to entire fields, which would not be a bad thing at all\u2014it shouldn't be too difficult to construct machines that will apply to a whole field the very light spraying that is needed\u2014you would then see how the cow-horn manure pushes from below and how the other stuff [the horn silica] pulls from above, neither too strongly nor too gently. Particularly with grain crops it could be wonderfully effective. What effect did he expect this \"pulling from above \" would have? Here one needs to recall that Steiner men- tioned already in the first lecture of the Agricult ure Course that silica is found not only in quartz and other rocks but is also present \"in extremely fine diluti on in the atmosphere.\" In that lecture he further indica ted that silica is related to the ability of plants to grow in girth and become trees, as well as to their ability to serve as nourishment for animals and human beings. Then in the second lecture he affirmed that part of the \"ABC of judging plant growth\" is to know how to ad- just the composition of the soil so that the ethers , which enter the soil via the silicious rocks, are either held back in the roots and leaves, or are \"sucked up int o the flowers, giving them color, or into the fruits [esp ecially tree fruits], permeating them with fine flavor.\" T he force that \"sucks up\" these ethers into the flowers and fruits is evidently the \"pulling\" force that Steine r ex- pected from the horn silica spray. He evidently ex - pected this spray to complement the effect of the s ilica in the soil and to reinforce the effect of the sili ca al- ready in the atmosphere and thus play a central rol e in ensuring the kind of nourishment that is needed by human beings today. 34 Steiner, in short, had some very high expectations for a light spraying of a pea-sized or pinhead-sized po rtion of the horn silica preparation. Such expectations would not be reasonable, however, unless he had also ex- pected the silica in the horn to have undergone a v ery fundamental transformation. The elemental transmu- tation mentioned in the previous section may seem radical, but it is consistent with Steiner's level of expectation for the final preparation. Steiner also had high expectations for his audienc e; he offered a conceptual framework for understanding the preparations and expected his audience to try t o grasp the processes rationally. Nowadays we do everything by trial and error and do not penetrate rationally into the process. But this is now the fundamental condition that must re-emerge if we hope at all to continue working on the earth. 35 Within the framework that he offered, the transmutation of silica appears plausible, but it i s plausible only if the silica is initially ground to the point of chaos (amorphousness). If it is claimed t hat the horn silica preparation is best made with coars ely ground silica, or even with unground silica, then w e have no conceptual framework\u2014at least not from Steiner or from Lisle\u2014for understanding how spendin g a few months in a buried horn could transform this coarse material into something capable of what Stei ner expected of it. Any transformation that did take p lace could only be regarded as miraculous. Steiner, how - ever, was not interested in miracles, he was intere sted in encouraging insight, because this is the basis for human freedom. He would not have introduced the practical preparations without the conceptual frame - work needed for comprehending them. This does not mean that he always spelled things out\u2014quite the contrary\u2014but it does mean that he expected his audience to look for and to find connections betwee n what he offered as the preparations and the concept ual framework of anthroposophy. Nevertheless, it is always desirable to confirm or correct our rational considerations by means of emp ir- ical data. The empirical investigations that Lisle under- took, therefore, are to be welcomed insofar as they are sound. The experiments mentioned in his 1985 artic le seem promising and it is only disappointing that he has never published any details about them. On the oth er hand, his recent experiments are much more curious and have some serious design flaws. Inasmuch as Li sle associates properly made horn silica with the sun, he 8 seems to share Steiner's expectation regarding the effect of this preparation on plants. If so, then in order to demonstrate the superiority of using one rather than another type of horn silica in biodynamic agricultu re, one would expect that his experimental design would (a) involve plants, and (b) involve applying the ho rn silica to the plants in much the way that Steiner o rigi- nally described. But, sadly, only one of Lisle's three recent experiments involved a plant, and none of them involved using horn silica samples that were actual ly stirred in water and sprayed out. In the experimen t in- volving the plant (a pear tree), each sample of hor n silica to be tested was merely placed on a branch (probably still in its zip-lock shipping bag). (Li sle also does not make clear how the parameter he chose to measure here\u2014the strength of the tree's \"aura\" as revealed through his dowsing\u2014relates to any physica l parameter or to anything mentioned by Steiner.) In the other two experiments\u2014one to test the effect of hor n silica on a person's muscle strength, the other to test the effect on a person's \"iron dowsing ability\"\u2014the (bagged?) horn silica was simply held in the hand o r placed in a shirt pocket. Lisle makes no attempt i n his article to explain the relevance of these latter experiments to biodynamic agriculture. Furthermore , it should be noted that the samples tested by Lisle di d not include any in which the median particle size was below the 2-micron threshold identified in Section 2, let alone below the 0.1-micron threshold. (The \"stock 501\" from JPI that Lisle used consists of a blend o f three commercially available silica powders with median particle sizes of 75, 45 and 10 microns, whi ch has not undergone any further grinding.) 6. Practical Aspects of Making the Horn Silica Preparation It may now be accepted that the real question about making the horn silica preparation is not whether to grind it finely but how best to do so. This is a real question and in the following I can offer only a fe w suggestions and perspectives. As far as the starting material is concerned, it i s beyond the scope of this article to discuss the rel ative merits of using quartz or orthoclase or any of the numerous varieties of these minerals. Some people choose to use gem quality crystals to make horn sil ica, but this seems wasteful and is not something that Steiner ever stipulated. (Nor did he place any emp hasis on the transparency of the crystal; in fact, he spe cifi- cally mentioned that even though smoky quartz is no t transparent to light, it is still perfectly transpa rent to the spirit. 36 ) On the other hand, there are other people who choose to start with natural quartz sand. This doe s not seem problematic in itself, but one cannot assume t hat all \"sand\" is quartz\u2014any mineral can be weathered until it becomes \"sand.\" As regards the condition or form of the starting materials, there is an important point to be made. Because reducing silica crystals to amorphousness h as been emphasized here, it might seem easiest simply to start out with silica that is already in an amorpho us condition (e.g., some form of opal or diatomaceous earth, or even some man-made silica product). Thes e forms of silica are much softer than crystalline si lica and would be much easier to grind, but the reason Steiner did not suggest this himself seems to be be cause what he was specifically interested in capturing in the preparation was the process of overcoming the crystallinity through grinding . In connection with the medical remedies that he developed, Steiner explain ed: What is especially important with these remedies is that we wish to heal not through substances but through processes. We produce remedies in the hope\u2014and of course these things have been verified\u2014that the processes we carry out through having understood the connection between nature and man will in a way be preserved in the preparation and then released in the human organism as a healing process. That is what is essentially new in these things of ours. We wish to heal through processes, through how the remedies are prepared. 37 In the case of the horn silica preparation, the imp ortant processes seem to be (1) the overcoming of the init ial crystallinity through grinding, and (2) the overcom ing of the subsequent chaos (as discussed in Section 4) . Since the latter process occurs while the silica is in the horn and is largely outside our control, we will fo cus on the process of overcoming the crystallinity through grinding. 38 Although Steiner mentioned using an iron mortar an d pestle for the initial crushing of the silica or qu artz crystals, an ordinary bowl-shaped mortar easily all ows chips and dust to escape. More efficient crushing can be done in a mortar made from a short, upright iron pipe welded to a base plate with a solid iron rod as a p estle or ram. A flexible cloth sleeve around the rod and the pipe will help contain the silica dust, but some of it will inevitably escape, at the latest when the pipe is e mptied. Therefore, whenever working with dry silica, it is highly advisable to wear a tight-fitting, half-mask respir ator 9 (not a disposable dust mask) with a clean filter.39 Fine crystalline silica dust, especially freshly fractur ed dust, poses a serious, non-reversible respiratory hazard (pneumoconiosis or silicosis) because the particles can- not be dissolved by the body and therefore cause chronic lung inflammations. Consider also using a strong fan with a filter (at least a wet cloth) to collect the airborne dust so that it does not endanger othe r people or animals in the vicinity. Alternatively, con- sider putting water in the mortar along with the cr ys- tals. The water will not interfere with the crushi ng or with the subsequent sieving and grinding, and if deemed necessary any rust can be removed with a magnet. After most of the material in the mortar is reduce d to a coarse sand, a fine sieve is useful for separatin g out the fine sand fraction, which is now ready to be gr ound on a glass plate; the remainder can be returned to the mortar for further crushing. In Section 3 it was s ug- gested that wet grinding or mulling on a glass plat e is easier and safer than dry grinding and that this we t method may in fact have been what Steiner intended for the horn silica preparation. With this wet method, how- ever, one cannot use a second glass plate as a mull ing instrument (as is commonly done in dry grinding) be - cause the thin layer of liquid tends to create a se al that immobilizes the two plates. To prevent this, the m ul- ling instrument should have a convex grinding surfa ce (for instance, a thick glass bottle held sideways). As the paste spreads out on the plate it will quickly dry out, so a spatula and a spray bottle with water are needed to move it around and keep it moist. A natural concomitant or extension of this wet grinding technique is to use water to suspend the smallest particles and separate them from the large r, heavier ones. For this the mulled paste is scraped into a wide-mouthed glass jar with some added water, the l id tightened and the jar then vigorously shaken. If t he water depth is about 12\u00bd centimeters (1/8 of a mete r), all of the particles larger than about 1 micron wil l settle out in about one day (see note 8) and the liquid wi ll probably appear clear. However, if a thin beam of light is shone sideways through the jar, any fine particl es still in suspension will reflect the light and thus become visible (the so-called \"Tyndall effect\"). If such are visible, the suspension is drawn off with a pipette and transferred to a dish or pan to evaporate the water and concentrate the fine silica particles. In the mean time the larger particles that have settled out in the j ar are returned to the mulling plate and the mulling and w ater- separating steps are repeated until a sufficient qu antity of colloidal silica paste is accumulated. 40 Since the steps just outlined are certainly tediou s and time-consuming, especially when one is trying to ma ke enough silica paste to fill a horn, the question na turally arises: what if one doesn't need a whole hornful? De- pending on the size of the horn and the size of the por- tion, a hornful of horn silica could be enough for hundreds, if not thousands, of acres. Is there any way to make a smaller batch of horn silica? It was pos sibly in response to this sort of question that Steiner l ater suggested an alternative procedure for making this preparation. As reported by Ehrenfried Pfeiffer: For the horn silica preparation Dr. Steiner said it would also suffice to fill the horn with a bean- sized piece of quartz that had been mixed and kneaded together with soil from the field to be sprayed. It would still contain enough silica radiation if a little bit of this were dissolved and stirred. 41 The indication that the soil should come from the f ield to be sprayed is somewhat puzzling (did he mean 'farm' instead of 'field'?), but it is interesting that the word \"kneaded\" is used here. This reminds us not o nly of Steiner's original indication about making the s ilica flour into a \"dough\" but also implies that the knea ded soil is somewhat moist and that the bean-sized \"pie ce\" of quartz actually means a bean-sized amount of pulverized quartz that can be mixed into the soil. Whereas Steiner originally mentioned using a \"pea- sized\" portion of the final preparation, the sugges tion here is to use a \"little bit\" of the final quartz-p lus-soil mixture. Making this \"diluted\" preparation require s a very small amount of pulverized quartz and thus aga in confirms the tremendous potency that Steiner expect ed the quartz to possess after it had been buried in t he horn. The other obvious question that arises is: what ab out using machines to do the grinding? Steiner did not comment in the Agriculture Course on this question, but from his comments reported in Section 3 we know that he was not in favor of this as far as pigment grinding was concerned, at least not for the final stages. Most probably he would have regarded mechanical grinding in much the same way that he regarded mechanical stirring, about which he said in the Agriculture Course: There is no question that stirring by hand does have a quite different significance than mech- anical stirring, though of course someone with a mechanistic worldview would not admit this. Just consider what a huge difference there 10 really is: when you stir by hand, all the fine movements of your hand go into the stirring, and quite possibly all kinds of other things too, including the feelings you have as you stir. Of course people nowadays don't think that makes any difference, but in the field of medicine, for instance, the difference is quite noticeable. Believe me, it is really not a matter of indif- ference whether a certain remedy is prepared by hand or by machine. 42 It becomes easier to believe Steiner if we recall h is re- marks quoted earlier about how the remedies are mea nt to capture processes . The quality or spirit of the forces that accomplish the grinding process may be retaine d by the very fine particles and ultimately conveyed to the plants and to the whole farm. If a machine is used, this might spread a spirit of mechanical uniformity , which would simply be counterproductive if at the same time one were trying to cultivate a biodynamic farm individuality. Steiner recognized that in modern society farming cannot be done without machines, bu t he drew the line when it came to \"the most intimate processes of nature,\" among which he included stirring. 43 On the other hand, it should be noted that even wi th grinding bread flour, Steiner was not entirely oppo sed to using a mill. In this connection he is reported to have said: In the process of milling, the etheric forces in the grain must in no way be damaged. Milling is not a purely mechanical process but a bio- logical one comparable with baking and cooking. If one grinds purely mechanically the resulting flour has little nutritive value. Milling should be the joint work of elemental beings and such people who can be befriended by good elemental spirits. The mill is a body built by man of water, stone and wood for well- intentioned elemental spirits who will make grain into flour without reducing its life forces. This is why the interior of a mill bears the character of a temple. In contrast to this, in modern mills with turbines, electric motors, and metal construction as well as in roller mills, a quarter or half of the etheric forces, i.e ., the food value of the grain, is lost by the violent mechanical milling. 44 Steiner evidently believed that if the milling proc ess was gentle, and if the mill itself were in a certai n way individualized, the etheric forces of the grain wou ld not be lost. A crystal, of course, does not have the s ame etheric forces that a wheat grain does, so it may b e acceptable to initially subject the crystal to viol ent mechanical grinding, but when the size of the parti cles approach the 2-micron threshold, they begin to lose their earthly crystalline structure and become open to the cosmic etheric forces. At or before this point , therefore, it would seem prudent to switch to a gen tler method of grinding such as hand grinding. A convenient method of identifying the 2-micron threshold is the \"bite test,\" i.e., when the silica powder or paste no longer feels the least bit gritty betwe en one's teeth. As mentioned earlier, particles around 1 mi cron in size will stay in suspension for about a day (i. e., settle about 12\u00bd cm). From the perspectives offered in th is article, it would seem ideal to try to grind the si lica un- til it is fully amorphous, yet the 0.06-micron degr ee of fineness mentioned in Section 2 is only an estimate of when this happens, and at these submicron levels it is difficult to know in the moment just how small the par- ticles are that one is grinding (the settling rate is no longer very practical and other methods require spe - cialized instruments). How much further one grinds , therefore, is largely a question of conscience and intuition. This situation, however, may also be re garded as an opportunity\u2014an opportunity to develop the sam e kind of \"personal relationship\" with silica as Stei ner explicitly recommended be developed with manure. 45 If grinding were actually to become a kind of medi- tative activity\u2014literally a kind of \"mulling over\"\u2014 one could then harbor real hope that the silica itself might inspire one with the knowledge of when full amor- phousness had been achieved. 46 7. Conclusion The attempt has been made here to review the scient ific facts related to fine grinding and the significance of fine grinding in the light of Rudolf Steiner's indications. In doing this I have been unable to f ind any evidence to support Harvey Lisle's idea that fi nely grinding the silica for the horn silica preparation is detrimental and is counter to Steiner's intentions. On the contrary, from my research it appears that Stei ner expected an extraordinary degree of fineness. This is certainly difficult to achieve, especially by hand grinding, and Steiner acknowledged this difficulty, but for him difficulty alone was never a reason not to do something. As he remarked in regard to one of the compost preparations, \"It is true that stag bladder s may be difficult to obtain\u2014but a lot of difficult thing s get done in this world!\" 47 Rather than being too finely ground, much of the 11 horn silica produced in America is probably too coa rse. This situation is mitigated, however, by the fact t hat a silica powder with particles of a given average diameter will usually have a considerable range of particle sizes. Therefore even a relatively coarse sample of horn silica may still contain a sufficien t per- centage of extremely fine particles to ensure a cer tain degree of effectiveness. This is particularly like ly if the silica has at least been reduced to the 2-micron le vel where it no longer feels gritty between one's teeth . On the other hand, it is a matter of concern to he ar occasional reports of plants being \"burned\" by appl i- cations of the horn silica spray. This does not se em to correspond to the effect that Steiner expected from the horn silica, namely, that it would \"pull from above , neither too strongly nor too gently.\" Such episode s of burning are usually attributed to an incorrect timi ng of the spraying, but they may in fact indicate a quali tative problem with the horn silica itself. If the silica is not ground finely enough in the first place, no further trans- formation will be possible when the silica is burie d in the horn. The silica removed from the horn will be no different from what was put into it. Spraying untr ans- formed silica on plants may still have an effect, a nd this effect may even be desirable at times, but it will not be the effect that Steiner was seeking. At the very l east, a properly made horn silica preparation should have a significantly different effect on plants than simil arly ground silica that has not undergone burial. This is a basic test for quality that should have been done m any times in the history of biodynamics, but I am aware of only one such test\u2014and its results were somewhat ambiguous. 48 It is to be hoped that the preliminary investigati on contained in this article will stimulate serious re flection on the nature of the horn silica preparation and le ad to serious support for basic, well-designed research o n the methods of producing it. __________________________ Malcolm Gardner is the editor and co-translator of Steiner's Spiritual Foundations for the Renewal of Agriculture .

Degremont ( Water Treatment Handbook (New York 1991)), a particle with an effective (av erage) diameter of 1 micron takes about 8 days to settle t hrough 1 meter of water; similarly, a 0.1-micron particle takes ab out 2 years, a 0.01- micron particle takes about 20 years, and a 0.001-m icron particle takes about 200 years. Below 0.001 microns [= 1 na nometer] the particles approach the size of the water molecules and the suspen- sion becomes equivalent to a solution. 9 Warmth Course (Spring Valley 1988; GA 321), lectures of Mar. 2 & 14, 1920.

Traditional lakes included talc, k aolin, alum and chalk, none of which on the Moh's scale of hard ness is harder than 4 and none of which has good fracture t oughness (resistance to fracture). Quartz, on the other han d, has a hard- 12 ness of 7 and has good fracture toughness. (Orthoc lase is intermediate; it has a hardness of 6 - 6.5 but has poor fracture toughness and is therefore relatively easy to pulverize.) 20 On one occasion Steiner also spoke of tiny silica crystals in the human brain and specifically said that these were \"much less than one ten-thousandth of a millimeter, \" i.e., much less than 0.1 microns or 100 nanometers ( The Human Being in Body, Soul and Spirit (Hudson 1989; GA 347), lecture of Aug. 9, 1922). 21 See, for example, Christian von Wistinghausen, et al., Anleitung zur Herstellung der Biologisch-Dynamische n Pr\u00e4parate (2 nd ed., Stuttgart 1996), p. 27. 22 Introducing Anthroposophical Medicine (Hudson 1999; GA 312), lecture of Mar. 29, 1920. 23 Course for Young Doctors (Spring Valley 1994; GA 316), lecture of Apr. 21, 1924. 24 See Cosmic Memory (San Francisco 1959; GA 11), chaps. 12-17; and Occult Science - An Outline (London 1979; GA 13), chap. 4. 25 See Universe, Earth and Man (London 1987; GA 105), lecture of Aug. 8, 1908; Cosmic Memory , chap. 17; Anthroposophical Spiritual Science and Medicine (Spring Valley 1991; GA 313), lecture of Apr. 4, 1921; From Limestone to Lucifer ...

The last level is also called a HEPA (Hi gh Efficiency Particulate Air) filter. The letters N, R or P stamped on newer filters refer to their resistance to oil aerosols, which is not a concern with silica dust. 40 An easier but more expensive possibility might be to con- centrate the colloidal particles with a cross-flow ultra- filtration system. 41 Spiritual Foundations , Appendix B, Part 5A. 42 Spiritual Foundations , First Discussion, June 12, 1924. 43 Ibid . 44 Rudolf Steiner on Nutrition and Stimulants (Kimberton 1991), Appendix A. 45 Spiritual Foundations , Lecture Four, June 12, 1924. 46 This is not as far-fetched as it may sound. In Eu rope there is a remarkable group of homeopathic physicians and patients who have systematically explored the \"reso nance\" that can arise between a person and a substance tha t he or she is hand grinding (triturating homeopathically). By following a strict protocol and recording all the private fee lings, images and impressions that they experience while grinding a spe- cific substance, they have consistently found that different people will have very similar experiences and that these ex- periences help reveal the healing potential of that substance. They claim, in fact, to have found a new method of making homeopathic provings. For further information (unf ortu- see http://www.c4-homoeopat hie.net/ z.htm.
