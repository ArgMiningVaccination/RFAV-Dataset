But it has great utility in dealing with emergencies, chronic conditions, and situations where the uncertainty of non-conventional treatment is unacceptable. Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in his seminal work on homeopathy , \"The Organon of Medicine\", wrote: \"The physician's highest calling, his only calling, is to make sick people healthy - to heal, as it is termed.\" \"The highest ideal of therapy is to restore health rapidly, gently, permanently; to remove and destroy the whole disease in the shortest, surest, least harmful way, according to clearly comprehensible principles\". I follow this dictum in my practice of allopathic medicine as well. I practice allopathic medicine when I consider it in the best interest of the patient. And there are conditions where allopathic treatment is the best treatment - and follows Hahnemann's dictum as well. Examples of allopathic treatments provided by my office: [Armour [Cialis](http://www.cialis.com/Pages/home.aspx?WT.srch=1), and [Levitra](http://www.levitra.com/) for male sexual dysfunction General internal medicine evaluation and treatment "}
