She's available for interviews about the cascading effects of hospital bed shortages. Albert says, \"A shortage of hospital beds introduces strains on hospital and healthcare systems. Doctors, nurses, and hospital staff have extra tasks to free up beds, treat patients in less-than-ideal spaces, and transfer patients. For example, ambulances have to travel to more distant hospitals where there are beds available, which means paramedics and emergency technicians are busier than ever.\" Contact: [laura@engr.wisc.edu](mailto:laura@engr.wisc.edu) VIDEO: Working women adversely affected by pandemic [Pam Kreeger](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/bme/Faculty/Kreeger_Pamela/), an associate professor of biomedical engineering, and her colleagues recently published \"Ten simple rules for women principal investigators during a pandemic,\" citing the additional home and child care burdens female academics have taken on due to COVID-19.

In [a recently published paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/12/04/2014859117) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's [Center for Healthy Minds](https://centerhealthyminds.org/) introduce a new framework for emotional well-being that focuses on specific skills that can be learned. The framework is based on scientific evidence that suggests well-being can be cultivated through practice in daily life. The framework focuses on four pillars that have been studied in the lab and have been shown to improve with training: awareness, or attentiveness to one's environment and internal cues such as bodily sensations, thoughts and feelings; connection, or appreciation, kindness and compassion; insight, which refers to fostering curiosity and self-knowledge; and purpose, understanding your values and motivations.
