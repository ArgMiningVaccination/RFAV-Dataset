For other drugs, damage is unpredictable. It is detected some time after the drug is taken and is not related to the dose. Rarely, such damage results in a severe liver disorder. Medicinal herbs and the liver Some medicinal herbs (parts of plants used for health benefits) contain substances that can damage the liver. The liver is a prime target for damage because it processes everything that enters the mouth and is swallowed. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids: Hundreds of herbs contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which may damage the liver. These herbs include borage, comfrey, and certain Chinese herbs, such as zi cao (groomwell), kuan dong hua (coltsfoot), qian li guang (liferoot), and pei lan (Eupatorium). Some herbs used to make teas contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Sometimes milk, honey, and cereals are contaminated with pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are then consumed unknowingly. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids can damage the liver gradually if small amounts are consumed for a long time. Damage can occur more quickly if a large amount is consumed. The hepatic veins may become clogged, [blocking blood flow out of the liver](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/blood-vessel-disorders-of-the-liver/sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-of-the-liver) [ Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome of the Liver Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome of the liver is blockage of the very small (microscopic) veins in the liver.

Most people have jaundice (yellow skin and eyes), feel tired... read more ](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/manifestations-of-liver-disease/liver-failure) , and even death may result. Other herbs: Liver damage may also result from herbs such as Atractylis gummifera, Camellia sinensis (used to make green and black teas), celandine (in the poppy family), chaparral, Garcinia cambogia (a supplement used to support weight loss), green tea extract (used for weight loss and disease prevention), germander, jin bu huan, kava, ma huang (Ephedra), mistletoe, pennyroyal oil (used to make teas), and syo-saiko-to (a mixture of herbs). In general, liver doctors recommend avoiding all herbal supplements because of the lack of safety testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the fact that many of these substances can cause liver damage and even liver failure, even in people who do not have any preexisting liver disease. Risk factors Generally, the risk of liver damage by drugs is thought to be increased by the following: Age (18 years or over) Obesity Pregnancy Consumption of alcohol A genetic makeup that makes people more susceptible to a drug's effects Drinking alcohol increases the risk of liver damage because [alcohol damages the liver](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/alcohol-related-liver-disease/alcohol-related-liver-disease) [ Alcohol-Related Liver Disease Alcohol-related liver disease is liver damage caused by drinking too much alcohol for a long time. In general, the amount of alcohol consumed (how much, how often, and for how long) determines... read more ](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/alcohol-related-liver-disease/alcohol-related-liver-disease) and thus changes the way drugs are metabolized. In addition, alcohol reduces the body's supply of an antioxidant that helps protect the liver. Classification Doctors categorize drug-induced liver damage in various ways, such as by how the drug damages the liver, how liver cells are affected, and which liver enzyme abnormalities are detected by [blood tests](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/diagnosis-of-liver,-gallbladder,-and-biliary-disorders/liver-blood-tests) [ Liver Blood Tests Liver tests are blood tests that represent a noninvasive way to screen for the presence of liver disease (for example, viral hepatitis in donated blood) and to measure the severity and progress... read more ](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/diagnosis-of-liver,-gallbladder,-and-biliary-disorders/liver-blood-tests) . For example, drugs may damage the liver by directly damaging liver cells (hepatocellular), by blocking the flow of bile out of the liver (cholestatic), or by doing both. Symptoms of Drug-Related Liver Injury [Symptoms of liver disease](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/manifestations-of-liver-disease/overview-of-liver-disease) [ Overview of Liver Disease Liver disease can manifest in many different ways. Characteristic manifestations include Jaundice (a yellowish discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes) Cholestasis (reduction or stoppage... read more ](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/manifestations-of-liver-disease/overview-of-liver-disease) vary from the general (such as fatigue, a general feeling of being unwell, nausea, itching, and loss of appetite) to the more severe (such as jaundice, an enlarged liver, pain in the upper right part of the abdomen, confusion, disorientation, and reduced alertness). Diagnosis of Drug-Related Liver Injury A doctor's evaluation Liver blood tests After stopping the drug suspected of causing damage, doctors repeat liver tests. A significant decrease in liver enzyme levels further supports the diagnosis of drug-induced liver damage. Liver damage caused by drugs If liver damage caused by drugs is identified quickly, people have a better prognosis. Doctors ask which drugs are being taken to determine whether any can cause liver damage. Doctors also do blood tests to measure levels of specific liver enzymes and to evaluate how well the liver is functioning and whether it is damaged ( [liver tests](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/diagnosis-of-liver,-gallbladder,-and-biliary-disorders/liver-blood-tests) [ Liver Blood Tests Liver tests are blood tests that represent a noninvasive way to screen for the presence of liver disease (for example, viral hepatitis in donated blood) and to measure the severity and progress... read more ](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/diagnosis-of-liver,-gallbladder,-and-biliary-disorders/liver-blood-tests) ). Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is likely when results of liver tests are typical of the liver damage usually caused by a drug that the person is taking. Drugs sometimes cause damage after they are stopped, even when the dose was not high, and sometimes it can take several months for DILI to improve. Thus, determining that a drug is the cause is sometimes difficult or impossible. Liver damage from other causes Because no test can confirm the diagnosis, doctors also check for other causes of liver damage. Blood tests to check for [hepatitis](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/hepatitis/overview-of-hepatitis) [ Overview of Hepatitis Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. (See also Overview of Acute Viral Hepatitis and Overview of Chronic Hepatitis.) Hepatitis is common throughout the world. Hepatitis can be Acute (short-lived) read more ](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/hepatitis/overview-of-hepatitis) , autoimmune disorders, and other causes are done. Pressing on the upper abdomen to determine the size of the liver and doing imaging tests, such as [ultrasonography](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/diagnosis-of-liver,-gallbladder,-and-biliary-disorders/imaging-tests-of-the-liver-and-gallbladder#v13952958) [ Ultrasonography Imaging tests of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tract include ultrasonography, or [computed Imaging tests biliary tract include ultrasonography, read more ](/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/diagnosis-of-liver,-gallbladder,-and-biliary-disorders/imaging-tests-of-the-liver-and-gallbladder#v13952981) (CT), can also help doctors identify other causes of liver damage. Treatment of Drug-Related Liver Injury Stopping the drug Administration of antidote if available Sometimes corticosteroids Sometimes liver transplantation Usually, stopping the drug results in recovery. Drugs to relieve symptoms such as itching can be used. Only a few drugs have antidotes. For example, N-acetylcysteine can be used if people have taken an [overdose of acetaminophen](/home/injuries-and-poisoning/poisoning/acetaminophen-poisoning) [ Acetaminophen Poisoning Acetaminophen, a common ingredient in many prescription and non-prescription drugs, is safe in normal doses, but severe overdose can cause liver failure and death. People sometimes ingest too... read more ](/home/injuries-and-poisoning/poisoning/acetaminophen-poisoning) . Corticosteroids may be appropriate in some cases. If the damage is severe, people may be referred to a specialist. [Liver transplantation](/home/immune-disorders/transplantation/liver-transplantation) [ Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the surgical removal of a healthy liver or sometimes a part of a liver from a living person and then its transfer into a person whose liver no longer functions. (See... read more ](/home/immune-disorders/transplantation/liver-transplantation) may be required. Prevention of Drug-Related Liver Injury When some drugs that can damage the liver (such as statins) are used, doctors sometimes regularly do blood tests to monitor liver enzyme levels. Such monitoring may detect problems early and may help prevent liver damage. For most drugs, monitoring liver enzyme levels is not done.
