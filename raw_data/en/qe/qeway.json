Director's Welcome and Update ( Kelly Taylor ) a. Today's Area highlights has a focused question related to COVID -19 i. Please include other pertinent updates related to your programs b. COVID -19 - FY2022 Proposed budget - House Report for IHS i. IHS asked to report things related to the pandemic (e.g. ongoing challenges and weaknesses likely to exist beyond conclusion of the pandemic ) ii. Please start thinking about those as they apply to your program . For instance, what comes to mind for me include the following weaknesses: IHS Indian Health Manual Chapter 9 - outdated Revised Chapter 9 complete and has been awaiting approvals for extended period Lack of official emergency preparedness program in IHS Need for agency focus and funding for a more formal program (e.g. full -time EMPOCs and national program managers [no collateral duties]) that report directly to the Area or Agency Directors Need for Employee Health Program Lack of nationally -led initiative , too varied from Area to Area c. American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 ( ARPA ) i. IHS Facilities = $600M for COVID -19-related needs for leasing, purchasing, construction, alteration, renovating, or equipping of health facilities and maintenance and improvement projects Of the $600M , $29M went to Facilities and Environmental Health Support Account and ~$9M of the $29M was specifically for EHSA . EHS and SFC share the EHSA so it may look like we should get a proportional share of that $9M but that is not completely accurate. DEHS Directors' Meeting - August 05, 2021 Page 2 of 6 ii. In addition to the $600M, $10M is specifically for the delivery of potable water This in creases SFC's workload so much, that they feel like they should get the bulk of the ~ $9M so they can spend that $10M on projects It's hard to argue with that, but if DEHS has a need related to COVID activities, you should work with your Area OEHE Director to see if DEHS can use some of those funds to complete that work 2.

ARPA question - if the EHSA is receiving an additional ~ $9M how will there be equitable distribution of the EHSA funds that get split between SFC & DEHS? i. The additional $9M in ARPA funds will be distributed to the Areas proportionately and should not impact what DEHS already receives in EHSA funds (i.e. there should not be a need for SFC to tap into funds EHS and SFC already receive) . SFC's addition al needs should be covered by the bulk of the funds each Area gets out of the $9M coming to them as ARPA funds . Received and processing for payment.
