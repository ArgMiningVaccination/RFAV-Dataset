However, patients experiencing influenza vaccine-associated anaphylaxis (IVA) do not always have egg allergy. In the 2011-2012 season, anunusually high incidence of IVA was reported in Japan. Objective: We sought to identify the cause of the increase in anaphylactic events in 2011-2012 in Japan.Methods: We collected blood specimens from patients with IVA from all areas of Japan. We analyzed 19 patients with conrmed IVA and 25 age-matched control subjects, including 10 with eggallergy who had no adverse events after correspondingvaccination. ELISA was used to measure specic IgE levels to the trivalent vaccines of several manufacturers and hemagglutinin proteins derived from both egg and cell cultures.Antigen-induced basophil activation was evaluated by measuring CD203c expression by means of flow cytometry. Vaccine excipients were also examined for effects on CD203cexpression. Results: None of the patients with IVA had severe egg allergy. Levels of specic IgE antibodies to influenza vaccine antigens,whole-vaccine products from different manufacturers, and hemagglutinin proteins (A H1, H3, and B) derived from bothegg and cell cultures were signicantly increased in patients with IVA compared with those in control subjects. Influenza vaccine-induced CD203c expression in basophils was also highly enhanced in patients with IVA but not in control subjects.Because IVA was most frequent in patients who received 2- phenoxyethanol (2-PE)-containing vaccine, the effect of this preservative on basophil activation was examined, and theactivation was slightly enhanced by 2-PE but not thimerosal. Conclusions: The 2011-2012 IVA spike in Japan was caused by specic IgE antibodies to influenza vaccine components.Excipients could not be implicated, except for a modest effect of2-PE. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2016;137:861-7.) hemagglutinin, IgE, activation Anaphylaxis after vaccination is a rare but signicant problem because it can be fatal if not treated promptly. However, it is sometimes difcult to distinguish anaphylaxis from other adverse reactions, such as the vagal reflex. Therefore proper diagnosis andidentication of the causative factor are critical for the manage-ment and prophylaxis of anaphylaxis, as well as the prevention of unnecessary contraindications and unnecessary treatments because of an incorrect diagnosis. Inactivated influenza vaccines are produced by means of inoculation of influenza strains into embryonated hen eggs. Thismeans that there is a risk of anaphylaxis caused by contaminatingegg antigens if these vaccines are administered to patients with egg allergy. However, safe influenza vaccine use, even in pediatric patients with severe egg allergy, has been reported, 1-3which sug- gests that severe allergic reactions to egg-based influenza vaccines are unlikely. The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac- tices recommends that influenza vaccination of patients with se-vere egg allergy should be performed by a physician withexperience in the recognition and management of severe allergic conditions based on the fact that occasional cases of anaphylaxis in patients with egg allergy have been reported. 4 Although the egg albumin levels in influenza vaccines should be less than 10 mg/mL according to the World Health Organiza- tion standard,5the level of egg albumin in vaccines produced in Japan is far less than that standard.6In the 2011-2012 influenza season one manufacturer (manufacturer A) in Japan reported asignicant increase in the incidence of influenza vaccine-associ-ated anaphylaxis (IVA; approximately 1 in 1.4 million doses innormal years but 1 in 0.4 million doses in 2011), although no fa- talities were reported.

The incidence was increased only in the population administered the vaccine produced by manufacturer A and not vaccines from other companies. One of the different ingredients in vaccineA compared with the other vaccines was 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE), which is used as a preservative, whereas the others used thimerosal. We investigated the cause of these IVA cases by collecting samples from patients from all over Japan and foundhighly increased influenza vaccine antigen-specic IgE anti- bodies and positive basophil activation in the patients with IVA but not in control subjects. METHODS Subjects Study subjects consisted of a patient group and 2 control groups. The patient group contained 19 children who experienced IV A in the 2011-2012 season (IV A group). Although the patients lived in different areas of Japan, we contacted the physicians who reported the anaphylactic events and asked themto collaborate on this study. The physicians then arranged for participation ofthe patients in the study. The diagnosis of IVA was conrmed based on the Brighton Collaboration case denition of anaphylaxis of levels 1 and 2. 7 We established 2 control groups comprising patients who had undergone influenza vaccination with vaccine A in the same year but had no adverseevents. One group consisted of 10 age-matched children with severe egg allergy who were intolerant to eggs at the time of participation in the study andhad a history of egg-induced anaphylaxis (egg allergy group [EA group]). Theother group consisted of 15 age-matched children with no egg allergy (no egg allergy group [N group], Table I ). The subjects' histories of other allergic dis- eases were conrmed by the attending physicians. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Mie National Hospital. All samples were collected after written informed consent had beenobtained from the parents. Blood samples EDTA-containing whole blood was collected from the patients and control subjects. The samples were divided into 2 parts: 1 for basophil activation experiments and 1 for obtaining plasma. Measurement of specic IgE antibody levels Levels of specic IgE to whole influenza vaccines and the key vaccine components (ie, hemagglutinin proteins) were measured by means of ELISA,as described below. The investigated vaccines were 4 inactivated trivalent influenza vaccines that had been produced by 4 manufacturers for the 2011-2012 season and 1 produced for the 2010-2011 season in Japan. The vaccine that showed an increased incidence of IV Awas produced by manufacturer A for the 2011-2012season. The vaccines for both the 2011-2012 and 2010-2011 seasons contained hemagglutinin derived from an A/California/7/2009 virus, an A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2)-like virus and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (Vic-toria lineage) virus, and the corresponding hemagglutinin proteins wereseparately used as antigens in the assay. In addition to the above hemagglutinin proteins that were produced in embryonated hen eggs, cell culture-derivedhemagglutinin proteins devoid of egg protein (Kaketsuken, Kumamoto, Japan)were also used. Other vaccine ingredients, such as preservatives and excipients, namely formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol, and thimerosal, were also tested asantigens. All antigens were dissolved (0.1 mg/mL) in carbonate buffer andplaced (0.1 mL per well) in wells of the Nunc-Immuno Plate I (Nunc A_S, Roskilde, Denmark) for 1.5 hours at room temperature. After removal of the supernatants, SuperBlock (Pierce, Rockford, Ill) blocking buffer in PBS wasadded at 0.15 mL per well and incubated overnight at 4 8C. Each well was then washed with PBS-Tween at 0.2 mL per well, and plasma diluted withSuperBlock blocking buffer (1:5) was added at 0.1 mL per well. The plateswere incubated overnight at room temperature. After washing with PBS-Tween, biotin-conjugated goat anti-human IgE (1:1,000, 0.1 mL per well; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif) was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed well, and then streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000, 0.1 mL per well; Southern Biotechnology,Birmingham, Ala) was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed well and incubated with a substrate, tetramethylbenzi- dine solution (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, Ohio), at 0.1 mL per well for30 minutes under a light shield. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 N HCl at 0.1 mL per well, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured with LS-PLATE Manager 2001 (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Plasma specimens from the 3 patients with anaphylaxis with the highest absorbance measurements were pooled and used as a positive control. Cord blood plasma, which did not contain umbilical IgE, was used as a negative control. A titration curve prepared with the serially diluted and pooled positiveplasma was used for quantication of specic IgE levels of the samples witharbitrary units (units per milliliter). Measurement of CD203c expression on basophils A commercial kit (Allergenicity Kit; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif) was used for quantication of basophil CD203c expression. The test wasperformed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, EDTA-containing whole blood was incubated with the vaccines and vaccine components at various concentrations for 60 minutes after addition of a sufcient amount of calcium solution to neutralize the chelating capacity ofEDTA. Anti-human IgE antibody at 4 mg/mL and PBS served as positive and negative controls, respectively. PC7-conjugated anti-CD3, fluorescein iso- and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti- CD203c antibodies were added during the reaction. The samples were thenanalyzed on an FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Basophils were de- tected on the basis of forward side scatter characteristics and negative CD3 and positive CRTH2 results. Upregulation of CD203c on basophils was deter-mined by using a threshold that was dened by the fluorescence of unstimu- lated cells (negative control) and expressed as the CD203c highpercentage. Statistics Differences in numeric variables were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples and 1-way ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test for more than 2 independent samples, followed by the Dunn multiple comparisontest. The x 2test was used to examine differences in categorical variables. RESULTS Demographic data of the subjects Table I summarizes the background characteristics of the pa- tients with IVA and the members of the EA and N control groups. A total of 36 pediatric cases of IVA were reported in the 2011-2012 season in Japan, and 19 patients were investigated in thisstudy. Demographics of the rest of the 17 patients who did not participate in the study were also shown. There were no differ- ences in age (in months) or sex among the 4 groups. Egg allergywas identied in only 21% of the IVA group, and no patients withJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL MARCH 2016862NAGAO ET ALIVA had of anaphylaxis. Fifty-three percent of the pa- tients with IVA had bronchial asthma compared with 100% in the EA group and 33% in the N group. In general, the EA groupappeared more allergic than the IVA group. Influenza vaccine-specic IgE antibody Levels of influenza-specic IgE were signicantly higher in the IVA group than in the N and EA groups ( Fig 1 ). The antigen used in the ELISA here was the vaccine that showed an increased inci-dence of IVA (manufacturer A). Vaccine-specic IgE levels in the IVA and N groups were also measured by using the other vaccine products for 2011-2012 from 3 other manufacturers (ie, B, C, andD) and the product for 2010-2011 from manufacturer A. Therewere no differences in titers between the products ( Fig 2 ), indi- cating that the vaccine-specic IgE in the IVA group was specicnot only to manufacturer A's vaccine but also to all the influenzavaccines. We then measured specic IgE levels to thehemagglutinin proteins contained in the vaccines (ie, those fromA [H1N1], A [H3N2], and B-like viruses propagated in embryo-nated eggs [e] and cell culture [c]) and found that the patients with IVA had high levels of hemagglutinin-specic IgE ( Fig 3 ). Excip- ients used in the vaccines (ie, formaldehyde, 2-PE, and thimer- osal) were also used as antigens in the assay, but there was no IgE binding to them (data not shown). Basophil CD203c expression induced by influenza vaccine To further investigate the biological signicance of influenza vaccine-specic IgE, we examined basophil activation by the vaccines on the basis of CD203c expression. Influenza vaccine- induced expression of CD203c was signicantly higher in the IVA group than in the N and EA groups ( Fig 4 ). 2-PE, which was used as a preservative, was the major different ingredient in manufacturer A's vaccine compared with the others. Thimerosal was used as the preservative by manufacturers B, C, and D. On the basis of the above ELISA results that there was nodirect IgE-binding activity for the preservatives, we tested the FIG 2. Influenza vaccine-specic IgE to vaccines from different manufac- turers. Influenza vaccine-specic IgE levels were measured by means of ELISA, as described in the Methods section. Solid triangles indicate sub- jects in the IVA group, and open circles indicate those in the N group. The 2011 product from manufacturer A was associated with an increased incidence of IVA.

We used vaccine devoid of both preservatives and added them at the same concentration as the nal product. This experiment was planned and performed after the initialbasophil activation experiments shown in Fig 4 . For that reason, we considered the possibility that basophil reactivity to these an-tigens might already have decreased if blood sampling was per-formed too long after the anaphylactic event, and we selected 8cases for whom less than 3 months had passed since the event. Thimerosal showed no effect on basophil activation (data not shown), whereas 2-PE signicantly enhanced CD203c the higher 1:3333 ( Fig 5 ). Influenza vaccination of 2011-2012 patients with IVA in the 2012-2013 season One contraindication for influenza vaccination is a history of anaphylaxis caused by any component of the vaccine. However, if influenza vaccine that does not contain phenoxyethanol might be safe, patients can avoid an ''unnecessary'' contraindication and be eligible for vaccination. With approval from the ethics committeeand informed consent from the patients, we vaccinated 3 of the patients with IVA in the 2012-2013 season with manufacturer A's 2012-2013 vaccine, which contained thimerosal rather than 2-PE,for 2 vaccines and manufacturer B's vaccine for the third. None of those patients experienced anaphylaxis, but 2 experienced rather extensive local swelling. One of those patients was not admin-istered the second vaccination. The second underwent the second vaccination after premedication with a nonsedating antihista- mine, which resulted in reduced swelling. The third patient had amild cough after the rst vaccination, which resolved spontane-ously without treatment. He showed no symptoms after the second vaccination ( Table II ). DISCUSSION After a spike in IVA in 2011 in Japan, we promptly collected blood samples from patients in collaboration with the vaccinemanufacturer and attending physicians in all areas of Japan. Our aim was to determine the cause of the increase in this life-threatening event. We were able to enroll 19 of the patients who had experienced this rare allergic event in 2011. Because IVA has been known to be related to severe egg allergy, we recruited 2groups of age-matched control subjects who had been adminis-tered the same vaccine safely in the 2011 season: one group had severe egg allergy and the other group had no egg allergy. We found that the patients with IVA had increased levels of IgEantibodies to the influenza vaccine components, and their basophils were signicantly activated by the vaccine. Only 21% of the patients with IVA had egg allergy, but it was not severe, andthey had no history of anaphylaxis. These ndings strongly suggest that the IVA events were caused by allergy to some component of the influenza vaccine but not to its egg component. The egg albumin level of influenza vaccines produced in Japan is less than 0.8 ng/mL, 6which is much less than the World Health Organization standard.5Most inactivated trivalent vaccines distributed in other countries, such as the United States andUnited Kingdom, also contain very low amounts of egg proteins, 8 and recent reports stated that the vaccines are safe even for mostpatients with severe egg allergy. 1-3However, anaphylaxis after FIG 3.

Recently, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System in the United States received reports of 12 cases of allergic reactions after immunization with an egg-free trivalent recombinant hem-agglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV3). 9The patients had a history of allergies (particularly to eggs) or previous reactions to other influenza vaccines, which probably led to their being adminis- tered RIV3. All the symptoms reported were immediate-typesymptoms, which is consistent with IgE-mediated reactions. Direct identication of the symptom-eliciting IgE was not per- formed. 9In the present study we showed that patients with IVA had high levels of hemagglutinin-specic IgE, and their basophils were actually activated by the offending vaccine. Other vaccine components and excipients have also been reported as possible causes of anaphylaxis. Gelatin, an excipient, was once a major cause of anaphylaxis related to measles and other vaccines.10,11Although it is still used in a yellow fever vac- cine, gelatin has been eliminated from other vaccines produced in Japan, and thus the incidence of gelatin-related anaphylaxis has been signicantly reduced.11The Sabin vaccine, an oral polio vaccine, contains cow's milk protein and was reported to cause an immediate allergic reaction in children with milk allergy.12Allergic reactions to yeast-derived hepatitis B vaccine13,14and allergic reactions against the rubber caps of vaccine vials in pa- tients with latex allergy15have also been reported. Influenza vac- cines do not contain yeast. Our patients with IVA did not report having latex allergy, and they had not experienced allergic reac-tions with other vaccines in vials with a rubber cap. The strengths of our study are that, in spite of the low incidence of IVA, we were able to recruit a relatively large number ofpatients with IVA in the same season, and we were also able to promptly develop the IgE and basophil activation assays. In Japan physicians are required to report all adverse events aftervaccination to the government's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency then provides vaccine manufacturers the pertinent infor-mation (without patient identication) so that they can takemeasures as quickly as possible. In 2011, manufacturer A realized that the reports of anaphylaxis with their products were very high, about 3- to 5-fold the average for other years. Because we hadtreated several early cases in our area and had started to investigate the cause, the company helped us to collect samples from physicians from all over Japan who had treated some ofthose patients with IVA. In the end, more than half of the FIG 5. Effect of 2-PE on influenza vaccine-induced expression of CD203c on basophils from patients with IVA. Influenza vaccine devoid of 2-PE was serially diluted to the indicated concentrations, and whole blood from 8 patients with IVA was incubated in the presence and absence of 2-PE at a concentration found in thevaccine product.

Our study is not the rst to investigate IgE antibody to influenza vaccines and their components, but it is the rst detailed study todemonstrate a strong association between influenza vaccine- specic IgE and IVA. Smith-Norowitz et al 16,17reported, from the viewpoint of protective immunity, increased IgE antibody levels to influenza virus after vaccination and after infection. Their studycohorts were very small, and they showed no evidence of IgE function, either protective or allergic. In Canada there was a large increase in anaphylactic and allergy-like reactions to the AS03-adjuvanted monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccine in 2009. 18The investigators used skin prick tests with full-strength products toidentify IgE-mediated reactions, but only 4% of patients and3% of control subjects had positive responses. They concluded that IgE-mediated allergies to the pandemic vaccine were rare and that the reactions were either coincidental or attributable toother immunologic reactions to the vaccine. 18We also performed skin prick tests with full-strength vaccine on 3 of our patients with IVA and 10 control subjects and found that all the patients with IVA had positive responses, whereas all the control subjects,including those with egg allergy, had negative responses. Our enrolled patients with IVA lived throughout Japan, some remote from us, and the collaborating physicians could send us bloodsamples only after obtaining informed consent. Thus we were not able to perform skin tests on all the patients, and we have not presented the ndings in the Results section. A major differ-ence between our study and reports from the United States 9and Canada18was the age of the patients. Our patients were mostly male children around 5 years old, whereas the North Americanpatients with anaphylaxis were mainly middle-aged women.The pathogenesis might differ. It is unclear why only the vaccine product of manufacturer A and not those of other manufacturers caused an increase in IVAevents compared with average years. Because 2-PE was the only ingredient different from the other products, we investigated the effect of 2-PE on influenza vaccine-induced basophil activationand found that it enhanced the activation in the higher vaccine dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:3333. 2-PE is thought to be a safe preservative, and it is commonly used in, for example, cosmetics,ophthalmic solutions, and foods. Several cases of contact dermatitis caused by 2-PE have been reported. 19-21However, no specic IgE antibody was detected.21Although there is a report of anaphylaxis caused by 2-PE, the anaphylaxis was induced by a topical product.22Use of 2-PE in vaccine products has gradually increased, replacing thimerosal.23No previous report of 2-PE in vaccines as the cause of anaphylaxis have been reported. Herewe show the possibility of enhancement of IgE-mediated reac- tions by 2-PE in vaccine-sensitized subjects, but there have been no reports suggesting this with other types of vaccine con-taining 2-PE. It might be that an adverse interaction between 2- PE and vaccine components occurs only in the case of influenza vaccines. In a separate experiment by manufacturer A on the physico- chemical properties of the vaccine, it was observed that the particle sizes of the vaccine components increased slightly during incubation with 2-PE, raising the possibility that larger particlesmight have promoted cross-linking of IgE antibodies (personal communications). Based on the results of our study and their own investigations, manufacturer A stopped producing the 2-PE-containing influenza vaccine and replaced it with a thimerosal-containing vaccine for the 2012-2013 season; the incidence ofanaphylaxis returned to the historical level. Shortcomings of the present study are that we did not prove a direct causal relationship between influenza-specic IgE and IVAand that we did not elucidate the detailed mechanisms underlying IVA. However, challenge tests cannot be ethically performed. Our demonstration of influenza vaccine-specic IgE and vaccine-induced basophil activation in patients with IVA might sufce toprove the relationship. We also examined lymphocyte prolifera- tion in response to the vaccine in some of the patients and control subjects but found no differences between the groups (data notshown). Our results of screening for IgG antibodies in the hemagglutinin inhibition test also did not differ between the patients and control subjects (data not shown). Further investiga-tion of other possible immunologic mechanisms might be necessary to understand the pathology of IVA. In conclusion, for the rst time, we clearly demonstrated signicantly increased influenza vaccine-specic IgE and vaccine-induced basophil activation in patients with IVA who were included in the IVA spike in 2011-2012 in Japan. The patients were all children (average age, 62 months), mostly male,and with no severe egg allergy. It is noteworthy that phenox- yethanol, which is used as a preservative in the causative influenza vaccine, might have enhanced the allergic reaction. No other riskfactors were found, and we believe there is no basis for adding any new contraindications for influenza vaccination at this point. However, clinicians need to be alert to the possible presence ofIgE to vaccine components if there is occurrence of a rare immunologic complication of influenza vaccination.
