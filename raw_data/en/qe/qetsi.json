From June 5 to November 30, 2016, a total of 174 suspected opioid overdose presentations were reported by emergency departments in NH. Sites reporting the largest numbers of ODs include UNHBC (92) and Fort St John Hospital (23). In response to this crisis NH is focusing on specific interventions to prevent OD deaths. These include: 1. Surveillance of ODs presenting to emergency departments. 2. Rapid expansion of the Take Home Naloxone program and availability of harm reduction supplies and education for persons at risk of OD. 3. Establishment of an Overdose Prevention Site at the Prince George HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (Needle Exchange), where clients can be monitored for signs of overdose and receive immediate care when needed. 4. Exploration of Supervised Consumption Services in our highest risk communities. 5. Population -based prevention and health promotion through communications, media and stakeholder engagement. Overdose Prevention and Response What can you do to help? Every Northern Health employee has the opportunity to be a resource of health information for their community in order to help prevent overdose deaths. Take the time to learn the tips to prevent an overdose: Don't mix different drugs (including pharmaceutical medications, street drugs, and alcohol). Don't take drugs when you are alone. Don't experiment with higher doses. Start with a small amount before taking your usual dose. Use less, especially if you took a break, were in detox, treatment or jail, or are new to use: your tolerance will be lower. Keep an eye out for your friends - stay together and look out for each other. Make a plan/know how to respond in case of an overdose. Carry a Naloxone Kit if you or someone you know may need it. Kits are available without a prescription and can be purchased at pharmacies or are available free to people who are at risk of overdose. A list of locations can be found at: Take Home Naloxone Kits -sites -Nov2016.PDF . Naloxone training is free and only takes a few minutes. Tips to recognize and reverse an overdose Recognize an OD: the person is breathing slowly or not at all not moving and can't be woken up cold clammy skin blue lips and fingernails tiny pupils may be snoring, gurgling or choking Call 9 -1-1 right away. Give breaths and give naloxone. For more information on NH's Prevention or: https:// ournh.northernhealth.ca/ClinicalPatientCare/ ODPrevRspnc/Pages/default.aspx Practice Support Update Northern Health now supports all community staff who work with people at risk for opioid overdose (OD) to administer naloxone and first aid in cases of suspected opioid overdose. For both dispensing and administration of naloxone, it is important to discuss these activities with your program manager/ direct supervisor. All staff carrying, administering, or dispensing naloxone must complete the appropriate education (see below). The average time to complete the online education is one hour. When any NH employed staff choose to administer naloxone from a Take Home Kit, outside of a hospital setting, whether during working or non - working hours, potential liability concerns are covered by either NH liability insurance or the Good Samaritan Act.

With support from the Ministry of Health and developed by the Centre for Addictions Research of BC (CARBC), these new resources use progressive teaching methods that draw upon the competencies that aid in students making healthier choices with respect to substance use. http:// www.uvic.ca/research/centres/carbc/publications/ helping -schools/index.php . First Responder Safety With overdoses and fatalities stemming from fentanyl use reaching epidemic proportions, the Justice Institute of British Columbia (JIBC) has launched a fentanyl website for first responders which contains several useful resources: https://fentanylsafety.com .
