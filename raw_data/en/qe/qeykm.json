Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) still needs more scientific rationale to be proven for it to be accepted further in the West. We are now in the position to propose computational hypotheses for the mode-of-actions (MOAs) of 45 TCM therapeutic action (sub)classes from in silicotarget prediction algorithms, whose target was later annotated with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomespathway,andtodiscovertherelationshipbetweenthembygeneratingahierarchicalclustering.Theresultsof10,749TCM compoundsshowed183enrichedtargetsand99enrichedpathwaysfromEstimationScore 0and5%ofcompounds/targetsin a (sub)class.

The philosophical background of TCM is basedon Yin and Yang, as well as the Five Elements (agents) the- ories. The Yin and Yang are the harmony of two oppositeenergies and the Five Elements describe the five interde-pendent functional organs, heart, liver, spleen, lung, andkidney, with each organ's own Yin and Yang [3, 4]. Whena human body suffers from a disease, the dynamic balance brought to you by CORE View metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk provided by Apollo2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine and the relationship of the Five Elements are disturbed; hence, to rectify the disturba nce, TCM applies a holistic approach with the key therapeutic principles being \" Zheng\" (meaningsyndromeorpathologicalpatternsseeninpatients)and\"Fufang\"or\"Fang Ji\"(meaningcompoundformulations consistingofmateriamedica)[5-11].TheChinesemedicines can be organized into several classifications such as thera- peutic actions, source of the medicine, and internal organs[12].Inthisstudy,theclassificationoftheChinesemedicinesfollows the therapeutic actions, of which some also possesssubclassifications based on clinical applications recorded byTCM monographs (Table1) [13]. A combination of two ormore Chinese medicine categories makes up a treatmentformula, which then contains a considerable number ofchemicalcompounds[14]. Themixtureofcompoundsintheformulaworksthrough the therapeutic principle Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi , by maximizing the therapeutic effects and minimizing the side effects [1,15,16].Basedonthehealing/pharmacologicalpropertiesandconstituentsofeachmedicine,theJun(emperor)componentis the principal phytocomplex targeting the major symptom ofthedisease.ThereareonlyafewvarietiesofJunmedicinal t h a ta r ea d m i n i s t e r e da sas i n g l ef o r m u l a ,u s u a l l yi nl a r g edoses. The Chen (minister) components synergize with Junto strengthen its therapeutic effects and may also treat sec-ondary symptoms. The Zuo (assistant) medicinal reduces oreliminates possible adverse or toxic effects of the Jun and/orChen components, while also enhancing their effects andsometimes treating secondary symptoms.

In brief, TCM is a well-structured system from diagnosis to healing, whose theories and medicines are rationally con-nected and interdependent. Note that a TCM Fufangis primarily based on medicinal plants but fungi(e.g., Ganodermalucidum ),mineral(realgar),andocca- sionallyanimalproducts(e.g., Calculusbovis ). TCMcompoundsderivesfromthebiodiversityofnatural products, of which is a rich resource for discovering newTCM-based drugs. However, to develop a novel TCM-based drug still remains challenging. One of the factors that contributestomakingitachallengeisanundefinedmedicine concoction, where characterising the complex formulationby using methods to isolate the compounds is an exhaustivetask that is very time-consuming [20, 21]. Although many compoundshavebeenisolatedfromChineseherbals[22,23], at the molecular level [21]. Another challengingissue is measuring the efficacy, pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamicprofiles,anddose-efficacyrelationshipof multiplecompoundssimultaneously,both invitroandinvivo [ 2 0 ,2 1 ,2 4 ] .H o w e v e r ,a ss h o w ni nt h i sw o r k ,p a r t i c u l a r l yrelated to MOAs, it is now possible to suggest the MOA of TCM compounds using in silicotarget prediction, henceproviding testable hypotheses to guide towards finding new molecularentities. Various methods are available for in silicotarget pre- diction such as chemical similarity searching [25], analysisof and protein panel docking [30, 31]. Protein panel docking is one of the earliest tools that hasbeenwidelyusedinTCM,wher eaco m po undisdockedto a wide panel of potential proteins and the proteins aresubsequently ranked based on calculated binding affinityscores[32].Ehrmanetal.employedpharmacophore-assisteddockingtoscreenTCMcompoundsactiveagainstinflamma-tionagainstfourproteintargets,whichwerecyclooxygenases( C O X )1a n d2 ,p 3 8M A Pk i n a s e( p 3 8 ) ,c - J u nt e r m i n a l - N H 2kinase,andtype4cAMP-specificphosphodiesterase(PDE4)[33].Inadifferentstudy,wherethe in silicotargetprediction was further validated experimentally, Zhang et al. identifiedputative targets of 19 natural products from two medicinalplants in TCM which were used for the treatment of dia-betes and inflammation using a reverse docking approach,TarFisDock server [34]. The natural products showed mod-erate inhibitory activities against the most frequent targetcandidate, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), with IC 50 values ranging from 14.14M to 113.76Mi na n in vitro enzyme assay [34]. Although protein panel docking methodrequires only the chemical structures of the putative activeingredients,itislimitedtohighqualityproteinstructuresandtheaccuracyofthedockingprogramsused[35]. In this study, the methodology opted for was the ligand- b a s e dt a r g e tp r e d i c t i o nb a s e do nl a r g eb i o a c t i v i t yd a t a b a s e available. Data mining in annotated chemical databases was used to predict the protein targets of TCM compounds tosuggest their MOAs. This method becomes viable due tothe increasing availability of bioactivity databases [36, 37].The consists annotated with bioactivity data to map \"chemicalspace\"onto\"biologicalactivityspace.\"Basedontheprincipleofmolecularsimilarity,themethod,bygeneratingastatisticalmodelusingtheavailabledata,measuresthelikelihoodofanorphancompoundtomodulateatarget[38].Themodelinferstheligand-targetmodulationbasedonthemolecularsimilar-ity, which can suggest the MOA of an orphan compound ofTCM by associating the target with the known phenotypiceffectsofthecompound(Figure1).

Nidhi et al. used a large chemogenomic d a t a s e tt od e v e l o pt h e in silicotarget prediction [28].

The motivation of the current study is prompted by the success to link TCM and Ayurveda compounds to the pre-dictedtargetsthatwererelevantfortheindicationsofvarioustherapeutic action classes in TCM and cancer in Ayurveda [44].Inthestudy,an insilicotargetpredictionmethodusing the Na\u00a8ve Bayes Classifier was able to com- pounds from the \"tonifying and replenishing\" therapeuticactionclass,forexample,withtheirknownphenotype,hypo-glycaemic effect, through the predicted targets such assodiumglucosecotransporter1(SGLT1),SGLT2,andproteintyrosine phosphatase to explain their MOA. In addition,in few cases, the predicted targets led to novel MOA andside effects being G-protein bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1),predicted from Ayurveda compounds, which contributes tocancerpathogenesisthroughtheapoptosisandcellprolifera-tion signalling pathway. The aim of the study was to extendthe analysis of the targets prediction compounds of TCM therapeutic action classes including their subclasses by first generating hierarchical clustering.

Pathway normalising frequen- cies the target prediction/pathway annotation of each therapeutic action subclass of compound to a backgroundof 10,000 compounds that were selected randomly fromPubChem [57] and ZINC [58], which consists of 194,849compounds in total. Two methods were used to performenrichmentcalculationinthisstep,namely,EstimationScoreand Average Ratio. The calculation of the scores was per-formedasfollows[55,56]. 2.4.1.EstimationScore. TheEstimationScoreisbasedonthe frequencyonthenumberofpredictedtargets/pathwaysintherandom dataset larger than or frequencyon thenumberofpredictedtargets/pathwaysinthetestdataset.Theabsolutefrequency(in(4))wasdividedbythetotalnumber ofrandomdatasets,givingavaluebetween0(enriched)and1(random).Hence, EstimationScore= 1000. (4) 2.4.2. Average Ratio. The Average Ratio is calculated by the ratioofthefrequency()ofpredictedtarget/annotatedpath- way in each random dataset with the frequency ()of pre- dictedtargetsinthetestdataset: Average Ratio=(randomset1)/(testset)+(randomset2)/(testset)++(randomset10000)/(testset) 10000.(5) In this study, enriched targets/pathways were considered if they showed an Estimation Score 0.01, and descending Average Ratio was used to further discriminate importanttargets in agreement with previous work by Liggi et al. [55,56].Therelativecutoffofbothtargetfrequency(TF)/pathwayfrequency (PF) that was5% of the highest predicted tar- get/pathway frequency was used after ranking the targetsusing the Estimation Score and Average Ratio methods todetermine which targets were considered to be enriched in particulartherapeuticaction(sub)classes.2.5. Hierarchical Clustering Based on the Bioactivity Space of the Therapeutic Action (Sub)classes. The frequencies of compounds across 477 targets for each therapeutic action (sub)classweresubjectedtoagglomerativehierarchicalclus- tering [59, 60]. The clustering method involved two steps as follows. 2.5.1. Selecting Measures of Dissimilarity or Similarity. The dissimilarity distance (sub)classeswascalculatedusingthe\"dist\"functionin and Ward's clustering method [62]. In this method, two clusters were merged if the sum square Euclideandistancewasminimal. A cutoff dissimilarity distance of approximately 20 was a p p l i e di no r d e rt oo b t a i nam a n a g e a b l en u m b e ro fc l u s t e r s ,defining14groupsoftherapeuticaction(sub)classes,namely,clustersItoXIV. 2.6.

All the enriched targets were annotated from 59 protein families and the enriched pathways were annotatedfrom 33 pathways motifs.

Results 3.1. Target Prediction and Pathway Annotation. Thein silico target prediction of 10,749 TCM compounds yielded 409unique targets, of which 183 were enriched targets. In thepathway annotation, the total number of unique pathwayswas 171, of which 99 were enriched pathways. The resultsdiscussed from here onwards cover 45 of the 46 therapeuticaction (sub)classes only. One therapeutic action(sub)classes based on their bioactivity fingerprints. Thecluster tree generates diverse spread of the 45 therapeutic action(sub)classes,whichisdefinedinto14clusters.Inmany instances, branches of the dendrogram paired up from dif-ferent types of classes or subclasses. Based on the molecularsimilarityprinciple[64],thisobservationindicatesthatmanysimilar compounds are present in both (sub)classes despitehaving different therapeutic actions. The link of the topthree enriched targets of the therapeutic action (sub)classesis discussed in the next sections as well as their top threeenrichedpathways. 3.3.TargetAnalysis 3.3.1.ClusterswithFourTherapeuticAction(Sub)classes(Clus- ter X).Only cluster X represents this group.

Relating to thethird enriched pathway, bile secretion, it has been reportedthat the major components of bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and glycochenodeoxycholic acid, can induce cyclooxy- genase2expressionandcellproliferationinesophagealsqua-mous cells, suggesting that bile acids may contribute to theinflammation and mucosal thickening [101].

However, no strong evidence can be foundtolinkbilesecretiontotheindicationofthesubclass. The \"tranquilizing, heart nourishing tranquilizing\" (Tranquil-heart) subclass lists mineral absorption (ES = 0,AR = 0.0387), carbohydrate digestion and absorption (ES = 0, AR = 0.1163), and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (ES = 0, AR = 0.2166).

Although there is no strong evidence to supportEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 17 thesecondenrichedpathway ,carbohydratedigestionandab- sorption, the two enriched pathways can be linked to theindication of the subclass.

In \"hemostatic, stasis resolving\" (Hemo-stasis) sub-class, the mineral absorption pathway can be related tozinc deficiency, which has been reported to delay wound healing [108]. In the bile secretion pathway, bile acids are implicated in platelet inhibition by solubilizing the platelets,in which patients with obstructive jaundice were exposed toabnormal hemostasis due to high level of bile acids [109].Both enriched pathways are related to the indication of thesubclass,whichistoachievehemostasis[12],andnostudycanbefoundtoassociatecarbohydratedigestionandabsorptionpathwaywiththeindicationofthesubclass.In\"tonifyingandreplenishing, blood\" (TR-blood), the first enriched pathway,mineral absorption, can be linked to the indication of thesubclass which isto strengthenthe heart thatcontrolsbloodvessel[12],whenseleniumisreportedtobeprotectiveagainstcardiovascular disease by contributing to the production ofvasodilatoryprostacyclinbytheendothelium[106].Nostudycanbefoundtosupportthelinkbetweenthesecondpathway,carbohydratedigestionandabsorption,andtheindicationofthe subclass. In the third enriched pathway, tjunctio nsintheb ileep for \"heat-clearing, blood cooling\" (HC-blood cool) subclass are mineral absorption (ES=0,AR=0.0276),carbohydratedigestionandabsorption (ES = 0, AR = 0.0753), and ABC transporter (ES = 0, AR =0.0769). The mineral absorption pathway can be linked tothe subclass when a decrease in intracellular magnesiumconcentration is implicated in type 2 diabetes [111] and thedisease, according to TCM, is described as the deficiency ofbody liquid due to heat syndrome [112]. Similar to previoussubclass, no study can be found to link the second enrichedpathway, the carbohydrate digestion and absorption, to theindication of the subclass. In the third pathway, ABC trans-porter, it is reported that the high expression of ABCG5and ABG8 in hypercholesterolemic condition of the heartis involved in cardiovascular protection by lowering plasmacholesterol level [113].

Table5summarisesthetopthreeenrichedpathwaysofthetherapeuticaction(sub)classes. The above analysis can be summarized into three obser- vations as follows. Firstly, a type of therapeutic action(sub)class is implicated in different enriched pathways andeach pathway is involved in a different disease; secondly,more than one therapeutic action (sub)class is implicated ina pathway that is involved in multiple diseases; and thirdly,more than one therapeutic action (sub)class is implicated indifferentpathwaysbutinvolvedinonlyonetypeofadisease.The first observation is indicated, in many cases, by the(sub)classesinanyofthethreeclusterssuchasbilesecretionandmineralabsorptionin\"tonifyingandreplenishing\"(TR-qi). The top three enriched pathways in a therapeutic action(sub)class are implicated in different pathways and diseases.The modulation of one pathway to a disease could providea better insight into the (sub)class MOA in the biologicalsystem. In the second observation, the mineral absorptionin cluster VII and cluster X and carbohydrate digestion andabsorption in cluster VII are implicated in various types of diseases.Theredundancyofapathwayinthepathogenesisof various diseases implies that a pathway could serve multiplepurposes; for instance, the mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK)signallingpathwaywasimplicatedininflammation,cancer, cardiovascular dysfunction, and Alzheimer's disease[117]. The third observation shows that different pathwaysfrom different therapeutic action subclasses in a clustera r ei m p l i c a t e di nat y p eo fp h y s i o l o g i c a lf u n c t i o n ,s u c ha sthe ABC transporter and mineral absorption from \"heat-clearing,bloodcooling\"(HC-bloodcool)and\"tonifyingandreplenishing,blood\"(TR-blood),respectively,whichisimpli-c a t e di np h y s i o l o g i c a lf u n c t i o no ft h eh e a r t .Th ed i ff e r does not function alone in the manifestation of a disease but through the interactions of multiple pathways[118], which account for the different clinical symptoms. Top u ti tb r i e fl y ,t h ep a t h w a y sa n n o t a t i o nn o to n l yi sb e n e fi c i a lto suggest the MOAs of the (sub)classes based on theirindications, but also shows that one pathway could havemanifold functions and multiple pathways contribute to thepathogenesis of a disease. From the TCM perspective, itis suggested that the involvement of multiple pathways inthe pathogenesis of a disease explains the complex TCMformulation, which consists of a set of herbs from varioustherapeuticaction(sub)classes. 3.5.ComparisonofBioactivitySpacesofClusters. Inthispart of study, the aim was to investigate the differences of bioac-tivityspacesamongallclustersbyclassifyingalltheenrichedtargets in the cluster to their respective protein families. The181 enriched targets were classified into 59 protein families.Out of 59 protein families, five protein families were fre-quentlyannotatedinallclusters,whichareG-proteincoupledreceptor(GPCR), proteinkinase,nuclearhormonereceptor,carbonic anhydrase, and cytochrome P450. The heatmap inFigure3 compares the five major protein families that wereannotated based on the enriched targets in each cluster.The more saturated colour represents the more significant proteinfamilyacrossallclusters.Thenumbersofproteinfam-iliesintheclusterswerenormalisedbecausethedistributionof enriched targets was not consistent because numbers oftherapeuticaction(sub)classesperclusterweredifferent. WhatcanbeseenfromthegraphisthatGPCRsandpro- teinkinasesarethemosthighlyclassifiedproteinfamiliesin almost all clusters. The results were expected as both of the familiesarethetwolargestproteinfamiliesinvolvedinmanyphysiological processes [119, 120], thus explaining why thesetwoproteinfamilieswereobservedtobesignificantinmanyoftheclusters.Inaddition,thediversityofthecompoundsinthe(sub)classesalsocontributedtothepredictionofenrichedtargets from these protein families. At least four proteinfamiliesweresignificantacrossallclusters,exceptforclustersVII and X in cytochrome P450. The numbers of enrichedtargetsintheclusterwereamongthelowestacrossallclusters,and cytochrome P450 was less classified. Nuclear hormonereceptors were found to be annotated in all clusters andthe frequent predictions of the nuclear hormone receptorfamilycanbeexplainedbythepresenceofnaturallyoccurringsteroids in natural compounds [121]. For the remaining twomajorproteinfamilies,thecytochromeP450familywasalsoexpected to XI XII VI II III VII I IXProtein kinase Nuclear hormone receptor G-protein coupled receptor Alpha-carbonic anhydrase involved in the interconversion between carbon dioxideand the bicarbonate ion that is important for many physio-logical processes [123]. All in all, five major protein familieswereobservedtofrequentlyoccurinmostoftheclustersandwere heavily implicated in the biological processes such ascellregulation,sensorysystem,andsteroidmetabolism.Thisanalysis has allowed the discovery of the bioactivity spacesconnection between subclasses in TCM based on the sets ofenrichedtargetsfromour insilicotargetpredictioninwhich the compounds from the significant cluster can be furtherexploredfordiseasesassociatedwiththeproteinfamilysuchascancerandproteinkinasefamily. 3.6. Comparison of Pathways Annotation of Clusters. In this part of the study, we aimed to investigate the differences ofpathwaymotifsamongallclustersbyclassifyingtheenrichedpathways according to KEGG ortholog. The 99 enriched pathways were classified to 33 pathway motifs, which werealmost half the number of total pathway motifs availablein KEGG. The major pathway motifs from the classificationwere infectious diseases, digestive system, immune system,signal transduction, lipid metabolism, cancer, and cellularcommunication. The heatmap in Figure4 compares theseven major pathway motifs that were annotated based onthe enriched pathways in each cluster. The more saturatedcolouracrossclustersrepresentsthemoresignificantpathwaymotif.

In addition to digestive system, infectious diseases,signal transduction, and lipid metabolism are significantpathway motifs in many of the clusters. The significance ofinfectiousdiseasescanbededucedfromfrequentlypredictedimmunomodulatory targets as the pathogenic factors aredescribed to attack weakened immune system [125]. Thesignal transduction pathway motif can be contributed fromtheclassificationofoneofthemajorproteinfamilies,GPCR, whichtranslatestheextracellularsignalsforthedownstream that produce a physiological response in a targetcell [126]. Many Chinese medicines have been reported tohave lipid regulating effects by influencing the intestinallipid absorption and lipid metabolism, to name a few [127].A l s o ,o n eo ft h eh i g h l yo b s e r v e de n r i c h e dp a t h w a y si nt h elipidmetabolismpathwaymotifwassteroidhormonebiosyn-thesis,whichthecytochromeP450proteinfamilyisinvolvedin [128]. It also appears that a few of the pathway motifs areinsignificant for some clusters such as immune system for clusterIIandexcretorysysteminclusterXIV,whichresultedfromlownumberofcompoundstoinfluencethetargetspre-dictionandpathwaysannotation.Thelistofcompoundsthatwere annotated for the Chinese medicine in the subclassesmight be incomplete to influence the classification of theimmune system as well as the remaining missing pathwaym o t i f s .I na d d i t i o n ,o n l ye n r i c h e dp a t h w a y sw e r eu s e di ntheclassification.Similartosignificantclustersforthemajorproteinfamilies,thecompoundsfromsignificantclustersforthemajorpathwaymotifscanbefurtherexploredfordiseases associated with the protein family such as liver disease and digestivesystem. Altogether, this analysis has allowed the discovery of the major pathway motifs in all clusters. Despite having thedifferenttherapeuticaction(sub)classesinacluster,inmanycases, all the clusters can be classified of having the sevenmajorpathwaymotifs.Theclassificationofthemajorpathwaymotifs was associated with the major protein families anal-ysedintheprevioussection.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 21 4. Discussion As shown in this study, the global mapping of relationships between TCM therapeutic action classes and subclasses,basedontheirputativebioactivityspacesandannotatedpath-ways,providesanovelapproachtounderstandtheMOAsofTCMformulations.Theclassificationoftheenrichedtargetsandpathways according to theproteinfamilies andpathwaymotifs allows the discovery of the relationship betweentherapeuticaction(sub)classesacrossclusters,definedinthedendrogram. In the first part of the study, we were ableto rationalize the link between the top three enriched tar-gets/pathwaysandthedescriptionoftherespectivetherapeu-ticaction(sub)classes.Inthebioactivityspace,inmanycases,thesupporting invitroorinvivostudiesoftheherbs'extracts or isolated compounds were also included to illustrate theMOA of the compounds. Among the three most enrichedtargets,weobservedthatimmunomodulatorytargetssuchasPTPN2 and PKC family were frequently represented acrossselected therapeutic action classes and subclasses. In TCM,symptomsareusuallyregardedastheinvasionofpathogenicfactors, thus sensitizing the immune system to response,and this might provide a mechanistic link between TCMandWesternthinking.Theotherfrequentlyenrichedtargets were implicated in glucose homeostasis, namely, SGLT1 and SGLT2, as well as cancer, such as TOPO1. The analysis ofthe enriched pathways showed that the multiple enrichedpathwayswereimplicatedforonetypeofdisease,whichwascardiovascular diseases, and one enriched pathway could beassociatedwithdifferentpathogenesisofdiseasessuchascar-bohydratedigestionandabsorptionandmineralabsorption.This finding is in agreement with the utilisation of differentherbsinoneTCMformulation,inordertomodulatebiologyin the desired polypharmacological manner. In addition, inmanycases,thehighlyannotatedpathwaymotifsareinvolvedin digestive system such as bile secretion, carbohydratedigestion and absorption, and mineral absorption, whichcan be linked to a theory of \"the foundation stomachandspleen enabled the visualisation of their bioactivity space, ofwhich,inmostoftheclusters,thefivemajorproteinfamilieswereobservedtocontributethebioactivityspace.TheGPCRa n dt h ep r o t e i nk i n a s ef a m i l ya r et h et w om a j o rp r o t e i nfamilies that contribute to the diversity of the TCM bioac-tivityspaceinallclusters.ThemajorKEGGpathwaysmotifsannotated,suchassignaltransductionandlipidmetabolism,were from major protein families, GPCR andcytochromeP450,foundinthepreviousanalysis. (sub)classes and provided a global overview of theirbioactivity space, this study is still limited to targets thatare only available in the in silicotarget prediction, while the entire human proteome is much larger than 477 targets.Thus, extending the biological space of the in silicotarget prediction could provide a more comprehensive overview oftargets that are involved in the therapeutic effects. Secondly, thechemicalspaceinthechemogenomicdatabaseislimitedto the version used when the model was developed andin this ChEMBL [49] v.14.0 database, natural compoundsonly represent approximately 3.85% of the total compoundsa v a i l a b l e[ 1 3 0 ] .Th u s ,t h el i m i t e dc o v e r a g eo fc h e m i c a ls p a c e from natural compounds led to zero prediction for targets in the subclass \"tranquilizing, settling.\" Thirdly, as TCM'stherapeutic principle works through Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi ,o u r in silicotarget prediction could only predict the putative targets and the top three enriched targets/pathways mightnot be modulated by the Emperor compounds of the herb,which play the leading role in treating the disease. In thisstudy,similartopthreeenrichedtargets/pathwaysfrequentlyappeared, which did not represent the actual therapeuticactionsdescribedinTCM'sphilosophypertherapeuticactionclasses because the definition of the (sub)classes could belimitedtotheEnglishtranslation[131].Althoughcompoundsi naT C Mf o r m u l aa r ek n o w nt ow o r ks y n e r g i s t i c a l l y ,t h ea l g o r i t h mi su n a b l et or e p o r tw h e t h e rac o m p o u n de i t h e ractivates or inhibits the predicted targets, which can beexperimentally influenced by ADMET (Adsorption, Dis-tribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties[55]. Therefore, only a general justification could be estab-lishedbetweentheenrichedtargets/pathwaysandtherapeu-ticaction(sub)classes. Despite the limitations, our in silicotarget prediction was able to describe the putative MOA of the compoundsfromtheselectedtherapeuticaction(sub)classesbyprovidingtarget-andpathway-basedMOAhypotheses.Withtheglobal overview of the bioactivity space of the therapeutic action (sub)classes, we could observe the similarity and the differ-ences between them, which are not apparent from the namegiven to the (sub)class itself. Hence, this analysis hopefullyhelpstobridgethegapbetweenTCMandWesternmedicineabitfurther .
