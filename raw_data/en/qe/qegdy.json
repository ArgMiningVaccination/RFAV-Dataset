Treatment will be offered if appropriate. Treatment may consist of soft tissue massage or instrument assisted massage, ultrasound therapy, exercises to help patients regain motion, flexibility, or strength, and spinal or extremity adjustments. (Call clinic if you'd like acupuncture on the first visit). Chiropractic Treatment-return visit |15 min| $40 Treatment may consist of soft tissue massage or instrument assisted massage, ultrasound therapy, exercises to help patients regain motion, flexibility, or strength, and adjustments. The chiropractic adjustments can be very light and gentle or more dynamic in nature. Dr. Harkness will discuss with each patient their preference for adjustment style, and what the patient finds most helpful. Chiropractic & Acupuncture-combination |30 min| $79 This popular option includes both chiropractic treatment & acupuncture. Acupuncture involves the gentle insertion of sterilized needles, that are as fine as a human hair at specific points on the body. This process stimulates movement of energy (Qi, pronounced \"chee\") within the body, allowing natural healing to take place. When properly combined, chiropractic and acupuncture can correct imbalances, heighten your body's natural ability to heal itself, boost energy, increase your range of motion, and restore your body to a healthy, better functioning state. Extended Chiropractic Treatment-return visit |30 min| $70 This would include the chiropractic adjustments and extra time needed for extensive soft tissue massage and/or therapeutic exercises. A chiropractic adjustment starts the process of correcting improper movement. However, often times, specific exercises are needed to create a longer-lasting change. For some patients, this involves the lengthening/stretching of tight and weak muscles. Other patients may need more core strength and balance. It's important to address any joints or muscles that may be causing compensation, in order to treat the actual source of pain. Established Patient Evaluation with Chiropractic Treatment |30 min| $75 This visit type is for established patients with a new problem, or the last appointment was at least 6 month ago. Patients not seen in 2+ years are considered a New Patient. This visit includes an updated health history and exam and chiropractic treatment. Treatment may consist of soft tissue massage or instrument assisted massage, ultrasound therapy, exercises to help patients regain motion, flexibility, or strength, and spinal or extremity adjustments. (Call clinic if you'd like acupuncture added to this visit). Acupuncture-return visit |15 min| $39 Acupuncture involves the gentle insertion of sterilized needles, that are as fine as a human hair at specific points on the body. The goal is to relieve a health condition or symptom, such as pain. Some forms of acupuncture aim to rebalance the body's energy (known as Qi) with needles that touch acupuncture points (acupoints) throughout the body. There are hundreds of acupoints in the body along 14 major meridians, also called energy-carrying channels. The needles stimulate the body's existing systems to: - React to an illness or symptom. - Rebalance the body. - Release natural chemicals, such as endorphins, the body's natural painkillers, and neurotransmitters, chemicals that control nerve impulses. Extended Acupuncture-return visit |30 min| $78 This Acupuncture treatment is for additional time on needles, for a total of 30 minutes. Treatment includes re-insertion and adding more acupuncture needles after the first 15 minutes. Patients pay at the time of service, this allows the doctor to keep costs low and focus attention on providing the best patient care. We accept cash, check, credit card, HSA and Flex spending accounts. A detailed receipt will be provided for you to submit to your insurance provider. "}
