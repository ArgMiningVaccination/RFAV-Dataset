The use of complementary and alternative practices in the eld of Allergy/Immunology is growing. A recent survey of AmericanAcademy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology members examining patterns of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use and adverse effects from CAM revealed that amajority of practitioners (81% of respondents) had patients whoare using CAM therapies over conventional treatments and many practitioners (60% of survey respondents) have encountered patients experiencing adverse reactions. During routine of ce visits, a majority of practitioners do not ask patients about CAM use, and when they do, most do not have a standard intake form to take a CAM history. There is a strong need to increaseknowledge and improve measures to prevent adverse reactions to CAMs. /C2112017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma Adverse reactions The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the United States is growing and continues to affect the deliveryof health care in the foreseeable future. 1,2In 2009, the Com- plementary and Alternative Practices committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI)reported ndings of a 2007 national survey of allergy specialists, which had an 8% response rate. The survey found that 80% of respondents were interested in learning more about CAM. 3 Respondents indicated interest in learning more about individ- ual CAM modalities including herbal and botanical medicine (88%), special diet therapies (67%), meditation (65%), mind-body intervention (60%), therapies (67%), traditional oriental medicine (79%), and acupuncture (71%) among others. The survey also found that 99% of respondents desired a\"trustworthy internet accessible resource for checking ingredients, side effects, interactions, and evidence based ef cacy data. \"In response to the survey, in 2008, the AAAAI provided theNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database (NMCD) as a member bene t that continued through 2012 and was re-instated in October 2016. In July 2013, a follow-up survey by the Complementary and Alternative Practices committee sought to determine the patterns of CAM use and adverse events from CAM, as well as describe practitioner approaches to patients using CAM. Using thewebsite www.surveymonkey.com , 10% of randomly selected academy members (n \u00bc529) were contacted to participate in the 30-question survey, of whom 71 members responded, a responserate of 13.4%.

Survey respondents were mostly male (41 of 67 male or 61.2% vs 38.8% female), and a majority were physicians with an MD, MD/PhD, or PhD degree (62 of 67 or 92.5% vs 4.4% nursepractitioner or registered nurse and others). A variety of practice settings were represented by the survey responders: Solo practice (9 of 64 or 14.1%), Single specialty group practice (22 of 64 or34.4%), Multispecialty practice (12 of 64 or 18.8%), and Aca-demic practice (21 of 64 or 32.8%). When asked about their patients 'use of speci c CAM mo- dalities, many respondents noted that they have patients who usenatural products ( Figure 1 ), in decreasing patients 'use of mind and body medicine ( Figure 2 ), many also used acupuncture (57.1%), yoga (52.1%), prayer (48.6%), meditation (41.4%), relaxation (39.7%), and breathing (33.3%). Amongmanipulative and body-based practices (see Figure E1 in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org ), they noted massage use in 48.5% and spinal manipulation in 42.8%of patients. The least frequently used CAM modalities amongrespondents 'patients (see Figure E2 in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org ) were homeopathy (36.2%), home remedies (25.7%), Ayurveda (18.2%), folk care(15.4%), qi gong (12.7%), and energy (12.5%). The next section of the survey focused on the practitioner 's inclusion of CAM in the medical visit. When asked \"do you routinely ask patients about CAM use? \"a majority (39 of 71 respondents, or 54.9%) did not routinely ask patients about CAM use and 95.8% did not have a standard intake form tocollect a CAM history. Only 31% of respondents noted that they counsel patients about scienti c evidence supporting CAM therapies, safety issues, or interactions. Regarding their patients ' motivations for using CAM, 89.9% noted a desire to use naturalproducts and 75.4% used CAM because of recommendations from friends, family, or media, whereas 62.3% were fearful of conventional therapies and 58% believed CAM to be safer thanconventional therapy (see Table E1 in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org ). The most common indications for CAM use among patients were allergic rhinitis(76.8%), overall health and well-being (71.0%), asthma (60.9%), eczema (58.0%), allergy (53.6%), and allergy prevention (42.0%) (see Table E2 in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org ). Among respondents, 2.9% reported recommending CAM to their patients, whereas 40.0% sometimes recommended and 57.1% did not recommend CAM. Among those who recom-mended CAM, 86.2% did not document verbal or written informed consent. When asked \"do you refer patients to CAM qualied providers? \"only 29 of 71 respondents answered the question: 3 answered \"yes\"(10.3%), 9 answered \"sometimes \" (31.0%), and 16 answered \"no \"(55.2%) with 1 respondent noting that he would refer if there were CAM quali ed practi- tioners in their area. The most common indications forrecommending CAM were overall health and well-being and food allergy (7.7%) (see Table E3 in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org ). A majority of practi- tioners who recommended CAM reported doing so due to pa- tient preference (16 of 28, or 57.1%) or because the patientsexpressed desire to use natural products (15 of 28, or 53.6%) (see Table E4 in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci- inpractice.org ). Regarding the future of CAM, 47 of 68 (69.1%) practitioners themselves anticipated using CAM about the same or more than currently and 60 of 68 (88.3%) felt that patients would use the same or more CAM in the future. Respondents were also asked about where they obtained information about CAM indications, dosing, ef cacy, and safety. The major resources (used by 60 respondents) included PubMed (51.7%), scienti c meetings (ie, AAAAI) (48.3%), general Google searches (38.3%), colleagues (25.0%), and the NMCD (20.0%). Notably, 2 common national resources were used only by a minority of respondents: NCCAM (National Center forComplementary and Alternative Medicine, now known as NCCIH [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]) (16.7%) and the Natural Standard website (5.0%) (seeTable E5 in this article 's Online Repository at www.jaci- inpractice.org ). Despite patients 'beliefs that CAM might be safer than con- ventional therapies, 59.7% of practitioners reported having seenadverse reactions from CAM. Examples of adverse events include (but were not limited to) anaphylaxis from daily ingestion of local honey, liver failure from Chinese herbal medication, failureto take medications resulting in premature death from cancer, malnutrition from extreme food avoidance secondary to antigen leukocyte antibody testing, exacerbation of eczema from naturalproducts containing balsam of Peru leading to secondary contact dermatitis, heated rocks causing skin burns, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome from multiplemedications taken for presumed Lyme disease, allergic reactionsto echinacea, asthma exacerbation from delayed use of conven- tional medication, and others. Further highlighting the potential risks from CAM use, a recent study of emergency departmentvisits estimated that 23,000 visits in the United States each year are attributed to adverse events related to dietary supplements. 2 Of particular concern was 80.6% of respondents (54 of 67) had patients on CAM who discontinued conventional therapy regardless of physician advice. If use of CAM is increasing along with reduced compliance with conventional treatments, ourefforts to improve our patients 'health may be challenged. For example, in patients with asthma, the use of CAM has been associated with poor asthma control and increased emergencydepartment utilization. 4,5 The survey concluded by asking practitioners what educa- tional resources related to CAM would be helpful for them. The primary desired resources were internet resources (72.7%),written materials in patient-friendly language (63.6%), addi- tional programming at the AAAAI meeting (53.0%), and teaching slides on CAM (24.2%) (see Table I ). The results of this survey include several key ndings. A majority of surveyed practitioners do not routinely ask patients about CAM use and 95.8% do not have an intake form to collecta CAM history. The true incidence of CAM use among ourrespondents 'patients may be underestimated by this surveyJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT MONTH 20172 LAND AND WANGbecause patients may not disclose the use of CAM if not directly asked (and as above, a majority of respondents do not routinelyask). Most patients who use CAM desire to use natural productsand obtain these recommendations from friends, families, and the media. A majority of patients believed CAM therapies to besafer than conventional treatments. However, a majority of practitioners caring for these patients have observed adverseevents from CAM use. Furthermore, 80.6% of practitioners hadsome patients on CAM who discontinued conventional therapy regardless of physician advice. FIGURE 2. Mind and body medicine. FIGURE 1.

More readily available information for both the clinician and the patient is imperative to improve thecare of our patients and a focus must be geared toward preven-tion of adverse events, including reactions to CAM itself and drug-CAM interactions. Furthermore, our training programs andmedical schools need to educate future practitioners about CAM therapies and develop guidelines on CAM use to assist clinicians in traditional medical practices. The Complementary and Alternative Practices committee of the AAAAI will continue toprovide the membership with increased educational opportu- nities and resources in online, publication-based, and Annual Meeting programming.
