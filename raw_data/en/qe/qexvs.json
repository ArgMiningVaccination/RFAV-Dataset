Document that the project will provide health services that improve the health care or well-being of the market area popUlation to be served. This project is to establish a 20-bed nursing category of care at Alden Courts of Waterford, a 66-bed sheltered care facility for those with memory impairment. Connected to Alden Courts is Alden of Waterford, a 99-bed nursing facility and Alden Gardens of Waterford, a I2l-bed general sheltered care facility. Therefore, this project is more accurately an expansion, or redistribution of services, to better care and treat persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD). Specifically, residents with memory impairment progress slowly through the stages of memory loss and it is best practices to allow elderly to age-in-place regardless of diagnosis. Moreover, it is also best practices to care for general geriatric residents separately from those with dementia. The rational for this is more about providing the appropriate physical plant environment to nurture residents with ADRD and to minimize confusion, which can lead to frustration, confrontation and acting out. These are all behaviors that can be harmful to the resident presenting the behavior as well as the residents around them and/or staff to include family members. This project is a result of years of experience in having residents who's medical needs outweigh the programmatic needs dealing with memory impairment, yet the resident cannot remain in a sheltered care facility when they are in need of nursing care, nor can they be appropriately placed in the general nursing care facility when they still need programming for memory care issues. This project proposes to address that gap in care to improve the health care accessibility of this specific population who have memory impairment yet require a nursing level of care. ATTACHMENT-I0 63 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued Ii The market area population to be served has a catchment area of a traditional 30-minute travel time from the Subject site. Refer to the Subject facility's patient origin data appended as ATTACHMENT-lOA. Moreover, the historical admissions of the Subject facility, Alden Courts of Waterford, illustrates that residents are aging-in-place as they should be. The majority (55.8%) of the admissions into the Courts building come from within the campus. This is indicative of the Applicant's experience in demand for the proposed level of care. Alden Courts of Waterford (memory sheltered care) and Alden of Waterford (general nursing) have consistently had to refer potential residents in need of this level of care to out of area facilities as the Waterford Campus did not have the appropriate level of care to accommodate. This referral out of the retirement community is the issue that this project is addressing. 2. Define the planning area or market area, or other, per the applicant's definition. The primary market area is a 30-minute drive time from the Applicant's facility. In a recent zip code analysis for all admissions during the most recent 24 month period, 80.8% were from within the 30-minute market area. It is important to note that 55.8% of the admissions came from within the campus. This is representative of how a true CCRC is intended to work with residents being able to age-in-place. 3. Identify the existing problems or issues that need to be addressed, as applicable and appropriate for the project. There is an internal demand for the nursing level of care within the memory care setting. Moreover, assisted living is not Medicare or Medicaid eligible. As residents medical needs outweigh their programmatic needs and nursing care is the only option, residents have to be discharged out of the memory care building in order for their Medicare or Medicaid benefits to be used. This leads to residents being discharged out to facilities that do not have this level of ATT ACHMENT -10 64 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued iii specialized memory care. Over the past two years Alden Courts of Waterford has transferred 12 people out of the building for a higher level of care, a few who were Medicaid eligible. The nursing facility (Alden of Waterford) averaged 2 prospective residents a month that were denied due to elopement/memory care risks. Therefore, this proposed project would allow those residents in need of nursing services to remain in, or to transfer within, the campus even with a decline in their financial situation allowing them to remain on campus as Medicaid eligible residents. 4. Cite the sources of the information provided as documentation. Appended as ATTACHMENT-lOA, is the patient origin for all admissions by zip code to the Subject facility. Appended as ATTACHMENT-lOB, is the Microsoft MapPoint North America 2009 map identifYing the primary service area of 30-minute market contour and all zip codes within said market area. Appended as ATTACHMENT-10C, are two letters, one from Alden Courts of Waterford (Subject facility) and the second from Alden of Waterford (nursing unit) both documenting the number of residents discharged (12) and potential admissions referred on (24) due to not having the service (nursing &/or Medicaid) available to address resident needs. Appended as ATTACHMENT-lOn, is a Market Study, commissioned by the Applicant and performed by Laurel Research Associates, exploring demand for the proposed service. 5. Detail how the project will address or improve the previously referenced issues, as well as the population's health status and well-being. The proposed project will allow residents needing to move from sheltered care to nursing care to remain in a memory care specific environment. Existing and future residents will be able ATTACHMENT -10 65 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued iv to fully and completely age-in-place. The added benefit of the nursing level of care to treat residents with memory care is that should residents be Medicaid eligible or concurrently need Medicaid (rehabilitative) services, the proposed facility will not have to discharge residents. The Applicant also commissioned a market study (perfonned by Laurel Research Associates) that found the proposed project would require a capture rate of only 0.3%, and a total inventory penetration rate of 7%, both well within industry nonns. It also concluded expanding need and demand for memory care and nursing services within a five year projected population. Thus, with a modest 20-bed establishment being proposed, patient access to nursing services for those with memory care issues would be improved and needed. 6. Provide goals with quantified and measurable objectives, with specific timeframes that relate to achieving the stated goals as appropriate. The Applicant's goal is to offer a complete continuum of care throughout its entire campus. Quantitatively, this can be gauged through the Applicant's ability to again reach and maintain the State's target utilization rate of 90% by the second full year of operation after project completion. For projects involving modernization, describe the conditions being upgraded if any. For facility projects, include statements of age and condition and regulatory citations if any. For equipment being replaced, include repair and maintenance records. Alden Courts of Waterford was approved by the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board (then Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board) on August 22, 1997 as a 66-bed sheltered care facility and construction was completed in 2001. As a nearly 15 year old building, it is relatively new as compared to traditional long-tenn care facilities in Illinois. Moreover, the parent company, The Alden Group, is a premier provider especially in tenns of physical plant environment. Together, this facility is in excellent industry standard condition and the modernization of the project is only to bring the one unit up from sheltered care standards to ATTACHMENT-tO 66 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued v skilled standards to meet all applicable IDPH licensure requirements. This will result in losing two beds. This opportunity also allows the Applicant to replace the existing furniture that is necessary due to normal wear and tear. Therefore, this modernization is not a result of physical plant deficiencies but rather solely due to the change in licensure category.

We currently have two residents awaiting outside placement, one due to a higher level of care and one for financial reasons. It is unfortunate because residents diagnosed with dementia often experience considerable decline when their environment' changes. While we do not collect data from all inquiries that need Medicare/Medicaid, we do turn. away a significant number of potential residents because we do not accept it on a monthly basis. lauren WetzellCPC, COP, Executive Director Alden Courts of Waterford Alden Courts Memory Care Assisted Living 1991 Randi Drive Aurora, 60504 tel: -1 OC I I 1 I J August 6, 2015 Ms. Courtney Averyl Administrator Health Facilities and Services Review Board Illinois Department of Public Health 525 W. Jefferson Street, Second Floor Springfield, Il. 62761 RE: Application for Certificate of Need for Alden Courts of Waterford 1991 Randi Drive Aurora, Illinois 60504 Dear Ms. Avery, On average, approximately two prospective residents per month are denied admittance to our facility due to elopement risk. We do not have a secured unit, therefore, the risk is much too great to admit these particular residents. Instead, we refer to other facilities which are located farther away in distance and may cause a burden on the family. Alden Courts of Waterford currently has secure units and the conversion to twenty skilled memory care beds would significantly aid in aSSisting these residents. Over the course of the past two years, we have had to transfer approximately twenty five residents from our Alden of Waterford Rehabilitation facility to other memory care facilities for their long term care. These residents had increased cognitive deficits but due to financial reasons, were unable to be admitted to Alden Courts of Waterford. The need for skilled nursing beds at Alden Courts of Waterford is vital, as we can continue the continuity of care here on the Alden Campus. I strongly support the need for this conversion and thank you for your consideration.

Developer: The developer of the proposed Skilled Nursing Care Expansion in Aurora, Illinois is: Alden Realty Services, Inc. Randi Schlossberg-Schullo, President 4200 West Peterson Avenue Chicago, Illinois 60646 B. General Description: The Alden Group is considering the expansion, modification and repositioning of some portions of its Waterford Continuing Care Retirement Center (CCRC). The developer expects to fund these changes from the operations of its existing senior living facilities and the proceeds from previous financing arrangements. One component of the Waterford CCRC is the Alden COlUtS of Waterford Sheltered Care Facility. To improve the marketability and efficiency of that component a repositioning of a portion of the Sheltered Care facility is being considered. The function of one wing at Alden Courts will be changed from providing memory care for residents at the sheltered car~ level to providing memory care at the skilled nursing level. This conversion will provide 20 spaces to serve those in the later stages of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD). The net result of these changes to the CCRC will be an increased capacity of20 nursing care beds devoted to memory care, and a decrease of22 units of memory care at the sheltered care level. The purpose of this study is to determine if the Waterford market will support the increase in ski1led nursing beds. C. General Location: The site for the proposed development is the campus of the Alden Waterford CCRe. It is located at Waterford Drive and Montgomery Road in the southwestem prut of Aurora, Kane County, Illinois. The campus is located in a modern suburban area that has grown and matured rapidly over the past 20 years. The Watelford campus is located just north of the Ogden Avenue (US Route 34) through-way, which is one of the major east~west commercial streets in the westem P0l1iol1 of the Chicago Metropolitan Area. It is also just about 4 miles from the 188 East/West Toll Way to the north and also, about 4 miles from the Fox River corridor to the west. A map showing the location of the proposed project is included in Attachment 1 in the Appendix to this study report. Aurora is located 37 miles west of Chicago, 53 miles southwest of Rockford, and 20 miles nOlthwest of Joliet, IL. It is the west-central anchor of the State's largest Metropolitan Statistical Area. ATTACHMENT-IOD 74 2 D. Site Description: The proposed site for the changes in memory care units is the current Campus of the AJden Waterford CeRe. The CCRC is a well established and successful continuing care facility providing residential and healthcare services ranging from independent living villas through skilled nursing care. The current configuration of the CeRC includes The Lakes of Waterford Independent Living (IL) villas. the Alden Horizons IL apartments, the Alden Gardens Assisted Living Community, the 66 bed Alden Courts memory care facility and the Alden of Waterford 99 bed Skilled Nursing Facility. The modifications that are being proposed do not contemplate any new building construction. E. Description of Site Improvements: The changes being proposed for the CeRC are all modifications to the existing memory care building. The \"A\" wing will be reconfigured to 12 one-bed rooms and 4 two-bed rooms of skilled nursing care. The skilled nursing area will replace the current 12 one-bed rooms and 5 two-bed rooms of sheltered care capacity. A summary of modifications and floor plans of the proposed changes are provided in Attachment 4 of the Appendix. ATTACHMENT-IOD 75 3 II MARKET AREA CHARACTERISTICS A. Market Area: The primary market area for the proposed Skilled Nursing Facility is defined by the area reached in a 30 minute drive from the existing site of Alden Courts of Waterford. TIlese drive times were initially detelmined by use of the Scan/US Market Mapping software that is designed for that purpose. The drive times were then confirmed by application of other mapping software such as MapQuest. They were further validated by test drives between existing SNFs in the market area. These methods are consistent with teclmiques used by the staff of the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board in their proceedings to determine a need for skilled nursing services. Such a market area definition is considered reasonable in an urban area like Aurora because it represents the distance from which potential tenants for the Alden Waterford nursing memory care unit would likely be drawn. The chosen market area contains parts of the Illinois Counties of Kane, Kendall, DuPage and WiJI. It includes a sizeable part of the southwestern quadrant oftbe Chicago, Illinois Metropolitan Area. It is an economically robust commercial and residential area as will be illustrated by the following demographic data. A map depicting the primary market area for this study is contained in Attachment 1 of the Appendix. Maps are also included that show locations for existing Skilled Nursing Facilities and for Assisted Living, Sheltered Care and Supportive Living (SLF) establishments that specifically provide memory care for their residents. B. Population/Demographic Characteristics: Laurel Research Associates analyzed demographic data for the City of Aurora, Kane County, Kendall County, DuPage County, Will County and the 30 minute market area surrounding Alden Courts of Waterford. This analysis utilized U.S. Census data and Scan/US Market Statistics Estimates. Results of that analysis are as follows: 1. Population: The population of Aurora and the surrounding areas have been increasing over the past 20 years. The primary market area, composed of the 30 minute drive geography selected earlier, has increased from a population of630,536 in 2000 to a projected 837,257 in 2019. The population of Kane County is expected to increase from 404,119 to 537,799, DuPage County is expected to increase from 904~ 151 to 943,336, Kendall County is expected to increase from 54,544 to 122,473, and Will County is expected to increase from 502,288 to 697,] 77 over the same period. These municipalities have averaged an increase in size of over 45% in the last 20 years. Table 1 shows the population of the relevant geographic areas for the years 2000, 2010, 2014 and 2019. ATTACHMENT-IOD 76 4 Table 1 -POPULATION 2000 2010 2014 2019 Estimate Projection AUrora 144,226 Area Population: ScanlUS estimates that the 2014 population of the primary market area was 815,794 with a projected increase of 2.6% to 837,257 by the year 2019. 3. Number of Households: Based on ScanJUS, the number of households in the primary market area in 2000 was 217,237 with a projected increase of 33.6% to 290,299 by the year 2019. The average household size in the market area in 2014 is estimated to be 2.86 and to remain virtually unchanged over the entire 20 years being considered in this study. 4. Population by Relevant Group: The following chart provides Scan/US information on population of the primary market area by the age groups most often used to estimate the need for nursing care services. Table 2 -POPULATION BY IMPORTANT AGE GROUPS: 2014 AND 2019 PRIMARY MARKET 2014 2019 2014-2019 Scan/US This data shows that the market area population is aging rapidly. The older age groups are increasing their numbers by more than 5% per year. TIlese are the most relevant age groups for the providers of skilled nursing care. ATTACHMENT -IOD 77 5 4. Population By Age: Table 3 shows the Scan/US estimated population in the primary market area by age cohort for the years 2014 and 2019. Table 3\u00b7 POPULATION BY AGE: 2014 AND 2019 2014 estimated 2019 1.0 2.71% Source: Scan/US Based on these statistics, there will be a decrease in of the age cohorts \u00ab5 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, and 45-54 years). An increase is expected in the age cohorts15-19 years. 20-24 years and all cohorts ahove 55 years. This pattern represents a definite aging trend. It is the age cohorts above 55 years in which one might expect to find potentia) tenants for the proposed project. All of the more senior cohorts over 55 years old are expected to have large increases and that will result in the median age increasing by a full year in the five year period. 5. Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) Population Projections: In an effort to provide better planning information to state health regulators, the IDPH has recently released internally generated popUlation projections for all Illinois counties and the various community areas of Chicago. While this information does not directly translate to a popUlation projection for this study's selected market area, it does serve to illustrate the conservative ATTACHMENT -IOD 78 6 nature of the Scan/US projections used in the study. lDPH projections of relevant age group populations for the four counties surrounding the Waterford CeRe campus are presented in Table 4. Table 4 -IDPH POPULATION BY IMPORTANT AGE GROUPS DuPage County 2015 Illinois Department of Public Health 6. Household Income: Illinois residents who enter a long-term institution face one of the most expensive experiences of their lifetime. By definition, this expense is a lasting one. This is especially true of those with Alzheimer's Disease, where it is likely to be a lifetime event. Sheltered care in Illinois is solely paid for by individuals or families with no govemment subsidies. Oil the other hand, the Medicaid program provides a financial safety net for those using nursing care. Thus, the sustained income of potential residents at the Alden Courts of Waterford is an important consideration when detel1uining what services to offer for memory care. Table 5 presents infonnation concerning household incomes of those over 65 years old in the study market area. ATTACHMENT-lOD 79 7 Table 5 -INCOME OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH AGE OF HOUSEHOLDER 65 AND OLDER 2014 Estimated 2019 Characteristics: Laurel Research Associates analyzed economic data for the City of Aurora, Kane County, Kendall County, DuPage County, Will County and the study market area surrounding Alden Courts of Waterford. This analysis suggests a market area that is prosperous and enduring. It includes such prominent suburban municipalities as Aurora, Naperville, Wheaton, Batavia, Oswego and Plainfield. It is home to several major hospital medical Centers, one of the Illinois river boat casino sites, many important manufacturing and financial industry companies and, most importantly, homes for nearly a million residents. Those residents are served by a myriad of commercial, service and recreational establ ishments. The Waterford CCRes market area is on the western edge of the Chicago Metropolitan Area. ]t is linked to the city by the Tllinois Toll-way system of Interstate Highways and the Burlington Railroad. Both of these transportation systems serve as major commuting arteries to the commercial and cultural centers of Chicago and traverse the high-tech research corridor that has developed along Interstate 88 between Aurora and tbe Chicago Beltway. Some of the key characteristics of the study market area are emullerated here. ATTACHMENT-IOD 80 8 1. Major Employers in the Market Area: Some of the major employers in this study's market area are shown in Table 6.

Unemplovment Rate: The unemployment rate in the study market area counties has historically tended to track State and U.S. trends. The county rates were usually benveen the Illinois and national rates, with the state rate being significantly higher than the national rate. This data indicates that since the last big recession the entire State of Illinois has been troubled by high unemployment, but that the counties containing this study's market area have suffered less than the state average. Table 7 shows the unemployment rates for recent years for the market area counties, Illinois and the U.S. ATTACHMENT-IOD 81 9 Table 7-MARKET AREA COUNTIES, ILLINOIS AND NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATES 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 (APR) DuPage County of Employment Security 3. General Affluence: In general, the study market area has a thriving economy that produces a high level of affluence for its residents. Below are some indicators ofthis fact as they were estimated by the Scan/US Demographic software for the year 2014: The median income ofhotlseholds in the market area is $88,046 and over 31,000 households have income in excess of $200,000. The State of Illinois has a median household income of$56,957. 77.5% of the market's households are home owners compared to 67.9% in I1Iinois as a whole. Only 4% of the market's housing units are vacant. Median age of the market area popUlation is 39.4 years compared to the Il1inois median age of 37.3 years. Of persons more than 25 years old in the market area, 43.8% have a college degree or higher education while the comparable number in the statewide population is 30.9%. Market area households have an average of 1.94 vehicles available and 68.5% of its households have 2 or more vehicles availabJe. Population density is 2)534.8 people per square mile ill tbe market area producing an aggregate income per square mile of$90.4 million. The State ofII1inois produces aggregate income per Square mile of$6.9 million. Market area residents over age 75 are 4.3% of the area's populace and nearly 40% of that age cohort have household income exceeding $50,000. Only 33% have household income below $30,000. ATTACHMENT-IOD 82 10 III SKILLED NURSING MARKET CHARACTERISTICS A. General Market Characteristics: Skilled nursing care in Illinois is a licensed service that can be provided only by licensed providers in a state approved Skilled Nursing Facility. Thus, while the Waterford market area is served by a number of different nursing facilities of varying ages and levels of proficiency, the basic components of skilled nursing care are defined and controlled by the licensing process of The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). Similarly, the actual number and size of skilled nursing facilities is controlled by a Cel1ificate of Need (CON) program overseen by the IHinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board (lHFSRB). The IHFSRB periodically publishes the Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Need Detenninations (The Inventory). This inventory and need data is used by the IHFSRB in deliberating whether to issue the pennit that is necessary before beginning any changes to facilities providing skilled nursing services. A CON application is being made for the conversion of wing \"A\" of Alden Courts of Waterford to a Skilled Nursing Care license. There is a sizeable nursing care industry that currently serves the area surrounding the Waterford CCRC. TIle Inventory for 2010 -the latest, published in 2013- reveals that in the four counties containing parts of the Waterford market area there are a total of89 SNFs with 12,122 licensed beds that provided 3,297,082 patient days of nursing service during 2010. The data for each of the four counties follows: Countv Facilities Beds Patient Davs Kane 28 798,003 Total 89 12,122 3,297.082 In general, the nursing care market is beginning to change character as the \"Baby Boomer\" generation reaches ages where they are entering that market in larger numbers. Alden's Waterford CCRC has found that shorter stays including more intensive rehabilitation are becoming the norm for nursing care. Along with this change, there is a noticeable increase in demand for larger and more home-like accommodations in the SNF. The CeRe's existing SNF, Alden of Waterford, is designed and managed to care for this type of resident There is one type of long-term care patient that does not conform to the above ATTACHMENT-IOD 83 11 pattern of characteristics. This is the person with ADRD or other memory disorders. This resident is nonnally oflonger tenancy and their care primarily concerned with comfort and quality of life issues. They are seldom involved in rehabilitation. The Alden Courts of Waterford is the CCRe's component that is designed, staffed and managed to provide the needs of this class of resident. The Alden Courts of Waterford is licensed for Sheltered Care by the fllinois Department of Public Health. While this license has been adequate to provide appropriate care for most of it residents, the Waterford CCRC has found two problems when trying to provide memory care to all of its residents. The first of these problems is that Alzheimer's is a progressive disease that increases in severity with the passage of time. ft is frequently experienced that the progression ofADRD results in debilitation so pronounced that appropriate care is not available under a sheltered care license. The second problem area at Alden Courts of Waterford is a financial one. Illinois does not provide any financial assistance for the purchase of Sheltered Care. Thus it is possible for a resident of Alden Courts of Waterford to exhaust alJ of their financial resources and not be able to qualify for an existing government safety net. There are frequent occasions when residents have had to leave the Waterford CCRC for one or both of the above reasons. The managers of Waterford feel that a repositioning of a portion of the Alden Courts of Waterford bed to skilled nursing care would solve both the above problems and allow it to provide a more complete continuum of care to its residents. B. Current Inventorv Analysis: 1. Comparable Facilities: The Primary Market Area selected for this study contains 31 Skilled Nursing Facilities providing 4,307 beds for nursing care. These facilities range in age from less than 2 years to more than 40 years and, in size, from 20 beds to more than 300 beds. Other than all being licensed to conduct nursing care, they have few characteristics in common. On the other hand, this means that the potential nursing care patient has a wide selection of facilities and services available. As indicated in the current Long-Term Care Inventory, there are sufficient nursing care spaces available to provide for the needs of the market area's current popUlation. However, as will be shown in the next section, by the year 2019, that will no longer be the case. Therefore, it is anticipated that the selection of a suitable source for nursing care will be decidedly more difficult by that time. ATTACHMENT-IOD 84 12 Since there is such a large group of existing facilities in the market area, individual tacility infonnation will not be presented in detail. More complete information for representative nursing care and memory care providers is contained in Attachment 2 of the Appendix. 2. Comparable Facilities-Memory Care: There are 20 providers offering long\u00ad tenn care that is devoted to memory care in the Waterford CCRC market area. These wilJ be summarized in this section and more detailed information is provided in Attachment 2 of the Appendix. The facilities providing memory care total 452 spaces for those with ADRD. 111e vast majority of those spaces are licensed at an assisted living level of care and only 4 providers are authorized to do memory care at the skilled nursing .level. One of the market area's memory care providers is part of a pilot program for memory care in SUppo11ive Living Facilities (SLFs). The Asbury Garden SLF would be available to ADRD suffers needing financial assistance from the Medicaid program. Even with this pilot program, the market area has less than 1 00 spaces that might quaJify for a government financial safety net. ATTACHMENT-IOD 85 13 IV DEMANDINEED A. IHFSRB Need Methodology: The Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Need Detemlinations publishes to the nursing care industry and its regulators the approved method of detem1ining how many nursing beds are needed in a particular area. The method that IHFSRB uses for this detennination is based on the calculation of a historical use rate for Health Service Areas (HSA) and Health Planning Areas (PSA). The method then uses that use rate -defined as the number of patient days of service for each one thousand persons in a relevant age group -to estimate the number of beds needed at some future level of population. The number of beds needed by a PSA is presented in The Inventory as a table showing the result of the above calculations. The calculation of the published bed need for PSA 7-C (DuPage County), PSA Kane County, PSA Kendall County and PSA Will County is provided in Attachment 3 of the Appendix and is summarized below: PUBLISHED BED NEED PSA Kane DuPage(7 -C) Kendall Will Total 2015 BED NEED 2,816 These data from the published inventOl)' of nursing beds indicate that the counties (PSAs) surrounding Waterford CCRe will have a surplus of443 nursing beds in 2015. However the Waterford CCRe's realignment of its Ilursing care capacity is intended for use subsequent to 2015. Since the IHFSRB inventory does not provide guidance beyond 20]5, Laurel Research Associates wi11 use the IHFSRB need methodology and the population data presented in Section III to project bed need requirements for the Waterford market areas in 2019/2020. These calculations are contained in Attachment 3 of the Appendix. B. Surrounding Counties Nursing Bed Need: In order to estimate nursing care demand in 2019, LRA has used the IHFSRB need methodology with the assumption that their published use rates and population projections for the market area are those that actually occur in 2015. However, since the pUblication of the current bed need and inventory, the new Department of Public Health populations estimates have been released. They have a remarkable effect on bed need fOT PSA Kane County, PSA Kendall County, PSA Will County and PSA 7-C (Dupage County). A ATTACHMENT-Ion 86 14 calculation of bed need for these PSAs using different population estimates is provided in Attachment 3 ofthe Appendix and is summarized in Table 8 below: Table 8~SURROUNDING COUNTIES NURSING BED NEED COMPARISON PSA 2010 20141 20191 2010 2020 Add 2015 2020 Beds Inventory 157 279 N/A 185 N/A IDPH Projections 294 374 185 189 Scan/US Software 273 346 185 161 Will County: Need Detemlination of Nursing Care Beds (2013) and LRA Bed Need Calculations, Attachment 3 of the Appendix This comparison of nursing bed need in the vicinity of Waterford CCRC reveals not only that the be.d need is heavily dependent on the accuracy of population projections, but also that the current published bed need is more conservative than would be the case if either the newly released rDPH projection of population, or those available in the Scan/US Market Mapping software, were used in calculating the need. The total bed need publjshed for 2015, in the four counties of interest to the Waterford CeRC, is 3.5% less than the need calculated using the new lDPH projections. It is also about 0.5% less that the Scan/US populations would yield. These facts indicate that the ScalllUS data used in this study is a reasonably ATTACHMENT -10D 87 ]5 conservative method of estimating the future population of the Alden Courts of Waterford PMA. C. Primary Market Area Demand: [11 order to estimate nursing care demand in this study's PM A, LRA has used the IHFSRB need methodology with the assumption that their published use rates and population projections for the sUlTounding counties are t110se that actually occur in 2015. The calculation of the 20 19 bed need for the Primary Market Area, derived by measuring 30 minutes driving time from the Waterford CCRC campus, applies Scan/US population projections to the IHFSRB need methodology. The detail of this calculation is included in Attachment 3 of the Appendix and the results are summarized below: CALCULA TED FUTURE BED NEED PMA 2019 BED NEED 30 Min. Drive Area 4,929 EXISTiNG BEDS 4,307 ADDITIONAL NEED 622 D. Memory Care Demand: The Alden Courts of Waterford are devoted to the care of those suffering fi'om the effects of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD). This type of specialization has become known as \"memory care\". In order to estimate the number of living units that should be allocated to memory care in the study market area, additional factors must be considered. Research has shown that the prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease varies mostly with age and increases dramatically at ages above 75. We will use the normally accepted prevalence rates and the demographic data of Attachment 6 to estimate the number of ADRD cases, and their financial qualification for care, that are Hkely to occur in the study market area. The results of that analysis is presented in Table 9. Table 9 -ADRD CASES WITH REQUIRED INCOME Age Group PopUlation Rate Cases Alden Waterford currently operates a Sheltered Care Facility (SCF) at the site of the Waterford CCRe. Its management reports that this SCF and other sister ATTACHMENT-IOD 88 16 facilities that are in or near the study market area and have memory care capability, are normally fully occupied. They fU1iher report that significant numbers of residents are forced to leave the SCF because their care needs have exceeded sheltered care standards or because their financial resources have been exhausted. The CCRC management believes that both of these current limitations of Alden C0U11s can be eliminated by adding a skilled nursing care capability to the SCF. Considering the factors enumerated above, LRA made a calculation of the potential market for memory care in the Waterford CCRC market area. The details of those calculation are contained in Attachment 3 of the Appendix and are used in the following table to report the potential market, required capture rate and total inventory penetration rate for the market area. Also considered in compiling Table lOis the finding by LRA that, in similar projects, approximately half of the identified ADRD cases will be cared for in non institutional settings such as private homes. Table 10 -MARKET CAPTURE AND PENETRATION RATES Item Memory Care PotentiaI Market -50% of Cases 7,132 Less Existing Units 452 Net Need in Market 6,680 Max Proposed Project Size 20 Required Capture Rate 0.3% Total Inventory Penetration Rate 7% As can be seen in the above table, the proposed project does not represent a significant proportion of the potential market for memory care in the Waterford ceRe market area. Also noted, is the small total inventory penetration rate of memory care providers in the market Both of these findings indicate that additional memory care capacity would be readily accepted by the market. ATTACHMENT -IOD 89 17 V CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS A. Conclusions: Based on a survey of existing nursing and memory care facilities in the 30 minute drive market area ofWatetford CCRC and interviews with managers of the CCRC, LRA found a need for additional capacity in both categories of long-tenn care. Although Waterford CCRC currently offers both skilled nursing care and memory care, the current services do constitute a complete continuum of care. The SNF concentrates on shorter care stays with more emphasis on rehabilitation, while the memory care is offered only under the CCRe's Sheltered Care license. No memory care is available at the skilled nursing care level. Therefore, the Waterford CCRC management is proposing to remodel onev.ring of the Alden Courts building and license it for skilled nursing tbat will then be devoted to memory care. LRA also identified a rapidly growing and prosperous suburban residential and commercial market area for the Waterford CCRC. The extent of the market area is defined by the area included in a 30 minute drive from the CCRC campus. LRA's demographic study conducted by use of ScanlUS Market Mapping Software indicated continued growth and aging of the market area population over the next five years. This finding was confirmed by population projections recently issued by the Illinois Department of Public Health. Although, the selected market area of Waterford CCRC is currently served by a sizeable long-tenn care industry, the need analysis conducted here indicates that stiIJ more senior services will be required in the fhture. Since the population of the study market area is botb growing and ageing, LRA predicts that demand for skilled nursing beds in the market area could increase by about 622 in 2019. Similarly, we believe that memory care demand could increase by several hundred beds in the same time period. The proposed project is consistent with social needs associated with these trends. B. Recommendation: Based on the findings of this Market Study, it is recommended that the proposed conversion of Sheltered Care capacity to Skilled Nursing Care capacity at the Alden Courts of Waterford in Aurora, Illinois be pursued, In light of the indicators revealed by this study~ these changes to nursing care services at Waterford CCRC seem appropriate and are likely to be quickly absorbed by Waterford's primary market area.

Pursuing a joint venture or similar arrangement with one or more providers or entities to meet all or a portion of the project's intended purposes; developing alternative settings to meet all or a portion of the project's intended purposes; c.

Provide the reasons why the chosen alternative was selected. 2. Documentation shall consist of a comparison of the project to alternative options. The comparison shall address issues of total costs, patient access. quality and financial benefits in both the short term (within one to three years after project completion) and long term. This may vary by project or situation. FOR EVERY ALTERNATIVE IDENTIFIED THE TOTAL PROJECT COST AND THE REASONS WHY THE ALTERNATIVE WAS REJECTED MUST BE PROVIDED. The problem this project is addressing is that residents in the sheltered care facility (Alden Courts), which is devoted to memory care, are requiring more care than can be provided in the sheltered care context. These residents are currently being transferred out of the campus for licensed nursing services. The campus's skilled facility (Alden of Waterford), as well as most free-standing nursing facilities, does not have the specialized memory care programing that these dementia residents require. This project, the conversion of sheltered care beds into nursing beds through the establishment of the nursing category of care, has limited alternatives as it is predicated on the use of existing space in an existing ongoing operation, i.e., Alden Courts of Waterford. Moreover, this is not a freestanding facility where beds are to be converted between levels of care. Part of this project is the related and connected Alden of Waterford, a 99-bed skilled ATTACHMENT-II 184 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued vii nursing facility, Alden Gardens of Waterford that is also a sheltered care licensed facility yet not specialized for dementia, and a variety of independent living options from apartments to villas and duplexes. One of the single most important determinants of alternatives is that the Alden Courts building is now, and will remain, for the care and service of those with memory impairment. As such, the alternatives to this project are limited to: continuing to discharge and transfer memory care residents out of the facility should their medical needs outweigh their programmatic needs; convert the entire building from sheltered care to nursing; and pursue the project as being proposed. As the proposed project is not only in an existing licensed sheltered care building, but also within a campus setting, it is fair to assess the alternative of utilizing a portion of the existing nursing building, Alden of Waterford, for this nursing memory care unit. The foremost reason this was not considered is the fact that Alden of Waterford is a rehabilitative model of care, which is more short term in nature, and with the lower average length of stay there is more turn around, which produces higher peek census days than the overall average utilization indicates. Therefore, a total of 20 beds have not typically been available. Moreover, it has been Alden's approach to not provide one building that can do everything, but rather to develop a building around a more singular purpose as it has on its Waterford, DesPlaines, Shorewood and Huntley campuses. In each of these, the latest of the Alden developments, there is a nursing rehabilitative building and a separate memory care building. When possible and needed it has separate assisted living or independent living (low income/tax credit) buildings also. Specifically, at the Waterford campus it has sheltered care for the geriatric popUlation, sheltered care for those with memory care issues and nursing care for the geriatric (rehabilitative/short term). The component missing is the nursing beds for those with memory care issues. ATTACHMENT-ll 185 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued viii Alden, through its more than 30 years of long-tenn care experience just in Illinois alone, has developed a model of health care delivery for today's seniors that is not a one size fits all. Alden has developed a program for each level of care and has then designed a type of building that best suits that program. Memory care units need to be locked units due to the greater propensity for elopement. These units are also typically in a one story building. Residents with memory issues are confused easily; the busier and noisier life in a rehabilitative unit would perpetuate and worsen agitation and sundowners, where residents with Alzheimer's Disease or Related Dementia (ADRD) become most confused, agitated or combative. Likewise, for general geriatric care residents to be in a smaller, locked unit may not promote the quick healing and recovery that is desired. Rehabilitative care is for residents who are trying to return home or to a lesser level of care. Memory care residents are much more long-tenn as ASRD is chronic and progressive. Shiny floors and bright rooms promote recovery for general geriatric residents while shiny floors or changing floor coverings can cause confusion for memory care residents. Changing lighting can also negatively influence mood and behavior is those with cognitive or memory care issues. In consideration of these issues, the rehabilitative nursing unit, Alden of Waterford, is a three story building designed for the bettennent of recovery, and the Alden Courts of Waterford was designed all on one level with smaller households, turn-around areas for wonderers, secure outdoor areas for each household, and locked units. It should be pointed out that even though a resident's medical needs progress to need nursing care, should they have memory care issues, the benefit of a unit specifically designed for ADRD care and treatment is essential. As such, the conversion of beds from within the nursing building would not be easily accomplished with the larger unit sizes, and ultimately it does not follow Alden's model of delivering health care to both populations. With this understanding the following alternatives ATT ACHMENT -11 186 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued ix were considered. ALTERNATIVE #1 Lesser Scope: The alternative of lesser scope is to maintain the status quo of referring out our residents and potential admissions that are in need of nursing care yet suffer with memory care issues. The size of the proposed unit is only 20 beds and predicated on the fact that physical plant design was created into three distinct units. To apply for fewer beds would require dividing and already established small unit. Life safety and IDPH code requirements of dividing the unit would render the alternative of less than 20 beds not viable. Cost There are not any capital cost to this alternative. Patient Access The reason for the project is to improve access to memory care for residents who also need nursing level of care. An alternative of lesser scope would not improve patient access. Quality To refer residents and potential admissions out of the campus setting renders the Applicant powerless to influence quality. It should be known that Alden, through all of its related facilities, tries to follow best practices of not mixing transitional rehabilitative residents with memory impaired residents and similarly avoids combining populations with different needs in the lower level of care of assisted/sheltered care. Financial Benefits Continuing to refer residents and potential admissions outside of Alden Courts of Waterford and, therefore, out of Waterford CCRC campus, does not result in any financial benefits for the residents and displaces them from where they have been living. ATTACHMENT-II 187 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued x ALTERNATIVE #2 Greater Scope: The existing 66-bed Waterford Courts building is arranged as three wings with 22 beds each. The proposed project would convert one wing to a 20-bed nursing unit. A project of greater scope could convert two of the three sheltered care wings to skilled nursing care or convert the entire building. On all new projects Alden designs its memory care units as nursing from the start. This provides the greatest flexibility of care for every stage related to memory impairment. Cost The cost of the project would triple as the entire building, as opposed to a single unit, would have to meet skilled nursing home licensure and life safety standards. Thus, just to convert the three wings, not counting the core elements, could cost in excess of $1,454,226 (3 times the project cost). Patient Access Patient accessibility is greatly improved anytime there is a higher level of care as it can easily accommodate the lesser levels of care without HFSRB or IDPH approvals. However, large nursing homes are not the answer as the long-term care industry has seen a significant reduction in beds over the past 5-10 years. As the population ages, the baby boomer popUlation has a different outlook on what it wants and how care should be delivered. This population and their family members are more educated and need more personalization of care and less of a one size fits all approach. Quality From the Applicant's perspective, having the ability to provide an additional level of care within the entire continuum of care improves accessibility. ATT ACHMENT-11 188 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xi Financial Benefits As Alden Courts is an existing facility, it is important to recognize that historically the facility has effectively only operated two of the three sheltered care memory units, as it had an average daily census of 42.7 beds (31,224 total patient days for 24 months ending June 2015). Refer to ATTACHMENT-11A for the facility's patient days over the last 24 months. Therefore, there is no need, nor financial benefit, to convert any more than one unit if a true continuum is to be maintained. If the project was solely profit driven, then the entire building would be converted as it could admit more residents with needs for higher levels of care as those levels typically pay more than the lesser levels of care. As such, this Applicant will maintain caring for its existing resident popUlation. For purposes of evaluating alternatives, a project of greater scope with the existing limitations of size and current resident population, there is neither financial gain nor loss for this alternative and no need. ALTERNATIVE #3 Pursuing a Joint Venture or Utilizing Other Health Care Resources. In many ways this project is part of a joint venture. There are three separately licensed facilities, although all owned by Alden, that are working together to provide the most appropriate level and type of care for residents. All three licensed facilities and two unlicensed entities are each best at their respective niche, yet jointly venturing to find the best fit to care for their residents. This alternative was considered and is more fully explored under alternative #4, the project as proposed. ALTERNATIVE #4 Project As Proposed The project as being proposed combines the utilization of an existing health care resource in a way that optimizes a minimal addition of nursing beds and the overall utilization of not only ATT ACHMENT-11 189 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xii the existing health care resource, Alden Courts of Waterford, but also the entire Alden Waterford continuum of care retirement campus. This project has a cost of $484,742 for 20 nursing beds in 9,254 gross square feet. That equates to $52.38 per gross square feet. Patient Access As documented, approximately 56% of the historical referrals to Alden Courts of Waterford have come from within the Waterford CCRC. The Applicant also states that 12 existing patients were discharged out of the campus to other area facilities within the most recent 12 months because the proposed specialized level of care is not available. Additionally, the Applicant has had to decline approximately 24 potential admissions due to the lack of this specialized level of care within the same time period. From the Applicant's experience, the proposed alternative would improve access. Refer to ATTACHMENT-lOe. The Applicant also commissioned a market study (performed by Laurel Research Associates) that found the proposed project would require a capture rate of only 0.3% and a total inventory penetration rate of 7%, both well within industry norms. It also concluded expanding need and demand for memory care and nursing services within a five year projected population. Thus, with a modest 20-bed establishment being proposed, patient access to nursing services for those with memory care issues would be improved and needed. Quality The issue as presented here is about accessibility and not quality. The Applicant states and continues to offer its commitment to the highest quality in care and in physical plant environment. This alternative would continue the high quality already provided at all the levels of care within the Alden Waterford CCRe.

As such, establishment project's need to be of a minimum size to effectively realize economies\u00b7of\u00b7scale, which historically is a minimum of 65\u00b7 75 beds that can still afford to meet IDPH and life safety code standards. IDPH has a norm of between 435 -713 gross square feet per bed and a norm of $226 per gross square feet according to the 3rd quartile of the RS Means report (Michael Constantino, IHFSRB Chief of Project Review July 24, 2015). Appended as ATTACHMENT -llB, is a copy of this correspondence. Thus, even to construct a 20-bed facility could cost $1,966,200 to $3,222,760 just for construction and contingencies without any soft costs. Utilizing the existing available space provides many financial benefits beyond mere hard construction project costs.

Identify the calculated number of beds needed (excess) in the planning area. See HFSRB website (http://hfsrb.illinois.gov) and click on \"Health Facilities Inventories & Data\". According to the Update to the Inventory of Health Care Facilities and Services and Need Determinations -2013 Long-Term Care Services dates June 15,2015, the Board's website (hard copy appended as ATTACHMENT -13A) identifies an excess of 248 nursing care beds in Health Service Area 8, Planning Area Kane. The existing bed need calculation is expected to be updated soon by the Board as the current five year projection is for Calendar Year 2015. This project is not the typical establishment of beds and services. The proposed 20 nursing beds are part of a CCRC campus consisting of 131 independent living units and three separately licensed facilities: Alden Courts -a 66-bed sheltered care facility devoted exclusively to memory care. Alden Gardens -a I21-bed sheltered care facility devoted to geriatric residents not needing memory care services. Alden of Waterford -a 99-bed skilled nursing facility for geriatrics patients without memory care requirements. Appended as ATTACHMENT-13B is a site map of the entire Alden Waterford Campus illustrating all components within this extensive CCRC. This project is more of a repositioning of existing beds. Specifically, the 20 proposed nursing beds will also cater to those with memory impairment. As the calculated bed need does not differentiate between general nursing, short term rehabilitation and specialized memory care type of nursing beds, the Applicant solicited Laurel Research Associates to perform a market study for this conversion project. This study is ATTACHMENT -13 240 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xvii appended as ATTACHMENT-Ion. It found that the 30-minute service area had a robust population that could support additional nursing beds and nursing beds specialized for memory care. This data supports the Applicant's experience of referring out existing residents and potential admissions for the proposed service to out of campus and out of area facilities for care. 2. Attest that the primary purpose of the project is to serve residents of the planning area and that at least 50% of the patients will come from within the planning area. As the Alden Courts of Waterford patient origin data (appended as ATTACHMENT- lOA) indicates nearly 81 % of all admissions were derived from within the 30-minute travel time service area and over 50% (55.8%) were residents who aged-in-place from within the CCRC campus. 3. Provide letters from referral sources (hospitals, physicians, social services and others) that attest to total number of prospective residents (by zip code of residence) who have received care at existing LTC facilities located in the area during the 12-month period prior to submission of the application. Referral sources shaH verify their projections and the methodology used, as described in Section 1125.540. Appended as ATTACHMENT-13C are 2 hospital/physician referral letters providing 156 of the proposed and historical referrals. Collectively, these referral sources have identified ] 56 historical and potential annual referrals to Alden Courts of Waterford for the next two years.

Jefferson Street/ Second Floor Springfield, IL 62761 RE: Application for Certificate of Need for Alden Courts of Waterford 1991 Rand; Drive Aurora,ll Dear Ms. Avery, I am a physician who currently sees residents at Alden Courts of Waterford. The building is specifically designed to service residents who have been diagnosed with dementia. The residents currently living in this building receive great care and the staff is truly dedicated to their well-being. There is a shortage of appropriate care for residents with dementia who receive Medicare and Medicaid benefits. I have had patients at Alden Courts who have had to transfer out to nursing homes for financial reasons and it is detrimental to their well-being. Over the years, I have referred approximately 5 patients per month to other facilities farther from home that were not as well equipped to care for our patients. Due to HIPPA compliance Identifications of residents could not be provided. I could refer approximately 5 patients per month within a 24 month period after the project is completed. if Alden Courts were able to offer these services the residents could continue to receive quality care without Interrupting their living situation. As the population continues to age in and around the Aurora area, these services are needed as much as ever. Please note that these patient referrals have not been used to support any other pending or approved certificate of need application for this area. I encourage you to consider their application.

Jefferson Street, Second Floor Springfield, Il62761 FAJC:63~16-8306 RE; Application for Certificate of Need for Alden courts of Waterford 1991 Randi Drive Aurora,ll Dear Ms. Avery, ~ 000216062 I am writing to express my support for Alden's proposed expansion of nursing memory care services which will be accomplished through the conversion of 22 sheltered care beds to 20 skilled care beds at Alden Courts of Waterford, which is currently a 66-bed sheltered memory facility in Aurora. Upon project completion, the facility will offer 44 sheltered care and 20 nursing care beds for all those with memory impairment. I have referred approximately eight patients a month to other facilities that were not as well equipped to care for our patients, due to HIPAA compliance identifications of residents cannot be provided. I would be able to refer at least 8 patients per month to Alden Courts within a 24 month period after project completion. With the continuum of care community at Alden of Waterford there are residential services from independent villas and duplexes and apartments all the way through skilled rehabilitation services. As the population continues to age in and around the Aurora area, these services are needed as much as ever. Please note that these patient referrals have not been used to support any other pending or approved certificate of need application for this area. Alden of Waterford has been part of the ~urora community for nearly 20 years. I hope that it will continue for another 20 years and continue to grow and evolve as it has been. As a community leader in senior health care, Alden of Waterford has provided educational discussions for the community, provided blood pressure checks, and entertained the communltv with various events. I urge you to give Alden's certificate of need application every consideration. Sincerely, 245 OFFICIAL.\u00a7~ . ANNA GOLDSTE'N NOTARY PUBLIC, STATE OF ILlINOIS . 'My Commission Expires ()2/2.4120t8 ATTACHMENT -BC SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xviii Criterion 1125.550 -Service Demand Expansion of General Long-Term Care The applicant shall document #1 and either #2 or #3: 1. Historical Service Demand a. An average annual occupancy rate that has equaled or exceeded occupancy standards for general LTC, as specified in Section 1125.210(c), for each of the latest two years. Alden Courts of Waterford is a sheltered care facility catering to those with memory impairments. As it is not a nursing care facility, it does not have an annual occupancy standard; therefore, this item is not germane. b. If prospective residents have been referred to other facilities in order to receive the subject services, the applicant shall provide documentation of the referrals, including completed applications that could not be accepted due to lack of the subject service and documentation from referral sources, with identification of those patients by initials and date. The Applicant has needed to refer both existing residents (12 in past 12-months from Alden Courts of Waterford) and prospective residents (approximately 24 in past 12 months from Alden of Waterford) to other facilities not on its campus in order to receive nursing services for individuals with memory impairment. Refer to ATTACHMENT- 10C. 2. Projected Referrals The applicant shall provide documentation as described in Section 1125.540(d). Appended as ATTACHMENT-13C are two (2) physician referral letters indicating that 156 annual referrals could be made to the facility upon project completion for the next two years. This project is only for 20 beds and with 156 referrals the resultant average length of stay would be only 42 days. This proposed population is not the short-term rehabilitative population. If the actual resultant average length of stay is only 100 days, which is still short for this population, ATT ACHMENT -15 246 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xix then only 66 annual referrals would be necessary to maintain optimal utilization. Moreover, as over half of all admissions to Alden Courts of Waterford have come from within the campus (refer to ATTACHMENT-lOA), it can be expected that the previously documented referrals will flow internally instead of to other area facilities. Therefore, it would appear that there is more than enough demand for the proposed beds and services. In support of the Applicant'S experienced demand for the proposed services, a market feasibility study was commissioned and performed. Laurel Research Associates determined that (using the State's new demographic estimates and projections) there was and will be a need for additional nursing care services that cater to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD). The study found the proposed project would require a capture rate of only 0.3% and a total inventory penetration rate of 7%, both well within industry norms. Thus, with a modest 20- bed establishment being proposed, patient access to nursing services for those with memory care issues would be improved and needed. 3. If a projected demand for service is based upon rapid population growth in the applicant facility's existing market area (as experienced annually within the latest 24- month period), the projected service demand shall be determined as described in Section 1125.540 (e). This project is not based upon rapid population growth and as such, this item is not applicable. ATTACHMENT-IS 247 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xx Criterion 1125.590 -Staffing Availability 1. For each category of service, document that relevant clinical and professional staffing needs for the proposed project were considered and that licensure and JCAHO staffing requirements can be met. Nursing care is the only category of service applicable. It should be known that this project includes the existing operations in good standing with IDPH and CMMS that meet all licensing requirements to include staffing. Moreover, upon project completion, the facility will maintain its good standing with IDPH and CMMS. 2. Provide the following documentation: a. The name and qualification of the person currently filling the position, if applicable; and b. Letters of interest from potential employees; and c. Applications filed for each position; and d. Signed contracts with the required staff; or e. A narrative explanation of how the proposed staffing will be achieved. Appended as ATTACHMENT-19A, is the existing and proposed staffing pattern for the existing 22-bed sheltered care unit and the proposed 20-bed nursing care unit, by position title at the Subject facility. This project will establish a new category of service resulting in an increase of full time equivalents from 36.5 full time equivalents to 45 full time equivalents, a net increase of 8.5 full time equivalents. The proposed staffing will be achieved in the following manner: The Applicants are related to a much larger organization that operates several general and several specialized long-term care facilities. Therefore, the Applicant and its administrative service company have the resources of general long-term care facilities throughout Illinois. This organization also has several assisted living and independent living units within Illinois. It is ATTACHMENT -19 248 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xxi the policy of the organization to begin a comprehensive recruitment program for every new facility, or new category of service, approximately four to six months prior to the opening in order to insure that the new facility has all of the necessary positions filled with qualified personnel. Local advertising in the area newspaper and at area nursing schools has generally been sufficient in attracting the needed professional health care manpower. Furthermore, it is the policy of the organization to promote from within their company whenever possible which allows the transfer of top professionals in their field to start-up facilities. The Applicant is closely related to Alden Management Services, Inc., the administrative services company, who recruits locally, regionally, and nationally for highly qualified staff. 1. A listing is obtained from the Illinois Board of Nurses in the geographic area of the proposed facility. Letters are mailed to announce the opening of the new facility, or category of service, in the specific areas and the positions that are available; 2. Advertisement in the local newspaper; 3. A special day for nurses will be held in the community. The nurses from the surrounding area will be invited to a special open house and tour of the facility. A film will also be shown to introduce the Applicant and its other Long-Term Care facilities, concluding with a question and answer session on the philosophy of the organization; 4. Announcement of the opening of the facility will be sent to the area Schools of Nursing. It is the philosophy of the organization that an innovative nursing program, and a continual in-service training program enhances the attraction of new employees and helps retain qualified and dedicated staff. It should be noted that the administrative services company is located in Chicago, and is very familiar with the employment situation of the area. Alden also has employees within the area and the State to pull from to fill ATTACHMENT-19 249 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xxii any needed position. The proposed employees will have paid continuing education credits, competitive wages, and a pension offered. With such a large number of existing employees one strong focus of recruitment will be by word of mouth by these existing employees to.their respective communities. Furthermore, Alden will provide an upward mobility transfer for those employees within the market area. As an existing facility, the following are the specific hiring procedures used at the Subject facility: 1. Applications are completed either online or in person; 2. Hiring manager reviews the applications; 3. Calls are made to the eligible candidates for each position to interview with specific manager; 4. If the candidate meets the requirements of the position, a second interview is scheduled with the Executive Director; 5. If the position is a management position, an interview is scheduled with a corporate partner to determine whether the candidate meets the job requirements; 6. Potential candidates are drug tested following a second successful interview and are informed that results will be communicated with them within a week; 7. Potential candidates are called by the Business Office Manager when the drug test results are received; 8. If the drug test results show the candidate is eligible for hire, the candidate is then scheduled to come in for orientation. Employee turnover at Alden Courts of Waterford is very low and the Applicant has not experienced any difficulty in maintaining appropriate staffing levels. Lauren Wetzel, Executive ATTACHMENT-19 250 SECTION IV -SERVICE SPECIFIC REVIEW CRITERIA Continued xxiii Director of Alden Courts of Waterford, has provided a statement indicating more than half of the current employees have more than two years of seniority and several have been there as long as seven years. Additionally, she has provided a listing of applications on file by position title. Ms. Wetzel's documentation is appended as ATTACHMENT-19B. Thus, it does not appear that between the Applicant's experience and through the experience of the existing campus that there will be any difficulty in securing the needed health care manpower.

The building next door, Alden Courts of Waterford, is specifically deSigned to service residents who have been diagnosed with dementia. In the past year, I have referred patients to other facilities farther from home that were not as well equipped to care for my patients.

I currently see patients at Alden of Waterford Rehabilitation and Healthcare facility. The Alden Courts of Waterford facility is specifically designed to care for those patients in need of memory care.

If the project involves modernization of a category of LTC bed service, the applicant shall document that the bed areas to be modernized are deteriorated or functionally obsolete and need to be replaced or modernized, due to such factors as, but not limited to: a. High cost of maintenance; This item is not applicable. b. Non-compliance with licensing or life safety codes; As this project is changing from sheltered care to nursing, the modernization requires meeting the higher level of licensing standards to include physical plant requirements. Although this cost is minor, it is part of the project. Specifically, to be eligible for nursing licensure, the unit requires the addition of its own clean and soiled utiHties, a tub/shower room that meets standards, and the addition of an exam room. Finally, to help accommodate these changes/additions one two-bed room will be repurposed for the exam room. These are the extent of the alterations to the unit that pertain to licensing requirements. c. Changes in standards of care (e.g., private versus multiple bed rooms); or This item is not applicable. d. Additional space for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. As explained in item \"b\" above, part of the renovations include \"required\" diagnostic/therapeutic space such as the exam room which was not required under the sheltered care level of licensing. The need for this space is primarily due to licensing requirements. 2. Documentation shall include the most recent: a. IDPH and CMMS inspection reports; and ATTACHMENT-25 269 SECTION V -FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC FEASffiILITY REVIEW Continued ii The existing space is licensed as sheltered care. The need to modernize is more about realigning the campus continuum of care to provide a nursing level of care for memory impaired residents than it is about correcting or updating the facility to meet present day standards and practices. This facility is designed specifically for the care and treatment of those with memory issues and as it continues in that path, a modernization is merely needed to meet that end with IDPH licensure. b.
