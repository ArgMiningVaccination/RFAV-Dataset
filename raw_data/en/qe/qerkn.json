Anthroposophic medicine is neither truly alternative (rejecting conventional Western medicine) nor complementary in this sense. I have tried to adjust the introduction to reflect this, but am not sure what the final wording should be. It was created more as an extension to conventional medicine, (see [here](http://www.chisuk.org.uk/bodymind/whatis/anthroposophical.php) and [here](http://www.altmd.com/Articles/Anthroposophical-Medicine--Encyclopedia-of-Alterna)) and is probably practiced somewhere between this and as an alternative. Any suggestions for wording? [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 01:40, 5 December 2008 (UTC) - I disagree with the current wording in the lead: AM is an extension of conventional medicine (as \"anthroposophically extended medicine\"). It is not just a therapy that's tacked on to conventional medical care, like aromatherapy. Rather an anthroposophical medical practice typically employs a number of these complementary therapies, like physiotherapy, therapeutic eurythmy, rhythmical massage, art therapy, music therapy, clay modeling, speech therapy and biography work. - If you consider the treatment of cancer as a typical example, a full anthroposophical medical treatment could include surgery, chemotherapy, xray radiation therapy (i.e. all of the conventional approaches) along with Iscador therapy (as subcutaneous injections, tumor site injections and/or IV infusions), rhythmical massage, therapeutic eurythmy, art therapy, etc. The Iscador therapy directly complements the conventional therapies (enhancing resistance, strengthening the immune system and mitigating the side effects of the chemotherapy). The other therapies work on the subtler aspects of the patient's being. - So this is not \"alternative\" meaning replacing or supplanting conventional methods, but rather extending and complementing conventional medical methods. -- [EPadmirateur](/wiki/User:EPadmirateur)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:EPadmirateur)) 03:28, 5 December 2008 (UTC) Studies of Efficacy I made the following edit: The multicenter PARSIFAL study, involving 6,630 children age 5 to 13 in 5 European countries, concluded that certain practices of anthroposophical doctors, such as restrictive use of vaccinations, antibiotics and antipyretics, are associated with a reduced risk of allergic disease and higher risk of measles in children.[9] (Added vaccinations and risk of measles [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 00:44, 8 January 2009 (UTC) And then I actually read the study and made further corrections: \"An analysis of some of the data from the multicenter PARSIFAL study, involving 6,630 children age 5 to 13 in 5 European countries, concluded that certain factors in the anthroposophic lifestyle, such as restrictive use of vaccinations, antibiotics and antipyretics, were associated with a reduced risk of allergic disease. Measles was more common in the Antrhroposophic group children, likely because of the reduced use of vaccinations in that group. [9] \" The paper is not the PARSIFAL study, but an analysis of a subset of the data. The analysis was between parents of children attending \"Steiner Schools\" and a control group. Correlations were drawn between elements of the Anthroposophical lifestyle and various outcomes such as asthma. Actual treatments were not discussed. It is questionable as to whether this fits in the \"Studies of Efficacy\" section at all as it deals with lifestyle issues rather than medical treatments. Also interesting is that children in the \"control\" group had mothers who smoked significantly more during pregnancy and had parents who were twice as likely to currently smoke. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 05:44, 8 January 2009 (UTC) The following should be deleted: \"According to an on-going randomized study of mistletoe's effectiveness, \"Recent basic studies reported tumor response and survival prolongation in number of treatments with Mistletoe preparations. There are evidence based data for using this drug as side effect reducer when used in combination with chemotherapy regimen treatment.\"[17]\" The reference is a link to a description of an ongoing clinical trial and cannot be used as a reliable source until the study has been completed and results published. We should probably add this statement from the National Cancer Institute: \"At this time, there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of mistletoe as a treatment for cancer except in carefully designed clinical trials. These trials will give more information about whether mistletoe can be useful in treating certain types of cancer.\" In reality, much of the mistletoe section should just be condensed down to a couple of sentences. Its use does not in any way validate anthroposophical medicine. Mistletoe has been used as a drug since antiquity. It would be appropriate to discuss why Steiner promoted mistletoe's use and how this use fits into the anthroposophical scheme. Currently bioactive components isolated from mistletoe are being studied, but the connection with anthroposophical medicine is long gone. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 01:04, 8 January 2009 (UTC) OK, I obliterated most of the mistletoe stuff. The use and study of mistletoe and its extracts has lost its association with anthroposophical medicine. It is just another natural product being examined by conventional means. It would be interesting for someone to report about why Steiner started using it. I understand that it had something to do with the parasitic nature of mistletoe as it grows on trees. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 08:02, 8 January 2009 (UTC) - Can you document the absence of an association? Mistletoe extracts have been developed out of researchers working out of A.M.. Please don't remove this section unless you can document a current lack of connection. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 18:50, 8 January 2009 (UTC) - Fair enough. Do you think that these studies actually add anything to the article?

It reads as though Steiner knew about capillary osmotic pressure, which he almost certainly did not. The reference is from 1995. Steiner also had some unconventional ideas about the brain. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 07:45, 8 January 2009 (UTC) This article: Marinelli, Ralph and others The Heart Is Not A Pump Frontier Perspectives 5(1), 1995 does not deal with capillary pressure and is thus not the correct reference for the statement in the article. I will delete it. There are mentions of the idea of the interaction of capillary pressure and blood flow in articles such as these: [http://www.waldorflibrary.org/pg/journalFocus/journalFocus.asp?journalID=15](http://www.waldorflibrary.org/pg/journalFocus/journalFocus.asp?journalID=15) (way down at the bottom of the page). These are not peer-reviewed scientific articles and so cannot be used to support their claims. I am currently reading Steiner's Lecture on the heart and will provide a reference shortly. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 01:56, 12 January 2009 (UTC) - Unfortunately we can't use either source, per the [ArbCom ruling](/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education#Remedies): needs to be from a non-anthroposophical publisher and not directly from Rudolf Steiner either, which would be either a direct quote (not allowed) or [original research](/wiki/Wikipedia:OR). -- [EPadmirateur](/wiki/User:EPadmirateur)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:EPadmirateur)) 02:25, 12 January 2009 (UTC) - Well, that sucks. I am not too fond of the \"Frontiers\" article about how \"the heart is not a pump\" but I could probably work it in. It appears to be a peer-reviewed source for \"alternative\" medicine. What I would really like to add is how modern day Anthroposophical medicine reconciles Steiner's early beliefs about organ systems with their current practices.

Mistletoe This article devotes entirely too much space to discussing [medicine](/wiki/Medicine). This article is about the spiritual occult philosophy, [Mistletoe#Use in cancer treatment](/wiki/Mistletoe#Use_in_cancer_treatment) is only historically or peripherally related. Please try to stay on topic. \u2014Preceding [unsigned](/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures) comment added by [68.101.71.128](/wiki/Special:Contributions/68.101.71.128) ( [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:68.101.71.128&action=edit&redlink=1)) 06:35, 10 January 2009 (UTC) - This article is about anthroposophic medicine; how can it be devoting too much space to discussing medicine??? You may be confusing this topic with [anthroposophy](/wiki/Anthroposophy). [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 13:28, 10 January 2009 (UTC) - (edit conflict)Likewise, I don't understand: this article is about a recognized, widely practiced system of medicine. Mistletoe therapy in cancer treatment is one of the more central aspects of this system. Your deletion, 68.101.71.128, is unjustified based on your argument. -- [EPadmirateur](/wiki/User:EPadmirateur)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:EPadmirateur)) 13:35, 10 January 2009 (UTC) Ref 23:Gunver S. Kienle, \"Mistletoe in Cancer Treatment: Clinical Studies\" needs to be clarified. When I click on that link I get a dead end. If I backtract to the website I find that it is an Anthroposophical website, which is fine and expected, and lists a lot of clinical trials and their conclusions. The website is not written by Dr. Kienle, nor are all of the reviews. Which review, exactly is meant? It turns out that many reviews of mistletoe use for cancer use \"Anthroposophical\" and \"Non-Anthroposophical\" dosage. We will need to remove those reviews that include both and concentrate only on those that use the (low?) dosing regimens. For example, one review quoted in this article suggests that direct injection of high dose mistletoe extract directly into a tumor results in tumor shrinkage, which is expected from preclinical data. However, this result does not reflect the Anthroposophical use of mistletoe and should not be included in this section. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 00:28, 11 January 2009 (UTC) - I have corrected the link. All of the reviews and studies cited by Kienle on the page deal with anthroposophical mistletoe therapy. The [2007 EJMR review](http://wissenschaft.mistel-therapie.de/Dateien/Downloads/Studien/Kienle_2007_Mistel.pdf)is probably the best place to start. There is also the Kienle, Kiene and Albonico book [Anthroposophic Medicine](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=Y4B99iUJPuYC&dq=kienle+anthroposophic+medicine&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=mp-bHAAm31&sig=f-suGPBEGPEY7tS0m7MuS4YJH3o&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPP1,M1)that has a limited search in Google. Finally you may want to view the [40 minute presentation](http://streamsync.qbrick.com/06595/071119/frameset.htm?video.asx&)(mostly in English) by Kienle in November 2007 about mistletoe therapy. She cites 35 controlled clinical trials of which 26 trials reported on survival and 11 reported on quality of life. -- [EPadmirateur](/wiki/User:EPadmirateur)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:EPadmirateur)) 04:19, 11 January 2009 (UTC) Clearly the state of mistletoe clinical research is a mess, as Kienle and virtually everybody else concludes. I especially dislike the claims for a \"positive outcome\" in some of these studies when the positive outcome is somethingl like \"quality of life\" or \"reduction of side effects of conventional therapy\". While these are certainly useful goals for clinical trials, very often the summary is worded such that it is difficult to tell why the study was considered positive. Leaving my OR for a moment: One question that I have is about the difference between homeopathic vs. anthroposophical dosages and routes of administration of mistletoe. I suspect that the anthroposophical studies use real amounts of the active ingredients of mistletoe as opposed to the dubious homeopathic doses. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 04:33, 13 January 2009 (UTC) - From what I have seen and read, the potencies are typically 1x, 2x or 6x. You can generally tell (by sight, smell or taste) that there is a significant amount of active substance in the remedy. I don't know about Iscador potencies. However, I think the point of the remedy is not so much to have a direct biological effect as to induce the person's body (and subtler bodies) to overcome the illness. -- [EPadmirateur](/wiki/User:EPadmirateur)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:EPadmirateur)) 16:52, 13 January 2009 (UTC) Do you have a reference for the difference between \"homeopathic\" and anthroposophic doses, either in general or specifically? I mean one that we are actually allowed to use ;-). Your point about why an anthroposopic practitioner might view the efficacy studies in a fundementally different light than a conventional physician is what we should be writing about in this article, I think. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 00:49, 15 January 2009 (UTC) - There may be a difference in the specific process of potentizing but the net effect of 10-times dilution per x is the same. My point was that I haven't seen 30x used much, if at all. I may be wrong. With 30x potency there is theoretically no physical substance left (that's not quite accurate in general -- it depends on the relative formula weights -- but that's what skeptics point to). But 1x and even 6x still have quite a bit of substance in them, witness anyone who has had an injection of gencido (I think it's 8x, for allergies -- the injection is usually very painful, not a simple saline solution). In reference to a fundamentally different approach, I think Hgilbert has recently added some additional clarifications about \"focusing on strengthening the patient's organism and [individuality](/wiki/Individuality)\". -- [EPadmirateur](/wiki/User:EPadmirateur)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:EPadmirateur)) 04:24, 15 January 2009 (UTC) In the second paragraph I deleted the last half of the following sentence (after the comma): Evidence for the efficacy of mistletoe as an anticancer drug from human studies is weak, though animal and in vitro studies indicate a possible benefit. The fact that preclinical research suggests a potential role for mistletoe in treating cancer has no bearing on the fact that there does not appear to be any effect on tumors (except, perhaps for direct high-concentration injections into the tumor) in humans. The fact that preclinical research does show some anti-tumor activity is interesting and can be mentioned, but the conclusion must be that there is little or no evidence for tumor fighting abilities in humans, based on the results of the clinical trial reviews. Maybe inverting the sentence would be better, something like: \"Although preclinical (animal) studies suggested a potential role for mistletoe extracts in cancer therapies, no such effects have been convincingly reported\". [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 01:30, 15 January 2009 (UTC) - In the video, Kienle referenced tumor remissions in human subjects, I recall, in connection with direct injection in the tumor site. I don't recall the specific journal reference, but I'm pretty sure it's not just animal studies, although it's probably not blinded clinical trials either (can you imagine control subjects subjected to injections of saline into their tumors for such a trial?) I like the version with the inverted sentence, so I'll put it in. -- [EPadmirateur](/wiki/User:EPadmirateur)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:EPadmirateur)) 04:24, 15 January 2009 (UTC) In the subsection, reviews, most of the points refer to scholarly reviews of studies however I note that the last point refers to an opinion piece in a daily newspaper. However eminent the author may be this clearly does not belong here. Accordingly I propose its deletion. [Daffodillman](/wiki/User:Daffodillman) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Daffodillman)) 04:51, 20 August 2009 (UTC) Title Should this article be renamed to \"anthroposophic medicine\"? This seems to be the prevailing standard these days. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 11:49, 15 January 2009 (UTC) Ernst I removed the criticisms of Ernst as I feel they were given undue weight considering the weight of Ernst vs the weight of the criticisms, and not from a [reliable source](/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDRS) for the claims being made. [Verbal](/wiki/User:Verbal) [chat](/wiki/User_talk:Verbal#top) 12:43, 15 January 2009 (UTC) The source is a monograph on the subject that includes analyses of all studies and reviews to date - this not only conforms to the reliable source criteria but is easily the most reliable source available to date. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 18:54, 15 January 2009 (UTC) I have mixed feelings about this one. Ernst is himself a professor of complimentary medicine and suggests that many non-conventional therapies have great value and some are underused because of their associations with quackery. His concern about all therapies is that they should be tested and demonstrated to be safe and effective. I don't think that he is picking particularly on anthroposophical medicine, although he does use it as an example. He does not seem to have a dog in this fight, in other words, except that he believes in evidence-based medicine. The counter to his review was written by anthroposophical medicine practitioners, correct? In that case, my understanding is their criticism holds much less weight and may render the source unusable for this purpose. A far better source would be idependent of anthroposopical connections, but I suspect that such a source does not exist. If anthroposophical medicine proponents have an issue with evidence-based medicine, then that is a major major difference from conventional medicine that needs to be emphasized. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 00:28, 16 January 2009 (UTC) - The practitioners do not have a problem with evidence-based medicine; they have a problem with misleading statements and gaps that they cite in Ernst's work. For example (see pp. 55-6 in Anthroposophic Medicine): - \"[Ernst] claims to have asked 'experts in this field' and 'professional organizations of anthroposophic medicine' to contribute relevant articles, a claim which subsequent inquiry research showed to be incorrect.\" - Ernst's review cited \"well-documented risks\" associated with anthroposophic remedies; his reference refers to side effects of mistletoe therapy, but the reported effects were from high concentrations not used in these remedies in animal studies of mistletoe toxicity and from plant extracts other than Viscum album. - He only reported studies that covered the entire range of anthroposophical medicine; most studies specialize in one particular area (i.e. pain reduction or cancer treatments). Therefore his conclusions are only applicable to a very small subset of the published studies. - The Kienle/Kiene monograph was work commissioned by the Swiss government and published by a mainstream academic press. It meets every criterion of a verifiable source. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 02:28, 16 January 2009 (UTC) - It would appear clear to me that Ernst is a much stronger source on the efficacy of anthroposophic medicine than Anthroposophic Medicine. Whilst this source would be excellent to confirm beliefs and practices of practitioners, it has no reliability as a scientific source. With the monograph we have a slightly harder job, however, and should consider it's weight in more detail. More on this once I've have some time to look into it. [Jefffire](/wiki/User:Jefffire)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Jefffire)) 18:34, 16 January 2009 (UTC) - It would appear clear to me that Ernst is a much stronger source on the efficacy of anthroposophic medicine than Anthroposophic Medicine. Whilst this source would be excellent to confirm beliefs and practices of practitioners, it has no reliability as a scientific source. With the monograph we have a slightly harder job, however, and should consider it's weight in more detail. More on this once I've have some time to look into it. I agree with Jeffire's preliminary conclusion about the weight of the monograph as a rebuttal to Ernst. To Hgilbert, is there any possibility that a non-Anthroposophical source can be found that supports the monograph assertions about Ernst or that directly addresses Ernst's assertions? A source that is available via Medline from a peer-reviewed journal would be best, of course, but that also raises the question, was Ernst's criticism from a peer-reviewed source? If not then it boils down to a he said, she said argument in which case neither should be included. The less we rely on book chapters, monographs, and other non-peer reviewed sources, as well as commentary from anthroposophical sources, and the more we rely on actual studies the better, as far as I am concerned. As far as anthroposophical medicine not having a \"problem\" with evidence-based medicine, I was actually asking, in my usual poorly stated way, whether or not anthroposophical practitioners embrace evidence-based medicine as a primary determinant in the validation of certain therapies. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 18:59, 16 January 2009 (UTC) The Wallace Sampson reference is an excerpt on a website from what appears to be an opinion piece on a variety of alternative therapies. On the website, anthroposophical medicine is mentioned only once at the beginning as one of these practices. Perhaps in the original article he is more specific. In any case, probably not peer-reviewed. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 19:19, 16 January 2009 practitioners affirm the value of evidence-based medicine; there is no argument there. There is a lively discussion, however, over whether double-blind studies are appropriate to evaluate a medical approach that stresses the individuality of a patient's treatment. The anthroposophical practitioners' argument is as follows: as our medical approach would apply different treatment regimens to different people, then giving the same medication to a group \"blindly\" is not actually a test of the medical approach - only of the medication used apart from the approach. This caveat aside, everyone agrees that the anthroposophical medications and therapies should be supported (and supportable) by studies of efficacy. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 00:37, 17 January 2009 (UTC) - I agree that the Sampson piece barely mentions anthroposophical medicine, and not directly in the context cited; I have removed this reference. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 00:37, 17 January 2009 (UTC) - Double blind studies are perfectly compatible with even totally individualized treatments, one simply exchanges the recommended procedure with placebo in half the patients at the end of the decision process. It's quite an simple application of double-blind procedure really. I gather that \"double-blind won't work for us!\" has become rather a bit of a mantra for a number of alt-meds now though, despite the fact that it is abundantly obvious that the claim is nonsense. [Jefffire](/wiki/User:Jefffire)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Jefffire)) 00:45, 17 January 2009 (UTC) - Double blind studies are perfectly compatible with even totally individualized treatments, one simply exchanges the recommended procedure with placebo in half the patients at the end of the decision process.

I gather that \"double-blind won't work for us!\" has become rather a bit of a mantra for a number of alt-meds now though, despite the fact that it is abundantly obvious that the claim is nonsense. Jeffire beat me to it. There is no justification for the claim that you cannot do a blinded study in this case. Virtually all therapies are addressable in double-blinded trials. Hgilbert--The question is not whether or not \"everyone\" agrees that the anthroposopical medications and therapies should be supported by studies of efficacy, but rather whether or not anthroposophical practitioners agree. So far you have provided an argument for why they don't think that a double-blinded approach is feasible, which is not what I am trying to determine, and, in any case incorrect. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 01:44, 17 January 2009 (UTC) - Hmmm...let's try again. Yes, anthroposophical practitioners agree that empirical research should be the basis for evaluating any medical approach. Kienle, et al. (p. 26), for example, states that an evaluation of complementary medicine should be based upon \"all available types of evidence, ranging from practical experience based on individual physicians' judgments to randomised, double-blind studies.\" [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 19:44, 17 January 2009 (UTC) Hgilbert--thanks for that. I suspect that viewpoint is not fundementally different from most conventional physicians, although it clearly is in contrast to the supporters of \"evidence-based medicine\". It seems to be a weighting issue: in EBM, case reports are treated as anecdotal evidence and not worth much, while in anthroposophical medicine case reports seem to be considered as valuable as controlled clinical trials. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 21:09, 17 January 2009 (UTC) Studies of Efficacy I contest the following unreferenced statement: \"Nearly all studies of anthroposophic medicine have found clinically relevant improvements resulting from the treatments used; a number of the 195 studies identified in 2006 had methodological weaknesses, but a significant number of well-designed studies remains.\" This is an outrageous statement and needs an independent reference. In other words, the claimant must not be an anthroposophical practitioner. The mistletoe studies, described in this article, do not show clinically relevant improvements as a rule, so much so that neither the NCI nor the American Cancer Society endorses the use of mistletoe. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 03:10, 17 January 2009 (UTC) - I've added the range of outcomes (at one end, simply subjective reports of improved quality of life), but since the cited reference analyzes every one of the 195 studies, frequently in some detail, and since the study was funded and supported by the Swiss government, and published by a mainstream academic press, it appears to be a reliable source. - The mistletoe studies are described in the corresponding section, which also mentions that the organizations you mention, though they do not claim that there is clear clinical evidence of tumor reduction in humans, see the worth of further clinical studies on the basis of the positive results of in vitro and animal studies. - Feel free to add any balancing information to either of these sections. It is important to have a full picture. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 15:00, 24 January 2009 (UTC) Spiritual Science We need to work Steiner's concept of \"spiritual science\" into this article, especially in the first paragraph. Virtually every other description of AM has some mention of this in the first paragraph, if not the first sentence. I am not sure what kind of sourcing is appropriate for this. Since I assume that the concept of AM being based on Steiner's spiritual science that it is not controversial, therefore AM or non-AM sources could be used. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 21:28, 18 January 2009 (UTC) - Kienle's Anthroposophical Medicine has a significant section devoted to this, \"Anthroposophy as a spiritual science\" (in Chapter 3) - as one possible source. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 21:38, 18 January 2009 (UTC) You are too quick, Hgilbert! I had a few examples of intros from other sources, but they were lost. I do not have access to this book and am unlikely to acquire it in the near future. If you would like to come up with something for the early part of the article that emphasizes the spiritual science concept that would be great. Otherwise I will find some more readily available sources such as PAAM. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 21:49, 18 January 2009 (UTC) Here is what I had cut from the PAAM site: Anthroposophic Medicine is a holistic and human-centered approach to medicine. It recognizes and uses the vast information acquired by modern medicine in the fields of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and diagnosis. Then it goes one step further, adding a knowledge of the laws of the living organism, of the psyche, and the spirit. This knowledge of the spirit is derived from a spiritual scientific methodology which expands on the conventional scientific theory. This requires - besides an ongoing professional, personal, and moral development - the active inner participation in spiritual scientific studies outlined by Rudolf Steiner. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 00:32, 19 January 2009 (UTC) - Again the PAAM site is not citable according to the [ArbCom Albonico book [Anthroposophic Medicine](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=Y4B99iUJPuYC&dq=kienle+anthroposophic+medicine&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=mp-bHAAm31&sig=f-suGPBEGPEY7tS0m7MuS4YJH3o&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPP1,M1)is citable, readable on-line and has an authoritative description of AM as spiritual science (pp. 4-14, especially) and also some statistics for hospitals, clinics, etc. but not numbers of doctors (that I saw). -- [EPadmirateur](/wiki/User:EPadmirateur)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:EPadmirateur)) 02:21, 19 January 2009 (UTC) I agree with Hgilbert that PAAM is citable for non-controversial topics. I think that the spiritual nature of AM is not controversial in the slightest. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 04:24, 24 January 2009 (UTC) - Perhaps, more clearly: the spiritual orientation of the philosophy on which it is based. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 14:02, 24 January 2009 (UTC) Demographics Another topic that we should discuss is how many AM physicians are there relative to the total number of physicians and where are they located. It seems as though there are hardly any (~100) in the US but that there is a concentration in some parts of Europe. The worldwide total number from the IAAM site is about 2000, with a much larger number of non-AM physicians prescribing AM medicines. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 00:32, 19 January 2009 (UTC) Pseudoscience I note that in the article [Pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience), Anthroposophical medicine is included as pseudoscience. Should this the \"Categories\" section? Desoto10 [66.120.181.218](/wiki/Special:Contributions/66.120.181.218) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:66.120.181.218)) 06:23, 7 February 2009 (UTC) - It's actually not in that article as far as I can see. Anthroposophic medicine has substantial empirical basis (as reviewed in peer-reviewed journals) and is subject to on-going empirical verification. It is certainly not mainstream, but there are clear [guidelines for categories](/wiki/Wikipedia:Category)that recommend \"If the composition of a category is likely to be controversial, a list (which can be annotated) may be more appropriate.\" I suggest this is pretty controversial. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 19:58, 7 February 2009 (UTC) You're right, it is here: [List of topics characterized as pseudoscience](/wiki/List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience). I am just looking for consistency. One part of Wikipedia has a section saying that AM is considered pseudoscience, so we should either fix that entry or add it to this one. It seems to me that AM is based on the \"spiritual science\" of Steiner, is it not? If not, then what is it based on? That some aspects of AM have been evaluated in an empirical manner is not evidence that the fundemental underpinnings of AM is not pseudoscientific. Desoto10 [66.120.181.218](/wiki/Special:Contributions/66.120.181.218) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:66.120.181.218)) 23:49, 7 February 2009 (UTC) - The list you refer to doesn't claim its topics are demonstrably pseudoscience, or that there is any consensus that they are pseudoscientific, merely that someone somewhere has claimed this. Such claims belong in this article, of course, when drawn from verifiable sources. The category inclusion has a higher standard; see the guidelines I linked to above. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 14:09, 8 February 2009 (UTC) - I agree with hgilbert. A discussion of the status should be included in the article along with reliably sourced views of those who feel it is ps. But to categorize it, and therefore present it, as in actual fact pseudoscience seems to me to go well beyond what we should be doing in portraying one view as true.

[hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 21:40, 9 February 2009 (UTC) - See the related discussion - Just commenting here that I commented there that while the perspective that AM is at least partially pseudoscientific in basis and practice is sufficiently [prominent](/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE)to the topic to warrant discussion here, it is not so overwhelming as to justify unnuanced inclusion in [Category:Pseudoscience](/wiki/Category:Pseudoscience). - [Eldereft](/wiki/User_talk:Eldereft)( [cont.](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Eldereft)) 22:41, 9 February 2009 (UTC) - Just commenting here that I commented there that while the perspective that AM is at least partially pseudoscientific in basis and practice is sufficiently Worldwide acceptance This title is a real stretch and should be changed. The fact that AM is practiced in a variety of countries does not indicate that it is \"accepted\" unless you mean \"legally allowed\" or something. AM represents a tiny, almost negligible fraction of medical practice worldwide. I would change this section to something like \"Distribution\" and point out how AM is concentrated in some European countries and has a very small number of practitioners in other countries. PAAM could be used as a source for this, I think, as it is not too controversial. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 18:39, 11 February 2009 (UTC) - Yours is the third title for the section; it seems fine. Legally allowed and receiving governmental support are, of course, two different things; both are mentioned in this section. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 18:45, 11 February 2009 (UTC) Critical statement in Studies of Efficacy section Placing this statement under studies of efficacy seems entirely gratuitous. It does not relate directly to any study and appears to exist only to work a negative comment into this section. Accordingly I propose its deletion. [Daffodillman](/wiki/User:Daffodillman) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Daffodillman)) 04:33, 20 August 2009 (UTC) - It is, in its essence, a critique of the lack of studies performed. I have reworded it to make this clearer and to make it more neutral. It may be valuable to include as well a statement about the kinds of proofs of efficacy preferred by practitioners within this discipline, if a coherent one can be put together. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 13:53, 21 August 2009 (UTC) Criticism of AM Given that there are criticisms of AM, that many of the points raised in this discussion page arise from those criticisms and their subsequent rebuttal and that a substantial part of the article does not discuss what AM is but rehashes arguments over its efficacy, I suggest that a section of the article entitled Criticism or Criticisms and Rebuttals be created and that such points be confined to that section. Perhaps reference needs to be made to Ernst's article in Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift and the subsequent response in the same journal by Kienle et al. Currently, from a neutral point of view, the whole page reads like a restrained argument rather than an encyclopaedic article, moving this debate to its own section would allow the rest of the article to be cleaned up and useful information to be provided. N.b. I am not associated with either conventional or anthroposophic medicine (nor any form of complementary or alternative medicine) and do not have an axe to grind either way. [Daffodillman](/wiki/User:Daffodillman) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Daffodillman)) 05:30, 20 August 2009 (UTC) - I appreciate the point, and this article has far to go to create an adequate and balanced representation. We should consider that [WP:Criticism](/wiki/Wikipedia:Criticism)suggests that the form here - analyses of different aspects, including, critiques, of a subject within the appropriate sections, rather than a separate criticism section - often works better. So the question is, can it be done well in this in-line format, or do we have to change it in the proposed way? In any case, if the section is isolated, titling it \"reception\" or \"critique\" and including both positive and negative views is recommended. - We could, of course, do both: integrate criticism into areas where this is relevant, and have a general reception or critique section that could include more general views that are not easily incorporated into particular sections. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 14:05, 21 August 2009 (UTC) - There is a significant amount of material critical to anthrophical medicine which is not reflected in the article at all, i.e the unscientific nature of [Anthrosophy](/wiki/Anthrosophy)and its status as an Alternative Medicine [IRWolfie-](/wiki/User:IRWolfie-)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:IRWolfie-)) 02:54, 15 January 2011 (UTC) - That's fine, but the same standard of reliable sources must be applied to criticism as to positive evaluations. The [arbitration review of articles on anthroposophical themes](/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education)emphasized the use of publications (books and journals) by mainstream academic publishing houses and academic presses that have gone through a conventional peer-review process.

The phrase about reincarnation was there already. Not my addition, and as far as I'm concerned it can be removed. - The doctrine of signatures is just one part of homeopathy, which is one part of anthroposophic medicine; I'm not clear why this sub-aspect of a sub-aspect of AM needs to be in the lead, but if you can justify it, fine. It is certainly true to say that it is used. - No basis whatsoever was provided for claiming that AM does not focus on the theory of germs or employ scientific method. As doctors employing the method must have traditional medical degrees, one can hardly claim that they are not taught the theory of germs, and they clearly expect that diseases are contagious, etc. If there is a valid source for this, we could say in the lead that AM has been critiqued on this basis, and then give a differentiated picture in the body.

I think one issue is that we need to clearly differentiate between what AM physicicans do that is different from conventional practice. That they have trained in conventional medicine does not necessarily mean that they practice conventional medicine or even that they consider conventional medicine as valid. The most interesting part of AM, I think to most people, would be what they do that conventional MDs don't. In other words, what is the claimed \"extension\". In any case, my specific issue is 1st sentence: Anthroposophical medicine is a complementary medicine[1] that extends conventional forms of medicine[2] through the use of homeopathic medicaments and physical, biographical and artistic therapies.[3] Can we find a more neutral source regarding whether or not AP \"extends\" conventional medicine?

As it is quite a central aspect of the medical approach, and one that distinguishes it from other approaches, it probably should be expanded on rather than deleted. I've tried a first go, using one or two sources - I'm sure there are others. Let me know if it needs clarification...it was written in haste, I'm afraid.

Mistletoe We have a statement in this section to the effect that there are AM and non-AM mistletoe treatments. The statement implies that AM mistletoe treatments are homeopathic, but I find several sources (not too reliable) that claim that Steiner's mistletoe treatments are NOT homeopathic (for one thing, according to the ACS, mistletoe extracts are injected). I care only so that we can insure that we are evaluating AM-sanctioned mistletoe treatments in this article and not others. Does anybody have any clues about this? [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 05:09, 29 March 2011 (UTC) - That would be good to clarify. BTW: Homeopathic solutions are often injected, so this is no guideline. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 11:12, 29 March 2011 (UTC) - There's a citation supporting the difference between phytotherapeutic and anthroposophic uses of mistletoe; it refers us to Kienle, Kiene, and Albonico, the standard reference on AM. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 20:16, 30 March 2011 (UTC) - Yes, I can see that. I do not have access to that reference. In any case, that there are AM-sanctioned mistletoe preparations, and non-AM-sanctioned mistletoe preparations is the issue. Is this the only source for this? Does it provide the criteria for differentiating between the two? If only homeopathic preparations are the only ones allowed in AM then what is the homeopathic dilution. What are the approved solvents? I want this information so I can know which of the mistletoe studies to keep and which must be deleted and placed elsewhere.

It seems as though \"AM\" mistletoe therapy is only done relate to \"homeopathic\" dosages is still unclear to me. The solutions are not all that dilute. I'm still working on it. Thanks again. [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 05:00, 2 April 2011 (UTC) - Maybe it would help to take this in little bits. In the Intro we have: \"Anthroposophical medicine is a complementary medicine[1] that integrates theories and practices of modern medicine[2] with alternative, nature-based treatments,[3] including the use of homeopathic medicaments\" I take it from this that mistletoe therapy falls under \"nature-based treatments\" and is NOT an AM implementation of a homeopathic medicament but the use of a plant extract. Is this correct? [Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 00:36, 17 April 2011 (UTC) - This depends upon how you define homeopathic medicament. (1) The choice of mistletoe was probably arrived at at least partly through consideration of the \"doctrine of signatures\". How defining is the process by which a medicament is proposed? (2) At what dilution level does a medicament pass from being an extract to no longer being an extract? (3) The dilution process is itself presumably not a simple mixing with water in the correct proportion. Is this relevant to the classification of a medicament? - We could simply call it an anthroposophical medicament, which is clearly accurate for the original and most of the present treatments, and describe the processes by which the various extracts (the term used by the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/page1)) are produced.

[Desoto10](/wiki/User:Desoto10) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Desoto10)) 04:03, 1 August 2011 (UTC) - Amusingly, the sources introduced to support AM's unscientific nature were inaccurately quoted; comments were attributed to authors who did not make them (Shermer never terms AM pseudoscientific or any equivalent, for example). I have tried to bring the authors' actual wording into the lede rather than editors' OR-reinterpretations.

The chair in \"integrative health care and management\" would have been funded primarily by supporters of Austrian spiritualist Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy movement.
