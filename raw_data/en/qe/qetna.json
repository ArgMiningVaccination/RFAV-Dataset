It has a very light scent so none of my clients smell like a bouquet of flowers or feel like they've been marinating for their session. If you happen to use a little too much just pat your hands against the sheets. it won't stain at all. You also won't have to wash your hands if you need to do myofascial work after you've already applied cream previously during the session. They used to have a heavy-duty pump option but it wouldn't hold up so use the tube version & it works great! Just keep it slightly closed when not in use. I've had it fly off the massage table & the plastic lid pops off. This product is worth every penny! Payment & Security Your payment information is processed securely.
