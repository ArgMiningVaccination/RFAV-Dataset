Ezzat Hanna, who was born in Egypt, is the longtime pharmacist at The Apothecary, a holistic pharmacy that carries anthroposophical medical remedies. Anthroposophical medicine is regular Western medicine that incorporates an understanding of man as a spiritual being- not just a physical one. Mr. Hanna shared with us that that day was his 44th wedding anniversary. He proudly told us that his two sons are doctor.
