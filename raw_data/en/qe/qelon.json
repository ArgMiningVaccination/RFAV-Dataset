Introduction CAMbrella is a European Union (EU)-funded coordinated action in the field of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). To address the increasing use of CAM and the lack of scientific knowledge concerning CAM use, the CAMbrella Work Package 7 (WP7) group is developing a 'roadmap for further clinical and epidemiological research following additional exclusion criteria was fulfilled: (i) it mainly addressed research methodology of basic and experimental research; (ii) it primarily addressed the reporting of clinical trials; (iii) it primarily as- sessed methodological quality/rigour of CAM-evaluation trials; (iv) it presented a case study or abstract only; or (v) it mainly reported a specific study design or research tool. Full-text analysis and inclusion/exclusion based on the full text was conducted primarily by 1 reviewer (Felix Fischer). To check the rigour of the exclusion process, excluded articles underwent a second review and inclusion/exclusion was discussed by 3 reviewers (Felix Fischer, Benno Brinkhaus, Claudia Witt) until consensus was found. All arguments appearing within the included references were categorised and relevant information was extracted. Categories emerging from the original publi- cations were continuously reordered and discussed within the WP7 group. Results The literature search resulted in 3,279 hits and CAMbrella members contributed 98 additional references. After the ex- clusion process, 170 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. See figure 1 for additional information.we report the results of a systematic literature review on gen- eral issues in CAM research as a first step towards the devel- opment of a research roadmap. Research in CAM has been a controversial topic (for a broad overview on CAM research see [1]), and our aim was to create a comprehensive evalua- tion and analysis of the methodological and conceptual issues involved. We therefore performed a systematic review of literature dealing with the complexities and general methodological is- sues involved in the evaluation of CAM in clinical and epide- miological research. Ultimately, the outcome of this review, the subsequent discussion and the final roadmap for further research, should lead to a basis and framework for further CAM research in Europe. Methods A structured systematic literature review was conducted. Before starting this review, a systematic review protocol was developed (initial draft by the WP7 leader), which was submitted to the whole WP7 group for notes and suggestions for changes. The final version of the review protocol (in- cluding the search terms) was approved by the whole WP7 group. Literature Search In 2010, 7 electronic databases (Medline, Web of Science, PsychArticles, PsycInfo, CINAHL, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) were searched for relevant articles published between 1990 and 2010 (until December 16/17). Table 1 shows the search terms entered into the databases. In addition to the database search, all experts and the advisory board involved in the CAMbrella project were asked to submit any relevant publications. Selection Duplicates were excluded. We mainly aimed for full articles and original works, but comments, editorials, letters and 'grey' literature were in- cluded when a substantial original contribution to the topic was found. The title and abstract of the remaining references were screened by 1 re- searcher (Florian Junne) to exclude irrelevant references that were not related to CAM at all, not in a European language, on basic research only or on animal studies. Secondly, the title and abstract of the remaining articles were evaluated by 2 reviewers (Florian Junne and Felix Fischer) to identify publications that included investigations, analysis, discussion, proposals or statements concerning the following: i) qualitative and quan- titative methods, ii) clinical and epidemiological research methodology, iii) priorities or priority setting or iv) methodological complexities in- volved in the scientific evaluation of CAM. Articles with a corresponding judgment from both reviewers were in- cluded in further analysis. Kappa as measure of inter-rater agreement was calculated. For non-corresponding judgments, the 2 reviewers discussed the title and abstract of the publication until an agreement regarding in- clusion or exclusion was achieved. Publications contributed by CAM ex- perts (additional references were contributed by the authors of the review and the CAMbrella Advisory Board members Nora Laubstein, Ton Nico- lai, Peter Zimmermann and Stephen Gordon) were also reviewed and in- cluded in full-text analysis if they met the inclusion criteria after rating of title and abstract. Full-Text Analysis and Data Extraction All included publications entered full-text analysis. The eligibility of the publications was re-examined with respect to the above-mentioned inclu- sion/exclusion criteria. At this stage, publications were also excluded if 1 Table 1.

However, a consensus emerged that clearly im- plied that RCTs do not answer all research questions [28, 36, 52, 60-64] and are expensive to conduct [18, 30, 32, 52, 65, 66]. Some authors argue that placebo-controlled RCTs might be inappropriate for some specific CAM modalities [67-69]: a position that has raised considerable controversy [47, 70]. In- tegration of diverse research methods [2, 12, 27, 38, 61, 71], preference trials [3, 72, 73] or the use of different outcome measures [74, 75] could help overcome these shortcomings. Feasibility studies are a vital preliminary phase in the design of high-quality RCTs with adequate power [3, 4, 10, 76-79]. When individualised and standardised treatments are to be compared [3], or if specific and non-specific effects need to be separated [80], RCTs can be extended to more than 2 treat- ment arms to account for preference towards a specific treat- ment in preference trials [20, 28, 72, 73]. Pragmatic trials - as promoted in Comparative Effective- ness Research (CER) - can be conducted to assess outcomes Practical Problems in Research into CAM We found a large number of publications dealing with practi- cal problems when conducting research in CAM. These prob- lems and relevant references are categorised in detail in table 2. Choice of Research Methods The choice of research method depends on the question asked [2-6]. In some publications, explicit research questions and appropriate methods were given by the authors [2, 5, 7-11]. However, there was clear agreement about the value of differ- ent research methods in CAM research [12-16]. Most authors suggested a research-question-driven integration of diverse methods into the research agenda [6-8, 13, 16-29]. Quantitative Research Methods Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are considered to be the gold standard to assess specific effects and efficacy and to de- termine causal relationships in biomedical research. Most au- thors stated that RCTs with high methodological quality are Fig. 1.

Placebo treatments must be carefully developed[18, 30, 34-37, 51-53, 63, 72, 99, 101, 143, 144, 151, 152, 158, 166, 167] Randomisation randomisation is desirable, but might be hindered by patients' preferences making them unwilling to participate in studies when allocated to placebo treatmenttake preferences into account in trial design (preference trial) and statistical analysis; when randomisation is impossible, assess baseline differences[20, 30, 32, 33, 37-39, 53-55, 62, 67, 72, 84, 87, 88, 111, 115, 127, 146, 147, 168] (Double-)blinding (double-)blinding is desirable, but not achievable in all trials of CAM treatments (e.g. blinding of an acupuncturist)assess success of blinding technique; if blinding impossible, blind outcome assessor, data analyst, diagnostician[2, 3, 33, 35, 37, 40-43, 49, 51-53, 55, 68, 101, 102, 115, 152, 154, 169] Handling of different diagnostic frameworkstreatment allocation within studies could differ between different diagnostic systems of CAM and conventional medicinedifferences between diagnostic systems must be assessed and should be taken into account when allocating treatment[33-35, 43, 44, 49, 103, 123, 134, 170] Definition of treatment; standardisation vs. individualised treatmentstandardisation leads to loss of external validity, since most CAM treatments are considered as necessarily individualised; individualised treatment hinders reproducibility of trialsuse of semi-standardised treatment implementation of individualised and standardised treatments as study arms[3, 13, 17, 18, 21, 31, 34, 39, 42, 49, 68, 134, 152, 153, 166, 171, 172] Time frame for expected results observation time for CAM studies might need to be longer, e.g. in the treatment of chronic illnessextending study duration and regular follow-ups [17, 30, 35, 39, 49, 65, 88] Choice of outcome parameters treatment effects/outcomes in CAM might be different from conventional medicineobjective and subjective outcomes should be assessed (if possible) and cover different domains; when outcomes are unclear different potential outcomes should be considered[20-23, 30, 39, 41, 44, 49, 56, 67, 76, 89, 97, 101, 107, 130, 173, 174] Study setting and treatment providers CAM is often applied by practitioners with little experience in research; treatment provided by different practitioners might be hard to standardiseresearch needs to be conducted in collaboration with experienced researchers and clinicians[14, 74, 86, 89, 138] Lack of knowledge underlying the mechanism of interventionslacking theoretical basis of treatments complicates the planning of valid studies and might compromise resultsimplementation of research into foundations of CAM[4, 13, 17, 24, 55, 57, 58, 76-78, 93, 108, 152, 156, 160, 175] Inconclusive study results study results are controversial, e.g. in homeopathy, acupuncture & dietary supplementsdevelopment of guidelines in trial design, enhance methodological quality by development of research infrastructure[5, 7, 15, 43, 45, 52, 134, 144, 156, 159] RCT = Randomised controlled trial.Forsch Komplementmed 2012;19:51-60 Key Issues in CAM Research - Systematic Review55of the topic under study [67], to gather basic knowledge about CAM treatments [89] or to identify relevant, but uncommon outcomes [89, 105]. However, rigour and sophistication of case reports could be improved [10, 67, 106]. There was a strong consensus that both qualitative and quantitative methods are valuable and should be combined in the CAM research agenda, e.g., qualitative methods to formu- late hypothesis on mechanisms (which might be tested by quan- titative methods) as well as in specific clinical studies, e.g., to assess reasons for dropouts, identification of the most relevant outcomes or to generally improve interventions [2, 14, 16, 18, 22, 25, 26, 28, 42, 71, 98, 100, 102, 107-110]. The use of qualita- tive methods has been particularly discussed as a preliminary basis for preparation of clinical trials [25, 28, 29, 79, 97, 101]. Applying Research Methods Used in Conventional Medicine to CAM Research methods used in conventional medicine can and should be used for research in CAM as well [7, 15, 17, 44, 55, 73, 81, 87, 111-114]. Most authors agreed that the methodo- logical standards of medical research can be applied to CAM research [4, 11, 13, 17, 29, 32, 35, 40, 46, 47, 70, 115, 116], but it might be necessary to adapt the research designs in some areas [6, 12, 15, 43, 57, 58, 62, 69, 87, 88, 117, 118] to account for the complexity of CAM interventions [15, 17, 87, 119, 120]. This is the case not only for CAM, but also for complex and individualised treatments in conventional medicine [72]. However, some authors felt that the underlying assumptions between conventional medicine and CAM differ so funda- mentally [8, 18, 39, 64, 121, 122] that specific research meth- ods for CAM are necessary. Research Priorities No definite statement can be made concerning the question of which kind of research should be prioritised in CAM, but it was argued that the specification of research priorities is im- portant, as the methods of assessment must be derived from the research question and not vice versa [13]. Various criteria were proposed for deciding on the priorities of future CAM research in general, such as prevalence of use and burden of disease [7, 8, 29, 45, 46, 81, 82, 92, 107, 123-126], and also for specific fields and modalities of CAM [76, 78, 114, 123, 127, 128], where priorities might differ [129]. The context, founda- tions and philosophical background of CAM treatments [13, 26, 28, 57, 58, 71, 76, 97, 99, 119, 121, 130-132] are an impor- tant basis through which to understand the differences be- tween CAM practices and conventional medicine. The safety of different CAM treatments needs to be assessed [46, 57, 58, 64, 82, 89, 91, 119, 133] to protect patients using CAM [46], even though CAM is generally considered safe [55, 81]. There were 2 contradicting views regarding effectiveness versus efficacy studies. Although there seems to be no disa-of a treatment within a real world clinical setting (clinical ef- fectiveness) [36, 69, 81-83]. Pragmatic trials enable compari- son of clinical treatment alternatives, inclusion of a wide vari- ety of patients in diverse practice settings and address a broad range of patient relevant outcomes [2, 83]. Over the years, the general nature of research questions in CAM has shifted from efficacy to effectiveness [2, 36, 81]. Pragmatic trials involve randomisation [20, 33, 83, 84] and treatment has to be defined adequately and clearly [53, 83, 85]. In contrast to the wide use of explanatory RCTs addressing efficacy, pragmatic trials have greater external validity [19, 20, 38, 44, 52, 83, 85, 86]. They also allow the evaluation of complex in- terventions triggering a variety of specific and non-specific effects [29, 36, 87, 88], can include cost evaluations [52, 84], but cannot identify specific mechanisms of action within a treatment [18, 20, 82, 83]. Observational studies might be a feasible method for eval- uation of CAM and sometimes lead to results that are compa- rable with RCTs [15, 17, 20, 44, 52, 59]. This approach could represent a potential alternative if RCTs are seen to be inap- propriate, too expensive or too complicated [13, 20, 67, 69, 89], if general effectiveness of an intervention is the focus of interest [24, 52] or to assess CAM use in the population [45]. Results of observational studies can influence the design of further interventional trials [17, 42]. Uncontrolled observa- tional studies, however, give little information about effects of treatment [47], and their weak internal validity must be ad- dressed [20]. A particular method that has been discussed is the Best Case Series [29, 90-92]. The use of quantitative methods, such as factorial and ex- perimental designs [20, 24, 63, 72, 93], has also been proposed. N-of-1 trials (repeated intervention of 1 approach in 1 person) were discussed extensively as a methodology to achieve valid results on the level of the individual patient. It could be ap- propriate when studying customised treatment of many CAM modalities [20, 49, 72, 74, 94, 95]. However, these trials are uncommon in published research and need to be planned and executed carefully [96]. Qualitative Research Methods In relation to studies of outcomes of specific therapies, quali- tative research may be used to assess the subjective views of individuals [14, 8, 25, 26, 44, 97, 98]. This can help to establish a patient-centred mechanistic understanding of the interven- tion and its impact, irrespective of whether mechanisms and objective outcomes of treatments are known [16, 26, 56, 97- 100]. Qualitative research is unsuitable when trying to estab- lish causal relationships or specific physiological outcomes [101], but is relevant for the investigation of changes in sub- jective approaches to health and illness [5]. Specific qualita- tive research methods have been introduced in the literature, such as ethnographic research, interviews and focus groups [5, 16, 98, 102-104]. Case reporting and case studies are particu- larly valuable to establish complex of Different Modalities in CAM Research Issues concerning a broad range of different CAM modalities in CAM research have been discussed in the literature, with acupuncture (as part of Chinese medicine) and homeopathy being the specific CAM modalities addressed most frequently. Use and design of RCTs in acupuncture research have been discussed extensively [3, 15, 32, 40, 43, 48, 50, 55, 151-153]. A major issue is the choice of appropriate control groups (in- cluding the design of credible placebo and sham treatments) and blinding [32, 33, 102, 143-145, 152, 154, 155]. Specific acupuncture-related suggestions for further research have also been given [57, 58, 85, 108, 127, 145]. Similarly, specific issues involving in the design of homeopathic studies have been discussed in detail [75, 112, 113, 156, 157], e.g., the sepa- ration of non-specific and specific effects [68, 80] and the han- dling of patient preferences within a randomisation procedure [88]. The shift from efficacy to effectiveness studies in home- opathy [78, 84] has been suggested to be of more clinical value. A specific argument that has been raised regarding dietary supplements and herbal medicine is their varying quality and/ or composition since there is no adequate standardisation of production for these medicines [30, 55, 158, 159]. Developing an appropriate placebo is crucial especially when there is a difference of taste between the active drug and suggested pla- cebo [49, 99, 158]. Arabic medicine [103], diet [73, 53, [62] and Yoga [115]. Discussion This literature review summarises and reflects the on-going discussion within the scientific community regarding CAM re- search over the last 20 years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review, following a clearly defined protocol, aimed at assessing the current situation of clinical and epidemiological research methodology in CAM. How- ever, developing definitions of inclusion and exclusion criteria has been proved difficult. Also, although 2 reviewers con- ducted reference selection and 3 reviewers checked the full texts, first screening was only done by 1 reviewer. In light of the current literature on CAM research method- ology there is broad consensus that the commonly accepted research methods that are used in conventional medicine can and should be applied to evaluate CAM. This applies espe- cially to RCTs. However, the literature reflects a movement from double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trials (to explain specific mechanisms and efficacy, as conducted in greement that both types of research have their own place, validity and importance [13, 33, 36, 66, 82, 88], some authors argue [11, 36, 48, 57, 58] that efficacy research should be pri- oritised over effectiveness research to legitimise the use of CAM and to help to increase acceptance [55, 108, 134]. Other authors state that efficacy research to examine specific effects should not be undertaken until overall effectiveness of the therapy in question is demonstrated to prevent misuse of scarce resources [76, 81, 119, 135]. This discussion also reflects different opinions on the importance and value of specific and non-specific effects within the whole of clinical practice [18, 19, 36, 53, 66, 78, 81, 82, 85, 86, 136-140]. An integrative research approach has been described as si- multaneous research into mechanisms and overall effective- ness of CAM treatments [13, 31, 88]. The health economic evaluation of CAM treatments was seen as particularly rele- vant in modern healthcare [141, 142]. Research into the mech- anisms of placebo, context or meaning effects were also seen as important to determine appropriate control groups and their respective explanatory power [143-145], to explain po- tentially contradictory study results [144] and to maximise these effects in clinical practice [46, 144]. Research Strategies and General Frameworks on Research in CAM Some authors have developed general frameworks for CAM. A number of frameworks are applicable; many have overlap- ping concepts and may be described as 'whole systems re- search' [20, 89, 99, or 'health services research' [76]. These approaches focus on the investigation of processes and outcomes in a sys- temic manner [130] in routine clinical practice [76]. They pri- marily reflect the concepts of effectiveness research and are designed to take the complexity of CAM into account [20, 87] while ensuring maximal external validity and clinical rele- vance [130, 149]. An approach that has received considerable attention is the 'reversed research strategy' for CAM, in contrast to drug research [57, 58, 76, 81, 119], where initial observational re- search in the context of areas, such as usage and safety, is fol- lowed by research into the overall effectiveness and then by efficacy research. Concepts, such as the 'evidence house' [13], the 'circular of research designs' [81] put emphasis on a broad perspective of research designs to gather evidence on the effects of CAM. A general framework to explore 'healing relationships' is suggested [23], again with emphasis on methodological pluralism. Cognition- based medicine (CBM) [150] is suggested as an alternative or additional framework for studying the perceived causality of treatment effects.Forsch Komplementmed 2012;19:51-60 Key Issues in CAM Research - Systematic Review57Most authors are in favour of a broad integration of differ- ent research methods to gather evidence about the clinical ef- fects of CAM. There is a strong consensus that both qualita- tive and quantitative methods are valuable and should be com- bined within the CAM research agenda using a mixed methods approach. This would involve qualitative methodology, for ex- ample, to understand the feasibility of running a study, devel- oping the appropriate outcomes and formulating hypotheses about the psychological mechanisms involved in the complex intervention. This information would then be evaluated utilis- ing quantitative methods in specific clinical studies. The above-mentioned aspects in clinical and epidemiologi- cal CAM research were discussed at a CAMbrella workshop with distinguished experts in the field of CAM research to de- velop recommendations for further research into CAM. The invited experts were Wayne Jonas, Klaus Linde, Hugh MacPherson, Charlotte Paterson, Harald Walach and Claudia Witt and as members of CAMbrella's Advisory Board Sea- mus Connolly and Peter Zimmermann. These recommenda- tions form the basis of the CAMbrella 'roadmap for future clinical and epidemiological research in CAM'. Disclosure Statement This project was funded as part of CAMbrella Work Package 7 FP7- HEALTH-2009-3.1-3 (Grant No. 241951).drug-research) towards more pragmatic trials that compare meaningful clinical alternatives in heterogeneous groups of patients. Efficacy research was hampered by a lack of consen- sus-based and testable underlying theories for many CAM modalities, e.g., when designing appropriate placebo or sham treatment. The assumptions underlying the rationale of dou- ble-blind placebo-controlled RCTs were also difficult to fulfil for most CAM modalities, e.g., patient and treatment-pro- vider blinding. Consequently, the results of efficacy research have often been inconclusive and difficult to interpret. On the other hand, research into the overall clinical effects of CAM promises more relevant results for clinical decision-making, and within the framework of comparative effectiveness re- search RCTs of high methodological quality are possible. These challenges and the current trend towards the evalua- tion of treatments in clinical contexts are not restricted to CAM but affect all areas of complex interventions in medi- cine [161-163]. Giving priority to comparative effectiveness research does not devalue the importance of basic research on mechanisms of action in CAM, which is needed to facilitate interpretation of efficacy and effectiveness research. A previous independent advisory group [164] stated that trials into effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are primarily needed, but the mechanisms of action of CAM also need to be assessed. In addition, further basic research is needed on the mechanisms of action of pla- cebo intervention or sham controls.
