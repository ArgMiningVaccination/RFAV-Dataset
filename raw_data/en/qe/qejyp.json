Fears from parents about side effects and adverse reactions have steered many away from wanting to vaccinate their children despite the numerous infectious diseases they prevent. These debates have gotten in the way of progression in schools for preventing the spread of disease. To me, the risks of not vaccinating children are far greater than the risks of adverse reactions. Parents who don't vaccinate their children put them and others at risk because it allows normally preventable disease to continue to spread. The increase in the number of diseases in America is becoming problematic due to religious reasoning to not receive vaccinations. This is creating a problem in society because there are some that are not being treated for these diseases and since they aren 't being treated for it, they put others at a large risk of getting the diseases. Immunization is the process when an individual is made immune or resistant to an infectious disease, normally through vaccination (WHO, 2015). Individuals of all ages should receive a shot in order to better protect themselves and the individuals around them. In 1809, Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to require an immunization policy, since then the entire nation now has federal policies implementing vaccinations to protect the public health (Martindale-Hubbell, 2015). However, these policies are typically generated for the younger generation of the population. Federal Immunization policies in the United States are implemented solely to ensure the safety of oneself and the society as a whole. The requirements for these Since the invention of vaccines, it has created a huge impact worldwide. As a child begins to start school, their required by the state to receive their twelve routine shots. The children who receive all their shots have a greater chance of not contracting any diseases. Throughout the years, vaccination or otherwise known as immunization has been a hugely controversial issue worldwide and whether or not to vaccinate children. However, vaccines are an effective and key role in keeping the human population healthy and safe. According to CDC, or Center of Disease Control, vaccines have reduced and, in some cases, eliminated many diseases that killed or severely disabled people just a few generations ago. Being vaccinated is very important and very effective. Children should have to be vaccinated, especially when it could cause such a huge impact on others if they do not. The cost of the vaccines are just a small price to pay for the prevention of future illnesses and diseases. It should be a moral and legal obligation to vaccinate all children. Dear Editor, it is very important for all human beings to be properly vaccinated. Kids should be vaccinated because their immune systems are at a higher risk of getting sick. Teens should be vaccinated because they're starting to get into the real world and realizing that there's things out there that they don't want to get. Adults should get vaccinated because they don't want to pass it to their love ones. Some children/adults could be carrying a disease without knowing and when in close proximity or contact with another being, could infect them with something threatening. Illnesses may also be spread by bacteria left behind. Something as simple and \"harmless\" as a sneeze could emit germs and pathogens that could easily be spread to those breathing in surrounding air. In these instances, choosing to not inoculate your children is nothing short of selfish and irresponsible. The health of others around should be taken into consideration when making this decision. \"If the vaccination rate drops significantly within a community, the population is no longer protected, putting the unvaccinated at risk. Some people specifically choose vaccination because they feel that it will protect others from disease\" We the people deserve the right to be free. We the people deserve the right of religion. We the people deserve the right to refuse to force children to get medical vaccinations before attending a public school. For decades, the altercation between whether children should be vaccinated or not has been debated between many parents, teachers, and even federal level officials. Should the United States put public safety before civil rights? Practicing religious beliefs is an essential freedom provided in the country and has a major impact on the foundation of the United States. The enforcement of vaccinations in children is not constitutional; therefore, parents and children have the right to refuse vaccinations for it is against some religious The history of infectious diseases in America predates the establishment of the United States. Colonial children were afflicted by many epidemic contagious diseases, and a number of very graphic descriptions have been recorded.1 As research and medical advances have increased, more vaccinations have been developed to prevent and eliminate some of these once deadly diseases. The pace of progress regarding infectious diseases of children accelerated during the 18th Century, particularly with respect to prevention of smallpox by inoculation or variolation. Smallpox was an almost inevitable illness of childhood and was one of the most common causes of death because of its high mortality rate. It was reported, for example, to kill 10% of Swedish Disneyland, also known as the happiest place on Earth, has recently been the considered one of the most dangerous places on Earth for those that have not received a measles vaccination. A measles outbreak had swept across the park only months ago, causing many unvaccinated individuals and those too young to be vaccinated to contract the awful sickness. Also, the individuals who became sick returned home and began to spread the germ in their towns and cities. The measles vaccine is proven to be extremely effective, so if parents had made the decision of vaccinating their children, the outbreak could have easily been prevented. Measles is one of many diseases that are preventable with immunizations, yet some individuals refuse to cooperate. The CDC has urged the public to understand that the vaccinations are safe by stating, Overall, vaccinating children has many positive benefits. All the little side effects that come along with it are nothing compared to what could be with an illness. The scientific research and facts all support getting vaccinated. When choosing to not vaccinate, a child is being put in harms way. There are many risks that come along with not vaccinating. In order to ensure children are healthy, they need vaccines. They need these to have a strong immune system and to be protected at all times. All the extensive research that has been conducted is proof of how important immunizations are. Vaccines ensure children, adults, and the whole community is protected. Despite some misconceptions, They do not cause autism and are not injecting children Many people may think that vaccination is a bad thing, that instead of preventing it causes illness, that is not natural. Natural or not, there are many reasons as to why we should vaccinate us and the younger generation. Most of the time children don't like vaccination because it hurt, but is the responsibility of a parent to seek the wellbeing of his or her child. Vaccination it's a preventive measure of various diseases. Unfortunately, things like the anti-vaccination movement, the misinformation on the Internet, and the believe that vaccination causes more damage than is worth, have led our society to think that it's right not to vaccinate. How likely is it for a child to get a disease? \"Statistically, the chance of your child getting a vaccine-preventable disease may be relatively low. You are making a wager\" (Childhood 1). Mainly, parents don't want their children to be vaccinated in order to attend public school or tend to lack taking them on time to get the shots. A vaccination is being introduced to the body which will then produce an immunity to a specific disease. While many people think that it's not harmful to their children if they're not vaccinated, they're mistaken. There are many risks of not being vaccinated, which include disabilities and even a higher risk of catching a disease that could've been prevented in the first place. Once the child recovered from the cowpox disease, Jenner then tried to infect the child with smallpox, but the young man proved to be immune. \"It seemed that this attempt at vaccination had worked. But Jenner had to work on for two more years before his discovery was considered sufficiently tested by the medical profession to permit widespread introduction.\" (Alexander, 2003). Beginning in 1831 and ending in 1835, due to increasing vaccination, smallpox deaths were down to one in a thousand. The year of 1853 deemed obligatory for all children born after the first of August to receive routine immunizations. By 1898, one hundred years after Edward Jenner's unveiling of the vaccine, smallpox in London had fallen dramatically - to one in every 100,000 (less than 50 people per Vaccines are like traffic lights; they ensure the safety of the public, be in heavily crowded areas, like schools, or densely trafficked roads. Traffic lights only work when all people follow the rules. If a car runs a red light, the car runs the risk of killing innocent pedestrians who are complying with the prescribed rules. Vaccines, if not utilized by most people, are ineffective. Even though some parents are concerned over the safety of vaccines, children who go to public schools should not be granted exemptions because vaccines are necessary to prevent outbreaks, children who do not receive vaccines are at risk of disease, and medically compromised children rely on vaccines to prevent disease.
