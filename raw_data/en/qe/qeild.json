Nine horses werenaturally infected with the virus and nine healthy horses served as controls. Theconcentrations of copper, zinc, iron, and cobalt were determined spectrophotometricallyin the blood serum of all horses. The results were (expressed in micrograms per deciliters)copper 2.80\u00b10.34 vs 1.12\u00b10.44, ratio 0.72\u00b10.38 vs 1.41\u00b10.36 forcontrol vs infected group, respectively. In conclusion, copper and zinc concentrations of theinfected group were lower than the control group ( p<0.001), whereas iron concentration and the copper/zinc ratio of the infected group were higher than the control group ( p<0.05 and p<0.001). The cobalt concentration was not found to be statistically different between two groups. It might be emphasized that copper/zinc ratio was significantly affected by theEHV-1 infection, so it could be taken into consideration during the course of infection.

Ataseven Department of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Yuzuncu Yil, 65080 Van, TurkeyIntroduction The extent of the impairment in the immune system because of trace element deficiency is sufficient to increase the risk of morbidity and mortality because of viral, microbial, andparasitic infections [ 1]. Several trace elements are essential micronutrients and are required for various body functions and well-being of the immune system. The deficiencies of trace elements andinfectious diseases often coexist and exhibit complex interactions [ 2]. Trace elements such as selenium, zinc, copper, and manganese have immunomodulatory functions and thus influence the susceptibility to the course and the outcome of a variety ofviral infections. Some trace elements inhibit virus replication in the host cells, thus showingantiviral activity. Many trace elements act as antioxidants or help such functions that notonly regulate immune responses of the host, but also may alter the genome of the viruses[2,3]. The fact that serum trace mineral levels change in response to infections is well known. Suttle and Jones [ 4] have reported that deficiencies in minerals such as copper and zinc can decrease an animal 's immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to disease. Shankarand and Prasad [ 5] stated that zinc deficiency depresses immune function and increases the risk of viral infection. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was any difference between the serum copper, zinc, iron, and cobalt concentrations and copper/zinc ratio in the horsesinfected with EHV-1 and healthy horses. Materials and Methods Anatolian type local horses ( n=18) that were used for the experiment had a body mass of 300-400 kg and age up to 6 years old. The animals were maintained in a controlled environment (paddock) that mimicked their natural habitat. All horses under study were examined serologically by using serum neutralization test [ 6] and clinically. According to the neutralization test and clinical examination, nine horses were found to be infected withequine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), other nine horses were virus-free. Blood samples were taken into plain vacutainer tubes from the jugular vein of the infected and control groups. The serum was separated and diluted with double-distilledwater. The samples were then analyzed following established procedures for copper, zinc,iron, and cobalt and by means of a Unicam 929 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer[7,8]. All analyses were made using the SPSS statistical software package. Data are expressed as means\u00b1SD. Statistical analyses were made using the independent sample ttest. Results and Discussion The blood serum copper, zinc, iron, and cobalt concentrations and copper/zinc ratio in control and infected groups are given in Table 1. The mean serum zinc and copper concentrations in the infected group were significantly lower than the control group ( p<0.001). Meanwhile, the mean serum iron concentration and the mean copper/zinc ratio in the infected group were significantly higher than that inSerum Concentration in Horses with Equine Herpesvirus-1 39the control group ( p<0.05 and p<0.001). However, there was no statistically significant differences for the mean serum cobalt concentration between the two groups. Equine herpesvirus-1 is an important pathogen in horses, which is characterized with epidemic and sporadic respiratory disease, abortion, and encephalitis. The virus causeseconomic loss to the horse industry [ 9,10]. Clinical illness after a virus infection depends upon factors both in the virus and the host. The most important factor in a virus is genomic alterations. The factors in the host mostlydepend upon the nutritional status and the optimum functioning of the immune system [ 11]. The roles of zinc and copper on growth, immune system function, cellular respiration, redox processes, and protein synthesis are well known, as is their ability to prevent cancerand other noncancer diseases [ 12-14]. Serum trace mineral levels change in response to infections is well known. Infections are known to affect the extracellular concentrations of zinc and copper. Serum copper concentration of the patients with hepatic viral fibrosis, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and viral hepatitis were reported to be higher than the control [ 15,16]. In our study, the serum copper concentration of the infected group was lower than the controlgroup. This result is contradictory with the result in literature. Studies indicate that copper has no significant role during some of the infections. It has been suggested that hypocupremia and hypocuprosis are not consistent features of Borderdisease and thus have no etiological significance [ 17]. However, Arthington et al. [ 18] have demonstrated that copper deficiency alters the acute-phase protein response to viralinfection and may affect lymphocyte responsiveness to mitogen stimulation in young cow inoculated with live bovine HSV-1. The relevance of zinc in resistance to infections by viruses, fungi, and bacteria is recognized because of its pivotal role in the efficiency of the entire immune system, inparticular, in conferring biological activity to a thymic hormone called thymulin, which hasdifferentiation properties on T cell lines [ 19,20]. It is known that zinc deficiency, resulting from exposure of culture cells to membrane- permeable Zn 2+chelators, can induce apoptosis in virally transformed cells, whereas normal cells remain unaffected under these conditions [ 2]. Zinc metalloproteins may be useful to prevent transmission of viral disease [ 21]. The serum zinc concentration has been studied by Fota-Markowska et al. [ 22] and Nagamine et al. [ 23] in patients with viral hepatitis, by Koch et al. [ 24] in patient with AIDS, and by Wellinghausen et al. [ 25] in patient with HIV infection. They reported decreased serum zinc concentrations in these viral infections.Table 1 Serum Copper, Zinc, Iron, and Cobalt Concentrations and Copper/Zinc Ratio in the Control and Infected Groups Trace elements Control group (X\u00b1Sx) Infected group zinc and copper concentrations of the patients with viral hepatitis have been investigated by Kalkan et al. [ 26]. They stated the decreased serum zinc concentrations and the increased serum copper concentrations. Similar results in the calves were stressed bybovine respiratory disease and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis [ 27]. In the present study, zinc concentration in the infected group was significantly lower than in the control group. The increased serum cobalt concentrations have been reported in mice infected with Coxsackie B virus infection [ 28]. On the other hand, Greig et al. [ 29] determined cobalt deficiency in young calves suffering from tick-borne fever virus infection. In the presentstudy, no statistically significant differences were found in the serum cobalt concentrationsbetween the groups. The micronutrient iron plays a central role in many biochemical and physiological processes. However, iron is known to play a role in the susceptibility to and outcome ofseveral infections. High intracellular concentrations of iron are generally associated with thepotential to catalyze oxidative damage through the generation of hydroxyl radicals [ 30]. Lin et al. [ 31] observed that decrease in the iron level in the serum of patients having hepatocellular carcinoma was induced by the hepatitis B virus. We did find significantly higher iron concentration in the infected group. As a rule, infections also cause an increase of the copper/zinc ratio. Some researches found an increase in the serum copper levels, but a decrease in the zinc levels in differentdiseases when compared with those of the control group. They also found markedlyelevated copper/zinc ratios [ 31,32]. However, Ciftci et al. [ 33] stated that even if the copper level was not affected during the treatment of tuberculosis, a significant increase in thelevels of zinc and a decrease in the copper/zinc ratio were observed. Although we found significantly lower serum copper and zinc concentrations, the copper/zinc ratio was higher in horses infected with EHV-1 when the compared to controlgroup. In the infected group, serum zinc concentration was decreased more than copper, sothe copper/zinc ratio was found higher than the control group. Actually, calculated values for decrease of copper and zinc were 2.5 -3.65 times lower than control values, respectively. The results indicated significant differences of trace elements concentration between infected and control groups. It might be emphasized that the significantly affected copper/zinc ratio could be taken into consideration during the course of EHV-1 infection. References 1.
