[](/sites/default/files/graphs/pni1a.jpg) Background Nitrates and nitrites are nitrogen-oxygen chemical units that naturally occur in soil, water, and some foods. When taken into the body by drinking water and through other dietary sources, nitrate and nitrite can react with amines and amides to form N-nitroso compounds (NOC), which are known to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer in humans. Excessive nitrate or nitrite exposure can also result in acute acquired methemoglobinemia, a blood abnormality that causes blood to lose its ability to carry oxygen to tissues (anoxia). This is especially dangerous in infants younger than 4 months of age. The biggest source of nitrate exposure is dietary consumption of certain types of vegetables that are naturally high in nitrate. However, these vegetables also contain compounds that prevent the formation of NOCs. Studies assessing connections between nitrate and cancer in humans have focused on excess exposure from drinking water or food grown in areas where use of nitrogen-based fertilizers is common. Some of the highest levels of nitrate have been measured in shallow wells and surface water supplies that are subject to runoff from nitrogen fertilizers, confined animal feedlot operations, and resulting excrement and contamination from leaking septic tanks and sewage. In addition, workers who manufacture these fertilizers can have high exposures to dusts that contain nitrate. Oral tobacco also may contribute to nitrate intake, but is a minor source compared to diet or contaminated drinking water. Studies have shown increased risks of colon, kidney, and stomach cancer among people with higher ingestion of water nitrate and higher meat intake compared with low intakes of both, a dietary pattern that results in increased NOC formation. Other studies have shown modest evidence that higher nitrate intake can increase the risk of thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer among women. Measure We present exposure data on the 95th percentile of the population, representing people with the greatest exposure. The 95th percentile level means that 95% of the population has concentrations below that level. Public health officials use such reference values to determine whether groups of people are experiencing an exposure that is unusual compared with an exposure experienced by the rest of the population. For more information, see the [National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals](https://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/), published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To calculate whether the differences between 95th percentiles for two different time points is statistically significant, we used a different statistical methodology than that used by the National Center for Environmental Health, who publishes the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals from where our data are derived. Our estimates may differ slightly from those in the original report due to differences in statistical procedures used. [ [Methodology](chemical_exposures)] As nitrate is measured from urine, the concentration of nitrate may be affected by urine diluteness. Analyte concentrations within urine also may vary with time due to changes in the water concentration within urine. We use creatinine as a reference analyte to adjust for urine concentration and obtain measures of nitrate that are comparable, whether they are from concentrated or dilute urine samples.
