These domains were identified as the most critical attributes that contribute to a College effectively serving and protecting the public interest (Figure 1). The measurement domains relate to Ontario's health regulatory Colleges' key statutory functions and key organizational aspects, identified through discussions with the Colleges and experts, that enable a College to carry out its functions well. Figure 1: CPMF Model for measuring regulatory excellence Organizational FocusAppllant / Regrstrant FocusResults & lmprovement The seven domains are interdependent and together lead to the outcomes that a College is expected to achieve as an excellent regulator. Table 1 describes what is being measured by each domain. 4Measurement.

The efforts a College undertakes to ensure that only those individuals who are qualified, skilled and competent are registered, and only those registrants who remain competent, safe and ethical continue to practice the profession. The College continuously assesses risks, and measures, evaluates, and improves its performance. The College is transparent about its performance and improvement activities.6 7 Ontario Ministry of Health250 December 2020 College Performance Measurement Framework (CPMF) Reporting Tool Exomple: The College is planning a project to develop required competencies for Council and Committees and will develop screening crit\u20acria.

The ministry will not assess whether a College meets or does not meet the Standards. The purpose of the first iteration of the CPMF is to provide the public, the ministry and performance improvement commitments. Furthermore, the reported results will help to lay a foundation upon which expectations and benchmarks for regulatory excellence can be refined and improved. Finally, the results of the first iteration may stimulate discussions about regulatory excellence and performance improvement among Council members and senior staff within a College, as well as between Colleges, the public, the ministry, registrants and other stakeholders. The information reported through the completed CPMF Reporting Tools will be used by the ministry to strengthen its oversight role of Ontario's 26 health regulatory Colleges and may help to identify areas of concern that warrant closer attention and potential follow-up. Furthermore, the ministry will develop a Summary Report highlighting key findings regarding the best practices Colleges already have in place, areas for improvement and the various commitments Colleges have made to improve their performance in serving and protecting the public. The focus of the Summary Report will be on the performance of the regulator system (as opposed to the performance of each individual College), what initiatives health regulator Colleges are undertaking to improve regulator excellence and areas where opportunities exist for colleges to learn from each other. The ministry's Summary Report will be posted publicly. 7 Ontario Ministry of Health252 College Performance Measurement Framework (CPMF) Reporting Tool December 2020 As this will be the first time that Colleges will report on their performance against the proposed CPMF standards, it is recognized that the initial results will require on: . lmprovements a College committed to undertake in the previous CPMF Repor! . Changes in comparison to baseline reporting; and . Changes resulting from refined standards, measures and evidence.l 8 Ontario Ministry of Health253 College Performance Measurement Framework (CPMF) Reporting Tool December 2020 Completing the CPMF Reporting Tool Colleges will be asked to provide information in the right-hand column of each table indicating the degree to which they fulfill the \"required Evidence\" set out in column two. Furthermore, . wherea College@itwill haveto: o provide link(s) to relevant background materials, policies and processes OR provide a concise overview of this information. . where a College responds that it \"partially'' meets required evidence, the following information is required: o clarification of which component of the evidence the College meets and the component that the College does not meet; o for the component the College meets, provide link(s) to relevant background material, policies and processes OR provide a concise overview of this information; and o for the component the College does not meet, whether it is currently engaged in, or planning to implement the missing component over the next reporting period. . whereacollege@itwillhaveto: o indicate whether it is currently engaged in or planning to implement the standard over the next reporting period. Furthermore, there may be instances where a College responds that it meets required evidence but, in the spirit of continuous improvement, plans to improve its activities or processes related to the respective Measure. A College is encouraged to highlight these planned improvement activities. While the CPMF Reporting Tool seeks to clarify the information requested, it is not intended to direct College activities and processes or restrict the manner in which a College fulfills its fiduciar duties. Where a term or concept is not explicitly defined in the proposed CPMF Reporting Tool the ministr relies on individual Colleges, as subject matter experts, to determine how a term should be appropriately interpreted given the uniqueness ofthe profession each College oversees. The areas outlined in red in the example below are what Colleges will be asked to complete. 9 Ontario Ministry of Health25i4 December 2020 College Performance Measurement Framework (CPMF) Reporting Tool Example a.

Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, and Dr. Adalsteinn (Steini) Brown, Co-Chair of the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table. \"The latest modelling data shows that Ontario is in a crisis and, with the current trends, our hospital lCUs will be overwhelmed in a few short weeks with unthinkable consequences,\" said Premier Ford. \"That's why we are taking urgent and decisive action, which includes declaring a provincial emergency and imposing a stay-at-home-order. We need people to only go out only for essential trips to pick up groceries or go to medical appointments. By doing the right thing and staying home, you can stay safe and save lives.\" EffectiveThursday,Januaryl4,202la't.12:01 a.m.,thegovernmentisissuingastay-at-homeorderrequiringeveryoneto remain at home with exceptions for permitted purposes or activities, such as going to the grocery store or pharmacy, accessing health care services, for exercise or for work where the work cannot be done remotely. This order arld other new and existing public health restrictions are aimed at limiting people's mobility and reducing the number of daily contacts with those outside an immediate household. In addition to limiting outings for these purposes, all businesses must ensure that any employee who can work from home, does work from home. These new public health measures will help stop the spread of COVID-1 9 by reducing concerning levels of mobility as the province continues its vaccine rollout and ramps up to mass vaccination when the federal government is able to provide the necessary supply to do so. Additional Public Health Restrictions Since the implementation of the provincewide Shutdown over two weeks ago, the latest modelling trends in key public health indicators have continued to worsen, forecasting an overwhelming of the health system unless drastlc action is taken. Escalating case counts have led to increasing hospitalization rates and intensive care unit (lCU) occupancy which has resulted in cancellations of scheduled surgeries and procedures. provincial modelling shows growth in COVID-19 cases has accelerated, leading to increased hospitalization rates and ICU occupancy. ICU occupancy by COVID-19 patients is now over 400 beds and is projected to be as high as '1 ,000 beds by early February which has the potential to overwhelm ontario's hospitals. The number of COVID-19-related deaths continues to rise and is expected to double from 50 to \"100 deaths per day between now and the end of February. Notably, data shows that mobility and contacts between people have not decreased with the current restrictions. A new variant of COVID-1 9 emerged in November. lf community transmission of this variant occurs, Ontario could experience much higher case counts, ICU occupancy and mortality. In response to the alarming and exceptional circumstances at hand, and to further interrupt the deadly trend of transmission in Ontario communities, hospitals, and long-term care homes. the following additional public health measures will take effect January 13,2021 at 12:01 a.m.: 115o Outdoor organized public gatherings and social gatherings are further restricted to a limit of five people with limited exceptions. This is consistent with the rules during the lockdown during the first wave of COVID-1 9 in spring 2020 and will aliow individuais and famiiies to enjoy time outdoors sat-ely. r lndividualsarerequiredtowearamaskorfacecoveringintheindoorareasofbusinessesororganizationsthatare open. Wearing a mask or face covering is now recommended outdoors when you can't physically distance more than two metres. o All non-essential retail stores, including hardware stores, alcohol retailers, and those offering curbside pickup or delivery, must open no earlier than 7 a.m. and close no later than 8 p.m. The restricted hours of operation do not apply to stores that primarily sell food, pharmacies, gas stations, convenience stores, and restaurants for takeout or delivery.. Non-essential construction is further restricted, including below-grade construction, exempting survey. These measures will come into effect between TuesdayJanua ry 12,2021 and Thursday, January 14,2021 , including the provincial declaration of emergency under the EMCPA, orders under that Act, and amendments to regulations under the Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-19) Act, 2020. \"Despite our best efforts, COVID-1 9 is continuing to spread in our communities, our hospitals, our long-term care homes, and our workplaces. We are continuing to see concerning trends across the province, including a tragic number of deaths,\" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. \"We have made great strides in vaccinating tens of thousands of Ontarians, and we can't let these efforts go to waste. Urgent action is required to break this deadly trend of transmission, ensure people stay home, and save lives.\" To help quickly identify and isolate cases of COVID-1 9 in workplaces and service providers permitted to remain open such as long-term care homes and schools, the province will provide up to 300,000 COVID-l9 tests per week to support key sectors such as manufacturing, warehousing, supply chain and food processing. as well as additional tests for schools and long-term care homes. This volume of rapid tests would support antigen screening for up to 150,000 workers per week over the next 4- 5 months in Ontario's most critical workplaces. The province is expecting to receive 12 million Panbio tests from the federal government over the next several months and continues to pursue opportunities to purchase additional rapid tests. \"The trends in key public health indicators are continuing to deteriorate, and.further action is urgently required to save lives,\" said Dr. David Wiliiams, Chief Medical Officer of Health. \"By strictly adhering to all public health and workplace safety measures, we can reduce the transmission of COVID-l9 and keep our loved ones and our communities safe. lt will take the collective efforts of us all to defeat this virus.\" The government knows that in order to keep Ontarians safe, it is important that they are not forced to leave their homes during the new state of emergency, Ontario is exploring all options available to put a temporary residential evictions moratorium in place, and will have more to say in the coming days. The additional public health restrictions introduced expand on the existing measures put in place to keep Ontarians safe and healthy. New Enforcement Measures The province will provide authority to all provincial offences officers, including the Ontario Provincial Police, local police forces, bylaw officers, and provincial workplace inspectors to issue tickets to individuals who do not comply with the stay-at- home-order, or those not wearing a mask or face covering indoors in places open to the public, subject to limited exceptions, as well as retail operators and companies who do not enforce requirements under orders under the Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-I9) Acf (ROA) or EMPCA. Those who decide not to abide by orders will be subject to a ser fine and/or prosecution under both the ROA and EMCPA as applicable. ln addition, all provincial offences officers will have the authority to temporarily close a premise and disperse individuals who are in contravention of Sathering limits an order and will be able to disperse people who are gathering, regardless whether a premise has been closed or remains open such as a park. \"Stron8, new measures will be enforced to stop the spread of COVID-1 9,\" said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. \"We are taking extraordinary action to provide law enforcement officers with the tools and support they need to protect the health and wellbeing of Ontarians.\" Schools and Child Care Centres Based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, schools in the following public health units (PHUs) will not return to in-person instruction until February 10,2021:.296 o Windsor-Essex Hamilton297 ByJanuary 20,2021 ,the Chief Medical Officer of Health will advise the Ministry of Education on which public health units (pHUs) will be permitted to resume in-person instruction, based on the most up-to-date data and modelling. Before- and after-school programs can be offered when in-person instruction resumes. Schools in northern PHUs will continue to remain open. To continue to keep students, staff and communities safe, the following new health and safety measures will be put in place for in-person learning: . Masking for Grade 1-3 and requirements for mask wearing outdoors; r Enhanced screening protocols; and . Expanded targeted testing. The government will also implement new health and safety measures in Ontario child care settings, such as enhanced screening to align with school requirements, voluntary participation in targeted testing and additional infection prevention and control measures to align with schools. These enhancements are in addition to the existing health and safety measures already being implemented in child care settings across the province. Child care centres for non-school aged children will remain open, and emergency child care for school-aged children will end in approved pHU regions onJanuary zz,2021 as these elementary schools return to in-person learning.During this extended period of online learning, in areas where in-person elementary learning is suspended, emergency child care will continue for eligible families in regions subject to school closures, as identified by the Chief Medical Officer of Health. ',At the heart of our continued efforts to protect against the spread of COVID-19 in our communities is a firm commitment to return kids to school safely,,'said Education Minister Stephen Lecce. \"Protecting our students, staff and theirfamilies is our top priority, and these additional measures build on our comprehensive plan to reopen schools and keep young children in child care safe.\" Workplace Safety The Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development is taking additional steps to protect workers with the launch of the \"Stay Safe All Day\" campaign, focusing workplace inspections in areas of hiSh transmission, including break rooms, and providing new educational materials to employers to promote safe behaviour before, during and after work. Evidence gathered from COVID-19 related workplace inspections to date shows the vast majority of employers and workers are following COVID-1 9 safety requirements when working. However, when in a break room, a vehicle or not on the clock, there is a tendency to forget about the importance of wearing masks, maintaining physical distance and hand hygiene. As part of the ,,stay Safe All Day\" campaign. inspectors will use a data-driven approach to focus on workplaces with reported covlD-1g outbreaks, manufacturing businesses, warehouses, distribution centres, food processing operations, construction projects and publicly accessible workplaces deemed essential, such as grocery stores. The Ministry is also using a new data- sharing program, in conjunction with the Ministry of Long-Term Care and the Retirement Regulatory Authority, to focus onsite inspections of lonS-term-care homes and retirement homes. ',We know the majority of businesses are operating safely and responsibly to protect their workers and customers. But as COVID-1 9 cases continue to rise, we all need to step up and take additional measures to stop the spread,\" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. \"This includes increasing our inspections to look at everything workers do both while on the job and throughout the workday.\" ln the unfortunate event that an employee becomes infected with COVID-19, they may be entitled to federally funded paid sick leave of up to $500 a week for two weeks. Workers can also access Canada's Recovery Caregiver Benefit of up to $500 per week for up to 26 weeks if they are unable to work because they must care for their child under l2years old or a family member who needs suPervised care' Over the summer, the government enacted a new regulatory amendment that put non-unionized employees on Infectious Disease Emergency Leave during the COVID-19 outbreak any time their hours of work are temporarily reduced by their employer due to COVID-1 9, ensuring businesses aren't forced to terminate employees after their ESA temporary layoff 3/5periods have expired. As part of the Safe RestartAgreement, the federal government is funding a temporary income support program that allows workers to take up to 1 0 days of leave related to COVI D-1 9, preventing the risk of further spread in the wurkplace arrd allowlng workers to focus on their health.

When it is safe to do so, the province will gradually transition each region from the shutdown measures to a revised and strengthened COVID-I9 Responsefrcmewplk-KeepJnS-gnlaigs?le an!-9ppn (the \"Fra mework\"). Details were provided today by premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, and Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health. \"Our number one priority will always be protecting the health and safety of all individuals, families and workers across the province,,, said premier Ford. ,'But we must also consider the severe impact COVID-19 is having on our businesses. That's why we have been listening to business owners, and we are strengthening and adjusting the Framework to allow more businesses to safely reopen and get people back to work.\" To support the province's economic recovery, the government has updated the Framework to allow for a safer approach to retail. Limited in-person shopping in Grey-Lockdown zones will be permitted with public health and safety measures, such as limiting capacity to 25 per cent in most retail settings. ln addition, public health and safety measures in retail settings will be strengthened for other levels of the Framework. lndividuals will also be required to wear a face covering and maintain physical distance when indoors in a business, with limited exceptions. other measures include a requirement for individuals to wear a face covering when attending an organized public event or gathering (where permitted) if they are within two metres distance of another individual who is not part of their household (both indoor and outdoor). All other requirements for gatherings and organized public events would be maintained. Based on the improving local trends of key indicators, including lower transmission of CoVID-1 9, improving hospital capacity' and available public health capacity to conduct rapid case and contact management, the following three regions will be moving back to the Framework at the Green-Prevent level on Wednesday, February 10,2021 al12:01 a.m. and will no longer be subject to the 5!ay:ag-l-amC-aldg: . Hastings Prince Edward Public Health; . Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Public Health; and o Renfrew County and District Health Unit' Due to the fact that public health trends are improving in some regions faster than others, the current Stay-at-Home order will be amended and individual orders making it applicable to each public health region will be made except for the three above. lt is proposed that the Stay-at-Home order will continue to apply to 28 public health regions until Tuesday, February 16,2021. For Toronto, peel and york regions, it is proposed that the Stay-at-Home order will continue to apply until Monday, February 22,2021. Final decisions will be subjectto review of the trends in public health indicators atthattime' ,'While we have seen some progress in our fight against covlD-1 9, the situation in our hospitals remains precarious and the new variants pose a considerable threat to all of us,\" said Minister Elliott. \"As we cautiously and gradually transition out of the provincewide shutdown, we have developed an emergency brake system giving us the flexibility to contain community spread quickly in a specific region, providing an extra layer of protection\"' Recognizing the risk posed by new variants to the province's pandemic response, Ontario is introducing an \"emergency brake'' to allow for immediate action if a public health unit region experiences rapid acceleration in CoVID-19 transmission or if its health care system risks becoming overwhelmed. lf this occurs, the Chief Medical Officer of Health, in consultation with 1t3the local medical officer of health, may advise immediately moving a region into Grey-Lockdown to interrupt transmission, \"lA/hila said Dr. Williams. \"This is not a re-opening or a 'return to normal' and we must continue to limit close contact to our immediate households and stay at home except for essential reasons. By continuing to follow all public health and workplace safety measures, we can continue to reduce the number of new cases and the strain on our health system.\" ln addition, the Brsvllg.ial-cmergeney declared under s 7.0.1 of the Emergency Management and Civit protection Act (EMpCA) will be allowed to terminate at the end of February 9,2021 . While the provincewide stay-at-Home order will cease to apply in some regions as of February 10,2021 , everyone is strongly advised to continue to stay at home, avoid social gatherings, minimize travel between areas with different rules, and limit close contacts to their household. Employers in all industries should continue to make every effort to allow employees to work from home. Enforcement of residential evictions will remain paused in the public health unit regions where the provincial Stay-at-Home order remains in effect. This will ensure people are not forced to leave their homes. ln regions where the Stay-at-Home order is liftcd, thc rcgular process for residential evictiorr errfcrr\"cerrrerrL will resurne. Orders currently in force under the EMCPA have been extended to February 23,2021 and will be extended further if necessary. O.Reg.55/21 (Compliance Orders for Retirement Homes) is currently in effect until February 19,2021. \"While the declaration of emergency will be ending, the risks posed by covlD-19 and the new variants remain serious concerns,\" said Solicitor General Jones. \"That's why extending the stay-at-home orders for most of the province is necessary to protect our communities, our most vulnerable populations, and stop the spread of COVID-1 9. We continue to urge all ontarians to follow public health guidelines and stay home, stay safe, and save lives.\" The Chief Medical officer of Health will continue to consult with public health and other experts, review data, and provide advice to the Sovernment on the appropriate and effective measures that are needed to protect the health of Ontarians. Municipalities and local medical ofFicers of health may have additional restrictions or targeted requirements in their region.

I say first, because there are several other vaccine candidates that could also receive approval in future and become available alongside the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Health Canada's chief medical advisor Dr. Supriya Sharma characterized the announcement as a momentous occasion. CCO members are reminded as per CCO Standard of Practice S-001: Chiropractic Scope of Practice and the Professional Advisorv on Vaccination and Immunization that treating or advising in relation to vaccination is outside of the chiropractic scope of practice. This of course applies in equal measure to the new category of approved Covid-19 vaccines. Members must not express views, treat or advise patients or prospective patients with respect to vaccination, including providing information on vaccination on their websites or social media accounts. I am confident that CCO's Quality Assurance Committee will review Standard of Practice S-001 as paft of its regular review of standards and will recommend any revisions to Council as required and appropriate, It is a minute number of Ontario's 5100 registered chiropractors who are the subject of complaints regarding vaccination claims. In fact, according to a nationwide study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal last May, in their initial study period (2016) researchers found only 94 unique websites maintained by allCanadian chiropractors provided information on vaccination. Of these 94 sites, 63 per cent were critical of vaccination, 20 per304 cent were neutral, and the rest (17 per cent) were supportive. When the researchers revisited these same sites in 20L9, more than half of the initially identified content had been removed. While not designed to attribute causality, the study's authors did note CCO's introduction of our Professional Advisory (linked above) during this study period. I am sure there will be much public discussion in the coming months about Covid-19 vaccines, the quantities received, and how they are distributed etc, It is only to be expected after these many months of disruption, loss and sacrifice in all our personal and professional lives. The Health Canada announcement this week represents a beginning, but the road ahead is long, and significant challenges remain. The public interest in Ontario will continue to be served by members providing safe and effective chiropractic care, by observing all Ministry and CCO guidelines and directives. The profession in Ontario has done remarkably well during this global health crisis and I thank all of you for your ongoing diligence, perseverance and commitment to providing high quality, ethical care to the public of Ontario. As the health landscape continues to evolve, you have my ongoing commitment to communicate with all of you in a timely, focused way on all matters related to CCO's public interest mandate.

Harald Simon313 Dear Council Members, Re: Posting CCO Council & Executive meeting minutes on the CCO public website At the Nov 25/20 council meeting correspondence about the new College Performance Management Framework (CPMF) between the registrar and Ms Allison Henry, Director, Health Workforce Regulatory Oversight Branch, MOHLTC, was mentioned. Specifically, Ms Willson's Octt3/2O letterto Ms Henry asked in numbered paragraphs 2 & 3 on page 2 about the CPMF Standard 3, Measures 4 (b) (ii) & (iii) about details of required posting of Executive committee meeting minutes and stated that \"CCO embraces the intent of this measure to demonstrate greater transparency\". I attended the Nov 28/Lg CCO council meeting where Dr Starmer moved to have all CCO council meeting minutes posted on the CCO public website as has been the practice with the College of Chiropractors of British Columbia (CCBC) since Oct 20L0. After a cursory two minute discussion, Drs Mizel & Amlinger moved to table this item for further consideration and that motion passed. Notwithstanding the president's various pronouncements in multiple president's messages since, touting aligning CCO with best practices for greater transparency shared with other Canadian chiropractic regulatory colleges ensuing from multi-jurisdictional meetings, no further mention from CCO about posting minutes has occurred until the recent positive messaging from the registrar dictated by the MOH CPMF initiative. It would therefore seem incumbent on council to have a quasi-proactive discussion and decision about posting minutes at the next scheduled council meeting on Feb 26/2L especially because council is not fully constituted. Can one assume that council is already in agreerrrerrt with the registrat's above referenced comments to the MOH? With the executive committee currently being the only quorum CCO can muster, greater transparency should be voluntarily demonstrated as opposed to being forced into it by the MOH. Although ten years behind more progressive regulators, as the CCBC, a decision to post council and executive meeting minutes forthwith would be a sign of good faith to all CCO stakeholders, not least being its registrants.

These President's Messages, which are all posted on the CCO website, have communicated vital information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including: o Closures and openings of essential businesses as ordered by directives of the Ontario Government, o Return to work guidance documents from the Ministry of Health, Public Health Ontario and CCO, which are continuously updated, regarding protocols on physical distancing, active and passive screening, use of appropriate personal protective equipmen!, cleaning and disinfection, hygiene and contact tracing, to increase safety for members and patients and reduce the spread of COVID-19, o Guidance regarding virtual care or \"telecare\" to allow for the virtual care of patients in certain circumstances, . CCO expectations regarding advertising, websites and social media and response to inquiries, complaints and reports on these matters. CCO has disposed of a total of 185 complaints related to websites and social media and has also written a number of cease and desist letters regarding messaging and practices related to COVID-19 which are brought to CCO's attention, o Changes in CCO regulatory functions, including staff working from home as much as possible, o Extensions of renewal payments and continuing education reporting requirements and a pause and restart of peer and practice assessment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and o Changes in regulatory certificates of registration resulting from the cancellation of the CCEB May/une examinations (addressed in more detail later in this report). CCO continues to post information and links related to the COVID-19 pandemic on its website, including links to Ministry of Health guidance documents, Public Health Ontario information and Government of Canada initiatives. CCO staff have also prioritized answering questions and responding to inquiries from members and the public related to COVID-19 and if necessary, directing members and the public to the proper authorities, such as local public health units. CCO commends the efforts of members who have reviewed and followed the messages and protocols of these President's Messages and have helped ensure the safety and health of Ontarians and reduced the spread of COVID-19. CCO was also the first regulatory college to conduct a virtual discipline hearing and quickly developed policies and procedures to ensure these hearings could be conducted in a legal, transparent and fairCCO Reerrlatorv Rennrt to the FCC November 24,2020qq'loJl manner in this virtual setting. CCO has conducted a total of 8 virtual hearings and continues to conduct them in this manner. Registration Practices - General (Provisional) Certificates of Registration As a result of the cancellation of the May/une sitting of the CCEB examinations and CCO's Legislation and Ethics examination, CCO developed policies and protocols to register new graduates under a new General (Provisional) class of certificate of registration. CCO's Registration Committee engaged the Accessing Centre for Expertise from the University of Toronto to conduct a research study on the regulatory effects of registering new members of regulated professions under a conditional certificate in anticipation of completion of clinical competency examinations Based on the results of this study and using the model of a pre-existing CCO policy on the supervision of chiropractors in training, CCO developed a policy and application process for the registration of applications under a General (Conditional) certificate with terms, conditions and limitation on their certificates of registration. These include that provisional members would be required to practise under the supervision of an actively practicing member in good standing with CCO and represent themselves to the public as a provisionally registered member. CCO registered 79 members under this General (Conditional) certificate of Registration and as of November 15, 2020 has registered 128 new members in the full General class of registration since March I,2O2O. CCO received very positive feedback from the Office of the Fairness Commissioner about our recent Provisional Certificate of Registration initiative and has identified this initiative as a best practice. The Fairness Commissioner is responsible for ensuring registration practices across all Ontario colleges, professional bodies and trade associations are fair, impartial and transparent - just one of the many layers of government oversight and legislative obligation to which CCO is accountable. CCO thanks all stakeholders for providing valuable feedback during the development of policies and procedures on the General (Conditional) certificate of registration. A special thanks goes to the Canadian Chiropractic Examining Board who conducted the examination sitting in October and November in a safe and effective manner while navigating the difficulty of the opening and closing of businesses in different provinces as a result of COVID-19. As well, CCO applauds the CCO members who served as supervisors for this program. CCO also moved its Leglslation and Ethics examination into an online format and will continue to administer the examination in this manner during the COVID-19 pandemic. College Performance Measurement Framework (CPMF) The Ontario Government has released a draft version of the CPMF which is a standardized document for health regulatory colleges to report on their regulatory functions and effects to the Ministry of Health. The intention of the CPMF is to have a consistent method of colleges reporting on their regulatory functions and effects to the Ministry of Health. CCO had a positive meeting with the Ministry of Health to discuss preliminary reporting of the CPMF and continues to participate in weekly virtual meetings with the other health regulatory colleges in Ontario to discuss strategies and best practices on reporting on the CPMF. 2CCO Regulatory Report to the FCC November 24,2020 cco adapted its 201-9 Annual Report to address many of the areas of the cPMF and looks forward to reporting using the final version of this tool. Other CCO Committees and Functions Although CCO has prioritized its core regulatory functions and practices related to the pandemic as a result of COVID-19, its committees continue to adapt to this changing landscape and continue to fulfill their statutory mandates. CCO's Quality Assurance Committee paused the Peer and Practice Assessment process during the early months of the pandemic and restarted it with an emphasis on virtual assessments and added the review of questions and protocols related to COVID-19. The Quality Assurance also extended the deadline to participate and report on continuing education activities with an emphasis that members should look for online and virtual opportunities to fulfill their continuing education hours. other policy considerations for the Quality Assurance committee were related to business practices, health care claims in advertising, websites and social media, and continued dialogue with the College of Veterinarians of Ontario related to the chiropractic are of animals. cco also continues to approve applications for funding for therapy for victims of sexual abuse who have made complaints to CCO.

An important theme that emerged from the survey, and was adopted as a key pillar of the OCA's 2017-2022 Strategic Plan, was members' strong desire for OCA to actively identiff and address marketing and business practices that might diminish the profession's ability to serve the public and/or harm the profession's reputation. lmportant findings from the survey (conducted in 2017) include Almost 65% of respondents urged the OCA to adopt a strong stance against unethical treatment and marketing practices Almost 75% of respondents indicated the OCA should be raising these concerns with CCO T0o/o of respondents indicated that they would be personally willing to defend initiatives undertaken by OCA against marketing (and/or treatment) practices that might hurt the profession Nearly one in five respondents reported having viewed some advertising or communications they believed could harm the reputation of the profession The survey results complements OCA's submission to CCO on October 30 and reflects the priority that OCA members place on the need for urgent action by CCO to ensure a robust, and transparent regulatory framework to govern the profession's Health Care Claims in Advertising, Websites and Social Media practicesa a 2Ot - 70 U niversity Association342 Page 2 OCA welcomes an opportunity to discuss with you and/or CCO Council its recommendations and engage in broader conversations and collaborations regarding how to support the profession's capacity to strengthen chiropractors' marketing and business practices.

We recognize that this decision pertained to multiple breeches of CCO Standards and Guidelines. We also recognize that none of the specific allegations or corresponding findings of professional misconduct pertains to the use of incentives. However, we are particularly interested in the aspects of the decision and agreed upon statement of facts which involved Dr. Guttman's practice of giving free footwear to patients. Our understanding is that existing CCO policy allows for the use of incentives so long as a third- party payor is not involved. We base this understanding on the CCO Advertising Guideline (G- 016), which stipulates that: 'A member is not permitted to bill any third-party payor or ask for the patient's heatth insurance information for complimentary diagnostic or treatmenf servrces as fhis practice is unethicaland may be professional ln the passage subtitled \"Free Shoes\" the Discipline Committee's decision notes \"fhe cost of shoes that were free to patients were ultimately incorporated into the fee the Member charged to the insurer.\" ln this regard, it seems that Mr. Guttman's admitted actions were a clear violation of the Guideline. However, the decision also finds fault with Dr. Guttmen's use of incentives because it\"could result rn excessiye and unnecessary demands and [insurance] claims for medical deviced'. The decision further describes Dr. Guttman as admitting \"that it was unprofessional to offer an incentive.\" The decision thus seems to introduce a new ground upon which a member could be found to have engaged in professional misconduct: namely, by causing or potentially causing excessive or unnecessary use ofextended health care benefits. We are in the process of developing a tool to assist OCA members in navigating the complex world of extended health care, including the area of incentives and orthotics. ln order to help 2Ot - 70 U niversity Association344 Page 2 chiropractors follow CCO standards and guidelines, we would appreciate if you would clarifo CCO Guidance and Standards on incentives for us. For example, if a member were to be accused only of using incentives to cause excessive or unnecessary use of benefits, would this also constitute grounds for a finding of professional misconduct? ls it merely \"unprofessional\" (i.e., does not breach CCO professional misconduct guidelines) to offer incentives in this way, or does this also rise to the level of professional misconduct? A second related matter we are hoping you could clarifiT is whether incentives are only prohibited by CCO when a third-party payor is involved. ls the underlying concern with incentives that the cost of \"free\" giveaways and discounts is if often ultimately passed on to the payor in some other way? lf yes, would it be considered unethical and unprofessional whether that payer is the public system, an insurance company, or a private individual? Any clarification you could provide would be appreciated. Thank you and I look forward to your response.

I am writing on behalf of the Ontario Chiropractic Association (OCA) in support of the government's proposed regulatory changes posted on November 2,2020 to amend Acts governing Chiropractors, Denturists and Kinesiologists allowing members of those regulated health professions to deliver care to their spouses. Specifically, I am writing to express the support of the OCA for the proposed changes to the regulations impacting chiropractors. By way of background, in March 2018, College of Chiropractors of Ontario (CCO) wrote to the government to reaffirm its original request for a spousal exception and to report that CCO had -ompleted a comprehensive consultation process through both its Patient Relations Committee and full Council meetings, resulting in unanimous approvalto proceed with a spousal exception regulation for Ontario chiropractors. CCO then prepared regulations that are consistent with existing regulations for other professions related to the spousal exception. The OCA supports the proposed regulatory changes, allowing chiropractors to treat their spouses, as they recognize the important distinction between the power dynamic in a patient- provider relationship and one that is primari[ a spousal relationship. We are likewise encouraged the Ministry of Health is moving forward to address long-standing regulatory changes proposed by various health regulatory colleges and encourage the government to cbnsider scope enhancements for chiropractors that would permit the ordering of iertain lab and enhanced imaging diagnostic testing that will improve access to healthcare saving costs and reducing wait-times.

Chiropractic & SYSTEMATIC REVIEWOpen Access The global sumrnit on the efficacy and effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy for the prevention and treatment of non-musculoskeletal disorders: a systematic review of Abstract Background: A small proportion of chiropractors, osteopaths, and other manual medicine providers use spinal mani[ulative therapy (SMT) to manage non-musculoskeletal disorders. However, the efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions to prevent or treat non-musculoskeletal disorders remain controversial. Objectives: We convened a Global Summit of international scientists to conduct a systematic review of the literature to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT for the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of non-musculoskeletal disorders. Globaf summit: The Global Summit took place on september 14-15,2019 in Toronto, Canada. lt was attended by 50 researchers from g countries and 28 observers from 18 chiropractic organizations.

Chiropractic & Manual Therapies (2o21) 29:8 Background Some evidence-based clinical practice guidelines recom- mend that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) be used alone, or in addition to other interventions for the man- agement of back pain, neck pain, and headaches associ- ated with neck pain [1-5]. Although health professionals who deliver SMT are primarily consulted for spinal pairy some patients are treated for non-musculoskeletal disor- ders [6-8]. Specifically, between 3 and 10% of patients who receive care from chiropractors and osteopaths are treated for non-musculoskeletal disorders [1, 6]. In relative terms, these figures suggest that only a small proportion of patients receive SMT for non-musculoskeletal disor- ders; however, in absolute terms, it indicates that a sub- stantial number of patients globally receive such care every year. The treatment of non-musculoskeletal disorders has a long tradition among chiropractors and osteopaths. This tradition is based on two foundational concepts. The first concept implies that spinal dysfunctions, or sublux- ations, can have a negative effect on the body's innate ability to heal itself, and that these dysfunctions can berectified through SMT [9-11]. The second concept pro- poses that spinal dysfunction can negatively impact the autonomic neryous system, which in turn may cause dis- ease including organ dysfunctions [i0-12]. Some argue that they may influence the autonomic nervons system and thereby improve physiologic function by dysfunctions through SMT [13, 14]. Many chiro- practors do not endorse this thinking and use an evidence-based approach to clinical care [15-17]. Laboratory studies of physiological mechanisms report that certain types of manual therapies can indeed affect body functions, such as heart rate variability or inflamma- tory cytokines in healthy individuals [18, 19], thus sup- porting the notion that SMT can be used to treat non- musculoskeletal disorders. However, two systematic re- views suggest that such effects, if they occur, are short- lasting and without clinical consequences [13, 20]. More- over, a recent randomized controlled trial which com- pared SMT to a successful sham control found no such effect [21]. Although essential to the understanding of physiological mechanisms of action of interventions, la- boratory experiments alone have not provided aPage 2 of 23 355 (Continued from previous page) Systematic review of the literature: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Reqister of Controlled Trials, the Cumulative lndex to Nursing and Allied Health, and the Index to Chiropractic Literature from inception to May 15,2019 uslng subject headings specific to each database and free text words relevant to manipulation/ manual therapy, effectiveness, prevention, treatment, and non-musculoskeletal disorders. Eligible for review were randomized controlled trials published in English. The methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed independently by reviewers using the Scottish lntercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria for randomized controlled trials. We synfhesized the evidence from articles with high or acceptable methodological quality according to the Synthesis without Meta-Analysis (SWIM) Guideline. The final risk of bias and evidence tables were reviewed by researchers who attended the Global Summit and 75o/o (38/50) had to approve the content to reach consensus. Results: We retrieved 4997 cilalions, removed 1123 duplicates and screened 3874 citations. Of those, the eligibility of 32 articles was evaluated at the Global Summit and 16 articles were included in our systematic review. Our synthesis included six randomized controlled trials with acceptable or high methodological quality (reported in seven articles). These trials investigated the efficacy or effectiveness of SMTfor the management of infantile colic, childhood asthma, hypertension, primary dysmenorrhea, and migraine. None of the trials evaluated the effectiveness of SMT in preventing the occurrence of non-musculoskeletal disorders. Consensurs was reached on the content of all risk of bias and evidence tables. All randomized controlled trials with high or acceptable quality found that SMT was not superior to sham interventions for the treatment of these non-musculoskeletal disorders. Six of 50 participants (12o/o) in the Global Summit did not approve the final report, Conclusion: Our systematic review included six randomized clinical trials (534 participants) of acceptable or high quality investigating the efficacy or effectiveness of SMT for the treatment of non-musculoskeletal disorders. We found no evidence of an effect of SMT for the management of non-musculoskeletal disorders including infantlle colic, childhood asthma, hypertension, primary dysmenorrhea, and mlgraine. This finding challenges the validity of the theory that treating spinal dysfunctions with SMT has a physiological effect on organs and their function. Governments, payers, regulators, educators, and clinicians should consider this evidence when developing policies about the use and reimbursement of SMT for non-musculoskeletal disorders.

Chiropractic & Manual Therapies Q021) 29:8 mechanistic understanding of these hypotheses nor Pro- vided evidence of clinical efficacy or effectiveness [22]' Therefore, as emphasized by Bialosky et al. [23], the hy- pothesized causal chain between SMT, the autonomic neryous system, and clinical outcomes remains hypothet- ical and has yet to be established. Some clinicians and patients report favorable out- comes when SMT is used to treat a variety of non- musculoskeletal complaints, such as allergies, breathing problems, digestive problems, and tinnitus [24]. More- over, case reports suggest that SMT may benefit patients who consult for conditions such as bedwetting 125, 261, multiple sclerosis [27], autism spectrum disorder [28], and ischemic stroke [29]. However, it is important to note that observations, including case-reports that shape clinical experience may be misleading for several reasons [30]. First, it is possible that the observed improvement is due to the natural course of the disease rather than the treatment that has been delivered' Second, context- ual effects associated with the treatment may account for the reported improvements, rather than the treat- ment itself 119,22,31]. Moreover, whenever a treatment is provided, the patient may have expectations of the outcome, positive or negative, and it is well known that positive expectations of recovery are associated with fa- vorable health outcomes [32]. Fourth, it is possible that the observed changes are due to concurrent treatments [33]. Finally, the observed improvement can be due to regression to the mean, whereby patients with more se- vere symptoms tend to show greater levels of improve- ments independently of the treatment they receive [34- 36]. Consequently, RCTs are necessary to determine whether the benefits noticed in clinical practice and re- ported in case reports and case series are due to the pro- posed mechanisms of SMT or if they can be explained by other factors [33]. Without rigorously conducted RCTs, clinicians and patients may assume that SMT is more or even less effective than it is. Several previous reviews have evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT for non-musculoskeletal disor- ders [20, 37-4I]. Overall, these reviews found no strong evidence for the benefit of such treatment regardless of their scope, definitions of SMT, search strategies, and re- view methodology [20, 37 -4I]. Interestingly, these previ- ous reviews have not had an obvious impact on health care and clinical policies, at least not within the chiro- practic profession. We believe that this failed to occur because a broad-based consensus about the implications of this research has not yet been achieved within the chiropractic profession. Therefore, we convened a large group of international chiropractic researchers with dif- ferent scientific backgrounds and expertise to anchor a new systematic review. Furthermore, to promote know- ledge and understanding of our study to the chiropracticprofession at large, we invited representatives from chiropractic associations and organisations to observe our research. The purpose of our study was to systematically review the body of evidence on the efficary and effectiveness of SMT for the prevention and treatment of non- musculoskeletal disorders. Based on the osteopathic and chiropractic theories described above [9-14], we as- sumed that the rationale for this treatment was the same across non-musculoskeletal disorders conditions; specif- ically, that treating spinal dysfunctions with SMT has a physiological effect on organs and their function. We ad- dressed two main research questions for each of pri- mary, secondary and tertiary prevention: 1. Compared to sham or placebo interventions, is spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization or spinal traction efficacious for the prevention or management of non-musculoskeletal disorders? 2. Compared to other interventions (including sham intervention when delivered in a pragmatic plan of management or no intervention), is spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization or spinal traction effective in the prevention or management of non- musculoskeletal disorders? The primary target audience for our systematic review is policy makers (governments, insurers and regulators). We targeted policy makers because they are well posi- tioned to facilitate the development of clinical practice guidelines and implement evidence-based policies that will serve and protect the public's best interest. We also aim to provide educators, researchers and health care providers with the best evidence to inform their contri- bution to the policy development process, Context The global summit on the efficacy and effectiveness of spinal manipulation for the management of non- musculoskeletal disorders The two research questions were the focus of the Global Summit on the Efficacy and Effectiveness of Spinal Ma- nipulation for the Management of Non-musculoskeletal Disorders (Global Summit). The initiation of the Global Summit was prompted by international public concerns about chiropractic care for the management of non- musculoskeletal disorders [42-45]. Steering committee and writing teom The Global Summit was organized by a steering com- mittee which included PC (chair), CLY, IA and JH. The steering committee developed the methodology for the systematic review, oversaw its conduct and implementa- tion, led the evidence synthesis, and published thePage 3 of 23 356CAtd et al. Chhopractic & Monual Therapies (2021)29:8 rcport. Thc steering committee was assisted in this work by a research assistant (MC). The final report was drafted by a writing team consisting of the steering com- mittee and senior researchers with expertise and experi- ence in evidence synthesis and scientific writing (fDC, SDF, GNI(, SM, EP, JW). The writing team provided on- going feedback and quallty assurance to drafts of evi- dence tables and sections of the manuscript. Porticipants The Global Summit brought together researchers who were invited by the steering committee. Participants met the following criteria: 1) chiropractor with a PhD, or a researcher with a PhD (not a chiropractor) with research expertise in chiropractic; 2) actively involved in research (defined as having published at least 5 peer-reviewed pa- pers over the past 5 years); and 3) appointed at an aca- dcmic or educotional institution. In oddition, a small group of researchers who did not meet these criteria were invited. These included three chiropractors with a strong publication and scientific editorial record who did not have a PhD (SMP, |W and HS) and two early career researchers with an expertise within the area of chiro- practic and pseudoscience (ALM, GG). Participants were invited by the Steering Committee using purposive and snowball sampling methods. Pre-summit octivities From fanuary 5,2019 to September 13,2019, the Steer- ing Committee held regular meetings to organize the Global Summit. The presummit activities included: 1) identification and invitation of participants and ob- servers; 2) design of the systematic review; 3) search of the literature; 4) submission of the review protocol to International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO); 5) development of the instruction manual for critical appraisal; 6) screening of articles; 7) creation of three review groups of researchers for studies related to primary, secondary and tertiary prevention; 8) critical appraisal of the literature (first round) conducted by each review group; and 9) preparation of structure and first draft of evidence tables. Global summit meeting On September l4-I5,2019, 50 researchers (31 males; 19 females) from eight countries met in Toronto, Canada for the Global Summit. Twenty-eight researchers were from North America, 14 from Europe and eight from Australia. There were no participants from Asia, Africa or South America. In addition, 28 observers from vari- ous chiropractic organizations and educational institu- tions from North America, Europe and Australia were present to observe the meeting. At the Global Summit, researchers worked in their pre-assigned review groups.Each group reviewed the eligibility of RCTs that were deemed to be relevant by participants prior to the Global Summit, rated and discussed the methodological quality of studies, and extracted data from eligible studies. This was one of four phases in the risk of bias assessment, as described in detail below. Obseruers The steering committee invited representatives from chiropractic organizations to observe the scientific delib- erations during the Global Summit. The organizations represented at the Global Summit included 28 represen- tatives from 18 international, national and provincial associations, regulators, one malpractice protective asso- ciation, and one chiropractic college. We invited chiro- practic organizations so that they could witness the scientific discussion and learn about the methods in- volved in the conduct of systematic reviews. There were no formal criteria to invite obseryers, but it followed a purposive process. Observers held separate meetings during the Global Summit to discuss the implications of the research. Although they were invited to observe the scientific discussion, they did not participate in or influ- ence the scientific deliberations. Post-summit activities Following the Global Summit, the steering committee ensured that all relevant studies were critically re- appraised using a standardized method and finalized the risk of bias assessment and evidence tables. The steering committee also led an online consensus process with all participants of the Global Summit, who were asked to review and approve/reject/modifr the final risk of bias tables and evidence tables. These activities are discussed in detail below Methods Protocol registration and reporting 'We registered our systematic review with PROSPERO (CRD42019140194). We structured our report according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) [45], the PRISMA Harms check- [sts [47] and results according to the Synthe- sis without Meta-Analysis (S\\giM) Guideline [a8]. Eligibility criteria Studies eligible for our systematic review met the follow- ing inclusion criteria: 1) English language; 2) published from database inception to May L5, 20L9 in a peer- reviewed journal; 3) investigated non-musculoskeletal disorders; 4) randomized controlled trial that investi- gated the efficacy or effectiveness of spinal manipulation, mobilization, or traction (all types including manual/ assisted); 5) study population included all ages; 6)Page 4 of 23 357Page 5 of 23 COtd et a/. Chiropraaic & Manual Therapies (2O21) 2913 included at least one outcome that is specific to the non-musculoskeletal disorder under investigation and measured at the patient level; and 7) the number of ran- domized participants Per grouP was >20. We did not include the following study types: 1) guidelines, letters, editorials, commentaries, unpublished manuscripts, dissertations, government reports, books or book chapters, conference proceedings, meeting ab- stracts, lectures and addresses, consensus development statements, or guideline statements; 2) cadaveric or ani- mal studies; 3) non-clinical studies (studies that aim to understand the physiological effects of spinal manipula- tion); 4) pilot studies aimed at demonstrating the feasi- bility of conducting an RCT; and 5) studies in which the effect of spinal manipulation, mobilization, or traction could not be isolated (e.g, studies where spinal manipu- lation was included in a multimodal program of care)' Definitions of key concePts Efficacy Studies of efficacy are designed to investigate the bene- fits and adverse events of an intervention under ideal and highly controlled conditions. The preferred design for efficacy studies is the RCT using a sham or placebo group as a comparison [49]. Effectiveness Studies of effectiveness seek to examine the outcomes of interventions under circumstances that more closely ap- proximate a real-world setting. Effectiveness studies, iherefore, typically use an RCT design, where the new treatment is compared to other interventions (including sham intervention when delivered in a pragmatic plan of management), such as the standard of practice for the patient population being studied [49]. In our review, we classified an RCT as an effectiveness trial if SMT was de- livered according to a pragmatic plan of management re- gardless of the comParison grouP.

Spinal manipulative theroPY ln this report, spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization and spinal traction are referred to collectively as \"spinal manipulative therapy''. lnformation sources and search strategy We developed our search strategy in consultation with a health sciences librarian from the Centre for Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation at Ontario Tech Univer- sity and CMCC. A second librarian from the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College reviewed the strategy to ensure accuracy using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist 154, 551' We system- atically searched MEDLINE U'S' National of Medicine (through Ovid Technologies Inc'), Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumula- tive Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL' through EBSCOhost), and Index to Chiropractic Litera- ture (ICL, Chiropractic Library Collaboration) from in- ception to May 75, 2}lg. Search terms consisted of subject headings specific to each database (e.g', MeSH in MEDLINE) and free text words relevant to manipulation/manual therapy, effectiveness, prevention, treatment, and non-musculoskeletal disorders (Add- itional file 1).'We also asked participants to identify and submit any citations or articles that may be relevant to the literature review Study selection All articles retrieved through the literature searches were exported into EndNoteXT'0.2 for reference management and tracking of the screening process. Four pairs of trained and experienced reviewers (HS, IA; SM, JH; CC'C6t6 er a/. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies (2021) 29:8 JW AAM, PC) independently screened all potentially eligible articles in three phases. In phase one screening, titles and abstracts were reviewed and classified as rele- vant, possibly relevant or irrelevant according to the eli- gibility criteria. During phase two screening, the full text of possibly relevant articles was reviewed for final deter- mination of eligibility. Pairs of reviewers discussed eligi- bility to reach consensus for both phases of screening. Finally, in phase three, the eligibility of studies identified in phase two was reviewed and adjudicated at the Global Summit by the primary secondary and tertiary groups. In cases of disagreement between reviewers during phase one or phase two screening, a third independent re- viewer (CLY) was consulted to achieve consensus. Data collection process and data items 'We extracted the following descriptive variables from all relevant studies: First author's name, year of publication, description of participants, case definition, health care setting where the study was conducted, sampling frame, total number of participants enrolled, treatment and control interventions (description, type of provider, number of participants at baseline), duration of follow- up; outcome measurement(s), results (between-group differences, risk 95o/o Cl or p-values (when 95o/o Cl were not reported or could not be computed)). The data were entered directly into evidence tables. Pairs of researchers extracted data during the Global Summit and independent reviewers validated the data extraction following the Global Summit. The steering committee subsequently validated the content of the evidence tables for completeness, accuracy and consistency of reporting. Finally, the content of the evidence tables was submitted to all participants for review and approval through an electronic survey. We used 75o/o agreement (38/50 par- ticipants) as the threshold for consensus. Risk of bias in individual studies 'We critically appraised articles using the Scottish Inter- collegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria for ran- domized controlled trials [56]. The SIGN criteria were selected by the steering committee for ease of use and relevance, and adapted for the purpose of our review by adding the following questions to the generic checklists: - \"The definition of the non-musculoskeletal condition is clear?\" (Yes/No) - \"The participants are free from the non- musculoskeletal condition studied at the beginning of the study?\" (Yes/No/Can't say) (only for studies investigating primary prevention) - \"The spinal manipulative therapy (spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization, and spinaltraction) intervention is described in sufficient detail?\" (YesiNo) - \"The control intervention (if any) is described in sufficient detail?\" (Yes/No) - \"The follow-up period is sufficient (long enough for the outcome to occur) to answer the research ques- tion?\" (Yes/No/Can't say) In addition, we edited the following item (in the primary prevention form) to ensure that the measurement properties of the method used to identif the non-musculoskeletal con- dition were clearly captured. The item \"Are all outcomes measured in a standard, valid and reliable way?\" was split into two questions, \"The non-musculoskeletal condition is measured in a reliable way'' (YesiNo/Cant say) and \"The non-musculoskeletal condition is measured in a valid way'' (YesAtro/Can't say). Detailed notes accompanied the SIGN generic checklists, and these were also edited to match the purpose ofthis review The risk of bias assessment was informed by the items from the SIGN checldists that focused on methodological quality. All risk of bias assessments were conducted by two independ- ent investigators who were unaware of each othels ratings. The risk of bias items included clarity of the research ques- tion, definition of the non-musculoskeletal conditioru randomization procedure, blinding of participants, clinicians and investigators, description of manipulation and control interventions, outcome measurements, drop-outs, co, interventions, intention-to-treat analysis and follow-up period. The risk of bias assessment was conducted in four se- quential steps. Prior to the Global Summit, independent pairs of reviewers (within each of the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention review groups) critically ap- praised relevant RCTs to determine their methodological quality. At the Global Summit, the quality was discussed and agreed upon by the respective group. After the sum- mit, all RCTs were critically appraised a third time by two independent experienced methodologists (CLY, Nf, IA, SM, JH, PC) to ensure that the SIGN criteria were interpreted and applied in a similar manner across re- viewers and review groups. Two participants (SF, EP) then performed quality assurance by reviewing all SIGN forms and risk of bias tables developed from the third round of reviews to ensure their accuracy and standard application. A study was rated as low risk of bias (high or accept- able quality according to the SIGN methodology) if re- viewers judged that potential sources of selection bias, information bias and confounding were minimal or.ac- ceptable [56]. In particular, reviewers focused on poten- tial biases related to the randomization procedure, concealment of treatment allocation, blinding, adminis- tration of sham intervention, and attrition [57-61]. ThePage 6 of 23 359C6t6 et d/. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies (2021) 29:8 presence of a validated sham procedure was considered particularly important. Finally, all researchers involved in the systematic re- view of the literature reviewed the risk of bias tables and were asked to vote on the outcome of the critical ap- praisal through an electronic survey. We used 75% agreement (38/50 participants) as the threshold for con- sensus. One researcher (CLY) was not involved in the systematic review at the Global Summit but was, in case of problems, available as referee, to thereafter participate in the validation process and therefore also in the two voting sessions. Standardized metrics 'We used RR and between-group difference in means to quantify the effect of interventions. 'We reported the intervention-specific incidence of adverse events' 'When these summary measurements were not reported in the published article, we used data reported in the paper to attempt to compute these statistics. Synthesis of results We synthesized the evidence from acceptable or high- quality RCTs according to the SWiM Guideline and reported them in evidence tables [48]. We used two criteria to determine whether SMT was efficacious or effective. First, a study had to provide evidence that the null hypothesis was an unlikely hypothesis (p < 0.05) for the observed between-group difference in the primary outcome [62]. Second, if a difference was found, we determined whether the difference was clinically important. When available, we used stan- dardized measurements (minimal clinically important difference [MCID]) to determine whether clinically important differences were reached in each trial' If the clinical importance of a statistically significant dif- ference was not reported in the article, we planned to discuss the findings among Global Summit partici- pants and reach consensus on its clinical importance. We used 75o/o agteement (38/50 participants) as the threshold for consensus. W'e restricted our synthesis to RCTs with accept- able/high methodological quality because low/un- acceptable quality trials are more likely to yield biased estimates of effect sizes 157-6L]. To under- stand the impact of methodological quality on trial results, we contrasted results from methodologically acceptable studies with those from the unacceptable studies. The SWiM guideline was published after the registration of our protocol on PROSPERO t481. Nevertheless, we adopted it to ensure that our evi- dence synthesis complied with the most current methods of reporting. We had initially planned to stratify the synthesis by primary prevention, secondaryprevention and tertiary prevention. However, we re- vised this plan and synthesized the evidence by non- musculoskeletal disorder because there were no stud- ies, and very few studies, to inform primary and ter- tiary prevention, respectively. We further synthesized the evidence, based on the study design (efficacy ver- sus effectiveness). \\r)fle tabulated disease-specific outcomes as reported in the individual papers by comparing the outcomes for SMT to the outcomes for control interventions. These comparisons informed the development of an evidence statement for each non-musculoskeletal disorder. Be- cause the studies were clinically heterogeneous, we did not assess for statistical heterogeneity of effects across studies. We present our main results in a series of tables. First, we report our consensus methodological quality assess- ment in the risk of bias table. Second, the study charac- teristics and key study results are presented in the evidence table. Finally, we provide a succinct evidence table, which summarizes the key characteristics and re- sults of all studies to facilitate the comparison of study results according to study quality. We examined the dir- ection and magnitude of effect sizes across RCTs ac- cording to methodological quality by comparing studies rated as high/acceptable quality versus those rated as low/unacceptable quality. 'We developed a consensus-based, narrative evidence statement for each non-musculoskeletal disorder. How- ever, since the rationale for treatment is the same across conditions, these statements synthesize the evidence about the efficary and effectiveness of SMT for the pre- vention and management of the specific non- musculoskeletal disorder in general, in accordance with our research questions. Publication bias and selective reporting rMe did not assess publication bias' We checked report- ing of outcomes for the acceptable- and high-quality tri- als against registered protocols by 1) scrutinizing the papers for mentioning of published or registered proto- cols; 2) searching for protocol papers in PubMed; and 3) accessing clinicaltrials.gov. Approval of the final manuscript and authorship The final manuscript was submitted to all participants to the Global Summit for review. Participants were asked to vote electronically on whether they approved the final version of the paper and whether they wanted to co- author the published paper. Participants who declined authorship were asked to provide the reason for their decision. This process was repeated after the submitted manuscript had been reviewed by the journal.Page 7 of 23 360C6tA et al. Chiropractic & Monual Therapies (2021)29:8 Results Study selection Our search retrieved 4997 citations (Fig. 1). No additional articles were submitted by participants. We removed 1123 duplicates and screened the titles and abstracts of3874 ci- tations (phase one screening). Of those,219 citations were screened in phase two and the eligibility of 32 articles was reviewed at the Global Summit (phase three). The primary reasons for excluding 187 articles are presented in Fig. 1. Sixteen articles were excluded in phase three screening (Table 1) 178,63-771. Therefore, 16 articles (reporting on 14 RCTs) were included in the review and were critically appraised 137,78-901. tMe did not identifr any RCTs re- lated to primary prevention, 14 trials addressed secondary prevention, and six ofthe secondary prevention trials also included outcomes related to tertiary prevention. Of the acceptable and high-quality trials, one trial assessed effi- cacy [80] whtle ftve trials evaluated effectiveness [37, 81, 92,84,871. Risk of bias within studies Of the 14 included RCTs, three were rated as high qual- itl 137,81, 84], two were deemed to be of acceptable quality [80, 87], three were of low quality 179, 85, 891, and five were rated as unacceptable quality [78, 83, 86,88, 901 (Table 2). The study by Chaibi et al. [82] received two quality ratings as the component of the trial com- paring SMT to sham was rated to be of acceptable qual- ity and sham was included in the evidence synthesis, whereas the component comparing SMT to the control intervention was rated as low quality because of the dif- ferentially high drop-out rate in the control group and that study was, therefore, not included in the evidence synthesis [82]. Differences in the methodological quality between RCTs rated as high/acceptable quality and those rated as low/unacceptable quality were mainly related to the method of randomization, concealment of treatment al- Iocation, successful blinding of participants (inability to identify the treatment), and blinding of outcome asses- sors and investigators (those who collected outcome data and investigators were unaware of the treatment re- ceived by purLicipunl.s) (Tuble 2). Our qualitative synthesis therefore includes three high quality RCTs [37, 81, 84] and three RCTs of acceptable quality [80,82,87]. Ofthese, none evaluated the efficacy or effectiveness of SMT for the primary prevention of non-MSK disorders, six RCTs evaluated spinal manipu- lation for secondary prevention 137, 80, 82, 8+,87] and two studies evaluated spinal manipulation for tertiaryPage 8 of 23 361 c.s6 E !Records identlfled from database search (n-4997)Addltional ed from other sources {n'0) I +Records\u20acxclud\u20acd duilng phase screening quality Two RcTs add two adicl\u20acs (Chaibi et el., 2017; Parker et al., 1978). + one RcT had tuo articles (Parker et al,, 1978) I All RCTS related to tertiary preventlon also reported on secondary prevention outcomes. #The internal validltyofcomponents ofone RCTwas rated as ecceptable quality whlle componenb were rated as low quality (Chaibi et a1.,2017) Fig. 1 PRISMA 9 of 23 362 Table 1 Primaryreason for exclusion of RCTs in phase 3 screening First author, Year PoPulation Primary reason for ineligibilitY Atrali 2013 [63]u Bevilaqua-Grossi 2016 164l^Patients with irritable bowel syndrome Patients with migraine and neck painThe sample size was < 20 Per grouP.

Specifically, the trials included different populations, used different outcome measurements and were managed according to different therapeutic Protocols. Evidence summary for the secondary and tertiary prevention of non-MSK disorders Studies of high/occeptoble quolity None of the six RCTs of high or acceptable quality dem- onstrated that SMT is efficacious or effective for the sec- ondary or tertiary prevention of non-MSI( disorders (Tables 3-4) and there were no studies on primary prevention.Low and unacceptable methodological quolity Nine RCTs were rated as low or unacceptable quality (Table 1). Two of these were conducted in infants with colic [85, 89], two in women with dysmenorrhea [79, 83], one in adults with hypertension [88], one in adults with irritable bowel syndrome [90], and three in adults with migraines [78, 82, 86] (Table 4). Two studies evalu- ated the efficacy of spinal manipulation [79, 83] and seven evaluated effectiveness of spinal manipulation [78' 82,85,86, 88-90].364 management of colic in infants aged 3 to 9 weeks' The authors did not rePort on adverse events. Primary dysmenorrhea In one high quality RCT, Hon- dras et al. [37] compared the outcome of high-velocity low-amplitude manipulation targeting the lower thoracic spine, lumbar spine and sacro-iliac joints to that of a low force mimic maneuver in females aged 18-45years with primary dysmenorrhea (Table 3). The authors reported no diff\"t\"tt.\" in pain and prostaglandin levels in four subse- quent menstrual cycles' Mild adverse events (transient post-treatment soreness in the low back) were reported by u f\"* *ottt\"n in both groups. This RCT suggested that spinal manipulation is not effective for the management of primary dysmenorrhea in females aged 18-45 years' Hypertension One acceptable quality RCT [80] and one high quality RCT [81] informed the management of hypertension using spinal manipulation in adults' The first trial by Ward et al. evaluated the efficacy by com- paring a supine diversified high-velocity low-amplitude manipulation to the T1-4 region to a sham procedure in adults between the ages of 18-65 with pre-hypertension or hypertension (Table 3) t801. No differences in blood pr\"ti,tt\", arterial pressure or heart rate were found be- tlveen groups one- and 10-min post-treatment' These re- sults agree with the findings of an effectiveness trial which compared toggle recoil thrust delivered to the CI-CZ te- giorto sham manipulation in adults between the ages of 21-75y\" rtwith hypertension' In their RCT, Goertz et al' [81] no differences between groups in blood pres- sure, health-related quality of life or perceived stress im- mediately after the intervention and at 6 weeks follow-up' Adverse events included three people with headaches and one with neck and upper thoracic pain [81]' These two RCTs suggested that spinal manipulation is neither effica- cious nor effective for the management of hypertension in adults lSyears and older' Migraine An RCT of acceptable quality by compared the outcomes of full-spine Gonstead high-velocity low-amplitude manipulation to sham ma- nipulation for the management of adults with migraine headaches (Table 3). The results indicate that partici- pants who received the sham manipulations had fewer migraine days per month during the one-year follow- up compared to the group receiving SMT (calculation based on published estimates, available from the au- thors on request). There were no differences between groups in migraine duration, intensity and medicine consumption at follow-up. Minor and transient ad- verse events (local tenderness and neck pain) were at least twice as common in the SMT group (731355) as in the sham spinal manipulation gtoup (291348)' ThisPage1l of23 Childhood Balon et al' [84] compared the outcome of spinal manipulation to that of simulated spinal manipulation for the management of mild or moderate asthma in individuals aged 7-l6years (Table 3). Both treatment groups received usual medical care. No statistically significant differences in morning peak expiratory volume were found between groups at the two- and four-months follow-ups' Similarly, there were no differences in secondary outcomes at follow-up (airway re- sponsiveness, forced expiratory volume (FEV1), daytime symptoms of asthma, need for inhaled beta-agonists, use of oral corticosteroids, or quality of life)' No adverse events were reported except exacerbations of asthma symptoms. This trial found that spinal manipulation is not effectlve for the management of mild or moderate asthma in individuals aged 7-16 Years.

Results of studies of low/unocceptoble quality All studies of low or unacceptable quality reported some positive results ('l'able 5). Eight RCTs rated as low or un, acceptable quality reported at least some results supporting the efficacy [79, 83] or effectiveness of spinal manipulation 182,85,86, 88-901. These studies reported on high blood pressure [88], infantile colic [85, 89], [82, 86]. A ninth study (of unacceptable quality) reported a signifi- cant improvement in migraine for its three study groups, but all groups received some type of manual therapy [78]. Review of risk of bias and evidence tables by global summit participants The risk of bias table was approved by 98.Oo/o (49/SO) of participants (Table 2). Similarly, 98.0o/o (4915O) ofparticipants approved the content of the evidence table (Table 3). The content of the evidence sum- uraly wuri appruvetl by |00o/o (50/50) of participants for infantile colic, 94.0yo asthma, and 90.07o (45150) for migraine. Approval of the final manuscript and authorship Eighty-eight percent of Global Summit participants ap- proved the final paper and agreed to be co-authors. However, six participants declined authorship because they did not agree with the overall conclusion.

Simitarly, Goncalves et al', who reviewed evidence for spinal manipulation or chiropractic care as primary- or early secondary prevention for. disease in g\".r\"rui, failed to find any supportive evidence [42]'Ferrance and Miller, who reviewed the literature dealing with chiropractic diagnosis and management of non- musculoskeletal disorders in children broadly, including all types of studies, even case-reports, concluded that \"The efficacy of chiropractic care in the treatment of non-musculoskeletal disorders has yet to be proven or disproven\" [38]. Conversely, I(aminskyj et al' included case-reports, case-series, studies and two RCTs and concluded that \"it is obvious that some asth- matic patients may benefit from [chiropractic] treatment approach\" but added that it should not replace trad- itio\"\"t medical therapy [39]. Likewise, Pohlman and studies including commen- taries, case-reports and case-series and concluded that possibly some with otitis media may benefit lrom SMT [a0]. Rist et al. reviewed RCTs of SMT as treatment for migraine headaches and included trialsC6tE et al. Chiropractic & Manual Theropies (2021) 29:B with high risk of bias where the effect of SMT could not be disentangled from the effect of co-interventions [91]. Nonetheless, they concluded that \"SMT may be an ef, fective therapcutic tcchnique to reduce migraine days and pain intensity. However, given the methodological limitations to studies included [ ...] we consider these results to be preliminary\" [91]. Finally, Parnell Prevost et al. reviewed and critically appraised 50 studies ofvari- ous designs dealing with manual therapy for a wide var- iety of pediatric conditions and concluded that the evidence was inconclusive but favorable for some non- musculoskeletal disorders including infantile colic (4 RCTs included), (no RCTs included), sub-optimal infant breastfeeding (no RCTs included), re- spiratory, eyes, ears, nose and throat conditions (3 RCTs included) [43]. However, the review by Parnell Prevost et al. suffers from significant methodological limitations [92]. Our review adds to the lileraLule Lecause of four methodological differences between ours and some of the previous reviews. First, our research questions were different and focused on determining the efflcacy and ef- fectiveness of SMT for non-MSI( disorders. Second, we restricted our search strategy to RCTs, which was neces- sary to assess efficacy and effectiveness. Third, we used different criteria to evaluate the methodological quallty of RCTs. Finally, our evidence synthesis only included acceptable and high quality RCTs. Strengths and limitations Our systematic review has several strengths. First, our research questions focused on determining the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT for both the prevention and management of non-musculoskeletal disorders. These questions required that we focus our review on evidence from high (n = 3) and acceptable (n = 3) quality random- ized clinical trials. Second, the literature search was con- ducted by an expert librarian and independently reviewed by a second librarian to minimize errors. Third, our critical appraisal of the literature included four se- quential steps to ensure that the risk of bias assessment was conducted in a transparent, standardized, and rigor- ous manner. Fourth, the evidence synthesis included only high and acceptable quality RCTs and was con- ducted according to the SWiM Guideline and reported in transparent evidence tables [48]. The findings of our review should, nevertheless, be interpreted in light of the following limitations. First, al- though our search method was thorough, it is possible that studies of high or acceptable quality were not re- trieved because our literature search was restricted to the English language. However, it has been reported that excluding articles written in a language other than Eng- Iish does not lead to bias because most trials are pub- lished in the English literature 193-97). Furthermore,Paqe 18 of 23 3V1 authors included academics in the field with knowledge of German, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and French and none were aware of RCTs dealing with SMT pub, lished in those languages. This is supported by our search of the Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL) which only identified RCTs published in English. Sec- ond, the critical appraisal of articles may vary among re- viewers. However, our four-step approach to assessing risk of bias likely minimized this potential problem. Fi- nally, publication bias may be present in this field of re- search. However, it is unlikely that publication bias compromised the validity of our results because studies most unlikely to be published are those that failed to ob- tain a 'positive' result. Further, all the low risk of bias RCTs included in our review show that SMT is not ef- fective for the management of non,musculoskeletal disorders. Future review updates Our findings, which are based on the best current evi- dence, may need to be modified with the publication of findings from new high-quality RCTs. Therefore, we rec- ommend that our systematic review be updated every 2 to 3 years when new evidence becomes available. This is necessary to ensure that our findings are up to date with the most recent published literature. This is particularly important since our findings and conclusions are based on a limited number of high and acceptable quality tri- als, and only single trials for all but one conditions. Therefore, future trials can potentially alter our find- ings and conclusions. For example, we are aware of one ongoing RCT on the effectiveness of manipula- tion/mobilization for the management of infantile colic [98]. Once published, the quality of this trial should be evaluated, and its results integrated in an updated review. 'We recommend that governments, payers, regulators, educators and clinicians regularly adapt their policies and practices with new emerging evidence. lmplications The findings from the Global Summit call for the devel- opment and implementation of evidence-based policies regarding the use of SMT in the treatment of non-MSI( disorders at several levels, as explained below. We antici- pate that system-level polices will eventually impact clin- ical practice and change clinical behaviours. Policies should be based on the best available evidence with con- sideration of its strength and limitations, i) Implications for healthcare delivery systems and regulatory agenciesC6td et a/. Chiroproctic & Manual Theropies (2021) 29:8 Our systematic review highlights the need for health- care delivery systems and regulatory agencies to consider the lack of evidence supporting the prevention and treat- ment of non-musculoskeletal disordcrs using SMT when developing policies. ii) Implications for educational institutions ana educational regulators Educational institutions for the chiropractic, osteo- pathic and other manual medicine health professions have the opportunity to implement our findings into their curricula to train their students as modern, evidence-based clinicians' This will ensure that students' future clinical activities are consistent with the best available evidence and viable within modern healthcare systems. Implementing our findings will require signifi- cant changes in curriculum in some institutions where there is a need to communicate to students when their teaching content is not supported by valid evidence' It is of utmost importance that educational institutions edu- cate students to be competent consumers of research, thereby enabling the next generation of clinicians to dif- ferentiate high from low quality research' This should be a priority because, as we have demonstrated, sometimes very different conclusions can be drawn from high ver- sus low qualrty research. Educational regulators, who oversee the educational quality of practitioners of manual medicine, should also align their standards with best evidence and ensure consistency across educational institutions and, ultimately, of practitioners of manual medicine around the world. Ac- cording to the Council for Higher Education Accredit- ation (CHEA) International Quahry Group (CIQG) t99l this achieved by: 1) guiding institutions and orga- nizations in developing capacity for academic quality; 2) advancing understanding of international quality assur- ance; and 3) providing research and policy direction [99]. Finally, the findings from the Global Summit should be incorporated into continuing education programs and disseminated to clinicians, and professional organiza- tions should align their policies and communications with the current evidence. iii) Implications for clinical practice Our systematic review helps clinicians by providing them with necessary knowledge to deliver evidence- based care to their patients. Even though non- musculoskeletal disorders make up a small proportion of patients in chiropractic and osteopathic practice [5, 8]' implementing our findings will require changes for some clinicians in the way they communicate and practice. It is important to emphasize that patients with non-372 musculoskeletal disorders might still benefit from seeing practitioners of SMT. First, because many people with non-musculoskeletal disorders have musculoskeletal co- morbidities that significantly impact their overall health and well-being [100]. Alleviating pain and discomfort originating from the musculoskeletal system can be an important contribution to the care of people with multi- comorbidities. Second, contextual effects, associated with any clinical encounter can have important psychological and physical effects on patients. However, the best avail- able evidence suggests that it is not the SMT that is re- sponsible for the observed treatment outcomes [37' 80- 82,84,871. Importantly, clinicians need to be aware that low- and poor-quality studies can lead to deceptive results. This was the case in our review; all low-quality studies re- ported \"good\" results whereas high-quality studies all re- ported null results. Therefore, studies with poor methodological quality should not be used to inform clinical practice. iv) Implications for future research Although we found consistent evidence that SMT is not efficacious or effective for the management of non' MSI( conditions, our conclusions are based on a limited number of high and acceptable quality RCTs' Therefore, more and better RCTs should be conducted if the man- agement of non-musculoskeletal disorders with SMT is a priority for patients, clinicians and decision-makers' However, this will require that the preliminary research leading to the design and conduct of an RCT follows a sequential and logical approach, where adequate pre- trial data allows for the formulation of rational inclusion criteria, power calculations and interventions that have a clear biological target [101]. Reflections about the global summit Our research brought together an international group of researchers who used established methods to search, screen, critically appraise, and synthesize the literature. We ensured that our methods and deliberations were transparent by inviting chiropractic stakeholder organi- sations to attend and observe the Global Summit pro- ceedings. The observers are, therefore, able to testifu to the rigor and the transparency of the work conducted at the Global Summit proceedings' Including these ob- seryers in our process was important due to the consid- erable debate in the chiropractic and other manual medicine professions about the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT to prevent and treat non-MSI( disorders. The Global Summit was a unique and historic event. Never in the history of chiropractic or any manual medi- cine profession has such a large international group ofPage 19 of 23CbtA et ol. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies (2021129.8 active resealchers collaborated [o produce such a com- prehensive scientifi c report. Representatives from profes- sional organizations observed the scientific process and discussions, and they were able to interact with the sci- entists during breaks and provided all participants with the opportunity to discuss scientific, professional and political issues in an informal and friendly atmosphere. In spite of involving a large group of researchers and the complicated logistics of the Summit, we were able to strictly adhere to our pre-determined methods. It is also noteworthy that 88% of all researchers who attended the Global Summit agreed with the final conclusions of this comprehensive review. The six participants, who chose to abstain from authorship, did so because they did not agree that the overall conclusion represented the results of the review. Conclusions Our systematic review included six randomized clinical trials (534 participants) of acceptable or high quality in- vestigating the efficacy or effectiveness of SMT for the treatment of non-musculoskeletal disorders. We found no evidence of an effect of SMT for the management of non-musculoskeletal disorders including infantile colic, childhood asthma, hypertension, primary dysmenorrhea, and migraine. This finding challenges the validity of the theory that treating spinal dysfunctions with SMT has a physiological effect on organs and their function. Gov- ernments, payers, regulators, educators, and clinicians should consider this evidence when developing policies about the use and reimbursement of SMT for non- musculoskeletal disorders.

From: Ma n itoba Chi ro practo 20,2021 View this email in your browser MANITOBA CHIROPRACTORS ASSOCIATION Notice to Profession From the Office of the Registrar and President 14rlAF JOC It is with full transparency that we report that the Manitoba Government has reached out to include Manitoba Chiropractors in the provision of vaccination in the Shared Health Teams approach to dealing with the COVID-19 Pandemic Health Crisis. During our teleconference this afternoon, it was communicated directly to your President, Dr. Steven Gall, and your Registrar, Dr. Audrey Toth, that chiropractors will be included in the upcoming Ministerial Order set for the first week of February with the changes set to take place during the \"Big Push\" anticipated for March/April2021, when the vaccine supply increases. Many members have questioned why chiropractors were not included under the order which was passed during the beginning of December 2020. Some members have suggested that this was the MCA's missed opportunity or that the MCA dropped the ball by inaction. This is patently untrue. Public Health has been provided with responses to all questions and has received very detailed information regarding our education, our capabilities and our scope of practice. Shared Health has conducted a staging process that first included professions under the RHPA who had the reserved act (injectable vaccinations) within their scope. The Ministerial Order at the beginning of December was to include only those professions not under the RHPA that still had the procedure within their scope. The phase established for the beginning of February will include professions outside RHPA that do not have the reserved action within their scope. lt was suggested that the power of the order will open the reserved act to chiropractors, massage therapists, athletic therapists and dental hygienists. Members interested in contributing to the Crisis Team Model should know that participants: . Must be in Good Standing with the MCA . Must wait for the ministerial order to pass 2. Will be eligible after the order to apply for a position with Shared Health . Would serve in an employee/employer relationship with Shared Health (and would be paid hourly wage TBD) Should expect only one 8 hour shift per week Only hired employees will be considered eligible and will need to be386 a a a a a a a acertified with a Red River College micro-accreditation RRC 8 hour course (5 hours online and 3 hours practicum) paid for by Shared Health Through the employer/employee relationship, the employer would bear all liability for any actions of the employee (legal/regulatory) The employee would only be able to speak to and perform the reserved act of COVlDl g Vaccination at one of the three super sites (RBC Center/Brandon/ThomPson) The employee would be under constant oversight by the Shared Health lmmunization Leads (typicatly a nurse) The employee would be eligible to receive the COV|Dl9 vaccination, but it would be his or her choice and it would not be mandatory to receive it as a condition of employment The position will be open to graduates of doctor of chiropractic programs (CCE(|) accredited) who have not yet been licensed The position will be open to retired and/or past members of the MCA Due to the nature of the controlled chain which will be required to administer vaccinations through the Power of the Order of the Health Minister, it was clarified that it will remain outside our scope to speak to vaccinations or provide vaccinations within our private chiropractic offices. The opportunity is a temporary measure and the reserved action is only for employees during the time that they are working under the direct supervision of the lmmunization Lead. There is no mandate or requirement for the MCA to open our scope of practice documents, practice directives, position statements on vaccination or our legislation. The ability ends when the health emergency ends. lt wasa 3clarified that it will be a temporary exception and measure only during the health crisis387 It was noted that the government is extremely pleased with our role in helping Manitobans and appreciate the professional manner in which we operate both as members and as a Board. More information will follow as the this process unfolds. Please do not call Red River College or apply to Shared Health at this point in time. We will advise members when they are eligible to apply for the positions. lf you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to the MCA. We are happy to clarify.

We are watching for an obituaryto be posted, and we'll letyou know once it has been. (lf you have run across an announcement, please let me know.) Related to HPRO, you'll remember Barbara as an MPP, as the Chair of HPRAC, and in a number of regulatory roles in Ontario. The photo below was from October 20L0, when the \"Federation\" celebrated Barbara's retirement from HPRAC (Borbaro bottom, left)' 1455 Arrd I thought it was fittirrg to share the text from a letter that Barbara sent to Jo-Ann Willson who served as our Chair of our Board (AKA President) at that time. 75 October 2070 Jo-Ann Willson Chair, Federation of Health Regulatory Colleges of Ontario 730 Bloor St. W., Ste. 902 Toronto, Ontario MsS 7N5 Conoda Dear Jo-Ann, I con't tell you how touched I wos by the kindness ond generosity of the Federotion in marking my departure from the Chair's role at HPRAC. The worm words and the fine hospitolity on October 6, and the wonderful gift thot I willtreosure, meon o great deolto me. They all bore the mork of your personol thoughtfulness, ond I oppreciate thot so much.ln my time at HPRAC, I have benefited enormously by coming to know the tolented people who ore Registrars of regutoted heolth professions in Ontario, to leorn from their expertise, concerns ond aspirations. lt wos a joy to me to have o celebratory dinner where we shored some of our ambitions, successes, ond hopes. t think that we hove leorned from each other, and in the end, olong with others, have made singular strides in legislative ond regulation advonces in Ontario' At the outset of my tenure ot HpRAC, t hod a lot of personol education to do, ond that continued every doy to the end of my days ot the ogency. This was mirrored by every member of the HPRAC Council '.. people who were determined to make recommendations for sound pubtic policy. The participotion of the Colleges in every aspect of our examinations wos outstanding, olways responding with thoughtful contributions - sometimes with vehement support, sometimes with vigorous disogreement, ond sometimes with options for compromise * but always ready to be heord, with associated costs in humon ond financial terms. t applaud the interventions mode by members of the Federation, ond how HPRAC gained from these contributions. They olwoys mattered' pleose tet att the people at the Federotion know how much I apprecioted their worm wishes, ond how much I admire the work thot they do. And a personol thonk you for bringing us together in a speciol Heatth Profession Regulators of Ontario (HPRO) 301-396 Osborne St, including any ottachments, is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) ond moy contoin priiote, confidentio!, ond/or privileged informotion. Any unauthorized review, use, disclosure, or distribution is prohibited. lf you ore not the intended recipient or tiis informotion hqs been inoppropriotely forwarded to you, please contact the sender by reply emoil ond destroy oll copies of the 12, 2020 Note to Readers: In the event of any inconsistency between this document and the legislation that affects chiropractic practice, the legislation governs. Please note: this is a temporary policy to accommodate applicants for registration during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the cancellation of the Spring 2020 sitting of the Canadian Chiropractic Examining Board (CCEB) examinations and CCO's Legislation and Ethics Examination. This policy will befurther reviewed by December l, 2020. lrurerur The COVID-l9 pandemic has prevented new graduates and other applicants for registration with CCO from being able to complete the requirements for registration. Most notably, the Canadian Chiropractic Examining Board (CCEB) examinations and CCO's Legislation and Ethics Examination scheduled for Spring of 2020 were cancelled. Also, some documents used to veriff information are not available resulting in the inability for some applicants to provide anotarized copy of pictures of themselves and the inability of some applicants to provide a Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) Vulnerable Sector Check. There are compelling public interest reasons for accommodating applicants for registration who cannot attempt the examinations and cannot provide all of the documentary verification. Accommodating such applicants enables members of the public to have greater access to chiropractic services, particularly as the pandemic has reduced access to them (e.9., due to voluntary and mandatory self-isolation and practice closure orders). In addition, accommodating applicants appropriately enables them to keep their competence current at the crucial period of time between completing their education and beginning independent practice. In terms of the General class of registration, only the educational requirement is non-exemptible. While it is extremely rare to exempt the examination requirements, it is legally permissible to do so in appropriate circumstances. The intent of this policy is to assist the Registration Committee to accommodate applicants for registration during the pandemic on a principled and consistent basis. The principles underlying this policy include the following: 1. The public interest requires that anyone registered as a chiropractor in Ontario must be competent and ethical and who will practise safely and professionally.Policy P-058: Policy on Considering Applications for Registration During the COVID-19 Pandemic Version Date: August t2,2O2O 2. The COVID-l9 pandernic calls for exceptional measures to be taken to accornmodate applicants in the public interest who cannot meet all of the registration requirements because of the pandemic. 3. Exempting successful completion of the examinations, even temporarily, is a major concession that requires adequate alternative safeguards. 4. Any accommodations should be available to applicants from any jurisdiction or to graduates of any equivalent educational program. Such accommodations should not be limited to just the graduates of the two Canadian schools. 5. Any accommodations must be transparent to the public. 6. Any accommodations should be temporary. As soon as practicable, applicants who have been exempted from a requirement should have to complete them. Certificates of registration for those who attempt but are unsuccessful in completing a requirement will expire automatically. 7. While the Registration Committee strives to be consistent, nothing in the policy prevents a panel of the Registration Committee from making a different decision where the individual circumstances of the case waffant a different approach. DescrupnoN oF PoLrcY Requirements for General (Provisional) Certificate of Registration A panel of the Registration Committee may offer the following accommodations to the applicant, during the COVID-l9 pandemic only, where an applicant meets all of the other registration requirements (e.g., gtaduation from an accredited chiropractic program, graduation within the last two years, professional liability protection, payment of registration and certificate fee). Parts B and C of the CCEB examination and CCO's Legislation and Ethics Examination may be exempted with the following terms, conditions and limitations: a. The applicant has successfully passed Part A of the CCEB examinations; b. The applicant has registered for Parts B and/or C of the CCEB examinations for the Fall2020 sitting; and c. The applicant is otherwise not ineligible to register for Parts B and C of the CCEB examinations for the Fall2020 sitting. 2. The applicant shall only practise under the supervision of a member of CCO who: a. Holds a General (i.e. Active) certificate of registration; b. Has been registered in the General class of registration for at least five years from the date of application; c. Is currently actively providing direct care to patients; d. Is in good standing with CCO; e. Is not the subject of any disciplinary of incapacity proceeding or has an outstanding referral for a disciplinary or incapacity proceeding; andf. Effectively supervises the applicant's performance of patient-related activities, including the requirement that the member be physically present on the premises and available for consultation at all times during the applicant's performance of patient-related activities.497 2policy p-058: Policy on Considering Applications for Registration During the COVID-19 Pandemic Version Date: August \\2, 2O2O 3. The applicant shall use the title \"Chiropractor (Provisional)\" in all written and oral communications describing the applicant's professional or registration status. 4. When providing a professional service to a patient for the first time, the applicant shall inforrneach patient that the applicant's registration status is provisional because the applicant has not yet completed their registration examinations. The applicant shall \"*.r.. that the palient hal confirmed this disclosure in writing in the patient record (e.g., through a consent form). 5. The applicant must successfully pass the Fall sitting of CCO's Legislation and Ethics examination. and 6. The provisional certificate of registration shall expire at the earlier of being notified of an unsuicessful attempt of any component of the CCEB or eight weeks after the first available sitting of the CCEB examinations unless, atthattime, the applicant has successfully paised all components of the CCEB examinations and CCO's Legislation and Ethics Examination, at which point the applicant may be issued a General certificate of registration without these Terms Conditions or Limitations (TCLs). No additional registration or certificate fee will be owing from the applicant, if this fee has already been paid for the General (Provisional) certificate of registration. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CCO may accept altematives to additional registration requirements, such as the .\"qnir\"ment to provide anotaizedstatement as to the authenticity of photographs provided and the requirement to provide a Canadian Police Iinformation Centre Vulneiable Sictor Check. These ilternatives may be decided based on the ongoing state of the COVID-I9 pandemic and the accessibility to the services involved with these requirements. Applicants obtaining exemptions from the examinations should understand that, while these c#ificates of registiatiol ut\" technically General certificates of registration, they are in substance a different type of registration: Provisional. As such, applicants obtaining such a certificate of registration should not assume that they will be able to register as general or independent chiropractors in other Canadian jurisdictions under the Canada Free Trade Agteement. process for Application for a General (Provisional) Certificate of Registration Applicants wishing to take advantage of the accommodations described in this policy shall complete a General (provisional) application form specifically designed by the CCO for such applications. Under the Health Professions Procedural Code (Code), exemptions must be granted by the Regishation Committee. An expedited process is available where the applicant consents to TCLs proposed by the Registiar. In zuch a case, the applicant will be registered with those TCLs if a panel of the Relistration Committee upprol es. Where the Registrar indicates to the panel of the Registration 3498Policy P-058: Policy on Considering Applications for Registration During the COVID-19 pandemic Version Date: August 12,2O2O Committee that the application falls within the parameters of this policy and also indicates that the Registrar does not believe there are any special circumstances and the applicant indicates consent to the applicable TCLs, the Registration Committee will generally approve the issuance of the certificate of registration expeditiously. Where the applicant does not consent to the TCLs, or the Registrar is unable to indicate that the application falls within the parameters of this policy or where the Registrar indicates that the Registrar believes there are special circumstances, the Registrar shall refer the application to the Registration Committee under s. 15(2) of the Code for more rigorous individual consideration. The reasons for decision of the panel of the Registration Committee issuing a certificate of registration with the conditions outlined above will typically include the following points: o The exemptions provided are exceptional and are only made because of the COVID-I9 pandemic. There is a temporary, but compelling, public interest in ensuring public access to chiropractic services and in ensuring that applicants who have completed comprehensive training do not lose their competence by a pandemic-caused inability to practise or sit examinations.o The TCLs are related to examinations, courses and assessments which are necessary to protect the public by ensuring that applicants provide safe and ethical services.. The TCLs related to veri$ring information are necessary to ensure that applicants do not permanently escape the usual scrutiny of such information. Principles for Terms, Gonditions and Limitations and Supervision of the Applicant Under the General (Provisional) Certificate of Registration For the purposes of this policy, the following additional TCLs and requirements shall be applied to the Applicant under the General (Provisional) Certificate of Registration: 1. The applicant shall identiff the primary supervising member and the business address of the practice of that member in the General (Provisional) application form. The primary supervising member shall sign the applicant's General (Provisional) application form. 2' The applicant may list up to two additional members of CCO in the General (Provisional) application form who may perform the supervisory role identified in this policy for that applicant. These additional two members must meet the criteria of the supervising member in this policy and work with the primary supervising member at the indicated business address. 3. The applicant may list up to two additional business address(es) in the General (Provisional) application where the primary supervising member practises. 4. In the delivery of patient care, safe, ethical and effective care of patients and compliance with CCO regulations, standards ofpractice, policies and guidelines must always be upheld.499 4500 policy p-058: Policy on Considering Applications for Registration During the COVID-19 Pandemic Version Date: Augusl 12, 2O2O 5. In accordance with Guideline G-009: Code of Ethics, any contractual agreement regarding supervision of the applicant by the membero must have terms that are equitable an? agreiabli to all parties and maintain professional integrity and offer high quality care. 6. The primary supervising member shall make any mandatory reports to CCO or any other authorities, in accordanie with Guideline G-010: Mandatory and Permissive Reporting , and any relevant legislation. 7. At any point, the primary supervising member may end their supervisory relationship wittr itri applicant by noiifl'ing CCO. At this point, the applicant's General (Provisional) class of registration would expire, unless a secondary supervising memberor another mernber who meets the criteria of this policy immediately confirms to CCO that will serve as the new primary supervising member. Declananon I acknowledge that I have reviewed this policy and will comply with all teflns, conditions and limitations ind requirements related toihe General (Provisional) certificate of registration and will immediatety (io more than 24 hours) advise CCO of any change in the General (provisional) form.

The current situation: The COVID-19 global pandemic and related public health restrictions continue to provide a moving target with respect to our ability to conduct our examinations in person. Our in-person winter administration, scheduled to be held in Calgary and Hamilton on February O -7,2021 remains at risk of cancellation at this time. These heightened restriction levels are projected to remain in place until at least January 12t^ in Alberta and January 23d, in Ontario. We recognize that this level of uncertainty is frustrating. What we are doing: ln response to the increased and extended restrictions in both Calgary and Hamilton the CCEB is again attempting to adapt and respond. 1. We continue to seek clarity and a specific exemption from government. 2. We are waiving the administration penalty for any cancellation related to COVID- 19 received 24 hours prior to the exam administration date. 3. We have increased our remote proctoring capacity in order to provide an opportunity for those candidates who initially registered for Component A or B in person to be accommodated in a remote proctored environment. What you can do: 1. Nothing: a. Your application will remain active and we will continue to keep you informed as the situation evolves'[Type here] b. lt is possible that the in-person examination may be cancelled up to and including the day of the exam. c. You will receive your'Exam lnformation Email', with the date and time of your administration, no later than January 1s, 2021 . This also applies to candidates who previously chose remote proctoring. 2. Cancel a. Email exams@cceb.ca to request a cancellation due to covrD-1g and you will receive a full refund. b. This does not count as an attempt. 3. Move to remote proctoring (A & B only) a.

Volunteers and Stakeholders: Further to our communication dated January 6,2021, we regret to inform you that the February 6-7,2021in-person administration of CCEB examination Components A, B, and C is no longer viable due to the ongoing impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic At this time, we do not have permission to test under the current restrictions in Alberta and Ontario. The January 12,2021announcement of expanded and extended COVID- 19 related restrictions, including the proclamation of a state of emergency in Ontario, have left us with no indication that permission to administer our exams in person is forthcoming. We have no choice but to cancel the upcoming in-person exam administration in both provinces. Adherence to public health guidance along with our concerns for the safety of our candidates, staff, volunteers, site personnel, and the public at large remains of paramount importance. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic along with requisite timelines related to examination preparation, scoring, and reporting we were not able to secure a viable alternate administration date. As such, candidates impacted by this cancellation will need to reapply for the spring examination administration scheduled for May 29-30,2021' We ize that thiss extremelv no.51 1 What we are doing: 1. We continue to seek clarity and a specific exemption from government so that we may resume testing when it is safe to do so' 2. We have successfully accommodated all Component A/B candidates who elected to move to remote proctoring by the deadline, as provided in the January 6,2021 communication. 3. We will be issuing full refunds to candidates impacted by the cancellation in the coming week. What you can do: 1. No action is required on your part. Your application will be cancelled and your refund processed without any action from you.Rose BustriaITEM Bustria FW: Fair Registration Practices Data Collection for 2020 Registration a nd Council.

The same allotment of time will be provided to complete the report. This means that the deadline for submission will be pushed forward to Friday, April 2, 2021. The reason for the new time frame relates to our need to update our database sofh,vare. ln common with many of you, we are modernizing our lT infrastructure. We are digitalizing most of our system to help us become more efficient in how we collect, shlre and store information, and expect the process to take several months. The reporting requirements for 2020 data, as identified in the FRP Reporting Guidelines and instructions, will not change from previous years but there will be adjustments to format. We will provide further instructions in the new year about how to submit the information. As you know, the decisions made by modern regulators need to be driven by reliable dati. This means that the information that we gather from you is critical to the work of our agency. lt is used extensively to inform our compliance priorities, guide our research anO pbticy agenda, and to generally fulfill our oversight mandate. We sincerely appreciate the time that you take to collate and send this data to us' 1513 As some of you will be aware, the OFC will be migrating to a risk-informed comptiance framework. As we operationalize this approach, we will likely need to collect some supplementary data from you during the 2O2l calendar year to inform how we will assess forward-looking risk factors. We will make every effort, however, to target this process so that the information collection process is a simple and straightfonryard as possible. At this time, my colleagues and I at the OFC would like to wish you all a joyous holiday season lrwin General Counsel *Note Address Change Gollege of Chiropractors of Ontario 59 Hayden St., Suite 800 Toronto, ON CONFI DENTIALITY WARNING: This e-mail including any attachments may contain confidential information and is intended only for the person(s) named above.

On this basis, the OFC is adopting new digital praciices and technologie! to ficilitate its relationship with stakeholders and compliance activities. We are modernizing our current infrastructure to simplify our data-collection, information dissemination and compliance evaluation and reporting functions. These upgrades and improvements willtake time to complete. This plan involves several sequential steps. As such, you will experience some changes to our current digital products. Our website has been moved to a new platform that is integrated with the Ontario Public Services information technology infrastructure. The coni'ent of the website has not changed, with one caveat. For technical reasons, we have not transferred the Exemplary Practices database to the new site' We are currenly analysing how we can create a better environment to provide information on best practicei in registration processes. ln addition, we are building a more robust internal system to c-ollect and aggregate data to better serve our needs and those of our stakeholders. Our plan will feature a new database to collect Fair Registration Practices (FRP) information. However, this system is still under construction. As we mentioned in our communication to you on December 16,2020, we will need to adopt a temporary solution for the 2020 FRP Process. 1Once we receive your input, we will add the data to an internal form that we have created and then publish a report that you can review.The FRP questionnaire remains the same. For the current year, we will ask you to provide the required information in a Word form instead of directly into the database 515 We have included the FRP questionnaire and a set of instructions with this package The deadline for submission is April 30, 2021.

Thank you' From: Dusoruth, Za our recent annual meetings with regulators, I shared with you that the Office of the Fairness Commissioner would be introducing a risk-informed compliance framework in the new year. Over the last few months, my staff and I have spent considerable time and effort in advancing this work. As we focus on becoming a modern regulator, we have consulted with many organizations involved in regulatory activities to understand how they approach their work and to build upon best practices. We have decided to proceed with our work in two stages. The first step will involve migrating to a risk-informed compliance framework to be followed with a streamlined set of legal compliance obligations and best practices to replace our current compliance standards. Each of these projects will be underpinned by a common set of operating, modern reg ulator principles. In January, we consulted with a working group of regulators and other experts on the risk-informed compliance framework and we have integrated their comments into our proposed approach. We now wish to consult with regulators more broadly on the framework, which we plan to introduce on April 1,2021, in tandem with accompanying transitional provisions. Our approach is outlined in the attached slide presentation, which contains a number of consultation questions. We are offering regulators the opportunity to attend one of three virtual consultation sessions where we will present this framework and seek your input. These meetings will be scheduled for 90 minutes each and be convened through the Microsoft Teams platform. The available dates are Wednesday February 10th, Friday February 12th and Wednesday February 17th. Each session will start at 2:00p.m. To participate, I would ask that you select your preferred date plus an alternative date, and e-mailthis information to Zalina Dusoruth at zalina.dusoruth@ontario.ca by February 8,2021. lf you would prefer to submit your comments in writing, you may do so until February 17,2021to the attention of Shaila Salazar at shaila.salazar@ontario. ca I would ask that you consider the enclosed consultation deck as confidential and onty distribute the materials to others in your organization on a need to know basis.

This change initiative has been structured to fulfill three principal goals: 1. To enable regulators to more effectively comply with their legal obligations, and to adopt associated best practices, in order to achieve better registration outcomes for all applicants. 2. To promote the identification of targeted risk factors to enable necessary mitigation and remediation efforts. 3. To reduce unnecessary burdens on regulators and OFC staff, recognizing that all public sector organizations operate with constrained resou rces. ot Qo l$v?l 6 Office of the Fai.ness CommissionerConsultation Question : Are these outcomes the right ones for the OFC to pursue? 6 62/3/202t 545 The OFC's Proposed Modern Regulator Principles The OFC'g orooosed requlatory compliance philosophy and risk assessmeni frdmework,-will baundeipinned 11 core, modern iegulator principles. beeh culled from the OFC's own exoenence. vanous publications and discussions with subject matter exilerts and the working group.

Step 1: Assess Historical Performance: . A reoulator that has demonstrated full compliance with historical performance. indiiators will receive a \"low attention\" designation (where attention denotes the level of attention from OFC compliance staff). ' A regulator exhibiting substantial compliance will receive a \"moderately low attention\" designation..

The College of Dental 5153 DIVISIONAL COURT FILE NO.: DC-18-49s DATE:20190909 ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE DIVISIONAL COURT THORBURN, EDWARDS and FAVREAU JJ. BETIWEEN: OF DENTAL HYGIENISTS ONTARIO Robin McKechney, for the Respondent Collegee Dental Hygienists of Ontario Respondent HEARD: May 21,2019 BY THE COURT REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW tll This is an appeal from a decision of the Discipline Committee of the College of Dental Hygienists of Ontario (\"the Committee\"). I2l The Appellant's dental hygiene licence was revoked for providing dental hygiene treatment to his spouse, later wife. The Committee found that in so doing, the Appellant committed professional misconduct pursuant to section s. 51(b.1) of the Health Professions Procedural Code (the\"Code\"), being Schedule 2tothe Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991, S.O. Section 51(1Xb.1)ofthe Codeprovides that a Collegecommits an act of professional misconduct if the \"member has sexually abused a patient\". Section l(3) of the Code deftnes \"sexual abuse\" to include any sexual intercourse or other sexual relations between a hygienist and a patient. The courts have held that a finding that there was of the sexual encounter is sufficient; the patient's consent is irrelevant. l4l If a panel of the Committee concludes that a member hygienist had sexual intercourse with a patient, revocation of the member's registration is mandatory. t5] In this case, the Appellant hygienist's spouse had a fear of dental treatment and had not had dental treatment for several years when he met her. t6l The Appellant provided dental hygiene treatment to his spouse after being advised by one of his fellow dental hygienists that the College of Dental Hygienists of Ontario had approved a spousal exemption for dental hygienists. l7l While a regulation had been made by the College, the government of Ontario did not pass the regulation. There was therefore no spousal exemption in force. (A regulation was passed to allow dentists to treat their spouses.) The Appellant did not verifu the information from his colleague. t8l The Committee upheld the constitutionality of the provision and invoked the mandatory revocation of his licence to practice as a dental hygienist. In addition, his discipline history will be included on the College's public registry. t9] The Appellant seeks a declaration pursuant to s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 that s.51(1)(b.1) and s. 51(5) of the Code are unconstitutional and of no force and effect as they breach the Appellant and/or his spouse's ss. 7 and 12 Charter rights. The Appellant also seeks to set aside the Order of the Disciplinary Committee and the Committee's decision to dismiss his claim for constitutional relief, revoking his license, putting a reprimand on the registry including his name, address and a synopsis of the reprimand on the public registry, and ordering him to pay costs of his appeal in the amount of $35,000. [10] The Respondent asserts that the constitutionality of the sexual abuse provisions pertaining to health professionals has been upheld by the Court of Appeal and those provisions have been held not to contravene a spouse's s. 7 Charter rights. The Respondent acknowledges that the Committee did not deal with the s. 12 Charter challenge but submits that there is no breach of s. 12 of the Charter as the Court of Appeal in Mussani v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, (2004),74 O.R. (3d) I (C.A.) held that the mandatory revocation for breach of the sexual abuse provisions does not constitute an infringement of the s. 12 right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment or treatment. THE EVIDENCE [ 1] The Committee was provided with an Agreed Statement of Facts which contains the following information:=--j ta(.) c.) z a(\\ 2571 The Relationship Between the Parties ll2l The Appellant was a registered member of the College of Dental Hygienists of Ontario practicing in Toronto. t13l S.M. met the Appellant in late 2012 and they became friends. She told him that she had a fear of dental treatment and therefore had not sought dental care for several years. Over time, S.M. developed a trusting relationship with the Appellant and on January 22 and September 13, 2013 he performed dental hygiene treatment on her at no charge. [14] Their relationship was platonic. U5l Lr mid-2014, the Appellant and S.M. became involved in a sexual relationship and the Appellant stopped treating S.M. as he understood that he was not permitted to treat a person with whom he was in a sexual relationship. The Appellant's Knowledge of the Regulation [16] The Appellant began employnent at Dawson Dental Centre in Guelph in June 2014. In April2015, he was informed by a colleague at Dawson Dental Centre that dental hygienists were permitted to treat their spouses. The Appellant and S.M. were engaged to be married in April2015. [7] The Appellant did not independently verify the information provided to him by his colleague. [18] The College website contained a \"Proposed Spousal Exception Regulation\" which was passed by College in September 2015 but has yet to be passed by the Ontario government. (The government has passed a regulation allowing dentists to treat their spouses.) t19] The Appellant told S.M. the \"good news\": he was now permitted to provide her with dental hygiene treatment as she had not sought dental hygiene treatment since her last appointment with him in September 2013. [20] The Appellant admits that if he had read the proposed regulation, he would have understood that he was not permitted to treat S.M. The Appellant's Hygiene Treatment of S.M. l2Il The Appellant provided dental hygiene treatment to S.M. at Dawson Dental Centre on April 30, June 20, September 25 and December 2,2015 and March 24, J:une 2 and August 26, 2016.=J C z(a cc\\ 3572 l22l All the while, they were in a consensual sexual relationship. The Appellant and S.M. got married in January of 2016. The Discipline Committee Hearing l23l tn August of 2016, another member of the College of Dental Hygienists saw a Facebook post of S.M.'s dated June 2,2016 expressing her gratitude to her husband for treating her. The member submitted a complaint that the Appellant had provided dental hygiene treatment to his wife. l24l In the Hearing before the College, the Appellant challenged the constitutionality of s. 51 of the Code, arguing that it infringed the s. 7 rights of health professionals and their spouses and their s. 12 right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. On June 19,2018, the Committee dismissed the Appellant's claim for constitutional relief and ordered revocation of his licence to practice as a dental hygienist. The Committee also ordered the specific terms of the reprimand to be made against the Appellant and that it be placed on the College's public record. l25l On September 21,2018, Horkins J. stayed the decision pending determination of this appeal. THE LEGISLATION 126l The Health Professions Procedural Code, Schedule 2 of the Regulated Health Professions Act,1991, S.O. 199I, c.18 provides as follows: (1) Section 51 (1)(b.1) of the Code provides that, \"A panel shall find that a member has committed an act of professional misconduct if the ... member has sexually abused a patient\". (2) Section 1(3) of the Code defines \"sexual abuse\" as \"sexual intercourse or other forms of physical sexual relations between the member and the patient\". (3)Section 51(5) provides that if a panel finds a member has committed an act of professional misconduct by sexually abusing a patient, \"the panel shall...revoke the member's certificate of registration if the sexual abuse consisted of...sexual intercourse.\" l27l In addition, s. 23(1) of the Code provides that the Registrar shall maintain a register that contains \"each member's name, business address and business telephone number ... and a synopsis of the decision, of every disciplinary and incapacity proceeding ... and a notation of every finding of professional ... malpractice.\" [28] ln 2013, a spousal exception provision was added. Section 95(l) provides that \"Subject to the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council and with prior review of the Minister, the-:ca (e) v or CN 4573 Council may make regulations ... providing that the spousal exception in s. l(5) applies in respect of the College.\" Section 1(5) provides that \"If Council has made a regulation under clause 95 (1) (0.a), conduct, behaviour or remarks that would otherwise constitute sexual abuse of a patient by a member under the definition of \"ssxual abuse\" in subsection (3) do not constitute sexual abuse if the patient is the mernber's spouse ....\" THE ISSUES l29l The issues to be determined are: a. Is there an infringement of the Appellant or his spouse's right to liberty and or security of the person pursuant to section 7 of the Charter? b. Does the provision infringe his section 12 Charter right to be free of cruel and unusual Punishment? and c. Has there been a significant change in circumstances to warrant revisiting the case law? JURISDICTION t30l The Court has jurisdiction to hear this proceeding pursuant to s. 70(1) of the RHPA which provides that: Appeals from decisions ZO (tl A party to proceedings before the Board concerning a registration hearing oi review or to proceedings before a panel of the Discipline or Fitness to PraJtise Committee, other than a hearing of an application under subsection 72 (,I\\, may appeal from the decision of the Board or panel to the Divisional Court. Basis of appeal (2) An appeit under subsection (l) may be made on questions of law or fact or both. STANDARD OF REVIEW 13ll Section 70(3) of the RHPA provides that, (3) In an appeal under subsection (1), the Court has all the powers of the panel that dealt with the matter and, in an appeal from the Board, the Court also has all the powers of the Board. l32l As this question is whether the mandatory revocation provisions infringe s. 7 or 12 of the Charter, it is agreed that the standard of review is correctness.=:c (tz cc\\ 5ANALYSTS 57 4 The Reason for Enacting the Legislation t33] In 1993 the Ontario legislature enacted a zero-tolerance scheme for regulated health professionals who were found to be having sexual relations with their patients. Sharpe J.A' in Rosenberg v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario,2006 CanLII 37118 ONCA at para.25, summarized the provision as follows: The legislation, like the Task Force recommendations, is clear and unambiguous: when it comes to sexual relations between a doctor and a patient, there is a black letter, bright line prohibition with a drastic sanction and no exceptions or exemptions. The zero-tolerance policy precludes inquiry into any explanation or excuse for the sexual activity. A patient's consent is irrelevant. l34l This was done in order to address the problem of health professionals exploiting their positions to sexually abuse patients. The legislation included a provision which requires the revocation of the health professional's licence if the sexual abuse of a patient includes intercourse and other specified acts (s. 51(5)). t35l ln2013, s. 1(5) of the Code was amended to provide for a spousal exception if agreed to by the College and passed by the government. Section 95 (1)(0.a) provides that, in order for the spousal exception to come into force, the council of a college must pass a regulation, which is then reviewed by the Minister of Health and must be approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. t36] In September 2015, the College voted in favour of a spousal exception, however it has yet to be approved by the Lieutenant Governor. As such, there is as yet, no spousal exception' THE FIRST ISSUE: Does the mandatorv revocation provision in the Code breach the section 7 Cltrarter rieht to securitv of the nerson and/or libertv of the Apnellant or his spouse? l37l Section 7 of the Charter provides that, \"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\" t38l It is agreed that: a. The Appellant was in a health-care patient relationship with his spouse while he was treating her; b. He performed dental hygiene treatment while in a consensual sexual relationship with his spouse;Jcc (: (-) U}z ct aN 7575 c. The College voted in favour of a spousal exception but it has not been passed by the government and there is therefore no spousal exception in force for dental hygienists; d. The Appellant was advised by a colleague that he could treat his spouse but conducted no due diligence to confirm that information with the College and that information was incorrect; and e. The Appellant treated S.M. because she had a fear of dental hygiene treatment and had not been treated for years before agreeing to allow the Appellant to treat her. [39] The purpose of the law is to separate personal sexual relations and professional relationships in order to protect patients from health professionals who seek to abuse their positions of power. Does the Charter Apply to this Appellant? [40] The Court of Appeal held in Mussani at paras 4I-43 that, \"the weight of authority is that there is no constitutional right to practice a profession unfettered by the applicable rules and standards which regulate that profession. ... I am satisfied therefore, that the mandatory revocation of a health professional's certificate of registration in substance infringes an economic interest of the sort that is not protected by the Charter.\" [41] The Appellant has no constitutionally protected right to engage in sexual relations with any patient nor does he have a right to practice as a dental hygienist. The fact that there are professional consequences resulting from his decision to combine a sexual and health care relationship does not engage a liberty or security interest on the part of the Appellant. Moreover, s. 7 of the Charter does not protect economic interests: See R. v. Schmidt 2014 ONCA 188 at paras 37-38. l42l As such, there is no s. 7 Charter right at issue in the case of the Appellant. Is the Legislation Overbroad? t43] Assuming there is a s. 7 Charter right, the Appellant argues that the provision meant to protect patients from health practitioners' abusing their power is overly broad, forcing some healthcare workers and their spouses to choose between two aspects of their liberty interest. l44l The Appellant also argues that the s. 7 Charter -'ight to security of the person is engaged because the law prevents access to health care that would otherwise be available. The Discipline Committee's decision may force spouses to choose between who can treat them and who they want to marry. A person in a rural area for example, where health care services are sparse,-:c az aN 8576 would be forced to move to a more populous area to receive treatment from a health care provider other than hisftrer spouse, or be barred from romantically engaging with the health care provider. The Appellant argues that these choicss go to the core of one's autonomy and therefore the impugned provisions' interference with these choices, infringes s.7 Charter rights. t45] The Appellant argues that in a case like this, S.M. is more vulnerable than others as there are fewer health care providers to choose from, given her grave fear of dental hygiene treatment' The Appellant claims that the impugned provision is therefore overbroad, infringing his right and that of his spouse to liberty and security of the person. The Appellant cites the case of .R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] I S.C.R.30. 146l The Morgentaler case is, however, distinguishable from this case as the Morgentaler case involved direct state intrusion into the bodily integrity of a woman seeking an abortion. The provision in the Criminal Code in Morgentaler created significant delays in obtaining an abortion or made it impossible to obtain an abortion at all. There is no such evidence in this case. l47l In Mussani, the court held that a consensual sexual relationship concurrent with a doctor- patient relationship (between two individuals who were not spouses) is subject to mandatory revocation of the health care provider's licence and that mandatory revocation is not overly broad even where the sexual relationship is consensual. The court recognized that there are admitted problems with a zero-tolerance penalty regime: They are rigid. They can lead to results in individual cases that are harsh, extreme, and even arguably unjust...However, the Mandatory Revocation Provisions were enacted in response to a recognized and growing problem of sexual abuse in the medical profession. Indeed, they were enacted specifically to rectify a situation where discretionary sanctioning on the part of professional disciplinary committees and the courts had been found to be wanting. They must be considered in the context of a general power imbalance between a doctor and patient that can lead to easy exploitation of the relationship by the doctor at the risk of considerable harm to a vulnerable patient. t4Sl However, the court concluded that: [79] The fact Ihat an intimate sexual relationship which began during treatment may blossom into a truly loving one but still lead to revocation of a health professional's certificate of registration, does not necessarily make the Mandatory Revocation Provisions unconstitutionally broad, in the sense that they overshoot the legislative objectives. The health professional need only terminate the treatment relationship to avoid the problem. The issue is whether the means chosen by the legislature -- mandatory revocation of the certificate of registration -- are overly broad in relation to the pu{pose of the legislation [See Note 15 at the end of the document]. If they are not, the legislature has the right to make difficult: Cc u)z (t cc\\ 9577 policy decisions that may, in rare cases, override what might otherwise be considered permissible conduct. I do not read R. v.Heywood as mandating a contrary decision. The Supreme Court merely decided that the impugned legislation in that case went too far. [80]Here- the meanschosen to meet the lesislative obiectives -- i.e.. the revocation of the health nrofessional's certificate of resistration in the case of the frank sexual acts listed in s. 51(5) para. 2 of the Code -- do not go too far. in my opinion. They are not overly broad. Mandatory revocation in such circumstances (a) sienals the seriousness with which the sexual abuse of natientsto be taken. ft) underscores the eravitv of the breach of trust involved. (c) emphasizes the considerable impact of the practitioner's failure to meet his or her responsibility towards maintaining the integrity of the profession. and (d) responds to the need to protect the public from the risk of recidivism by removing the practitioner from the practice for a minimum period of time. The importance of responding to these objectives is not contested. fEmphasis added.] l49l In so doing, the court in Mussani held that even in cases where there is no exploitation and where the sexual encounters are consensual, mandatory revocation is warranted to meet the broader policy objectives of the legislation. There is therefore no violation of a Charter s. 7 liberty or security interest: See Mussani at parus. 58-60. The Court of Appeal has determined that, \"[T]he importance of upholding the zero-tolerance policy outweighs its pitfalls because the legislation is there to address a growing problem of sexual abuse of patients by some health care professionals.\" See Leering v. College of Chiropractors of Ontario (2010), 98 O.R. (3d) 561 ONCA. Conclusion t50l It is up to the legislature to make policy choices: See R. v. Heywood,lI994l3 SCR 761 at793 (para. 51). [51] There is no constitutionally protected right to practice a profession: See Mussani l52l Even if there were, the s. 7 liberty interest does not extend to protecting a practitioner's right to have a sexual relationship with a person he chooses to see as a patient or a patient's right to be treated by one health practitioner specifically. The courts have held that marrying a health care professional and seeking to be treated only by that health care professional is a choice; prejudice is confined to personal hardship, and the choice is not one of the \"basic choices going to the core of what it means to enjoy individual dignity and independence protected by s. 7.\" See Blencoe v. B.C. (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44 atpara 49. [53] While we recognize that this situation has created hardship for the Appellant and his spouse and may seem unfair, there is an important societal objective for the enactment of theJc z C c 1_0578 mandatory revocation provision in the Code. State action often imposes restrictions and a degree of hardship on individuals outside the strict purview of the purpose of the legislation. The courts have held that this provision is not overly broad. [54] For these reasons, while we recognize that this decision is harsh for a person in the Appellant's circumstances, we conclude that the mandatory revocation of licence provision of the Code does not breach s. 7 of the Charter. THE SECOND ISSUE: Does the mandatorv revocation provision in the Code and/or the nublic notation of a healthcare's discipline historv on the registrv constitute cruel and unusual treatment within the meanins of s. 12 of the Cftarfer? [55] Section 12 of the Charter provides that, 'oEveryone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\" t56l The Discipline Committee failed to address whether the impugned provision constitutes cruel and unusual treatment contrary to the Appellant's s. 12 Charter ights.It is conceded that the provision does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment as it did not create penal consequences. As such, the only issue is whether mandatory revocation of the licence and or the registry constitute cruel and unusual treatment. What is the Treatment at Issue? l57l The \"treatment\" in this case includes the mandatory revocation of the Appellant's licence, \"imposed by the State in the context of enforcing a State administrative structure\", and the public registry that contains \"each member's name, business address and business telephone number ...and a synopsis of the decision, of every disciplinary and incapacityproceeding ... and a notation of every finding of professional ... malpractice.\" [58] The Appellant submits that the mandatory revocation of his licence and the requirement to have his name and address, his revocation, and a synopsis of the reasons for the reprimand listed on a public website is grossly disproportionate because a dental hygienist who provides treatment to his spouse should not be subject to any discipline, the legislation was never intended to capture spouses, the College itself has voted to create a spousal exception, dentists who treat their spouses are not subject to any discipline, and there is no ability for the College to exercise discretion in imposing this treatment. He therefore submits that it constitutes cruel and unusual treatment. Huve the Courts Dealt with this Issue? [59] The court in Mussani at para 94 held that, \"the Mandatory Revocation Provisions do not constitute 'punishment' or 'treatmento as those words have been interpreted and applied in the context of section t2.\" The Court went on to say that,J C c) z (t N Lts79 Further, if they do, the punishment or treatment is not cruel and unusual; it is neither so excessive as to outrage the standards of decency, nor grossly disproportionate to what is appropriate in the circumstances. [60] The Court in Sliwin v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario,2017 ONSC 1947, para. 135, further held that \"once it is accepted that there is no obligation to inquire into whether the sex and relationship pre-existed the doctor patient relationship, there is no reasonable basis to contend that the penalty of mandatory revocation is unfit much less grossly disproportionate.o' [61] As such, the mandatory revocation per se does not constitute cruel or unusual punishment or treatment. The courts in Mussani and Sliwin did not however, address the requirement that a health college's registry must set out the names and addresses and a synopsis of the reprimand, which would include any findings that the practitioner \"sexually abused\" a patient. How to Determine whether Treatment is Cruel and Unusual within the meaning of the Charter 162l The issue of whether the combined effect of the mandatory revocation of a licence to practice and the content of the public registry contravenes s. 12 of the Charter must therefore be addressed. t63] The Code provides that the information on the registry \"shall be posted on the College's website in a manner that is accessible to the public or in any other manner and form specified by the Minister.\" It is not restricted to members of the College but is available to any member of the public who chooses to look at the site. 164] Treatment is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"the manner in which someone behaves towards or deals with someone or something.'o The Court of Appeal in Ogamien v. Ontario (Community Safety and Correctional Services),20l7 ONCA 667 atpara. 10, articulated a two-step process in determining whether treatment is cruel and unusual: first, what treatment would have been appropriate i.e. what is the benchmark, and second, how this treatment measures up against the benchmark. [65] The Appellant submits that his treatment exceeds the benchmark for similarly situated professionals for the following reasons: a. The registry is public and can be seen by any member of the public whether or not they are familiar with the definition of \"sexual abuser\" used by the College; b. The definition of a \"sexual abuser\" as set out in the Code and as interpreted in the above case law differs significantly from the general understanding in common parlance and the legal definition in the criminal law of what:: J C ff) z a t2580 constitutes sexual abuse. The difference is that sexual abuse is generally considered to be sexual behaviour that is engaged in without the consent of the other party; c. The College's registry will contain a public record that he lost his licence to practice due to his contravention of the 'osexual abuse\" provision within the meaning of the legislation, when it is agreed there was no sexual abuse of his spouse. On the contrary, she expressed her gratitude to her husband for helping her to overcome her fear of dental hygiene treatment; d. There is no other case of any dental hygienist anywhere in Canada who has been found guilty of sexual abuse for treating his wife; e. Dentists in Ontario are expressly permitted to treat their spouses and would therefore not have any discipline history on their College's registry for the very same behaviour; f. In F.J.D. v. 7.8., 2015 CanLII 16031 at paras 34-44, the only other case before the Ontario College of Dental Hygienists, a female dental hygienist provided treatment to her husband. A complaint was submitted to the ICRC. In that case, unlike the case before us, the ICRC decided not even to refer the matter to discipline because there was a pre-existing spousal relationship and that, [T]reating spouses was an established and accepted practice in the dental hygiene profession and the power imbalance and vulnerability that accompanies other health relationships is less pronounced than in the dental hygiene and client relationship, at least where there is a well-established spousal relationship that pre-exists the professional relationship. g. The HPARB has recognizedthat the power imbalance and vulnerability that accompanies other health relationships like the dentist-patient, doctor-patient relationships, is less pronounced in the dental hygiene group; and h. The Appellant's motivation for treating his wife was her fear of dental hygiene treatment. She had not been treated for several years before allowing the Appellant to treat her. Far from exploiting her vulnerability his wife's Facebook post expressed her gratitude to her husband. This matter was only discovered after a fellow hygienist saw his wife's grateful Facebook post and decided to report him to the College.=coo Q z 1_358f [66] The Code defines \"sexual intercourse ... touching ... or ... behaviour or remarks towards the patient\". While the courts in Mussani, Rosenberg and, Leering have concluded that a patient's consent to such sexual behaviour is irrelevanto consent is not specifically discussed in the legislation. The stated purpose of the provisions is to \"encourage the reporting of such abuse, to provide funding for therapy and counselling for patients who have been sexually abused by member and ultimately, to eradicate the sexual abuse of patients by members\", 167l The Respondent cites the Ontario the Court of Appeal in Hanif v. Ontario Cottege qf Pharmacists, 2075 ONCA 640, in support of its position that the mandatory revocation and or mandatory public notation on the registry does not constitute cruel and unusual treatment. In Hanif the Court of Appeal held that: [13] First, the impugned Codeprovisions do not have the effectofregulating morality. The intended, and in fact overwhelming, effect of the provisions is to protect the public. Legislation that declares that any sexual activity, even consensual, between a health professional and a patient is inconsistent with the professional-patient relationship does not make a statement about morality; ratherit speaks to the maintenance of the integrity of the professional-patient relationship. [14] Second, the Code provisions do not have the effect of criminalizing activities that fall outside the delivery of health services. They do not have the effect of importing notions of sexual morality on consenting adults. Rather, they require a health professional to make a simple choice: treat the patient or sever the professional-patient relationship and engage in a sexual relationship. Treating a patient while involved in a sexual relationship undermines the integrity of the professional-patient relationship. U5l Third, all offences - federal, provincial, criminal, regulatory - involve a degree of stigma. If you break the law, you may lose respect in the public eye. When the appellant says that a contravention of the Codein the domain of sexualactivity between health professionals and patients can lead to both loss of livelihood and social stigma, he is right. But to say that this combination removes the law from regulation of the health professions and places it in criminal law is a bridge too far. Breach of a provincial law can in some cases bring with it a potential social stigma in the public eye. [68] There is no specific reference in that case to the disciplinary history being made public through the registry. [69] The court in Nova Scotia (Minister of Community Services) v. D.J.M.,2002 NSSC 75, has addressed the effect of sex abuse registration. The court held that the child abuse registry in that case that was less readily accessible to the public than the Discipline Committee's decision constituted a stigma which infringed upon the security of the person:=Jc a: (,z C'-aN t4582 l25l It is clear to me that the right to security of the person is affected by having one's name placed on the Child Abuse Register. That being the case, the deprivation of a person's right to security of the person can only occur when it is done in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. [70] However, in the case before us, unlike the Nova Scotia case, while there is a requirement that the Appellant's name and address be placed on the College registry which records the names and addresses of those whose licence has been revoked and the reasons therefore, the Discipline Committee in this case set out the terms of the permanent reprimand that are to appear on the registry atparagraph 34 of its decision as follows: One of the rules that the Ontario legislature has enacted for health professionals is that they cannot have a concurrent sexual relationship with a patient they are treating. This policy of zero tolerance is backed up by mandatory revocation of the certificate of registration of the health professional. It is not discretionary. In your circumstances, where you were involved in a consensual relationship, it appears a harsh penalty. In the societal interest of preventing sexual abuse, this penalty can be avoided by dental hygienists, like other health professionals, by ensuring that they comply with the rule of not engaging in a sexual relationship with a client/patient. While we are sympathetic to your personal situation, our hands are tied by a strong legal rule designed to protect patients. You have paid a heavy price for breaking the rule. We sincerely hope to see you again as an active member of the dental hygiene profession. ITll The Committee was alive to the stigma attached to the words \"sexual abuse'o and the fact that this case is an anomaly as it involves a preexisting loving relationship between spouses, and not a case of a healthcare worker abusing his spouse. On the contrary, the Appellant was seeking to help her overcome a vulnerability. 172] As such, the words \"sexual abuse\" will not appear on the description of the appellant's discipline history and the above provision will be included as part of the information available to the public. Readers will only know that the Appellant's status is revoked, and they will have access to the full decision and the terms of the reprimand, which make clear that the sexual relations were with his spouse and were consensual. l73l In sum, Mussani establishes that in order to constitute cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of section 12 of the Charter, the facts of the case must warrant a finding of gross disproportionality. Given the manner in which the Appellant's disciplinary history will be presented on the Registry, we do not find a gross disproportionality in this case. l74l It is clear that the Appellant poses no danger to the public. On the contrary: it was the Appellant's wife's very vulnerability and fear of dental hygiene treatment and his desire to help her, that lead him to treat her.=J Ca az N 1_5583 l75l We appreciate that the requirement that the Appellant's name and address be included on the public registry and that he contravened the \"sexual abuser\" provision creates stigma. 176l However, there is no Charter right to practice a profession, and the mandatory revocation provision alone does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment or treatment within the meaning of s. 12 of the Charter. Requiring the Appellant's name address and the above particulars to appear on the public registry does not create an infringement of s. 12 of the Charter given the information provided on the registry and the terms of the reprimand to be provided as set out above. THE THIRD ISSUE: Are there circumstances in this case that warrant revisitins the decisions in Mussani and,S/iwn ? l77l The Appellant argues that the Discipline Committee failed to recognize that there has been a significant change in circumstances since the decisions in Mussani and Sliwin were rendered. [78] The change is the enactment in 2013 of a legislative provision to enable Colleges to provide for a spousal exception from the sexual abuse provisions. If the option is exercised by a particular healthcare College, it must then be approved by the government. When that is done, as it was in the case of dentists in Ontario, the health practitioner is permitted to treat his or her spouse. l79l The decisions in Mussani and Sliwin were decided before the 2013 legislative provision in respect of a spousal exception was enacted. Moreover, neither case involved a situation where the healthcare professional had a pre-existing spousal relationship. The court in Mussani specifically noted at para. 101 that, While the spousal hypotheticals appear troubling at first blush, I agree with the conclusion of Then J.: \"It is far-fetched to characteize the intimate relationship between spouses as 'sexual abuse' merely because a physician naay have treated his or her spouse. ... The fact that during the course of a marriage a physician may provide incidental medical care to his or her spouse is unlikely, in my view, to establish a physicianlpatient relationship which would attract the discipline procedures ofthe Code. [80] Similarly, in Rosenberg (supra) atparagraph 48, Sharpe J.A. for the Court held that, This court recognized that it is \"unlikely\" that a physician could be guilty of sexual abuse of a spouse. . . . [81] Moreover, the Appellant correctly notes that the enactment of the legislative option is evidence of the awareness of legislators of the issue and the potential problems that it raises for healthcare providers and their spouses.--- c(c lt) z OD C){\\ T6584 tS2] However, although the courts recognized that for obvious reasons it was unlikely that a healthcare provider would be found to have contravened the provisions, the legislature left open the possibility of an exception for spouses, and the College recommended such an exception for spouses, therc is as yet no spousal exception for dental hygienists. The government, for reasons unknown to us, chose to pass a regulation enabling dentists to treat their spouses but not dental hygienists. As such, while the legislators have left open the possibility to create an exemption for spouses and the College has endorsed such a change, there is as yet no change in circumstances as the government has not yet passed the regulation. tS3] In this case, the Appellant concedes that he and his spouse had a concurrent professional- patient relationship and a sexual relationship. The disciplinary offense of sexual abuse is therefore made out as defined in the Code. There has been no passage of a regulation by the government allowing a spousal exemption nor was there only \"incidental medical care\". As such, the mandatory revocation provision must be upheld. t84l In Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, [2013] 3 SCR 1101 at para. 44, the Supreme Court held that while there may be circumstances in which trial judges may review the law, the threshold for so doing is \"not an easy one to reach\". In our view, given the summary to be included on the registry and the fact that the law was not changed, this is not such a case. CONCLUSION t85l There is no constitutional right to practice a profession unfettered by the rules applicable to that profession. The rules in question are set out in the Code. [36] In 1993, the Ontario legislature enacted a zero-tolerance provision to prevent any concurrent sexual and patient-healthcare relationships. Legislators were seeking to recognize and address serious concerns about sexual abuse ofpatients. t87l In2013, the legislature passed a provision allowing each College to pass a regulation to create a spousal exemption, but such exemption only becomes effective upon approval by the Lieutenant Govemor in Council. The College of Dental Hygienists passed such a regulation, but to date it has not been approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council and passed tS8] After the College voted to pass a regulation to create a spousal exemption but in the absence of the regulation being passed by the government, the Appellant provided professional dental hygienist services on his wife at his office. There was a patient-hygienist relationship concurrent with the Appellant's spousal relationship. tS9] The Appellant acted in the honest but mistaken belief that he was allowed to treat his wife who had a phobia of dental hygiene treatment. She was vulnerable. He acted out of a desire to help her and she expressed her gratitude to him.:c O () z (t c -!! L7585 [90] We note that although there is also a requirement that the Appellant's name and address be placed on the College registry, at paragraph 34 of its decision, the Committee has set out the terms of the notation that is to appear on the registry: One of the rules that the Ontario legislature has enacted for health professionals is that they cannot have a concurrent sexual relationship with a patient they are treating. This policy of zero tolerance is backed up by mandatory revocation of the certificate of registration of the health professional. It is not discretionary. In your circumstances, where you were involved in a consensual relationship, it appears a harsh penalty. In the societal interest of preventing sexual abuse, this penalty can be avoided by dental hygienists, like other health professionals, by ensuring that they comply with the rule of not engaging in a sexual relationship with a clientipatient. While we are sympathetic to your personal situation, our hands are tied by a strong legal rule designed to protect patients. You have paid a heavy price for breaking the rule. We sincerely hope to see you again as an active member of the dental hygiene profession. [91] The words \"sexual abuse/abuser\" do not appear on the registry page and the s5mopsis of the terms of the reprimand only include the above text. As such, readers will only know that the Appellant's status is revoked, the detail set out in the above synopsis, and the decisions. [92] We recognize that this case has created serious hardship for the Appellant and his wife. He has: a.lost his livelihood and income for five years; and b. The College's registry will contain a public record that he lost his licence to practice due to his contravention of the \"sexual abuse\" provision within the meaning of the legislation, when it is agreed there was no sexual abuse of his spouse. On the contrary, she expressed her gratitude to her husband for helping her to overcome her fear of dental hygiene treatment. t93] We also recognize that it seems unfair that dentists may treat their spousos while dental hygienists lose their licence and are branded sexual abusers for so doing. l94l Finally, we recognize that it may seem an artificial difference to claim that treatment was \"incidental\" if it was done at home rather than the office. This Appellant, had he not honestly believed that he was allowed to treat his spouse, could easily have treated her at home without pay so as not to incur these repercussions. [95] It is indeed unfortunate that the Inquiries, Complaints and Reports Committee (ICRC) of the College elected to proceed with the complaint, notwithstanding the statement by Sharpe J.A. in Rosenberg that,::c () C,\\ z N 18586 [I]t is unlikely that a physician-patient relationship will be established between a physician and his or her spouse, and Blair J.A.'s statement in Mussani atpara. l0l that, While the spousal hypotheticals appear troubling at first blush, I agree with the conclusion of Then J.: \"It is far-fetched to characterize the intimate relationship between spouses as 'sexual abuse' merely because a physician may have treated his or her spouse. [96] In fact, in its own decision, as reflected in F.J.D. v. 7.E., 2015 CanLII 1603 I at parus 34- 44, wherc a female dental hygienist provided treatment to her husband, the ICRC decided not even to refer the matter to discipline because there was a pre-existing spousal relationship and that, [T]reating spouses was an established and accepted practice in the dental hygiene profession and the power imbalance and vulnerability that accompanies other health relationships is less pronounced than in the dental hygiene and client relationship, at least where there is a well-established spousal relationship that pre-exists the professional relationship. l97l However, unless and until the Ontario government approves the regulation put forward by the College of Dental Hygienists to enact a spousal exemption, the mandatory revocation and ancillary relief imposed by the Discipline Committee as they pertain to spouses must be upheld. [9S] For these reasons, the mandatory revocation provision per se does not breach either ss. 7 or 12 of the Charter. [99] For these reasons, the Appeal is dismissed. [00] Under the circumstances, there is no order as to costs. THORBURN J.:: C Qz cc\\l FILE NO.: DC-18-495 DATE:20190909 ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE DIVISIONAL COURT Edwards and Favreau JJ.

The ICRC found that the applicant failed to ensure proper policies were in place at his pharmacy, that he implemented an unsafe return-to-stock protocol following an incident in which an employee of the pharmacy dispensed the wrong medicine to a pediatric patient, and that the applicant's conduct warranted the imposition of an oral caution and remedial course. The applicant tikes the position that he was denied procedural fairness and that each one of the ICRC's findings, individually and collectively, renders the Decision unreasonable. Background l2l The applicant, Mina Geris, has been a licensed pharmacist in Canada since 2013. Until this incident, he had not been the subject of any prior investigation or complaint. The applicant began working full time at the relevant Pharmacy, in the position of \"designated manager\", on October 4,2017. This was nine days prior to the incident that ultimately lead to these proceedings. t3] On October 13,2017, a pharmacist at the Pharmacy dispensed prednisolone to a pediatric patient which improperly contained risperidone. It was later determined that a pharmacy assistant had added 41 mL of prednisolone to an amber bottle already containing 15 mL prednisolone label over a label from the previous August which indicated that the bottle contained risperidone. The pharmacy assistant was working under the supervision of the dispensing pharmacist (not the applicant). The dispensing pharmacist did not notice the error and dispensed the bottle. As a result of this dispensing error, the patient was taken to hospital with serious symptoms and was required to spend the night there. l4l The applicant was not present at the Pharmacy when the dispensing enor occurred. Upon learning of the incident, the applicant immediately made sure that the pharmacist on duty contacted the family and properly documented the incident. When he next came to the Pharmacy, the applicant sought to understand how the error had occurred and implemented several new protocols. He also spoke with the family and apologized for the error on behalf of the pharmacy. t5] Although the incident was brought to the attention of the College, there was no formal complaint. Rather it was processed as what is known as a Registrar's Investigation. The College first investigated the dispensing pharmacist.l The panel of the ICRC which considered the Registrar's Investigation Report into the dispensing pharmacist had concerns about the role of the designated manager - the applicant - and brought those concerns to the attention of the Registrar. t6l The Registrar then appointed investigators to examine the conduct of the applicant. The completed Registrar's Investigation Report was disclosed to the applicant on March 6,2020, the same day it was prepared. The Registrar offered the applicant an opportunity to respond to the Investigation Report. The applicant provided his response, through counsel, on March 18,2020. The ICRC deliberated on the applicant's matter on April 16,2020, and its Decision and Reasons were released on May 22,2020. The ICRC Reasons l7l The ICRC's reasons begin with a statement of the ICRC's purpose - to review a report of the Registrar about the applicant \"with respect to his responsibilities as the Designated Manager of a pharmacy, including the training of staff and establishing processes for the operation of a pharmacy to ensure that the patient receives the correct medications.\" t8] The ICRC also noted that it had the authority, after considering the Registrar's report: a) to refer the applicant to discipiine for professionai misconduct or incompetence; b) to refer the applicant to incapacity proceedings; and/or, c) to require the applicant to appear before the ICRC to be \"cautioned\" under s. 58 of the Health Professions Procedural Code and to require the applicant to complete a specific continuing education or remedial program. I That panel of the ICRC concluded that the dispensing pharmacist would not receive an oral caution but would receive \"advice and recommendations\".Page: 3600 t9] The ICRC reviewed the background circumstances around which, with one exception dealt with below, there was no material dispute. The ICRC also reviewed the applicant's submission, to the effect that the applicant: o instituted a new protocol and advised his staffthat when unused medication is being returnedo it must be poured into the oomother bottle\" immediately, and if there is no mother bottle, it must be discarded immediately. o instructed staff that a vial already containing medication must never be \"topped up\"; the vial and the medication inside must be discarded. o instituted a protocol that the pharmacist on duty is responsible for filling the vial during normal working hours. The pharmacy assistant is responsible for inputting the prescription into the system and bringing the pharmacist the mother bottle and the vial; the pharmacist then measures the dosage and fills the vial while the assistant observes. If the pharmacy is very busy, the assistant will sometimes fill the vial, but only under the direct supervision of the pharmacist, who first ensures that the vial is completely empty and ensures that the assistant fills the vial from the proper mother bottle' t10] The ICRC noted that pediatric patients are \"red flag\" patients and liquid medications are \"red flag\" medications. t11] The ICRC expressed serious concerns that a medication bottle containing risperidone, with i blacked out name on the label, and without an expiry date, DIN and LOT number, was put back on the pharmacy shelves to be used, and was used, for further dispensing. ll2l The ICRC was also concerned that the pharmacy's return to stock procedure, as instituted Uy itt\" applicant, \"will create the risk of contaminating entire stock bottles'', emphasizing that a liquid midication should never be added back into a stock bottle. The ICRC was of the opinion that, without a robust return to stock policy, the likelihood of a recurence of this type of error remained high, particularly for liquid medications, which are difficult for the dispensing pharmacist to check visually. tl3l While acknowledging that the applicant was new to his role as designated manager, the iCnC stated that the error should not have occurred. The ICRC concluded that the applicant, in his role as designated manager, did not ensure that the pharmacy had robust policies in place related to safe medication practices, particularly regarding return to stock practices. Further, the applicant did not ensure pharmacy staff were adhering to processes that would ensure the patient received the correct medication. tl4] Having reached these conclusionso the ICRC decided that the issuance of an \"oral caution\" and attendance at and successful completion of a workshop on \"root cause analysis\" was the appropriate course ofaction. The oral caution was administered and the applicant has, I understand, successfully completed the workshop on root cause analysis.Page:4 601 Analvsis Standard of Review [15] The parties agree on the standard of review. Regarding procedural fairness, the standard is whether the requisite procedural fairness was afforded to the applicant. The standard of review of the Decision of the ICRC is reasonableness, as formulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Minister of Citizenship) v. Vavilov,2019 SCC 65. In connection with judicial review of the Decision itself, therefore, the burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable. Before a decision can be set aside on this basis, the reviewing court must be satisfied that there are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility, and transparency. Any alleged flaws or shortcomings must be more than merely superficial or peripheral to the merits of the decision. It would be improper for a reviewing court to overturn an administrative decision simply because its reasoning exhibits a minor misstep. Instead, the court must be satisfied that any shortcomings or flaws relied on by the party challenging the decision are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable: Vavilov, para. 100. Procedural Fairness [16] The applicant submits that the ICRC denied him procedural fairness in three ways: l) its investigation was wholly inadequate; 2) it prejudicially delayed the matter and breached the timelines prescribed under the Code; and, 3) it failed to notiff the applicant that his post-incident retum-to-stock protocols were under investigation and failed to provide him with an opportunity to clarifu the details of the procedureo and thus to make full answer and defence. [17] [n connection with the allegation of inadequate investigation, the mechanism of how the dispensing enor occured was ascertained very early on. There was no dispute over how the error occurred. The only issue in doubt was whether the bottle of risperidone was placed on the storage shelf the day before the dispensing error or a several weeks prior (before the applicant was designated manager of the Pharmacy). The applicant says he was denied procedural fairness because the pharmacy assistant was not interviewed to resolve this uncertainty. I cannot agree. U 8] When the applicant assumed the role of designated manager at the Pharmacy, he submitted a form to the College acknowledging the following: The DM is accountable for the following pharmacy functions:. Professional Supervision of the Pharmacy . Facilities, Equipment, Supplies and Drug Information . Record Keeping and Documentation . Medication Procurement and Inventory Management . Training and Orientation . Safe Medication Practices Before accepting the role of DM, it is important for the pharmacist to review the roles and responsibilities expected of this position. The DM must be familiar withPage: 5 the legislation and operational requirements for the profession and the business as well as the policies and procedures that are in place at the pharmacy. t19l Thus, the applicant certified an acknowledgement of his duty to be aware of the policies and procedures when he assumed the role of designated manager. While the return to stock of the risperidone bottle may have taken place before the applicant was designated manager, the use of thii medication in filling a prescription, and the dispensing of the contaminated medicine, took place after the applicant had become designated manager. The concerns of the Registrar and the iCnC were withpolicies and procedures in place when and after the applicant took on the role of designated rnanag\"r. Whether the return to stock of the risperidone took place before or after October 4,2017 was not the issue. I cannot accept that the fact that the College did not interview the pharmacy assistant resulted in any denial of procedural fairness. It is clear that interviewing the pharmacy assistant would not have affected the outcome. l20l Regarding the allegation of delay, it must be noted that the applicant did not raise any issue of Oetay before the ICRC or assert, then or now, any specific facts that would establish prejudice by reason of delay. l2ll There is a perfectly good explanation for the o'delay\", in any event. The College completed its investigation oi the dispensing pharmacist first. It was only in the course of its review of the dispensing pharmacist that this prior panel of the ICRC raised concerns about the applicant's role as designated manager and reported those concerns to the Registrar. l22l Further, the evidence is that the applicant acknowledged the seriousness of the incident immediately after it occurred. As a result, he took steps to document and respond to it thoroughly, including: ensuring a Dispensing Error Incident Form was completed, ensuring the documentation of the incident in the pharmacy records' ensuring that both the family of the patient and the prescriber were notified, retrieving security videos of the incident, obtaining interviews or statements from all relevant staff members, and instituting new protocols. l23l In addition to the applicant's own acknowledgement of the seriousness of the dispensing enor, the need to preserve evidence was reinforced by the request from the College for information and documents only seventeen days after the incident occurred, and the fact, known to the applicant, that the family of the patient retained a lawyer. l24l Finally, the applicant is incorrect when he submits the College was required to dispose of the complaint within 150 days and that the College failed to provide him with written notice of its602 a a a a a aPage: 6 failure to do so, pursuant to section 28(3) of the Code. The applicant has confused the provisions relating to Registrar's investigations and reports with those applicable to formal complaints. Section 25 of the Code distinguishes between a formal letter of complaint and information that results in a Registrar's investigation report. The former is subject to the 150-day requirement; the latter is not. Section 25(6) of the Code requires the College to provide notice to the member within 14 days of the receipt of the Registrar's report. This requirement was met; the applicant was given the Registrar's Report the very day it was received. I25l For these reasons, I am unable to agree that delay by the College resulted in any denial of procedural fairness. 126] I am also unable to accept the applicant's assertion that he was unaware that post-incident return-to-stock policies were part of the investigation or the considerations of the ICRC. Among the documents requested by the College was a copy of the Pharmacy's policies and procedures for responding to a medication error. The applicant provided no policies or procedures that existed at the time of the incident. Instead, the applicant provided the new, one-page policy which he created in direct response to the incident. This policy dealt with safeguards when pouring liquid medication and returning the medication to stock once it is poured. l27l The introduction to the Registrar's Report, which was given to the applicant well before his response was filed, states that the ICRC panel dealing with the investigation into the dispensing pharmacist triggered the investigation of the applicant because of concerns \"about the training of nonregulated pharmacy stafl the policies and processes in place at the Pharmacy, and the accountability of the Designated Manager\". [28] The applicant's response to the Registrar's Report again did not provide any information about the policies and procedures that existed at the time of the incident that might, if followed, have prevented the error. Indeed, based on the applicant's lack ofresponse to a direct question from the College about this, it is quite apparent that there were no policies in place about returning previously dispensed medicine to stock. The applicant merely stated that he did not observe o'any deficiencies\" in the Pharmacy's policies atlarge. The applicant's response did, however, include a detailed explanation of the post-incident policies which he had established after the dispensing elTor. [29) The applicant was clearly aware of the need to address his response to the incident, including what he had done to ensure there could be no repetition of the mistake. This included his post-incident policies, which he submitted and explained to the College in his response to the Registrar's Report. [30] For all these reasons, I would not accept any of the applicant's arguments that he was denied procedural fairness. Reasonubleness of the Decision [31] The applicant submits that the ICRC's determination that he acted improperly and that his conduct warranted an oral caution was based on three findings, each one of which was603Page:7604 unreasonable: l) the applicant failed to ensure that proper policies were in place, which contributed to the dispensing crror;2) the applicant implemented an improper return-to-stock procedure post- incident; and, 3j the applicant's conduct was sufficiently serious to justiff an oral caution' The decision to issue an oral caution was based on the totality ofthese findings. Thus, to the extent that any one of them was unreasonable, the ICRC Decision, he submits, should be quashed. l32l The ICRC performs a screening function. It does not make findings of disputed fact and is not required to resolve every factual dispute through additional investigation or, for that matter, in its reasons. Neither does it make findings of professional misconduct. Rather, it investigates concerns and determines whether they warrant a referral to discipline or other, less intrusive, responses: Armogan v Health Professions Appeal and (Div' Ct.) at para. 5. t33] Cautions and educational or remedial directions are not meant as sanctions or penalties but are meant to benefit the practitioner and the patients by avoiding future complaints of a similar nature: Armogan, parc. 9. l34l It is true, as the applicant argues, that cautions and remedial orders regarding attendance at iducation programs are now placed on the public register. This was not the case when a number of the leadingiases dealing with such orders were decided. However, the fact that the Legislature felt it would be in the public interest to make health disciplines bodies publish remedial orders of the kind issued by the ICRC in this case does not fundamentally alter the preventive, educational and remedial nature of such orders. I cannot agree that an entirely different approach must be taken now that remedial orders appear on the public register. t35] Among other things, there is a mechanism in the legislation to remove entries from the puUlic register where 'othe information is obsolete and no longer relevant to the member's suitability to practise.\" t36l I cannot agree that the applicant was found accountable for something he had no ability to conlrol. Each pharmacy is required by statute to have a designated manager who is responsible for the management of the pharmacy. A designated manager is responsible to ensure that the pharmacy follows safe medication practices, including having appropriate policies and procedures in place and responding appropriately to dispensing effors. The applicant, upon becoming the designated 111unug.., acknowiedged to the College that he was aware of the requirement that \"[b]efore u..\"piing the role of DM ... The DM must be familiar with ... the policies and procedures that are in place at the pharmacy.\" t37l While the applicant may have had no ability to control the original action whereby the iisplridone was returned to stock, he became designated manager before it was wrongly dispensed, and inherited, as designated manager, a pharmacy that, on the evidence, apparently had no policy about returning previously dispensed medications to stock. The College was entitled to consider this shortcoming in procedures which continued 'on the applicant's watcho. t38] More importantly, the ICRC assessed the applicant's new, post-incident, return to stock policy, both as wriffen and as described in the applicant's submission to the College. Each ofthosePage: 8 605 descriptions contemplated the pouring of medication from a prescription bottle back into the stock bottle either by or under the supervision of a pharmacist. There was no mischaracterizationof the applicant's post-incident policy. The ICRC's reasons on this point were, likewise, not vague or lacking in specificity. The ICRC concluded (as it was entitled to being an expert body of the applicant's peers) that such a policy \"will create the risk of contaminating entire stock bottles\" and thatooa liquid medication should never be added back into a stock bottle.\" [39] Finally, the ICRC concluded that educational and remedial measures could reduce the risk of such errors occurring in the future. It chose not to engage in an exercise of allocating blame for the incident amongst the various participants. The ICRC gave extensive reasons justifiiing how and why the applicant (and the public) would benefit from the educational and remedial measures it adopted. [40] Finally, the applicant argues that the \"penalty\" was, in the circumstances, too harsh; mitigating factors were not given sufficient weight and, the dispensing pharmacist, who the applicant says was clearly more at fault, only received oadvice and recommendations'. I do not agree. l4ll Directing the applicant to attend and receive an oral caution is not a penalty. Rather it is an educational and remedial measure intended to prevent the applicant from having a similar experience in the future and to protect the public. The ICRC did consider the mitigating factors that the applicant was new to the role of designated manager and that he had no record of prior incidents. The role and responsibilities (including accountabilities) of the designated manager, however, are central to the protection of the public under a regime in which only the individual pharmacists, not the pharmacy, are regulated. Someone has to be accountable for the policies and procedures of the pharmacy - that \"someone\" is the designated manager. The applicant is asking this court to re-weigh the relevant factors and come to a different result. That is not the role of any court on judicial reviewo especially where remedy is concerned: Mitelman v College of Veterinarians of Ontario,2020 ONSC 3039. 142] For these reasons, I would not accept the assertion of the applic antthatthe ICRC' s Decision was unreasonable. Conclusion l43l For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the application for judicial reviewPage:9 Costs t44l The parties agreed that there should be no order as to costs.

Hamilton,2020 ONLSTH Andrew Gerry HamiltonApplicant Respondent Before: Jay Sengupta (chair), C. Scott Marshall, Heard: September 25,2020, by videoconference Appearances: Shannon McDunnough, for the applicant John Dent, for the respondent625 Summary: HAMILTON - Invitation to Attend - ln earlier reasons the panelfound the Law Society failed to prove two allegations of misappropriation against the Lawyer - A third allegation, that he had signed minutes of settlement which required a former clie nt to withdraw a complaint, had been established - The Lawyer moved, and the Law Society consented, to convert the proceeding to an invitation to attend - The proven misconduct is significantly differenf and /ess serious than that alleged in the notice of application - The circumstances do not compelthe imposition of a penalty and there are mitigating circumstances in favour of Mr. Hamilton. The motion was granted - The Lawyer was invited to attend for the purpose of receiving advice concerning his conduct and the application uvas dismissed. REASONS FOR DECISION RE INVITATION TO ATTEND INTRODUCTION 11l C. Scott Marshall (for the panel):- ln reasons for decision dated May 1 1, 2020, 2020 ONLSTH 56, we found the Law Society failed to prove two allegations of misappropriation against the Lawyer, Shawn Andrew Gerry Hamilton (the unproven allegations). We found that a third allegation of misconduct had been established; specifically, that Mr. Hamilton had committed misconduct by signing minutes of settlement in a small claims court matter, a term of which required a former client to withdraw or discontinue her complaint against him with the Law Society (the proven allegation). I2l Mr. Hamilton filed a motion - to which the Law Society consented - to convert the proceeding in respect of the proven allegation into an invitation to attend (lTA) under s. 36 of the Law Society Acf RSO 1990, c. L.B. t3lA joint submission of the parties should be accepted bythe Tribunal unless it is unreasonable or contrary to the public interest (Law Society of lJpper Canada v. Ludmer, 2017 oNLSTH 28 at para. 9). we agree that the proposed disposition is reasonable in the circumstances. The proceeding was converted to an ITA on consent, Mr. Hamilton attended before the panel to receive advice, and we dismissed this application. BACKGROUND Facts Relating to the Unproven Allegations I4l The Law Society alleged that in January 2014 Mr. Hamilton misappropriated $1,000 sent by e-mail money transfer from Client A to be held in trust, and that in March 2014 he misappropriated $2,000 sent by e-mail money transfer from Client A to be held in trust.-:c(E O f.- =FoJ NO(\\ 2626 t5lClient A maintained these transfers were retainer top-ups. Mr. Hamilton maintained they were gifts from Client A and he treated them as such by transferring them to his personal account. We assessed the credibility of Client A and Mr. Hamilton and accepted Mr Hamilton's version of events, that the transfers were in fact gifts.t6l-JC O N IFa -lz N(3N17lFacts Relating to the Proven Allegation Client A terminated her retainer with Mr. Hamilton in September 2014 and what had been a friendly relationship turned adversarial. Client A initially demanded the return of $8,500 from Mr. Hamilton, a sum later increased after litigation had commenced. tBlln the spring of 2015 Client A lodged a conduct complaint against Mr. Hamilton with the Law Society. ln September 2015, she commenced a Small Claims Court action Mr. Hamilton in relation to his representation of her. Client A alleged incidents of criminal harassment against her by Mr. Hamilton that resulted in police contact but no charges. She also alleged to the Law Society that he had substance abuse problems and shouldn't be licensed. t10l The acrimony prompted Mr. Hamilton to report a claim to LawPRO. LawPRO counsel was appointed in the spring of 2016. 111l LawPRO counsel negotiated a settlement of the small claims matter with Client A on behalf of Mr. Hamilton in which Client A would receive $7,500 from Mr. Hamilton conditional upon her withdrawing all conduct complaints against him and agreeing to make no further complaints to the Law Society against either Mr. Hamilton or his LawPRO counsel. Client A and Mr. Hamilton signed the full and final release on September 29,2017 and October 5,2017 respectively. l12l Mr. Hamilton paid Client A the agreed sum and considered the matter closed until Client A made a further demand of $3,000 on November 24, 2017. ln her letter to Mr. Hamilton, Client A said failure to comply would result in the reinstatement of her conduct complaint against him. Mr. Hamilton refused to comply and the Law Society complaint proceedings were reinstated shortly thereafter, ultimately leading to this application. 113l Mr. Hamilton's LawPRO counsel was investigated by the Law Society in relation to the term of the settlement agreement requiring Client A to withdraw or discontinue any complaints filed with the Law Society about Mr. Hamilton and to refrain from filing any complaints with the Law Society about him as counsel but was ultimately not prosecuted.lel 3627 114l We found Mr. Hamilton, in agreeing to the term of the release requiring Client A to withdraw or discontinue any conduct complaints against him, had engaged in professional m isconduct. ANALYSIS t15l An ITA is reserved for exceptional cases: Law Society of Upper Canada v. Dadepo, 2009 ONLSHP 43, Law Society of Upper Canada v. Desjardins, 2016 ONLSTH 79, and Law Society of Upper Canada v. James,2017 ONLSTA 16. Concerns about the Tribunal usurping prosecutorial functions are diminished where the invitation to attend stems from a joint submission and the panel is well apprised of the history of the proceedings, as in this case. [16] The James decision at para. 93 sets out a list of factors to be considered in a motion for conversion to an lTA. We applied these factors to determine if the motion to convert the penalty hearing to an ITA would be granted: L Whether the proven conduct is significantly different and less serious from that alleged in the notice of application. 2. The seriousness of the proven misconduct on its own. This will generally be the most important factor. Clearly the public interest requires that only the least serious cases are candidates for an invitation to attend. For example, significant harm visited on others, oron the administration of justice, by a licensee will compel the imposition of a penalty, and cannot be excused by a s. 36 direction. 3. The need for a formal order, for example to enforce conditions that are themselves necessary in the public interest (Dadepo). 4. Special considerations under the Human Rights Code, RSO 1990, c. H.19, such as medical or other explanations of the conduct in question. 5. Other non-Code related compassionate circumstances, such as personal tragedy. 6. A range of mitigating or explanatory circumstances, including remorse, good character, disciplinary record or similar assurances of future conduct. The Proven Misconduct is Significantly Different and Less Serious than that Alleged in the Notice of Application l17l The notice of application alleged two instances of misappropriation in addition to the inclusion of the offending term in the settlement agreement. Misappropriation is the most serious allegation of professional misconduct that can be made against a lawyer, carrying with it a presumptive penalty of revocation.-:C(o O N IF Jz O N(fN 4628 t18] By contrast, the proven allegation of including a term in a settlement agreement requiring a client to withdraw or discontinue conduct complaints with the Law Society is among the least serious. Nor is there case law in which the Law Society prosecuted a licensee for such misconduct in the absence of other, more serious proven allegations. We note the Law Society didn't sanction Mr. Hamilton's LawPRO counsel for the same misconduct, indicating at the least that the Law Society doesn't consider such misconduct prosecutable in every case. This suggests Mr. Hamilton wouldn't have faced a conduct application based on the proven allegation alone. The Proven Misconduct is Among the Least Serious t19l This is the most significant factor in deciding whether to grant a motion to convert to an ITA and has been adequately canvassed above. The Gircumstances do not Gompel lmposition of a Penalty t20l Mr. Hamilton has no prior discipline history and has exhibited no pattern of misconduct that would justify imposition of a penalty. We note the Law Society agrees this is not a case where suspension or other significant penalty is required in the public interest. There is No Need for a Formal Order to Enforce any Conditions lmposed 1211 The Law Society seeks no conditions or restrictions on Mr. Hamilton's practice. There are Mitigating Gircumstances in Favour of Mr. Hamilton 1221 Mr. Hamilton was acting under the advice of LawPRO counsel when he signed the release containing the term for which he was prosecuted for misconduct. We note his counsel faced no sanction for including the term and can't justify unequal treatment of Mr. Hamilton for the same misconduct. I23l We accept that Mr. Hamilton is of good character with a reputation for honesty and integrity in the wider North Bay legal community and within the Nipissing First Nation community where his office is located. t24j We accept that Mr. Hamilton overcame some difficult life circumstances and mentored other First Nations students while at the University of Toronto law school and that these factors further attest to his good character. l25l Finally, we accept that Mr. Hamilton's commitment to serving his First Nations community is also a relevant consideration. His work has enhanced access to justice for an underserved community thereby strengthening public confidence in the legal profession.3 =g (g O t*c) =F <nJzo NON the result, we made the following order:629 1.

Many provinces, including British Columbia, Alberta and Qudbec are in the midst of reform right now.1 One of the key reform proposals has been to establish an independent oversight agency similar to the Professional Standards Authority of the United Kingdom.2 However, Ontario is choosing a different, and somewhat unique, path. Last month the Ministry of Health of Ontario made available its College Performance Measurement Framework (CPMF). The CPMF requires the 26 health regulators to collect, report and publish detailed information about their structure and activities in a uniform format. The Ministry will then publish a summary report of the updated information annually. The Ministry has stated the purpose of the initiative as follows: 1 See, for example: A Year of Change: Proposals for Regulotory Reforms n nd at: https://m365-emarketing- uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cnar/SML December 202 0.pdf. 2 Modernizing the Oversight of the Health Workforce in Ontario, Dialogue Summary, McMaster Health Forum, https://www, mcmasterforu college performance wlll strengthen accountability by linking college activities to outcomes and providing consistent and aligned information across all Colleges. In addition, performance measurement strengthens transparency about the role of the Colleges (e.g., how decisions are made, the impact of those decisions and activities in advancing the public interest, etc.) helping to foster trust in the ability of the health professions to regulate themselves in the interest of the public. Finally, this work places a focus on areas of improvement (e.g., better support for changing public expectations, patient needs, and delivery of care models) and through highlighting best practices, reduces variation in the efficiency and effectiveness with which Colleges carry out their functions. The CPMF document and reporting tools are the products of hard work by a working group, collaboration with experts in the field, and broad consultation with stakeholders including the regulators themselves. The information to be gathered and reported is quite detailed. It is organized into seven topics (or domains) each of which has a number of separate standards to be met. Each standard has a number of questions to be answered. For each question the regulator has to identify evidence to support its meeting of the standard. Links to documents of supporting evidence are to be provided. The regulator then indicates whether it fully, partially or does not meet the standard. There is a place for the regulator to offer comments to put the information into context.

Domain 6 deals with suitability to practice, which addresses the core function of a regulator to ensure that practitioners are competent and ethical. Standard 13 reads: \"All complaints, reports, and investigations are prioritized based on public risk, and conducted in a timely manner with necessary actions to protect the public.\" Measure 13.1 under this standard reads: \"The College addresses complaints in a right touch manner.\" The proposed evidence to support whether this measure is met reads as follows: The College has accessible, up-to-date, documented guidance setting out the framework for assessing risk and acting on complaints, including the prioritization of investigations, complaints, and reports (e.g. risk matrix, decision matrix/tree, triage protocol). The regulator then assesses whether it has met this measure in whole or in part. The above example is probably one of the more straightforward ones. Standard 7 reads: \"The College responds in a timely and effective manner to changing public expectations.\" That standard does not have ameasurement statement and calls only for a narrative discussion of what the regulator does. Some standards with measurement statements are difficult to quantifu. For example, measure 9.1 reads: All policies, standards of practice, and practice guidelines are up to date and relevant to the current practice environment (e.g. where appropriate, reflective of changing population health needs, public/societal expectations, models of care, clinical evidence, advances in technology). The evidence of meeting that measure is entirely process orientated, including that each policy is regularly reviewed and that any updates include the following components:Applranl / llegisrant i:trusResults & 1. ii. iii. iv.evidence anddata, the risk posed to patients / the public, the current practice environment, alignment with other health regulatory Colleges (where appropriate, for example where practice matters overlap) expectations of the public, and stakeholder views and feedback.v vi In fact, that is a criticism of the CPMF. Harry Cayton has stateci that he is skeptical about the CPMF bccausc it focusscs on proccss and not outcomc.3 However, he also says that the CPMF is an important step. t Listen to the l-2:40 mark of the podcast Heolth Profession Regulation 2It is, after all, quite difficult to measure outcomes for most regulatory activities. In addition, Standard 15 specifically requires regulators to monitor, report on, and improve their performance and requires each regulator to identify and measure key performance indicators (KPI). The Ministry has also noted that: ...there are currently no benchmarks that set expectations for regulatory excellence that have been identified through jurisdictional scans or literature reviews. The purpose of the first iteration of the CPMF is to provide the public, the ministry and other stakeholders with baseline information respecting a College's activities and processes regarding best practices of regulatory excellence and, where relevant, the College's performance improvement commitments. The reported results will help to Lay a foundation upon which expectations and benchmarks for regulatory excellence can be refined and improved and may stimulate discussions about regulatory excellence and performance improvement. Some of the standards appear to create obligations that are not contained in the enabling legislation. For example, Standard 1, measure 1 asks about whether the regulator has competency and suitability criteria for a candidate to be eligible for election to its Board. This concept is not included in the legislation despite a number of recent amendments dealing with governance and the Minister has never requested that the regulators establish such a requirement. These are difficult concepts to introduce into an election process and will likely take years to implement. Yet the first reporting period for this measure is 2020.SML Other standards, while not directly required by the enabling statute, can perhaps be inferred from it. For example, Standard 5 reads \"The College actively engages with other health regulatory Colleges and system partners to align oversight of the practice of the profession and support execution of its mandate'\" The Ministry is taking a quality improvement approach to this initiative. It will provide a factual summary of the information but will not rank the regulators or point out poor performers. It anticipates using the information to: ...lay a foundation upon which expectations and benchmarks for regulatory excellence can be refined and improved and may stimulate discussions about regulatory excellence and performance improvement. . . The ministry may use the results, where warranted, to inform discussions with individual Colleges regarding proposed improvement commitments, best practices, and potential areas for alignment with other Colleges and system partners. The CPMF will create a lot of work for the regulators to compile the information in a format consistent with the Ministry requirements and to implement changes to meet the new expectations. However, this is currently an alternative to the creation of an independent oversight body, which likely would require even more effort. The Ministry has not posted the CPMF documents on a website, but they are available upon request from: Regulatory Oversight & Performance Branch Ministry of Health 438 University Avenue, 1Oth floor Toronto, RECULATION Page | 3|TEM 6,10 640Gouncil Member Terms as at February 15,20211 I Please advise Ms Rose Bustria a.s.a.p. if you aware of aware of any discrepancies. 2 By-election will be called for April2}2l for one-year term.
