It is also useful for soreness after labor and delivery, and for hemorrhoids that follow childbirth. Calcarea phosphorica This remedy can help to strengthen a woman who tends toward easy tiredness, poor digestion, cold hands and feet, and poor absorption of nutrients. Some women who need this remedy find only \"junk food\" appealing during pregnancy, or have cravings for smoked and salty food. A history of easy tooth decay and aching bones and joints can also suggest a need for this remedy. A person who needs Calc phos is often irritable because of tiredness, and may long for travel or a change of circumstances. Caulophyllum This remedy may be helpful to women with weak muscle tone in the uterus. A history of irregular periods, slow and difficult labor with previous deliveries, or weakness of the cervix may bring this remedy to mind. The woman may feel erratic pains like sticking needles, or episodes of contracting pain. She typically feels nervous, shaky, and trembling (sometimes irritable, as well). Carbo vegetabilis This remedy can be helpful to a woman who feels weak and faint during pregnancy, with poor circulation, a general feeling of coldness, and a craving for fresh or moving air. She may also have frequent digestive upsets with burning pain and a tendency to belch. A woman who is deeply tired from overwork, many pregnancies close together, or a previous illness may regain some strength with Carbo vegetabilis. Cimicifuga (also called Actaea racemosa) This remedy can be helpful to women who are nervous and talkative, with a tendency to feel fearful and gloomy during pregnancy. They may become overagitated and fear a miscarriage \u2014 sometimes having pains that feel like labor pains too early, or pains that shoot from hip to hip and down the thighs. Ferrum metallicum A woman who has a sturdy build, but looks very pale and weary\u2014flushing red from any exertion or emotion\u2014may respond to this remedy. Ferrum is often helpful in correcting anemic tendencies. Ferrum phosphoricum This remedy can be helpful for nervous, sensitive women who often feel weak or tired, with easy flushing of the face and a tendency toward anemia. A woman who needs this remedy often has a slender build and may develop frequent neck and shoulder stiffness. Nux vomica This remedy may be useful for indigestion, heartburn, stomach pain, and constipation during pregnancy. A woman needs this remedy usually is impatient, irritable, and chilly. Pulsatilla This remedy is often helpful at times of strong hormonal changes, especially to women who are moody and emotional, and want a lot of affection and attention. They often crave desserts or butter and may overeat, which can lead to indigestion and nausea, or excessive weight-gain. Pregnant women who need this remedy feel uncomfortable in hot weather and in stuffy rooms, improving from gentle exercise in open air. Sepia Women who are tired, dragged out, and irritable during pregnancy (feeling overburdened by demands of family members, or with little enthusiasm for the pregnancy) may benefit from this remedy. Poor circulation, nausea, constipation, a tendency toward accidental urine loss, and a feeling of sagging or weakness in the pelvic floor, and an energy-boost from exercise are other indications for Sepia. [] Dosage Homeopathy Dosage Directions Select the medicine that most closely matches the symptoms. In conditions where self-treatment is appropriate, unless otherwise directed by a physician, a lower potency (6X, 6C, 12X, 12C, 30X, or 30C) should be used. In addition, instructions for use are usually printed on the label. Many homeopathic physicians suggest that medicines be used as follows: Take one dose and wait for a response. If improvement is seen, continue to wait and let the medicine work. If improvement lags significantly or has clearly stopped, another dose may be taken. The frequency of dosage varies with the condition and the individual. Sometimes a dose may be required several times an hour; other times a dose may be indicated several times a day; and in some situations, one dose per day (or less) can be sufficient. If no response is seen within a reasonable amount of time, select a different medicine.
