The progress was made possible with increased vaccination and surveillance reach in inaccessible areas in the northeast . The Buratai initiative, among others, were specially employed in Borno and Yobe states to address areas with security threat/risks. The program continued to implement innovative and impactful in -between round special interventions target ed at vaccinating more children potentially missed through the House -to-House campaigns. These strategies included profiling and vaccination of children liberated from captivity in the security compromised areas, vaccinations at transit points , IDP camps, h ospital s, markets , etc. The innovative strategies resulted in more settlements being accessed and thus more childr en vaccinated in security -compromised areas than the previous years . There has been tremendous progress in meeting the general goal of Reaching inaccessible communities (Buratai initiative). As at week 46, in 2019, 13 rounds of BI (RIC) have so far been co mpleted in Borno, with over 18,216 children vaccinated per round. The Reaching Every Settlement (RES) has been transitioned to HH and still capturing children. The number of children vaccinated through the RES for the rounds of 2019 is 188,192. Despite t he remarkable progress made in PEI in 2019, there was persistent detection of cVDPVs from different sources (AFP cases, environment, and healthy child samples). For the first time in years, cVDPVs were detected from non -polio high -risk states across the river Niger . A total of 83 cVDPV2 were confirmed from ES (56), AFP Cases (18), AFP Contacts (1) and Healthy Children (8) in 2019. The latest cVDPV2 from human was from an AFP case in Surulere LGA/Oyo State, with date of onset of paralysis on 09/10/2019 whi le the latest ES confirmed virus is from Onitsha South LGA of Anambra State with date of collection on 19/12/2019. The positive cVDPV2 isolates were and Yobe states. The outbreak spread to neighboring countries of West Africa. The country programme responded swifly to address these events. Monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine t ype 2 (mOPV2) was deployed to control the cVDPV2 outbreaks in January, February, April, May, June and December 2019 outbreak responses. The use of mOPV2 after the withdrawal of trivalent OPV required approval of the DG WHO and strict vaccine accountabili ty. 6 To ensure all the vaccines deployed were accounted for, mOPV2 accountability officers were engaged' whose responsibility was to reconcile and return all used and unused vials with all the teams, up to the state level. One national supplemental immuniz ation activity (SIAs), three subnational IPDs (SNIDs) as recommended by the 35th ERC and seven outbreak responses have been conducted between January and December 2019. The post campaign Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAs) showed steady number of LGAs ac cepted as with => 90% coverage in the implementing states. Improved campaign outcome resulted from dogged strategies/ innovation that complemented the traditional house to house teams in addressing the barriers to OPV uptake by eligible children. Empha sis was placed on improving the quality and sensitivity of surveillance in 2019 through training and sensitization of surveillance actors, surveillance peer reviews at state level and strengthening the accountability framework . This surveillance structure comprises of surveillance personnel, a network of 9,184 prioritized health facilities as surveillance focal sites and a total of 53,518 community informants in 2019. The surveillance structure is coordinated at national, zonal, state, LGA and health facility levels. The National Polio Committees (NCC, NTF and NPEC) in the country are functional and meet at least every quarter. These committees guide the entire PEI programme. The country has been able to achieve and sustain the re quired WHO standard targets of surveillance performance indicators for over a decade at both national and state levels even though some surveillance gaps do exist at LGAs. The NP -AFP and stool adequacy rates in 2019 were 7.7 and 94% respectively. To impr ove the sensitivity of the surveillance system in the country, environmental surveillance (ES) was introduced in 2011 in Kano State to complement the AFP surveillance. As at December 2019, the country had 113 ES sites in 29 states and FCT. Environmental sa mple collection is supervised by senior surveillance officers. The proportion of ES sample collection supervised in 2019 was 1,732(83%) out of the 2,093 samples collected. The last time WPV was isolated from ES was in May 2014 in Kaduna State whereas cVDPV2 was last confirmed from ES in December 2019 in Anambra State. Stool and environmental samples collected for poliovirus isolation are analyzed in the two national polio laboratories in located in Ibadan and Maiduguri. These laboratories are p art of the Global Polio Laboratory Network and are WHO accredited. The major challenges faced in 201 9 were the outbreak of cVDPV2 as well as the lack of access to remaining children in completely inaccessible areas in Borno especially Abadam, Marte and some islands on the Lake Chad. Sustaining the gains made through polio campaigns was also 7 threatened by potential immunity gaps as revealed by the upsurge in cVDPV2 cases and low coverage based on community surveys and RI LQA S data . In 20 20, the overall goal of the program will be to sustain the interruption of wild poliovirus transmission and to contain the current outbreak of cVDPV2. This will be done through quality campaigns, increasing the reach to inaccessible areas in Borno state, achieving reduction in number of unimmunized children in very high risk LGAs, and sustaining quality surveillance performance indicators in all LGAs 8 1.0 INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT OF THE PROGRAMME Context of Polio Eradication Efforts in 201 9 - interrupting all poliovirus transmission As at end of December 2019, Nigeria has marked its 40 months without a case of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) detected anywhere in the country . The last virus was detected in a healthy contact in Monguno LGA of Borno State. Although successes have been recorded in curbing the spread of WPV, the country experienced an outbreak of cVDPV2 in 2016 with one case confirmed. There wasn't any cVDPV confirmed in 2017. However, in 2018 there was re -emergence with a total of 34 cVD PV2 cases that decreased to 18 in 2019. The downward trend in the incidence of cVDPV2 from 2018 to 2019 was as a result of innovative and intensified activities to improve population immunity. In Nigeria, the AFP surveillance system detects, reports, inves tigates and verifies AFP cases in children below 15 years of age or in any person of any age when a clinician suspects poliomyelitis. This surveillance structure comprises of surveillance personnel, a network of 9,184 prioritized health facilities as surve illance focal sites and a total of 53,518 community informants in 2019. The surveillance structure is coordinated at national, zonal, state, LGA and health facility levels. The National Polio Committees (NCC, NTF and NPEC) in the country are functional and meet at least every quarter. These committees guide the entire PEI programme. The country has been able to achieve and sustain the required WHO standard targets of surveillance performance indicators for over a decade at both national and state levels eve n though some surveillance gaps do exist at LGAs. The NP -AFP and stool adequacy rates in 2019 were 7.7 and 94% respectively. Surveillance reach in inaccessible areas expanded in Borno State through community informant network. Community informants submit w eekly report including zero report and attend quarterly meetings at the health facility catchment area level. This tracking system has enhanced the reporting rate of the informants with more than 90% reporting . This has improved reporting of AFP cases from the community and reduced over reliance on campaigns. With the multiple surveillance strategies described above, the surveillance reach in Borno State exceeds the vaccination reach. The use of CIs from security compromised areas brought about a breakthrough in surveillance. Marte and Abadam LGAs which were silent in 2017 are now reporting AFP cases: - Marte: 12 and 8 AFP cases reported in 2018 and 2019 respectively - Abadam: 4 and 1 AFP cases reported in 2018 an d 2019 respectively . Innovative approaches to reach children in inaccessible areas were sustained and guided by settlement -based accessibility mapping and collaboration with security forces . 9 The implementation of interventions (Permanent Health Teams, f irewalling, Market/Transit vaccination, international border vaccinations, IDPs, nomadic vaccinations, renewed efforts towards RIC strategy (Buratai Initiative etc.) vary from state to State depending on peculiarities. There were teams dedicated to the ID P camps, closely supervised, who conduct daily vaccinations in the camps while IDPs embedded into host communities were tracked for vaccination with the support of identified community focal points. Although successes have been recorded in curbing the spr ead of WPV, in 2018 re -emergence with a total of 34 cVDPV2 cases , decreased to 18 in 2019. The downward trend in the incidence of cVDPV2 from 2018 to 2019 was as a result of innovative and intensified activities to improve population immunity. The last cVD PV2 was detected from an AFP case in Sokoto s tate, while the last positive cVDPV2 from the environment was isolated from a sample collected in December 2019 in Anambra s tate. Despite the remarkable stride for PEI in 2019, progress was marred by the incessant detection of cVDPVs from different sources (AFP cases, environment, and healthy child samples). For the first time after many years, cVDPVs were detected from non -polio hig h-risk states across the river Niger. The country responded aptly to address these events. Monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) was deployed to control the cVDPV2 outbreaks in January, February, April, May, June and December 2019 outbreak respon ses. The use of mOPV2 after the withdrawal of trivalent OPV required approval of the DG WHO and strict vaccine accountability. To ensure all the vaccines deployed were accounted for, mOPV2 accountability officers were engaged' whose responsibility was to r econcile and return all used and unused vials with all the teams, up to the state level. One national supplemental immunization activity (SIAs), three subnational IPDs (SNIDs) as recommended by the 35th ERC and seven outbreak responses have been conducted between January and December 2019. The post campaign Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAs) showed steady number of LGAs accepted as with => 90% coverage in the implementing states. Improved campaign outcome resulted from dogged strategies/ innovation that complemented the traditional house to house teams in addressing the barriers to OPV uptake by eligible children. Access to children in the North East remains a challenge due to insecurity. This is further complicated by other escalation in northwest a nd north central states coupled with criminal elements in spotted parts of the country. However, mitigating measures including special interventions have been deployed to address children that would have been missed from these 10 conflicts. Internally displa ced person's (IDP) camps, use of community structures to identify IDPs in host communities, transit vaccination posts and vaccination teams with the support of security agencies have deployed to inaccessible areas. Implementation in some rounds was s tagger ed to facilitate close supervision and monitoring and attention was also availed to cross border collaboration with neighbouring countries, given the dynamic situation at the borders. These efforts were complemented by the intensified efforts of the Emergency Routine Immunization Coordination Centers at national (NERICC) and State (SERICC) levels to address the gaps in routine immunization. The National and State EOCs continued to drive the programme, ensuring strong co ordination of Government and partner efforts at all levels and strategic technical support, including close monitoring of performance. GoN, through the resilient leadership of National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), with support of polio eradication partners and strategic planning through the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) galvanized these efforts. The oversight of polio eradication by H.E. the President through the Presidential Task Force on Polio Eradication (PTFoPE); enforcement of a ccountability at all levels, efficient and effective management of resources through the Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) was unprecedented. Furthermore, implementation of annual NPEEPs; data driven planning and deployment of crack teams, rapid respons e and Management Support Teams (MSTs), including timely response to reported outbreaks and routine intensification with IPV/ fIPV enhanced programme performance. The key achievements during the implementation of the 201 9 NPEEP included: No detection of WP V1 from cases or the environment for 40 months. Increased surveillance reach in inaccessible areas of Borno state. Improved quality of surveillance at State level. Surveillance sensitivity was maintained with non -polio AFP detection rate at 9.6 per 100,000 under 15 population and stool adequacy at 96% in 201 8. The proportion of LGAs meeting both indicators was 87% by December 2018. Prompt investigation and response to cVDPV2 outbreaks. As the programme con tinues to implement respo nse activities in a wider scope. However, the latest c VDPV2 from Anambra was in December 2019. 11 Strengthened vaccine accountability. All mOPV2 vials provided for the c VDPV2 outbreak response activities were accounted for. These mea sures are being extended to other antigens. The major challenges in 201 9 included : Evolving security situation in Borno. Frequent attacks by insurgents made accessibility to parts of Borno a challenge. Implementation of RIC slowed down due to engagement of the military in security operations . Low routine immunization coverage across nor thern Nigeria including IPV coverage fueled the emergence of cVDPV2 outbreaks Waning political support and commitment at the State and LGA levels. Release of counterpart funding for activities and timeliness of release continued to be a challenge at all l evels . 1.0. Poliovirus Epidemiology As at December 2019, Nigeria was 39 months without WPV; the last being reported i n August 2016 . Four cases of WPV1 were confirmed in three LGAs in Borno State after 23 months o f no virus detected in Nigeria. Internal displa cement and poor access to the programme were contributory. 12 Figure 1: Confirmed WPV 1 cases, Nigeria, 2005 -2019 There was a decline of number of cVDPVs from 2018 . As at December 2019, 18 AFP cases were isolated from AFP in 2019 with most recent from Surulere LGA (Oyo State) with date of onset on 09 October 2019. cVDPV2 from environmental sample confirmed 56 cVDPV2 in 2019 in 7 states with latest case from Onitsha South, date of collecti on on 19 December 2019. Figure 2: Location of VDPV2 isolates, 201 9 13 Figure 3: Trend in polioviruses from AFP cases, 2014 -2019 The number of positive cVDPV2 isolates from contact was one, while a total of 8 positive isolate was from healthy children sample. 14 Figure 4: Trend in VDPV2 from the environment, 2014 - 2019 1.1. Profile of VDPV2 and Genetic Data Detailed outbreak investigation in the cVDPV2 -infected wards in 201 9, indicated the following: The OPV status of NPAFP f rom 0 to 4 doses with significant suboptimal doses. 24 out of the 31 cases (77%) as zero dose children. The vaccination coverage for IPV in the infected areas (based on community surveys conducted in 30 households in the area where the virus was picked up) was suboptimal (<80%). Table 1: Summary Profile of VDPV2 isolates 201 9 15 2.0. ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED IN 201 9 TO BOOST POPULATION IMMUNITY AND STRENGTHEN SURVEILLANCE 2.1. Routine Immunization I ntensification in cVDPV2 Outbreak LGAs/ States Further effort at improving population immunity to reverse the cVDPV included RI intensification using fractional IPV (fIPV). One fIPV SIAs was conducted in different locations and scope in 15 outbreaks states of Bauchi, Borno, Yobe and Zamfara, July to August 2019. A total of 12,014,975 eligible children (14 weeks -59 months) were vaccinated with IPV in the 151 LGAs across 15 states (Figure 5). Figure 5: Scope of RI intensifica tion, 15 States, July/ August 2019 16 Figure 6: LQAs Results for fIPV Vaccination, August 2019 In the August 2019 fIPV SIAs, 343/353 (76%) of the LGAs survey were accepted as with coverage at =>90%. All LGAs (lots) with less than 90% coverage were made to repeat vaccination in poorly covered areas for 2 days (Figure 6). There was a decrease in the number of cVDPV cases detected after each fIPV campaign . The number of States infected in the last six months in 2019 has declined to seven, with declini ng number of reported cases in Nigeria (Figure 7) Figure 7: cVDPV2 b urden in fIPV target areas (LGAs with IPV/fIPV campaign Vs number of cVDPV2) 17 2.2. Vaccination in Security Compromised areas and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps . Nigeria has made progress in reaching children in security compromised areas through a host of strategies such as RES, RIC and Vaccination by Community infornmant from inaccessible (CIIAs). In July 2018, regular monthly RES implementation was discontuined and synchron ized with SIAs campaign implementation. However the RIC strategy has continued to be implemented.After 13 rounds of RIC, 115,613 children have been reached through the program in 4,827 (68%) of 7,078 planned settlements across 17 RIC implementing LGAs. To expedite progress in accessing children in unreached settlements with Polio vaccines, the CIIA vaccination strategy was adopted. CIIAs primarily conduct AFP surveillance, with progress made by this intervention in AFP surveillance,the state leveraged on t his oppoturnity to vaccinate in those areas reached by the CIIAs. As at December 2019 an estimated 525 settlements which were previously unreached by any intervention were reached by CIIAs. A combination of H2H, RES, RIC and CIIA vaccination intervention has improved vaccination reach from 7,926 settlements in December 2016 to 12,821 settlements by December 2019 (representing a 62% improvement in Vaccination reach relative to December 2016 vaccination reach) as shown in Figure 8. Outcome of vaccination con ducted by RES during the H2H campaign across Borno and Yobe State is shown in Table 2 and 3 18 Figure 8: Vaccination Reach in Borno, Quarter 4 2016 - Quarter 4 2019 Table 2: Number of children vaccinated with OPV by RES during regular H2H campaign Jan - Dec 2019 (Borno State) Month of implementatio n Total Number of settlements planned Total number of settlements Reached Proportion of Settlements reached Children Number of children vaccinated with OPV by RES during regular H2H campaign Jan - Dec 2019(Yobe State) Month of implementatio n Total Number of settlements planned Total number of settlements Reached Proportion of Settlements reached Children Immunized Mar-19 383 378 99% 14,014 2.3. Vaccination of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP s) The country continues to conduct targeted vaccination activities amongst IDPs population. Specific IDP camp teams are recruited to ensure children entering the IDP camps are vaccinated with OPV and IPV. The teams also search for AFP cases among the IDP pop ulation. In Borno, seven special intervention strategies were deployed to vaccinate and profile new arrival internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) below the age of 5 years. In 2019, IDP camp immunization data was only received from three states namely Borno, Adamawa, and Taraba. 752,334 children were vaccinated with OPV in the three states with Borno contributing the highest number at 748,164 while Adamawa and Taraba contributed 1,963 and 2,204 respectively. A total of 75 AFPs were picked in the IDPs which are all from Borno. 20 Table 4: No. children vaccinated with bOPV in IDP camps by State and LGAs State 1,118 Grand Total 752,334 Profiling Vaccinated Children Internally displaced children coming out of inaccessible areas in Borno were targeted for vaccination with Polio vaccines at strategic locations such as transit/motor parks, market, IDP camps, Community IDPs Tracking Teams (CITT), nomadic, CMAM centers, and hospital vaccinations. These children were profiled to determine the LGA and Ward of origin. During January - December 2019, 195,964 children were vaccinated and profiled, of which 182,163 migrated from 27 LGAs with in Borno, 5,442 were from other states in Nigeria and 8,359 were from other countries (Cameroun, Chad and Niger Republic. A total of 25,088 children were vaccinated from Abadam, Guzamala, Kukawa and Marte LGAs. 21 Figure 9: Profiling of children from inaccessible areas in Borno, January - December 2019 Remaining challenges for focus in 2020 By December 2018, two LGAs (Kukawa and Guzamala) in addition to Abadam and Kukawa became inaccessible to regular IPDs team. CIIAs re aching many settlements away from point of interest on the Geo data base and captured as invalid due to been within 300 -500m from the location. Previously abandoned inaccessible settlements becoming inhabited, thus increasing the number of unreached inhabi ted locations Strategic priorities for 2020 Adequate funding to sustain the gains made by CIIAs. Provide additional technology i.e. MB tiles with visual navigation to point of interest to support the CIIAs program. Continued planning to access unreached inhabited locations through the exiting strategies. 22 2.3 Transit Vaccinations: Markets, Motor parks, Highways, Hospitals, CMAM sites Children in transit from underserved and partially accessible areas with risk of poliovirus circulation pose a great risk of spreading the virus. Children in transit (highways, motor parks, markets, hospitals, nutrition centers) contribute to a good propor tion of missed children during IPDs. Similarly, children going into polioviruses transmitting areas have to be administered OPV doses to ensure they are protected. Farmers with children coming to markets to trade pose a risk of \"trading\" polioviruses in ma rkets. It is therefore important to vaccinate children in transit places. Transit vaccination activities were conducted in 2019 in Bauchi, Borno, Yobe, Gombe and Taraba states (Table 2). As at week 52, 2019, through market/ transit vaccinations, 1,148, 64 2 children were vaccinated across the northeast zone, majority were from Borno state where 328,830 children were vaccinated. Table 5 shows the number of OPV doses administered through special interventions as at Week 52, 2019. Table 5: Number of children vaccinated as at week 52, 2019 through the various special interventions in NWZ Interventions Category Kaduna Total Immunized 1,102 5,400 5,739 3,174 The Nigeria government's polio team has based on the suggested epidemiologic niche for polio transmission, established a Nomadic working group to try to track the situation and enhance essential immunization and oral polio vaccine rounds within the migrant and nomadic populations. The activities of the group have improved reach of the nomadic population (Figure 1 0 and 1 1). Figure 1 0: Nomadic Children vaccinated through SIAs/ Outbreak response rounds, Borno state, North east, 2019 24 Figure 1 1: Children vaccinated through special interv entions (Nomadic) in security - compromised areas in North east, 2019 2.4. Mobile Outreach es in Hard to Reach Areas In the year 2019, the Hard to reach (HTR) mobile outreaches continued to provide support to PEI in high risk and vulnerable population that are potential reservoirs of the virus. The HTR project activities continued in Yobe and Borno throughout 2019, given the special nature of the states and the need to continue reaching underserved, partially accessible areas without health facilities and those liberated in IDP camps. In Borno state, 58 hard to reach teams were deployed to support recently accessible areas and target vulnerable populations in underserved IDP population and new arrivals from liberated settlements. As part of the humanitarian cris es response, 35 additional teams supported by the humanitarian emergency, were engaged in Borno State to respond to the crisis in Northeast. The HTR teams in Borno and Yobe States surmounted the security and logistics challenges in these hard to reach are as. They provided services such as RI, treatment of minor ailments, antenatal services as well as Surveillance for AFP and other IDSR priority diseases. By December 2019, the HTR teams had administered 578,767 OPV doses to children 0 -59 months old; 46,986 children under one reached with measles vaccine; 46,338 children with 25 yellow fever vaccine and 19,328 reached with menA vaccine. HTR session plans have been integrated with the strategy of engaging informants from insecure areas by providing services at strategic locations for persons from insecure areas seeking services in secure areas. Figure 12: Number of Children, 5years and under 1 reached with OPV and RI by HTR teams, Borno state, 2019 International Border Activities Nigeria has 16 States, 60 LGAs and 201 wards along the international border. Prominent among these are states that share bo rders with Niger and Cameroon. In other borders vaccinations continued as an in between round activity. In 2019, 202,953 children were vaccinated through international border activity in the Northeast and a total of 47,731 in the Northwest and through spec ial interventions. Figure 13: Number of Children, 5years reached Yellow Routine immunization intensification in polio vulnerable LGAs using polio infrastructure . Special focus w as availed to the VDPV2 affected S tates/LGAs as well as high risk LGAs identified through the risk analysis. Using a combination of risk criteria related to population immunity, security and other factors . NERICC will expand to provide support to these LGAs Harmonization of high risk L GAs was done with the NERICC in order to coordinate joint support. NERICC led the convening of a two-day meeting with vulnerable LGAs in phases. Feedback on RI performance was provided and discussed in detail , as well as strategies to improve perfor mance such as Optimized Integrated Routine Immunization Strengthening (OIRIS). The LGAs developed action plans and were followed up through NERICC. The polio infrastructure in the affected states was used to support planning, implementation and monitoring of action plans to improve performance, including participation in the State Emergency Routine Immunization Coordination Centers (SERICC). Some of the key interventions conducted to improve routine immunization services in the high - risk states /LGAs included: implementation of OIRIS, implementation of daily fixed sessions in tertiary and secondary health facilities, intensification of outreach services, REW micro planning and implementation of intensified integrated RI services/local immunization days (LIDs) and IMO . 2.6. Mobile Outreach es in Hard to Reach Areas This strategy is to improve RI reach to hard -to-reach (HTR) settlements through the use of mobile health outreach sessions. These teams provide integrated RI services with other health interventions such as treatment of minor ailments, antenatal care and n utritional services. There is steady increase in the contribution of HTR teams to the state OPV coverage from 2016 to 2019. Similarly, the intervention has provided other services to over 450,000 clients in 2019. Table 6: Children reached with OPV, HTR, 2019 27 2.7. Directly Observed Polio vaccination (DOPV) In polio high -risk states, the directly observed polio vaccination (DOPV) is the vaccination of children under the direct supervision of an independent supervisor to ensure compliance. Attractive incentive s (pluses) are used to make parents / caregiver willingly submit their children for vaccination or the children are attracted to the vaccination teams outside the houses. In 2019, DOPV was implemented across the 11 high -risk states during each IPD, and the five outbreak responses conducted. 2.8. Strengthening Surveillance Strengthening surveillance: As Nigeria comes closer to being a polio -free nation, having a very sensitive surveillance for timely detection of poliovirus transmission cannot be overemphasized. The challenge for the country is to improve access to population in inaccessible areas especially in Borno where the programme doesn't have sufficient information on the population and w hether or not poliovirus transmission in these areas can be sustained. During the reporting period (as at week 52, 2019), a total of 7,333 AFP cases were reported. The Non -Polio AFP (NP -AFP), stool adequacy and Non -polio enterovirus rates were 7.6 (target 3/100,000 of population under 15 years), 94% (target 80%) and 14% (target 10%) respectively. The corresponding figures during the same period in 2018 were 9.5, 96% and 14%. All the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) achieved the two AFP s urveillance core indicators (NP -AFP and stool adequacy rates). In addition, the proportion of Local Government Areas (LGAs) that achieved the two core indicators in 2018 was 83% (target 80%) and 82% in 2019. The drop in the Non -Polio AFP rate from 2017 to 2019 is not unconnected with measures taken by the country to improve surveillance data quality including training and sensitization of surveillance focal points including DSNOs, health facility focal persons and community informants, training of AFP veri fiers, introduction of data quality check templates, data harmonization meetings, peer review in high performing LGAs; and accountability among others. The proportion of AFP cases verified in 2018 and 2019 was 98 % (target 90%) and 96% respectively. Most ( 80%) AFP cases in 2019 were reported by health workers (32%), health facility surveillance focal persons (20%), community informants (14%), Vaccination teams (5%), and others (5%). All the 774 LGAs in the country have reported at least one AFP case in 2019.The number of polio compatible cases so far in 2019 was five as against 13 in 2018. 28 Figure 1 4: Trend of Core AFP Surveillance Indicators (2010 -2019) One of the key driver s of quality surveillance performance in the country is the sheer number, spread and categories of surveillance personnel that are formally trained every year. This formal training is in addition to on the job training that takes place during other survei llance activities such as supervision, active surveillance and meetings among others. The number of key surveillance personnel trained and sensitized in 2019 was 123,264 as against 102,718 in 2018. These trained personnel include the Disease Surveillance a nd Notification Officers (DSNOs) and their assistants (ADSNOs), State Epidemiologists, Clinicians, community informants and partner agency staff among others. In 2019, the poliovirus surveillance guideline was updated to include innovations being implemen ted and other guidance received from both regional and global bodies. In addition, an abridged version of the guidelines for health facility surveillance focal points was also developed. Copies of both the abridged (11,000) and the main guideline (4,000) w ere printed and distributed to surveillance officers at all levels. On the road to being polio -free: As at the end of 2019, Nigeria has not reported any case or isolate of wild poliovirus for over three years. In this light, The African Regional Certification Commission (ARCC), invited the country to present its complete documentation for a polio -free sta tus in June 2020 and has also planned two field verification visits to Nigeria: Southern States: 9 -20th December 2019 and Northern States: 2 -13th of March 2020. In preparation of planned ARCC field visits, the country implemented a PEI peer review document ation in August 2019 to support the states, LGAs and health facilities to have adequate documentation that will ensure a polio -free status. In all, 36 states plus FCT, 765 LGAs and 14,552 health facilities were visited by 1,970 reviewers. At the 29 end of the exercise and after implementing corrective actions, the overall assessment score for the state, LGA and facility levels were 93%, 95% and 94% respectively. A mock review was also conducted in prioritized states ((high population: Kano and Lagos, affected by insurgency: Kwara, States with polio laboratory: Borno, and Oyo).) and follow up assessment was conducted in all the 17 southern states to ensure recommendations from the previou s exercise have been implemented and gains sustained. Table 7: Performance of PEI peer review documentation by state, LGA and health facility in August 2019 First phase of ARCC verification visit: In the final stage of the country being declared poli o-free, the ARCC visited the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and six Southern states (Abia, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Lagos and Oyo) from 9th to 20th December 2019 to conduct a critical analysis and verification of the certification documents prepared by the Nig erian Government. In each of the states visited, routine immunization, cold chain, surveillance activities and documentation were assessed, including those at the LGA and health facility levels. All three levels of health facilities; primary, secondary and tertiary were assessed for validity and accuracy of their documents and the polio eradication processes carried out at those levels. At the end of the verification visit, a debriefing session was organized with the Honourable Minister of Health, Dr Osagi e Ehanire. During the debriefing, The ARCC Chair, Professor Rose Leke, represented by a member of the ARCC, Dr Allen King, expressed confidence that Southern Nigeria is on course to being polio -free. She recommended that \"updated preparedness and 30 response plans must be available in all states, and government must ensure all levels of the health system maintain and strengthen AFP and environmental surveillance systems.\" In addition, she called for an increase in local funding in view of declining do nor support and stated that \"concerted efforts should be made to improve access to primary health facilities through improvements of roads, power supply, communication and transportation. This infrastructure should be prioritized for all health facilities. In addition, Nigeria needs to fast track the implementation of e -patient records with unique identification numbers at all levels and provide appropriate training to enhance capacity of health workers at all levels.\" To fully verify and consider Nigeria p olio free, the ARCC will reconvene in March 2020 for a final verification visit to states in Northern Nigeria. Based on the team's recommendations, Nigeria may receive polio free status, while the African Region could be certified to have eradicated polio by June 2020 should the final documentation be accepted. Validation of Surveillance Data and Peer Reviews : Quality surveillance information is crucial for certification. Several surveillance reviews have recommended the improvement of surveillance data. To this end, the country has introduced a quarterly peer review of states with high AFP surveillance performance and has as well introduced trigger criteria ( LGAs with 10 times AFP detected than the expected or LGAs with 10 AFP cases with 100% stool a dequacy ) of peer review for states to use as part of self - assessment. In 2019, States like Adamawa, and Benue have successfully used the trigger criter ia to conduct local peer reviews. The peer review started in August 2017 and by May 2019, the review was conducted in a total of 15 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The average true AFP and stool adequacy concordances were 77% and 79% respec tively. The state with the least True AFP and stool adequacy concordance was Bayelsa with 56% for both scores. At the end of each peer review, surveillance improvement plans are developed by the states with the support of reviewers. Implementation of such plans are expected to be monitored and the results shared with the national level. Experience from the reviews conducted so far shows that the most common reasons why cases are ruled out as Not True by reviewers are Spastic Paralysis, Malnutrition, Sickle Cell Disease, Trauma and Injection Pains/abscess. The main causes of inadequate stools on the other hand were collection of two samples less than 24 hours apart, failure to ask parents when the second stool was collected in relation to the first one, inade quate communication between the investigator and caregiver, inadequate interview skills of the investigator to elicit exact date of onset of paralysis and attitudinal problems. One of the main conclusions of surveillance peer reviews so far conducted was t hat AFP case definition was not strictly applied by field personnel including verifiers. Training of 348 AFP verifiers (CCs, LGAFs, Stoppers, ZCs, STCs) was conducted in order to further improve 31 surveillance data quality and guide strict application of AFP case definition as well as improve capacity on neurological examination and differentiating AFP from other common local diseases and conditions (e.g. Malnutrition, Sickle Cell Disease). AFP verification is an added advantage to the Nigerian surveillance system in that it acts as a filter to sieve out all cases that are Not True AFP cases. Trainers in this regard included senior personnel from teaching hospitals and other institutions (Pediatricians, Hematologists, Nutritionist), WHO and government personn el. State Coordinators, Zonal Coordinators and Monitoring and Evaluation officers are expected to validate at least 5 -10% of verified AFP cases. While AFP verification data is used to update the AFP surveillance database, validation data on the other hand is used to among others assess the quality of verification and build capacity of the verifiers as well as give feedback. Table 8: True AFP and Stool Adequacy Rate Concordance by State, 2017 -2018 Period States Environmental Surveillance : Environmental surveillance (ES) is the regular collection of sewage or wastewater contaminated with faecal matter in identified high risk areas and testing the sample in the laboratory for the presence of poliovirus. This provi des complementary information to strengthen the AFP surveillance system and further guide Nigeria's polio eradication program with targeted interventions. In 2018, Environmental surveillance was being implemented in 20 states and the Federal Capital Territ ory (FCT) and in 78 collection sites. Additional environmental sites were established in 2019 based on poliovirus epidemiology as well as the capacity of the laboratory 32 to accommodate expansion. By December 2019, the country had 113 (88 routine and 25 Adho c) ES sites in 29 states and FCT. There are only seven Ekiti, Nasarawa and Ondo) in the country that are yet to initiate environmental surveillance. Prior to 2019, all ES samples were tested in Ibadan Polio laborat ory; however, in March 2019, Maiduguri laboratory started independent ES testing of ES samples from Borno state only following a successful ES sample parallel testing (in four selected ES sites from Borno) with Ibadan polio laboratory from December 2018 to March 2019. In 2020, after a comprehensive review of ES performance, the country intends to have all the 36 states and FCT implementing ES with an average of three ES sites per state. In Addition, The ES sites will be redistributed among the two national polio laboratories such that each laboratory analyzes ES samples from states that traditionally submit their AFP samples to the laboratory for analysis. Innovative approaches to increase surveillance reach in security -compromised areas: One of the main ch allenges to completion of the job of polio eradication in Nigeria is the presence of areas with trapped populations that have not been reached for several years with either surveillance or immunization activities. D espite these security challenges, surveil lance continues to be strong due to multiple innovative strategies such as engagement and sensitization of community informants from inaccessible areas and partnership with security personnel including the Military and civilian Joint Task Forces (cJTF) in order to access areas that are ether partially or totally inaccessible. Some of the key activities that are being conducted to specifically increase surveillance reach in security -compromised areas include the following: a) Surveillance through Reaching Every Settlement (RES) and Reaching Inaccessible Children (RIC) Strategies: The RES strategy has been implemented with the military, civilian Joint Task Force (cJTF) and immunization personnel to reach partially accessible settlements with immunization services as well as surveillance activities including active case search, case investigation and identification and engagement of community informants. The RIC strategy has been conducted by the military alone following training of personnel to provide immunizatio n services and search for AFP cases among populations they liberated in inaccessible areas. In 2018, six AFP cases were reported in Borno state through this partnership. In 2019, four suspected AFP cases were reported however after investigation: 3 were no t true AFP cases and 1 was a previously investigated AFP case (NIE-BOS-KDG -19-001) which was positive for cVDPV2 reported earlier in 2019 b) Stool sample collection from healthy children: During Phase 1 healthy children sampling in Borno state from January to October 2017, a total of 242 stool samples were collected from Under 10 years old healthy children from 12 inaccessible/partially accessible LGAs of Borno and from one LGA each from Yo be (Gujiba) and 33 Adamawa (Madagali) states. In addition, one stool sample was collected from a healthy child coming from Niger republic. No WPV, cVDPV or VDPV was isolated in any of the samples. Phase 2 of the healthy children sampling was continuous as op posed to the targeted phase 1 strategy. Stool samples were collected from new arrivals of nomadic children, RIC/RES strategy whenever they visited non -reporting Wards since 2017 and new arrival IDPs entering IDP camps. Samples were collected within 7 days of entry into IDP camps or arrival in a Borno LGA for nomads, all in children less than 10 years. An additional strategy for healthy child sampling was introduced in 2019; Stool sampling from not true AFP cases evacuated by community informants from inacc essible areas (CIIA). This involves collection of one stool sample from children evacuated from insecure areas as suspected AFP cases, but after investigation by LGA surveillance officers were classified as not true AFP (i.e. not meeting AFP case definitio n) In 2018, 723 stool samples from healthy children were collected: 521 from trapped IDPS entering IDP camps, 81 Nomadic populations and 121 RES/RIC. No WPV nor VDPV were detected from these stool samples, four of the stool samples were positive for Sabin 2. In 2019, 308 stool samples from healthy children were collected: 138 from trapped IDPS entering IDP camps, 131 from Nomadic populations, 11 RES/RIC and 28 from \"not true AFP\" cases from insecure areas. As at week 52 2019, a total of 301 out of 308 healt hy child stool samples collected had been processed: no WPV were detected from these stool samples, one cVDPV2 was detected from a stool sample collected from a \"not true AFP\" from insecure areas, seven of the stool samples were positive for Sabin 2.

The second phase of ES 'sweep' was conducted from 19 February to 7 March 2018. This time around, in addition to ES sample collection (as in Phase 1), sample collectors also took pictures of the sites and geo -coordinates using mobile phones and sent the data in the ODK platform. In this phase, 42 samples from security compromised LGAs were collected. The results of these samples showed that 35 samples were negative, and seven samples isolated non -polio enteroviruses Figure 1 5: Outcome of Borno environmental surveillance sweep samples, 2018 d) Engaging Community Informants from Inaccessible settlements: Informants from inaccessible areas are any persons residing in inaccessible settlements with regular contact (weekly, fortnightly or monthly contacts) with secure areas. Contact with secure areas is usually to utilize basic services like health care, market or visitation of relatives. Such community informants include persons like lamidos, hunters, drivers, fishermen, cJTF, informal health care providers (TBA, drug retailers/hawkers). Informants a re engaged through LGA Community Informants Focal persons in collaboration with the LGA DSNO. LGA Community Informant Focal Persons include Nomadic/Miyetti Allah or Lamido, Bulamas, Market leaders. Each informant engaged uses his \"circle of influence\" to e ngage other informants who also have regular contact with secure areas and link them with LGA Community Informants Focal Persons. 35 As at December 2019, 1,241 of these informants were recruited. Of the 162 AFP cases reported from inaccessible areas in Borno, 156(96%) were reported by informants from the inaccessible areas. The NPENT rate of these cases was 21.2%, stool adequacy 80.9% and Sabin detection 5.8% compared with performance over the same period as at as at December 2018 where NPENT rate was 23 .5%, Stool adequacy of 61.6% and Sabin detection of 13.0% for the 127 cases reported from inaccessible areas. Figure 1 6: Outcome of AFP cases reported by community informants from inaccessible areas in 2019 e) Stool samples from AFP Contacts reported from inaccessible areas in 2019 With the introduction of community informants from inaccessible areas, the number of inadequate AFP cases in Borno states increased in 2018. To this special category of AFP cases, it was not always easy to systematically get contacts stool samples as it had to also involve evacuating the healthy children from same security compromised settlements. In all 212 contact stool samples were collected in 2018, one of whom turned out to be cVDPV2 and 6 Sabin 2. In 2 019, a total of 256 (53%) contact samples from a possible 486 contact samples were collected, cVDPV2 was isolated into two contact samples and 8 Sabin 2. 36 Figure 1 7: Outcome of Borno stool samples from AFP contacts from inaccessible areas in 2019 f) Surveil lance reach In 2019, a total of 12,516 settlements have been reached with sustained surveillance while 3,528 were reached with sporadic surveillance (RES/RIC vaccination teams only). An estimated 1,321 geo locations/settlements remain unreached by surveill ance as at December 2019 . CIIA have reached 3,409 security compromised geo locations with valid geo evidence; 563 of these geo -locations have not been previously reached by any other intervention for surveillance or vaccination activities . 525 of the previ ously unreached security compromised location were reached with polio vaccines in addition to polio surveillance by CIIA. 37 Figure 1 8: Borno Surveillance reach maps as at 21st December 2019 National Polio Committees: National Certification Committee (NCC); National Task Force on Containment (NTF); and National Polio Expert Committee (NPEC) in the country are functional. The committees hold regular meetings (at least quarterly) and provide guidance to the polio eradication programme in the co untry. As at December 2019, NPEC classified five cases of polio compatibles from five states (Bauchi, Borno, Kaduna, Kebbi and Lagos). National Polio Laboratories: There are two national polio laboratories in Nigeria (Ibadan and Maiduguri). The two polio laboratories After the last accreditation of 2018, Ibadan and Maiduguri National Polio Laboratories have again in November and December 2019 achieved full WHO accreditation respectively. Auto -Visual AFP Detection and Reporting (AVADAR): An initiative to strengthen surveillance through a mobile phone based reporting system, the Auto -Visual AFP Detection and Reporting (AVADAR), that sought to improve the detection and reporting of AFP cases and raise awareness of AFP surveillance among heal th workers and key community informants was introduced in 2016. Following pilots (in Kuje and Oyun LGAs of FCT 38 and Kwara respectively) in September and October 2016, AVADAR was found to be a high impact innovation that enabled timely AFP detection, investi gation and verification, while at the same time improving 'zero' reporting of cases. From this pilot, the project as at December 2019 was being implemented in 10 States (Abia, Adamawa, Borno, and FCT. As at week 52, 2019 the proportion of AFP cases reported by AVADAR informants in implementing States was 68 % (508/748). Figure 1 9: Performance of AVADAR by States in 2019 Temperature monitoring of sample transportation: The World Health Organization collaborated with CDC in 2017 to pilot temperature tracking of AFP and environmental samples from ten pilot states. The main objective of temperature tracking was to track temperature of AFP stool specimens from the point of specimen collecti on (caregivers' homes or health facility) to delivery at the national polio laboratories (Ibadan and Maiduguri) using logtags. Results of the temperature tracking showed that the quality of reverse cold chain can be improved through effective interventions when the underlying factors of poor performance are known. The temperature tracking gave insights into the causes of poor reverse cold chain in the homes of AFP cases and on transit and has enabled appropriate actions to be taken to improve the non -polio enterovirus rate in the states and the country at large. The temperature tracking continued through 2019 with expansion in 2018 to include all LGAs Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States to bring the number of implementing states to 27 and 151 39 LGAs from 86 LGAs an d 25 States in 2017. This was made possible through acquisition of additional LogTag trackers from CDC. Samples with temperature excursions are investigated by states using a standard template in order to understand the reason/s for such excursions and for appropriate interventions to be taken. In 2019, 100% of tracked samples were transported to the laboratory by trained couriers (either DSNO, ADSNO or health facility surveillance focal person). The major reasons for temperature excursions (>8 C) include difficulty in sourcing well frozen icepacks by DSNOs and vehicle breakdown on the way to the laboratory. Other reasons include inappropriate storage of sample carriers in the homes and frequent opening of sample carriers by caregivers. The Figure below com pares the performance of temperature tracking in the period Jan - Dec 2018 and 2019. Since the start of temperature tracking to the end of 2019, a total of 1,041 AFP samples have been tracked out of which 220(21%) samples had temperature excursion. Figure 20: Performance of temp erature . tracking Jan uary -December 2018/2019. 2.9 Cross Border Collaboration Cross -border AFP surveillance activities have continued to be given priority, especially following the current cVDPV2 outbreak in northern Nigeria which started since 2018. A single cVDPV2 emergence (designated JIS -1) first detected by environmental survei llance in Jigawa State in January 2018 later spread other Yobe) within the country and then internationally to Niger, and subsequently to Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Chad and Togo. States that conducted cross -border activities in 2019 include Adamawa (with Cameroon), Borno (with Niger Republic), Niger (with Benin Republic), Ogun and Oyo (with Benin Republic). Additional e fforts were increased to e nhance cross border collaboration and coordination with Cameroun due to the influx of refugees following civil unrest and agitations in that country. In addition, a cross border surveillance meeting was held in September 2019 between Borno State and Niger Team (Diffa Region) to enhance cross border detection and reporting of AFP cases following the confirmation of a cVDPV2 case in Niger from a nomadic family that moved between the two countries highlighting the need for strengthening of coordination of surv eillance activities along the borders. In addition, a cross -border cVDPV2 outbreak investigation and response were conducted between Toumour, -Niger area and Malam Fatouri, Abadam LGA of Borno state. Other cross -border activities conducted by concerned states include the following: - Review and sensitization of border community informants - Enhance active surveillanc e and retroactive case search in health facilities along the borders - Review of focal sites along the border areas - Community active case search for AFP cases - Sharing of contacts and standard tool for cross -border notification 2.10 Strengthening of Vaccin e Accountability The implementation of the mOPV2 campaigns provided an opportunity to pilot and scale up best practices in vaccine accountability. The following measures were instituted to ensure vaccine accountability for SIAs: A Vaccine Accountabilit y Management (S -VAM) framework was developed with guidance notes to explain the expected roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders. This ensured that cold chain and vaccine management systems and mechanisms were in place at different levels before, du ring and after a campaign The logistics requests from States to National level , were based on agreed population figures arrived at by the National EOC based on the lates t enumeration 41 outcomes and other program data. Strategic buffer was stored at zonal level to address any eventual additional requirements from States. Cold Chain Officers and Senior S upervisors were trained on the guidelines for management of polio vaccines (bOPV/mOPV2) which included the rigorous implementation of the accountab ility process, deployment of vaccine management tools such as the tally sheets and summaries, the form A and S -VAM to all levels. Daily call in data for vaccine accountability was reinforced, while returns of empty vials was closely monitored to ensure fu ll accountability for doses deployed. From State to teams, documentation of number of vials given out and returned were available. At the end of a campaign or OBR round, reconciliation of vaccines deployed and utilized was done and reported using S -VAM for m. Senior Logistician s from national and zonal level were deployed as part of the MST deployment during mOPV2 and all other OPV campaigns. To further strengthen management and acc ountability of mOPV2 vaccines, W ard Vaccine Accountability Officers were enga ged in all implementing wards and this strategy paid off as all mOPV2 vaccine vials were accounted for throughout the year. Documentation at all levels was strengthened by ensuring that all arrival procedures at the national level were strictly adhered to. The arrival procedures at national level were modified for State and LGA levels and the necessary documentation was put in place. I. State LWGs were required share their distribution plans with the National LWG for proper tracking, guidance and accountability. The same process was encouraged at the state level for the LGAs. II. For in between rounds: thorough stock reconciliation wa s conducted by the national and zonal logistics teams with the support of the National EOC. Records of OPV vaccine deployed to each state were compared with available data on stock received, number of vials dispatched to the field, number of vials returned opened or unopened, number of vials held in storage. Any identified gaps were closed to ensure that activities continued to be implemented. III. At vaccination team level: The correct use of the tally sheets continued to be encouraged while also ensuring that all vaccine vials were kept in Ziploc bags in the vaccine carriers. When mOPV2 vaccine was used, the Ziploc bags were labelled with stickers indicating \"mOPV2 only\" to ensure segregation from other vaccines. At the LGA level, small bags were provided for packaging used vials in predetermined numbers for easy accountability. Bigger sacks were provided for the safe storage of the returned used vials before transportation to final disposal sites. The use of these bags was to prevent spillage especially from u sed vials thereby contaminating surfaces and posing risk to the programme in terms of incidences of VAPPs and cVDPV 2s. 42 There was great improvement in vaccine management and accountability espe cially after the deployment of Ward Vaccine Accountability O fficers for mOPV2 campaigns and ensuring the implementation of the S -VAM framework. 3.0. REMAINING CHALLENGES FOR FOCUS IN 20 20 3.1 Reaching the remaining children still trapped in very insecure areas of Borno State As at May 2020, an estimated 29,376 children remain trapped in very security challenged settlements in Borno1. In 2019, Community informants were able to reach several Island settlements in Lake Chad with vaccines and surveillance activities. However, some settlements have not been reached. The evolving insecurity too has hampered the pace of implementation of other special interventions like RIC/Buratai initiative. The push of these interventions will be a key priority in 2020 3.2 Interrupting cVDPV2 transmission in 2020 As the country prepare for polio free status certification, control of cVDPV2s is a key priority for the Polio program. From January 2018 until Dec 2019, a total of 7 lineages of cVDPV2 were in circulation in Nigeria. Several innovative strategies were dep loyed interrupting 6 lineages. The remaining lineage needs to be interrupted in 2020.The National EOC has developed several strategies to improve population immunity in areas with vulnerable populations. The summary of such initiatives is: a) Development of a SIA continuity plan post COVID 19 Pandemic lockdown b) Strategic use of fractional IPV in areas with low Population immunity 3.3 Intensify In -between round activities (IBRA) To maintain population immunity, the Program will intensify in between round activities in high risk areas that are traditional potential polio sanctuaries. These activities include: a) Weekly market vaccinations b) Hospital vaccinations c) International Border vaccinations d) CMAM vaccinations e) Vaccinations in settlements with securi challenges f) Nomadic route vaccinations g) IDP camp vaccinations 1 Based on aggregated data from satellite imagery, vaccination tracking , and vaccination through special interventions 43 3.4 Mobile populations Fully extending program reach to the mobile and nomadic populations remains a challenge due to their dynamic movement typically in security compromised, hard -to-reach, scattered, and border settlements. Insecurity due to insurgency in the northeast of the country and the lake chad basin countries and farmer/herder conflicts in several states impact the migratory routes, duration, and period of movements. Besides, insecurity impedes the delivery of services to these populations. The latter is also constrained by the hard t o reach terrain which poses physical accessibility and higher logistic requirements in the bigger context of diminishing program funds Other challenges include limited data on the movements particularly of nomadic pastoralists or when known are not readily available to programs for use in the planning of Polio Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIAs) and outbreak response. Further, the closure of the GPEI Lake Chad Basin Task Team based in N'djamena has created a short -term challenge in coordinating effo rts between Nigeria and the neighbouring countries. To sustain the implementation of planned cross border activities, the country will engage the countries bilaterally focusing particularly at sub -national levels. 44 Population Immunity Gaps Population immunity profile analysis indicates a waning type 2 population immunity in the southern states and type 1 immunity in some of the Northern states , posing a potential risk for continued transmission of wild poliovirus particularly in Northcentral (especially Kogi and Kwara) and North western states. Figure 21 below illustrates gaps of type 1 and 2 immunity profile across the states by July, 2019. However, it does not take into account all eight reactive mOPV 2 campaigns held in 24 Northern and Southern states (some states had > 3 campaigns) as well as IPV RI intensification in 15 states, which would have boosted both type 1 and 2 immunities to some extent by end of December 201 9 and beyond ). Figure 21: Type 1 and 2 population immunity profile, Nigeria, July 2019 (Source: Institute of Disease Modelling (IDM) . The cVDPV2s detected from the environment (54) and AFP cases (18) in 16 states in northern and Southern states in Nigeria further indicated gaps in population immunity.

There was non -fulfillment of financial commitments and lack of release of counterpart funding in several states. The tracking of Abuja commitments indicated all the tracked indicators were below 50%. Personal involvement of the Governors however had incre ased from 16% in quarter 1 to 4 4% in quarter 4 of 201 9. Counterpart funding stagnated between 35 to 44 % in 2019 .

Areas of inaccessibility still exist in the security challenged state of Borno. In addition , surveillance gaps have been id entified during peer reviews and supervision. These gaps include an element of poor surveillance data quality, inadequate active surveillance, and knowledge gap s among surveillance personnel, presence of polio compatible cases; and inadequate documentation ; among others. 46 3.7 Vaccine Management Challenges still prevail with data accuracy, completeness and timeliness especially at the last mile. State Governments have not uniformly embraced the system of empty vial retrieval for RI vaccines . Several states still report shorta ge of giostyle vaccine carriers. 4 GOAL, TARGETS, AND MILESTONES FOR 20 20 4.1 Goal The overall goal of the NPEEP 20 20 is to achieve and sustain interruption of all poliovirus transmission. 4.2 Targets Target 1: Receive WPV1 polio free certification by June 2020 Target 2 : Increase reach of inaccessible areas in Borno by June 20 20 Target 3: Interrupt cVDPV2 transmission by March 20 20 Target 4: Achieve and sustain surveillance performance indicat ors in all LGAs by June 2020 Target 5: Achieve 50% reduction in number of unimmunized children in VVHR LGAs by December 2020 Target 5 : Polio Transiti on Business Case finalized and approved by March 20 20 4.3 Major Milestones 1) Scale up special interventions (RIC scale up, RES others) to reach trapped populations (in security compromised areas) of Borno and Yobe States by June 201 9 2) Polio certification documentation prepared and presented to ARCC by November 2019 3) High quality outbreak and mop -up responses to cVDPV2 implemented timely 4) Expand environmental surveillance to at least three additional states by December 2019 5) Expand the surveillance reporting network of health facilities and community informants by at least 10% from 2018 figures 6) All high risk and vulnerable LGAs have ro utine immunization strengthening plans (as developed by NERICC) implemented throughout 2019 with joint close monitoring by EOC and NERICC 7) Finaliz e Polio transition business case by March 20 20 47 5. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR 2020 The global Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID -19) pandemic has greatly impacted on the activities that will help ac hieve the NPEEP 2020. T he Federal Government on the 24th of March restricted non -essential staff to work from home. The above development underscores the need to develop a contingency plan allowing some activities that will sustain the gains in the polio eradication initiative in the states, especially the high -risk states. The plan is to ensure the continuity of essential polio supplementary immunization activities (SIA) and in between round activities within the context of measures taken by the government to control the COVID -19 pandemic . The strategic priorit ies for 20 20 within the context of C OVID -19 as identified by the National EOC in consultation with immunization partners and local stakeholders include: 1) Increasing access to vaccination in security challenged areas and IDPs (particularly in Born o, Yobe a nd Lake Chad islands ). 2) Identification of emerging security issues in States outside Borno and Yobe and apply strategies to reach children in these areas 3) Interrupting any cVDPV2 outbreak and ensuring robust outbreak response across all states 4) Sustaining re silience towards certification. 5) Enhance quality and sensitive surveillance 6) Enhancing SIA quality in prioritized vulnerable areas 7) Enhancing routine immunization in polio high risk LGAs 8) Strengtheni ng cross border collaboration 9) Improving and strengthening quality assurance of all Polio data and 10) Complete p olio transition planning These strategies will aim to achieve the country's set goal, targets and milestones and will be underpinned by strict adherence to the accountability framework. 5.1 Increasing access to vaccination in security challenged areas and IDPs : Insecurity and lack of access remain the most significant risk factor to achieving interruption WPV circulation and eradication of Polio. In 2020, the program will continue to focus attention in security compromised areas and ensure it is able to penetrate, reach and vaccinate eligible children and conduct surveillance activities, as much as possible. The north -eastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa will continue to be special area s of focus in addition to other hot spots in north central and north -western zones. Key Activities 1. Vaccination in completely inaccessible areas (Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States): 48 Sustaining implementation of RIC, RES and vaccination by CIIAs are critica l to accessing the remaining security challenged areas. As at the end of 2019 in Borno state, the number of settlements reached were 12,821 representing a 62% improvement in Vaccination reach relative to December 2016 vaccination reach of 7,926 settlemen ts. Furthermore, 81 islands in the Lake Chad have been reached with surveillance and vaccination, using community informants The goal in 2020 is to intensify implementation of these strategies to make inroads to reach the remaining inaccessible settlements by July 2020. These strategies will be extended to reach the 175/256 Lake Chad Islands on the Nigeria side in five LGAs (Abadam, Kukawa, Marte, Monguno and Ngala) that have not visited. The community informants' network in security comprom ised areas of Borno State, though used primarily for surveillance activities will be expanded and further explored to reach more inaccessible areas with vaccination. In Yobe State, since the discontinuation of RIC in 2017, RES which was transitioned in 20 18 to house to house vaccination continued in 2019. This intervention was conducted in five LGAs namely: Damaturu, Geidam, Gujba, Tamuwa and Yunusari . RES will continue alongside enhanced routine immunization and special interventions in 2020. In 2019, Adamawa had two security compromised LGAs namely Michika and Madagali owing to insurgency . These LGAs shares border with Borno state along the Gwoza axis. However, s ecurity deteriorated in other LGAs related to communal clashes, armed banditry and kidnaping in Noman, Gombi, Fufore, Girei, Song, and Hong. The program will continue to use satellite imagery to determine habitation to inform microplanning for vaccination activities in insecure areas. The special int ervention strategy will continue to be implemented in 2020, permanent transit teams will be deployed with vaccines, (OPV and IPV including routine antigens) at all potential routes from the Islands and other security challenged areas for profiling and vacc ination of these children from trapped populations. The mobile hard to reach (HTR) teams will also be deployed to geographically difficult areas as well as vulnerable population like the Nomads. In addition, the program will continue with military and cJTF including to provide information on potential movement or displacement of trapped population for better planning and anticipation of response activities. 2. Validation of inaccessibility data: The program will continue to rely on geo -evidence as a proxy indication of activity conducted in insecure areas. In 2019 accessibility activities and data generated were tracked, reviewed and analyzed regularly used to monitor progress in surveillance and vaccination reach. The program hopes to deploy Geospatial Tracking system (GTS) which is a 49 lightweight version of vaccination tracking system (VTS) by end of quarter one 2020 for capturing of geo -evidence by community informers from inaccessible areas 3. Deployment of National and S tate EOC personnel: In 2020, deployment of personnel to support PEI activities in Borno and Yobe States will continue with focus on high risk LGAs. These personnel will conduct integrated supportive supervision not only for SIAs b ut other PEI activities like Routine immunization, Surveillance and special interventions. The State EOC in conjunction with the National EOC will align deployment plans that will ensure all the LGAs with special needs are assigned supervisors from nationa l level on a rotational basis. This will ensure liberated LGAs as well as those that are recently liberated are supervised by personnel deployed from national level and within the State 4. Expand and strengthen Routine Immunization Services in IDP camps : Currently most IDP camps have clinics or health facilities where in addition to provision of basic health services they also routine immunization and surveillance. Defaulters will continue to be tracked using FVs, VCM and Community leaders using th e current community engagement strategy. The cards will also be used to provide other child survival interventions in the camp. In the event of the camps being closed and populations moving back to their former locations, a deliberate policy to re -establis h RI services within a 30 -day period will be facilitated starting with provision of cold chain equipment as well as staffing. IDPs in host communities will continue to reached with routine vaccines by the Community IDP tracking teams as well as outreach se rvices from catchment health facilities. 5. Scale up permanent vaccination sites at all major transit points : In 2019, the program deployed different special intervention vaccination strategies aimed at vaccinating eligible children in transit as well as tho se internally displaced. Borno state engaged about 427 permanent vaccination teams to immunize children coming out from inaccessible areas. These teams are located in strategic locations in markets, military check points, nomadic routes, CMAM sites and IDP s camps. Profiling was also done in all these vaccination points and 25,088 children vaccinated. The profiling guides the state to evaluate by proxy the immunity status of the inaccessible areas of origin as well as track defaulters for completion of 5 dos e of OPV in short intervals. Though the inaccessible LGAs increased from two to four, with Kukawa and Guzamala becoming inaccessible in December 2018, the special intervention continued to vaccinate children from these LGAs. 180 and 5,820 children were cinated Marte LGAs while 9,634 children were vaccinated in Guzamala and Kukawa respectively. The permanent vaccination sites will be continuing to be reviewed based on the evolving security situation and regularly sup ervised and monitored to assess their impact at the deployed location. 50 6. Reaching other Insecure States: Some states in the north -western region of Nigeria have been contending with the challenge of insecurity due to kidnapping, armed robbery and cattle ru stling. This has made some wards and LGAs in 5 including Bauchi inaccessible for SIAs. Special interventions will continue to be implemented in these insecure areas based on accessibility. Taraba had a different type of se curity challenge which involved mainly communal clashes and constant clashes between herdsmen and farmers. These clashes usually disrupt immunization activities. In 20 20, special emphasis will be made to vaccinate in the affected areas. Key Activitie s in 20 20: Surveillance Continue to expand the CIIAs network to reach the remaining 1,401 unreached locations as at December 2019 Pilot and expand the deployment of GTS in the CIIAs intervention Continue to implement Surveillance during implementation of RIC and RES Continue Healthy child stool sample collection for New arrival IDPs, false AFP evacuated by CIIAs, new arrival nomads and Healthy child stool sampling in silent wards during RES. Expand AVADAR network to newly liberated LGAs w ith restored mobile network. Continue AFP surveillance by special intervention and HTR mobile teams Strengthen community surveillance through close tracking of community informants Zero reports Sustain implementation of e surveillance with regular feedback on program performance Continue to use Polio structure to implement IDSR at all levels SIAs and Special intervention Continue to advocate and implement the revised 'RIC' strategy of dedicated RIC teams across the 17 LGAs in the state to reach 80% of remaining inaccessible settlements by end of December 2020 Intensify use of VTS and ODK by military, cJTFs and CIIAs during vaccination in insecure areas. Continuous tracking of trapped population using satellite imagery 51 Sustain the regular high -level advo cacy to military and the agreed monthly briefing of RIC/RES with the Governor and Theater Commander Sustain permanent team vaccination in special places and IDPs in Camp as well as host communities Sustain vaccination in Nomadic routes and CMAM centers Sustain the innovation of profiling and tracking with tickler cards for all new arrivals to camps and host communities Maintain quality SIAs among IDPs and special places Ensure vaccine and other commodities availability for special interventions in security compromised areas Sustain all innovations that improve quality of SIA - DOPV, HC, DC, Mock LQAS, VATA, and expand Mock LQAS to partially accessible LGAs Routine Immunization Continue to expand RI to partially accessible areas through the current RI expansi on strategy using cJTFs. Intensify the current strategy of 'Community Engagement' using traditional leaders (birth registration/line -listing, referral of newborn to HF for vaccination, tracking of defaulters) Strengthen the ongoing Intensified Outreach Strategy (IOS) to bring routine immunization closer to the caregivers Ensure availability of at least 2 technical personnel per HF for RI in newly liberated LGAs. Sustain integration of RI in special interventions (Transit, markets, CMAM, and Noma dic routes) Provide accurate and timely of vaccine utilization reports using the approved templates to the national Advocate to the government to increase skilled manpower for RI Targets, Milestones and Indicators: Cover and vaccinate 80% of remaining unr eached 1,401 locations by December 2020. Cover and vaccinate 80% of the lake Chad Islands by December 2020 Vaccinate all children including those who possibly missed vaccination from newly liberated areas by December 2020 52 5 contact vaccination by SIAD with in 10 weeks of new arrivals by the Special intervention teams January to December 2020 All new arrivals assumed to have suboptimal immunity to vaccine preventable diseases to have penta3/OPV3 within 3 months of arrival. Deploy GTS application to 70% of LGA s with CIIAs by September 2020 5.2 Interrupt cVDPV2 outbreak and ensure robust outbreak response Stopping the cVDPV2 outbreak: The reverberation of three years without detecting any case of wild poliovirus in Nigeria was attenuated by the continued transmission of cVDPV 2 with potential for moving to non -polio high risk states of the south and international spread. The mounted outbreak response efforts yielded significant success in halting the outbreak in most of the outbreak states but with tendenc y for spread to the southern states. Also, the polio sanctuary of Sokoto state, where intractable number of cases of cVDPV continued to be isolated from both the environment and AFP cases in 2019 remains to be of concern. Furthermore, lack of adequate quantity mOPV2 vaccine affected both the timeliness and scope/ scale of mounting outbreak response in 2019. The plan for 2020 is to review risk factors and develop mitigating measures to address incessant cases in cVDPV sanctuaries, maintain stro ng and responsive OBR teams to provide quality support for activities across all levels, ensure timely availability of mOPV2 and vaccine accountability; and RI intensification with IPV. In January 2020, the remaining outbreak response to Oyo cVDPV will be completed, while RI intensification with fIPV, will be conducted to boost population immunity in areas where mOPV2 SIAs were completed in Kogi state. In addition, the review of the 2019 OBRs activities will be done and lessons learned applied to improve quality of subsequent OBR. Maintaining strong and responsive outbreak response teams across all levels Strengthening resilience to achieve better quality campaigns, political commitment and right level of counterpart funding. The program in 2020 will re main alert to respond to any outbreak and or event as they may occur. Key to this is having an active and responsive outbreak response team with highest level of political will at both LGA, State and National levels. 53 In depth review of risk factors/ dete rminants to transmission in cVDPV sanctuaries/ potential sites NPEOC will review the approach and strategies to vaccine derived poliovirus outbreaks, especially in states with continued transmission of cVDPVs with well -developed operation plans/ standard o perating procedures and accountability framework enshrined. Vaccine Accountability The country will continue to monitor and validate the strategy of vaccine accountability, during and after each mOPV2 campaign to ensure no left -over vials in the field t o avoid misuse or accidental use and the possible effect of VAPP and cVDPV2. Already, checking for tOPV and mOPV2 vials is captured into routine support supervision system to ensure no mOPV2 or tOPV vial is left out. Responsibility is given to States for a ccounting of all vaccines deployed to them. The ward accountability officers are held accountable for retrieval for all vials used during the campaigns. Monitors will be trained and deployed to states to monitor disposal of all used or unused vials after c ampaign completion, based on global guidelines. A report of the validation, including number of vials disposed will be shared with AFRO and the Advisory Group. After the validation, surveillance for vials that could possibly have been missed during the im plementation will continue during each supportive supervision visit to the field. In 2020, special attention will be given to: Vaccine request and timely deployment for OBR Strengthening vaccine arrival processes (with appropriate documentation) at all levels to ensure accountability of vaccines. Continue strengthening knowledge and skills of cold chain officers and senior supervisors on the management and accountability of polio vaccines Reinforcing the ward accountability officers (WAO) in all SIA act ivities to strengthen vaccine accountability. Strengthening the deployment of the S -VAM framework to all states, LGAs and ward levels Support NERICC in the institutionalization and sustenance of monthly empty vial retrieval for all RI vaccines including tr iangulation of data (vaccine utilization data, number of children vaccinated, and empty vials retrieved) in priority LGAs Targets, Milestones and Indicators : Complete pending OBR rounds RI intensification in OBR states by January 2020 Review the approach and strategies to vaccine derived poliovirus outbreaks, especially in states with continued transmission of cVDPVs with well -developed operation plans by February 2020 54 Review, Reactivate and share names of National, State and LGA Outbre ak teams by March 2020 State Outbreak Response Plans developed and shared with National EOC by March 2020 National Outbreak Management Team deployed to outbreak states within 24 hours of non-Sabin ITD notification The first response to all poliovirus outbreaks conduc ted within 2 weeks of non -Sabin virus notification and the responses completed within 4 months. Timeliness of the outbreak responses to be monitored using the Outbreak dashboard mOPV2 released from global stock within 2 weeks of report of type2 virus Vacc ine utilization report compiled within 2 weeks of completion campaign mOPV2 destroyed systematically based on global standards 5.3 Sustaining resilience towards Certification Sustaining resilience beyond certification As at end of December 2019, Nigeria has marked its 39 month without a case of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) detected anywhere in the country. Having achieved this critical milestone, the African Regional Certification Committee for Polio Eradication Certification (ARCC) has commenced field verification and reviewing documentation of interruption of wild WPV -1. If the ARCC is satisfied with its field verification and national documentation, Nigeria will be declared WPV -free and Africa certified to have eradicated WP V1. This milestone will need to be cautiously communicated to the populace as the country is still transmitting cVDPV2. Also, all stakeholders will be intensely engaged to guide against complacency which can derail the gains that have been made. Concerted effort will be made to review the history of Polio eradication in Nigeria, acknowledge the achievements and document good practices and lessons learned. In 2020, communication and advocacy efforts will therefore focus on sustaining and strengthening resil ience beyond certification and until the country is free from all types of polio virus. An updated communication plan will be developed based on the EPI Communication Strategy for Expanded Programme on Immunization in Nigeria (\"EPI Communication Strategy\") - an overarching guideline for overall polio and RI communication activities. Dissemination of the strategy to polio and RI communication actors at all levels through cascaded workshops will be prioritized in early 2020 to ensure harmonization of interven tions and messaging. Guided by the EPI communication strategy, a new and nuanced message framework will be developed. This framework will support PHC communication agenda of the country - to announce a wild polio virus free Nigeria, and address any rumour s and false information, while emphasizing the importance of the continued polio campaigns and benefits of routine immunization. Targeted approach will be implemented for all key audiences --- political leaders, donors, community influencers as religious a nd traditional leaders, frontline workers and family and caregivers - to address the cVPDV2 transmission in the context of the WPV free status and seek their continued support for polio vaccination. States will be supported to produce customized behavior c hange communication (BCC) materials to suit their peculiarities. 55 The framework will also play a role in raising visibility of the polio programme. It will capture the journey of polio eradication in Nigeria and formally document all programme strategies, innovations, standard operating procedures, events as reference materials. An Online 'library' will be created as a repository of these documents, polio communication materials, tools and case studies to document and disseminate good practices and lessons learned. Intensive Advocacy commenced in 2019 will continue and be expanded in scope and reach. Political leaders and donors will be sensitized regularly on the need to remain committed to the polio programme post certification, to sustain the country's Po lio free status and improve RI services. Most donors and partners in the polio landscape, will commence their human resource ramp down in 2020. The programme will sensitize the leadership of partners and donors on how to effectively communicate the ramp d own to avoid any negative impact on personnel attitude and behaviour. Governors' Abuja commitment indicators will be reviewed and harmonized with the Governors' 2019 Seattle Declaration tracking indicators. The governors' performance will be tracked regularly, and feedback given to them through multiple channels such as duri ng PTFoPE meetings, NGF meetings, ES quarterly meetings, NTLC quarterly meetings, social media and newspaper publications. In line with the recommendation of the 37th ERC meeting, the Communication Working Group will support the Nomadic and Mobile Populat ion Working Group to develop a communication strategy for mobile and nomadic populations including collaboration with EPI communication teams of neighbouring Lake Chad countries to leverage on each other's strength. Traditional and religious leaders have c ontinued to play a pivotal role in sustaining community trust for the programme and in managing rumours and other misconceptions. The programme will continue to engage traditional and religious leaders, document and showcase their role and achievements as best practices. Integrated community engagement structures like CHIPS will be sensitized on trained on integrated messaging to promote polio vaccination in the context of the broader PHC Regular and timely social data analysis is one of the hallmarks of th e Nigerian PEI. The programme will sustain and intensify evidence -based communication and advocacy by conducting KAPs, Rapid surveys, risk perception surveys and Behavioral Surveillance Survey (BSS), to complement routine social data analysis within and in -between rounds. Key Activities 1. Communicating WPV certification Develop a message framework to guide all stakeholders in communicating the achieved milestone being declared WPV -free Develop and implement a communication plan for announcing Nigeria's WPV -free status and Africa's certification in June 2020 Develop integrated messages to reflect the country's post certification status, promoting continued polio vaccination within the context of RI and broader PHC 2. Enhancing quality of Communica tion Interventions 56 Conduct cascaded dissemination workshops for the Communication Strategy for Expanded Programme on Immunization in Nigeria; Conduct communication workshop with State Health Education Officers and support in -state cascade workshops in coll aboration with NERICC Review relevant SOPs in line with the EPI Communication Strategy Develop new print and audio -visual materials, including TV and radio Public Service Announcements (PSAs) to announce the WPV -free status of Nigeria and certification of Africa as Polio free. Engage and deploy H2H mobilizers prior to every SIAs to raise visibility and build household and community trust 3. Advocacy for political leaders and donors sustained commitment Advocate for integration of Abuja Commitment indicators with that of Seattle Declaration and track regularly and report at NEC and NGF meetings as well as ALGON meetings Track and report on Abuja Commitment through conventional and social media channels a nd platforms Produce and circulate quarterly immunization 'score card' for states and LGAs to facilitate ED/NPHCDA regular briefing of the Nigerian Governors' Forum & ALGON Conduct zonal sensitization meetings on immunization with ALGON executives Conduct retreat with LGA chairmen of low performing States (polio high risk and RI low coverage) Hold a high -level donor meeting with existing and new donors to explain the Polio Business Case and request their funding support. 4. Raising visibility of Polio Program me Develop online library/repository to showcase polio materials (written, photographic, audio, video) Document good practices and case studies to disseminate the achievement and innovation in polio programme Develop documentaries to tell the story of poli o eradication in Nigeria Develop infographics with latest information on polio eradication for social media platforms. 5. Media engagement Conduct media sensitisation workshops at national and sub -national levels with Journalists Against Polio (JAP) in stra tegic geopolitical locations. Maintain streamlined messaging on media to check rumours and misinformation 57 Sustain the Rumour Rapid Response teams at all levels Organize special media appearances by key stakeholders to keep polio issues on the front burner of national discourse Conduct field trips to specific locations with journalists to document efforts being made to sustain the achievements made. Support States to systematically engage the mass and traditional media 6. Communication for Mobile and Nomadic p opulation Conduct a KAP research on nomads' health seeking behaviour to guide communication planning Develop a communication plan to engage the leadership and sensitize them on the benefits of vaccination Develop and publish/broadcast BCC materials in local languages, targeting mobile and nomadic population Target, Milestone and indicators Communication Plan for communicating the country's certification developed and implemented by June 2020 Governors' Abuja Commitment indicators harmoniz ed with the Seattle Declaration Indicators and tracked quarterly from Q2 2020 Communication Strategy for Expanded Programme on Immunization in Nigeria rolled out by end March 2020 New message framework for post certification developed and rolled out by Ju ne 2020 High level advocacy to political, military, traditional and religious leaders conducted by end 2020 At least two social Surveys conducted by end 2020 New messages and entertainment -education packages in place by June 2020 Online Polio library devel oped and functional by June 2020 Proportion of States providing State & LGA counterpart funds for IPDs increased by 25% from 2019 level by end 2020 Proportion of missed children due to non - compliance in high risk states reduced by 50% from the 2019 level by end 2020 30% increase in the proportion of States achieving at least 80% of Abuja Commitment indicators for PEI & RI by end 2020 Increased proportion of LGA chairmen providing counterpart funds and attending ERMs by end 2020 Annual Polio Communica tion Report available by end of Q1 2021 58 5.4 Enhance Quality and Sensitive Surveillance Remaining challenges for focus in 2020 Surveillance gaps: The very sensitive nature of poliovirus surveillance in Nigeria notwithstanding, gaps and challenges do exist especially at subnational levels. These gaps and challenges constitute a risk to missing poliovirus transmission especially in the security challenged States. This situation calls for a concerted effort to identify these gaps and challe nges with a view to taking effective measures to address them. The following are some of the key surveillance gaps and challenges and some of the measures that are being implemented to address them. As the situation is dynamic, new gaps and challenges keep ing propping up that require additional and sometimes novel ways of intervention. Table 9: Addressing surveillance gaps, 2020 Theme Identified gaps/challenges Key interventions Key Surveillance Gaps Polio compatible cases Building capacity of surveillance personnel including DSNO, ADSNOs, health facility focal persons, clinicians, community informants and vaccination teams Improving frequency and quality of active surveillance Temperature tracking to improve reverse cold chain Missed AFP cases Capacity building of surveillance personnel Improving frequency and quality of active surveillance Conduct of supportive supervision Expansion of surveillance reporting network Silent LGAs Surveillance efforts to improve AFP case detection including retroactive case search, active case search in community, capacity 59 building of surveillance personnel, review and expansion of reporting network and motivation of health workers and informants to report AFP cases among others Inadequate active surveillance Introduction of electronic surveillance Provision of additional logistics support to DSNOs including provision of motorcycle Expansion of reporting network Introduction of accountability Suboptimal surveillance data quality Capacity building of surveillance personnel including training on AFP case verification Peer review and use of trigger criteria Data harmonization meetings Introduction of data quality assessment tools Accountability framework Key Surveillance challenges Insecurity Partnership with security agents including the Military and civilian Joint Task Forces (cJTF) Engagement of Community Informants from Inaccessible Areas (CIIA) Use of technology and innovation to overcome challenges (e.g. AVADAR, eSurve) Collection of contact and healthy children stool samples Environmental sweep Inadequate ownership Advocacy at all levels to improve funding and leadership High burden of ES samples in Ibadan polio laboratory Introduction of ES in Maiduguri polio laboratory Redistribution of ES sites in the country among the two national polio laboratories II. Strategic priorities for 2020 Quality surveillance and certification The Strategic surveillance priorities for 2020 are in line with current peculiarities of the country, the AFRO certification framework as well as the Polio Endgame Strategy 2019 - 2023. These priorities aim at achieving the fol lowing: Enhancing Management and Oversight of surveillance including improved coordination through development and implementation of a comprehensive annual 60 surveillance work plan with particular attention to inaccessible and other high risk areas, mapping of the surveillance structures (focal and non -focal sites, focal persons, informants, DSNOs/ADSNOs), strengthening and weekly meeting of the Surveillance Working Group. In addition, as part of the integration of poliovirus surveillance with other VPD surve illance, a fortnightly coordination meeting with WHE, NPHCDA and NCDC will commence in 2020. Strengthening poliovirus surveillance and integration with other vaccine preventable disease (VPD) surveillance through the Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy. The main focus here is to improve the reach (to special populations: hard -to-reach, border area and migrant populations) and sensitivity of surveillance to timely detect AFP, other cases of VPDs, outbreaks and other emergencies. Thi s focus will be achieved through implementing such activities as setting up of strong surveillance teams at all levels, capacity building of surveillance personnel, provision of logistics support to state epidemiologists and DSNOs, conduct of quality acti ve surveillance, strengthening community involvement in surveillance, implementing other complementary surveillance activities (retroactive case search and community active case search) in silent and other poor performing LGAs and conduct of supportive sup ervision, use of technology and innovations and implementing IHR (2005 ) among others. Sustaining, expanding and intensifying surveillance in areas with chronic or dynamic insecurity. Surveillance strategies in Borno (e.g. RIC, RES, CIIA, healthy children sampling) will be maintained and improved upon. Replication of these strategies in other states with insecurity will be explored and surveillance performance in insecure areas will be monitored closely. Quarterly risk assessment will be conducted in these areas with security challenges and training to share experience with other states with insecurity as Borno will be conducted. Expanding Environmental Surveillance to cover all the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. Currently, seven states (Abia, Akwa -Ibom, Bayelsa, Ebonyi Ekiti, Nasarawa and Ondo) of the federation are yet to initiate ES. Expansion of ES will greatly enhance the sensitivity of poliovirus surveillance at a time when poliovirus transmission is very low and considering the very low paralysis to infection ratio of the poliovirus. In this regard, a comprehensive review of all the 113 ES sites in the country will be conducted in January 2020 to identify and close down poor performing sites with or without replacements. At the end of the review, there is going to be on the average three ES sites per state. The ES sites will be redistributed among the two national polio laboratories such that states that send their AFP stool samples to a particular laboratory will also send their ES sample s to be analysed in that particular laboratory. Adequate logistics support for sample collection and transportation will be provided and sample collection supervision will be enhanced. The ES performance of ES sites will be monitored every six months throu gh process 61 indicator analysis. In addition, the national ES review meeting will continue to be conducted annually. Maintaining the capacity and efficiency of the Polio laboratories through capacity building and provision of logistics support. The laborator ies will be supported to continue to achieve and sustain accreditation. Advocacy to the government to shoulder the burden of human resource in the laboratories will be conducted as part of the efforts to alleviate the impact of the upcoming ramp down. The laboratories in the long run will also analyse for other VPDs as well as conduct sero -prevalence and serum protein analyses. Establishing surveillance to detect poliovirus among patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID). Healthy persons, when infected with poliovirus, excrete the virus for a period of about one six weeks (in stool, and for a shorter period through pharyngeal spread) and then clear the infection. Persons with primary immune -deficiencies (PIDs) affecting B -cells or combined prima ry immune - deficiencies, in rare circumstances, may excrete polioviruses for a longer period of time (prolonged excretion: 6 months - 5 years and chronic excretion: >5 years); and in some instances, Sabin (vaccine) poliovirus develops into VDPV, in this cas e referred to as iVDPV. iVDPV excretion is not compatible with global poliovirus eradication. The two major risks from iVDPV excretion are: risk of progression to paralysis and death (individual patient) and risk of community spread and seeding of outbreak s. The focus here is to seek technical guidance from AFRO on the establishment of PID surveillance including training, site selection, sample analysis and management of cases. Enhancing surveillance data management system. Timely and accurate data is instr umental to any surveillance system and it is important that efforts to have secure database systems in place along with proper data management and quality control procedures. Data should be periodically evaluated for accuracy, consistency and completeness using standard data management procedures. Systems and procedures should be in place to protect data integrity as well as safety and security from natural disasters, computer virus attack, theft and other threats. In this regard, the zonal data management should be maintained considering the size of the country and for ease of coordination. Every state should have a surveillance data manager and regular data harmonization meetings and capacity building should be conducted. In addition, regular feedback to s takeholders, use of electronic surveillance and AFP case verification and accountability will go a long way in improving data quality. Strengthening of polio certification processes. Efforts will be intensified to ensure that the country is declared polio -free in 2020. In this regard, the national polio committees (NCC, NTF and NPEC) will be supported to achieve optimal functionality. There will be a quarterly combined national polio committee meeting and at least 62 two NPEC standalone meeting in 2020. the co mplete documentation for certification will be finalized by February 2020 the country annual progress report for the year 2019 will be finalized before April 2020. The phase I containment for Northern states and repeat for southern states will be conducted by May 2020. As Nigeria has no intention of having a polio essential facility (PEF), all polioviruses will be destroyed according to the GAP III protocol. In the spirit of integration, the National Measles Verification Committee (MVC) will also be supported to function optimally. The committee will meet at least twice a year and annual measles progress report will be produced. Increasing efficiency and sustai ning performance of sentinel surveillance sites (Rota, PBM and CRS). A sentinel surveillance system is used when high -quality data are needed about a particular disease that cannot be obtained through a passive system. Selected reporting units, with a high probability of seeing cases of the disease in question, good laboratory facilities and experienced well -qualified staff, identify and notify on certain diseases. Data collected in a well -designed sentinel system signal trends, identify outbreaks and monit or the burden of disease in a community, providing a rapid, economical alternative to other surveillance methods. Nigeria has five ( Edo, Lagos, Ilorin, Bauchi sentinel sites located in teaching hospital s for PBM and Rota virus respectively. These sites will be supported with TSA, logistics, capacity building and other technical assistance. In addition, two review meetings per year for Rota, PBM and CRS sentinel sites will be organized. Conducting operat ional research in such areas as KAP of surveillance officers, health workers and caregivers on identification of AFP cases and sero -prevalence (SPS) surveys. With regards to the SPS, historically Polio SPS has proved very useful in assessing population imm unity and guiding polio eradication activities especially in polio endemic countries. Polio sero -prevalence surveys started in Nigeria in 2011 in Kano state and by 2016, under the recommendations of the Expert Review Committee (ERC), similar studies were c onducted in Borno/Yobe, Sokoto/Kebbi and Katsina. All sero -surveys in Nigeria mentioned above were cross -sectional surveys and implementation was health facility based. Health facility based implementation was considered operationally feasible and convenie nt in the security challenged areas. It also had an advantage that both vaccine acceptors and refusers were captured in the data because in the hospital set up, there was hardly any refusal to participate in sero -prevalence. But there were some limitations like that the results reflected only the health seeking populations. Nigeria ERC in its 29th meeting recommended that the future sero -surveys in Nigeria be community based. The country has developed a community based study design, which is representative of high risk areas, is operationally feasible to implement and has been approved by the WHO ethical 63 review committee. This community sero -prevalence survey is to be conducted in Sokoto state in 2020. Supporting Measles and Yellow Fever laboratories throug h provision of logistics support, supporting accreditation exercise, capacity building and conduct of supportive supervision. This is of paramount focus as the country is persistently affected with measles outbreak that result in high morbidity and mortali ty. In addition, Since Sept 2017 till date, the country is recording yellow fever outbreaks. From the 1st of January 2019 to the 5th of December 2019, 3947 suspected cases have been reported from all 36 States and the FCT. Of the suspected cases, 154 have been confirmed positive (IP Dakar = 78; In country PCR = 76) in 36 States and the FCT. Current yellow fever risk categorization has shown 6 (Anambra, Oyo, Delta, Benue, Osun Lagos) and 1 (Borno) States as high, medium, low and no risk . Although the analysis is showing Borno as a NO risk state, insecurity in the area may result to an increased risk of outbreaks and other public health issues. Enhancing and sustaining AEFI surveillance. The goal of immunization is to protect the individual and the public from Vaccine Preventable Diseases. Immunization is also a core component of the human right to health. Although modern vaccines are safe, no vaccine is entirely without risk. In addition to the vaccines themselves, the process of immunization is a potential source of adverse events. Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) range from mild to rare serious events. Vaccines rarely cause serious adverse reactions, and common reactions are minor and self - limiting. In majority of serious cases these events are merely coincidences. To increase immunization acceptance and improve the quality of services, the surveillance of AEFIs must become an integral part of immunization programmes. Monitori ng of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) is an essential strategy for ensuring the safety of vaccines. Immunization safety /AEFI surveillance is a collaborative venture between the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) and the N ational Regulatory Authority (NRA) which is the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), with the Federal Ministry of Health having overall oversight. The NPHCDA is the National focal point for AEFI surveillance. It receives A EFI case reports from sub -national levels, leads investigations and ensures regular analysis and feeds results back down the system. It provides support to the states and share all reports and communications with NAFDAC, the NRA.NAFDAC is the technical poi nt of contact for vaccine testing , vaccine licensing and regulation. It receives vaccine samples or initiates collection of samples and advises on vaccine quality and testing. AEFI surveillance in the country can be improved through capacity building of h ealth workers and sensitization of 64 caregivers, regular meeting of the AEFI National Expert Committee to conduct AEFI case review and causality assessment; and close monitoring and evaluation of AEFI reporting and sharing of quarterly feedback. Key Activiti es Development of annual surveillance work plan at all levels (national, states, LGA) with participation of all key stakeholders and monitoring of the status of implementation of work plans. Development of surveillance strategic plan 2020 -2023 taking into account polio ramp down Identify, engage and train surveillance teams at national, state and LGA levels. Integrate poliovirus surveillance (AFP and ES) with other Vaccine Preventable Disease (VPD) Surveillance through the IDSR strategy. Initiate Surveilla nce for Primary Immuno -Deficiency Disorders (PID ). Provide weekly and monthly surveillance feedback to states and other partners. Implement regular capacity building of personnel involved in surveillance including surveillance site focal points, DSNOs, Sta te Epidemiologists, surge capacity and others involved in surveillance through supportive supervision, on -the-job training, peer exchanges and refresher trainings. Continue to prioritize security challenged states to implement key activities aimed at impro ving access to populations in inaccessible areas through innovations, partnership with communities, the Military and other security agents. In addition, capacity building of surveillance personnel, healthy children stool sample collection, enhanced surveil lance in IDP camps and host communities, use of technology to improve AFP reporting, expansion of reporting network as well as enhancing other complimentary surveillance activities especially environmental surveillance will be prioritized. Improving survei llance data quality through such activities as peer reviews, capacity building of surveillance personnel, conduct of data harmonization meeting and conduct of case verification and validation. Creation of community awareness and sensitization including in the local media (TV and radio) through discussions Jingles using local language and provision of posters in both English and local languages. Targeted sensitization of special populations such as nomadic groups and selection of informants and focal persons among nomadic populations. Conduct quarterly polio risk assessments with mapping. Review Environmental Surveillance performance by site and close down underperforming sites. Redistribute states implementing ES among the two national polio laboratories. Ensure optimal functioning of environmental surveillance and initiate ES in Oyo and Cross River states 65 Finalize phase 1 containment activities (polioviruses infectious and potentially infectious materials) documentation according to revised GAP III guideline s. Update the list of health facilities and informants in the country and prioritize these facilities for active surveillance. Prioritized facilities should be reviewed every six months Monitor LGA DSNO active surveillance and AFP zero reporting Conduct regular surveillance data analysis and monitoring to identify areas with surveillance gaps for focused intervention (e.g. supportive supervision). Strengthen coordination and quality of feedback through monitoring of monthly DSNOs review meetings, quarterly zonal review meetings and national review meetings. Monitor the implementation status of recommendations of key bodies, reviews and teams such as the ERC, OBRA, IMB, ARCC, data quality review and the National Polio committees. Monitor quality of active surveillance and performance of the AFP surveillance network though supportive supervision, teleconference, monthly and quarterly surveillance review meetings at LGA, State, zonal and national level as well as implementation of regular surveillance reviews especially in high risk states and other states based on risk analysis. Continue to motivate vaccination teams to report AFP cases. Conduct timely Investigation of confirmed poliovirus isolation, Sabin type 2 isolation, OPV zero dose and polio comp atible cases following standard guidelines. Conduct retroactive AFP case search in wards that have not reported AFP cases for two to three years. Support the conduct of rapid surveillance assessments in states with surveillance gaps. Continue to support th e national polio laboratories to achieve and sustain WHO accreditation Continue to support the National polio committees (NCC, NPEC, NTF) to function effectively Organize cross border surveillance meetings between states sharing international border and t heir counterparts . Targets, Milestones and Indicators Build capacity of at least 90% of key surveillance personnel (e.g. DSNOs, ADSNOs, health facility focal persons, clinicians, informants) through refresher training by June 2020. Attainment of the two main AFP surveillance performance indicators at national, state and LGA levels by June 2020. 66 At least 90% of all reported AFP are verified and geo -coordinates collected in 100% of verified cases as at June 2020. Validate at least 5 -10% of verified AFP cases Collect at least 80% of contact samples of all AFP cases from Adamawa, Borno, Sokoto and Yobe states and from inadequate AFP cases of the remaining states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Conduct at least 80% planned monthly active surveillan ce activities (including to community informants) by June 2020. Implement at least 80% of the surveillance annual work plan by December 2020 At least 25% reduction in polio compatible cases by December 2020. Initiate ES in the remaining seven states (Akwa -Ibom, Abia, Bayelsa, Ebonyi, Ekiti, Nasarawa, Ondo) that are yet to start implementing ES by June 2020. Conduct timely (within 48 hours of notification) investigation of all confirmed poliovirus outbreaks. Conduct community polio sero -prevalence survey in Sokoto by June 2020. National Polio Laboratories maintain WHO accreditation in 2020. Achieve at least 80% implementation of ARCC, ERC and OBRA recommendations by June 2020. Conduct and complete the phase 1 Polio containment in Northern states and repeat in Southern States by May 2020. Complete and submit the 2019 country annual progress report to ARCC by April 2020. Country complete documentation for certification finalized by February and accepted by ARCC by June 2020 5.5 Enhancing SIAs Quality with special focus to vulnerable /special areas Based on risk categorization algorithm (combined EOC and Institute of Disease Modelling - IDM), a total of 78 LGAs across 18 States have been prioritized and will be specially focused in 20 20. T he program will still pay attention to the remaining 691 LGAs across all the States and FCT. The special attention to these unique 78 LGAS include increased supervision and support, increased high level engagement with the political, Religious and Communit y leadership, improved planning, implementation and evaluation of polio related activities (including campaigns). Key Activities 1. Identifying vulnerable areas The classification of LGAs as vulnerable is conducted by the National EOC in conju nction with the Insti tute of Disease Modelling (IDM). This process is repeated every 6 months. For 67 the 201 9 high -risk categorization, ou t of the 774 LGAs a total of 83 LGAs across 13 State s + FCT as indicated in the T able 17 and Fig 18 below will be give n special attention and focus. 68 Table 10: 2020 High Risk LGA Categorization Zone state VHR Special Total NCZ Kogi 2 2 Kwara 7 7 Niger 2 2 11 11 NEZ Bauchi 2 2 Borno 27 27 Gombe 1 1 Taraba 1 1 Yobe 6 6 4 33 37 NWZ Jigawa 7 7 Kaduna 5 5 Kano 1 1 Katsina 5 5 Sokoto 5 5 23 23 SEZ Enugu 1 1 1 1 SWZ Lagos 2 2 Ogun 1 1 Osun 1 1 Oyo 2 2 6 6 Total 45 33 78 69 Figure 24: Polio Highrisk LGAs As indicated in figure 24, 33 of the 78 LGAs are special LGAs comprising all the 27 LGAs from Borno, six of the LGAs are from Yobe . Only one LGA in Enugu State was included from the southern states. Strengthening support and supervision on High risk/weak performing areas Continuous review of campaign quality and identification of weak performing areas , through high -risk analysis and HROP will continue to guide prioritization. Government and partners will regularly review performance of their res pective state, LGA, ward staff, and ensure that stronger hands are redeployed to poor performing LGAs. This would result in quality implementation of planned activities. The period ic review and re -deployment of LGA and ward level staffs will be done as the situation demands based on available performance data. Management support teams will also be deployed based on these assessments. Improving team performance Team performance is mainly assessed through child absent households and households not being vis ited during the IPDs. Other parameters of measure include, knowledge of VVM, 5 key household questions and knowledge of the daily implementation plans. To improve team performance in 20 20, the critical activities will include: Strengthening and sustaining data -driven ward level team selection 70 LGA Task Forces should review the appointments/retention of ward focal per sons and vaccination in all LGAs but primarily focusing on the priority ones after every round of campaign. A team made up of Government and partners at LGA level should review WFP and team performance, and measure it against set campaign outcome indicators . Any ward with LQAs results of <90% (and where this is established to be due to team performance) should have the WFP accou nt fully for that. On the other hand , very good performing wards (>90% LQAs performances) should have their respective WFPs rewarded (in form of incentives such as commendation letters, public recognition, capacity building opportunities, promotions etc). Team selection should align with the national guideline s and all partner agencies at the LGA level should be active members in the selection process, and in the review of performance process. These will form part of their performance and accountability mea sure within their respective partner organizations. Plans to extend enumerations in 20 20: Considering the importance of microplanning and enumeration, the program plans to continue with enumeration in states that have not completed enumeration. However, the NERICC would buy into it based on the added advantage and benefits which include : Obtaining best estimates of the population denominator with resultant savings in the fi nancial resource requirements especially vaccines and devices, Rationalized workload for house to house and transit teams during SIAs Innovative ideas to improve and maintain the quality of micro Plans in 20 20: Tracking of enumeration teams and Ward Focal Persons using vaccinator tracking system (VTS) Compulsory use of ODK by all Senior Supervisors including MSTs Weekly triangulation of ODK and VTS data as part of accountability Use of Security Vigilantes in security compromised settlements escorting enumeration teams Comprehensive validation process of at least 40% of the micro plans up from the previous 10% Continuous micro planning review Micro -plans of all LGAs will be reviewed after each SIA round through a detailed tally -sheet analysis, LQA S and Independent M onitoring data from the concluded IPDs. Revised household -based enumeration with an inbuilt validation processes be used in identified poor performing LGA s with questionable denominators will be conducted. Enhancing quality of team members training Training modules for major components of the IPDs will be reviewed to ensure consistency of the trainings and in line with adult learning approach. The training will be adapted to be within the context of post Covid 19 implementation. In addition, audio -visual training 71 materials will be produced and emphasis will be made for trainings at all levels to be conducted by senior programme officers, and par ticularly at ward levels , the trainings will be led by the PHCC along with partners. The IPD guideline will be reviewed and updated in 2020 to incorporate experiences with innovative approaches to improve the quality of SIAs within the context of Covid 19 disease . Enhancing supervision The national EOC will deploy management support teams (MST) to states based on risk / performance concerns. Crack team will also be deployed to states based on the challenges encountered, especially with political commitment . The State EOCs / State Task Forces will deploy the MSTs, state level and partner agency staff to the identified high risk LGAs and wards based on the high risk operational plan for that round. There will be stringent monitoring of the completed superviso ry checklist submitted by staff deployed by each agency to ensure adherence and accountability. The analysis of completed supervisory checklists by agency will be presented to the state EOC/ State Taskforce and National EOC during/ after each round. Use of a n electronic supervisory checklist on an ODK platform will be scaled up to facilitate monitoring, tracking, analysis and storage. During SIAs ODK and VTS data will be triangulated and shared during evening review meetings for action. The accountability fra mework will be enforced on poor performing government and agency staff. Improve SIA s monitoring In an effort the improve enhanced independent monitoring and LQA S processes, the National EOC revised the standard operating procedures (SOPs) of conducting independent monitoring in 2017. The SOP has spelt out verification processes of the LQA S to ensure the integrity of data collected by surveyors. The implementation of the SOP is key to ensuring concordance between all sources of monitoring data and improvement on the quality and veracity of the data. This has re-establish ed confidence in the process while generating quality data that will guide program interventions. In areas with reported rejection of lots after LQAS, the state/ LGA will be mandated to conduct repeat vaccination to ensure that all eligible children and reached. Vaccine Management and A ccountability The gaps identified from the previous sweeps conducted in the country , showed clear ly that vaccine management and accountability needs to be strengthened at all levels. To address the issue, ward vaccine accountability officers were introduced at the wards level during each round of SIAs. Introduction of LGA and Ward Vaccine Accountability forms and Introduction of Logistics Management Support Team (MST) support from Government and Partners in each implementing State / LGA to address all logistics issues and account for all vaccines. 72 Targets, Milestone s and Indicators Share line lists of 83 HR LGAs to States by February 201 9 Develop an inter -agency Supportive supervision plan and start implementation by June 2020 Review and share ward level performance (LQA S) after every round and use that to assess WFP starting March 20 20 Achieve at least 90% LGAs at 90% pass per round Ensure S-VAM report is shared by States and LGAs 5 -days post campaign Repeat vaccination conducted in All LGAs that failed LQAS 5.6 Enhancing Routine Immunization To ensure sustained interruption of all polioviruses, it is important that RI is rapidly strengthened, and coverage improved. The ARCC at its most recent meeting indicated concerns about the low population immunity in most countries including Nigeria and t he risk of emergence and transmission of cVDPV2. ARCC recommended that countries should: Assess the causes of low routine immunization coverage. Urgently implement plans to improve routine immunization, especially IPV and OPV. Improve quality of SIAs Conduct catch -up campaigns with IPV to close immunity gaps caused by delayed introduction. Furthermore, the Global Certification Commission in a recent meeting also noted that \"Inadequate routine immunization levels coupled with subnational gaps in survei llance in high -risk countries continue to be the main risk factors for the emergence or continuation of cVDPVs.\" Thus, both risk factors must be addressed. Strengthening routine immunization across board is an important and strategic component for PEI. Therefore, following the establishment of National Emergency Routine Immunization Coordinating Center (NERICC) on July 4, 2017, several innovations continues to be implemented on improving RI coverage. The National Emergency Routine Immunization Coordination Centre (NERICC) has been implementing strategic activities to revamp routine immunization in the country. In 2019, results from the PAPA RI - LQAS showed improvements in routine immunization performa nce from 36% of children appropriately immunized in Q4, 2017 to 76% of children appropriately immunized in Q3, 2019. Key priorities for 2020 by NERICC: In 2020, the following strategies will be implemented to further improve routine immunization coverage while continuing previous key interventions to sustain the gains achieved. A key focus will be on low performing LGAs who have low immunization coverage and history of cVDPV2. The EOC conducted a risk analysis of Southern states and identified 48 high ris k LGAs in southern states in addition to the 78 very high risk LGAS in 13 Northern states. The NERICC interventions will be emphasized in these states and LGAs 73 A. Strengthening accountability and responsiveness for routine immunization SERICCs/LERICCs hav e been established in 18 Northern states and 6 Southern states while Routine Immunization Working Groups (RIWG) are being strengthened in remaining states to coordinate the RI activities in the states with special focus on strict implementation of the acco untability framework. SERRIC/ LERICCs will be held accountable if interventions are not done. B. Improving uptake for routine immunization o Conduct of Optimized Integrated Immunization Sessions (OIRIS) will continue in 2020 whereby National support the states in joint supervision and monitoring of RI services in LGAs and HFs and ensuring optimization of RI sessions by integrating other services during immunizations C. Integrated Medical Outreaches (IMOs) to strengthen Primary Health Care : Primary Health Care in Nigeria is bedeviled with low service delivery with survey results showing sub optimal performance in core PHC indicators. The recent 2018 National Demographic Health Survey (NDHS) further corroborates this with an increase from 128 deaths per 1000 live births to 132 deaths per 1000 live births. This increase in childhood mortality rate is a marked deviation from the previous steady decline in under - 5 mortality rate observed in the last decade. Suboptimal delivery of primary health care services with gaps in human resources for health is also a significant contributor to the challenges with access. While there are over 30,000 primary health care facilities in the country, a significant number of them are largely ineffective with very poor service delive ry. To address these gaps in immunization and primary health care, a strategy of Integrated Medical Outreaches (IMOs) for communities is being implemented. The IMOs will be conducted for three monthly rounds of 5 days. The main aim of the IMOs is to impro ve immunization and primary health care service delivery in targeted low performing LGAs. The specific objectives of it are to strengthen the PHC outputs by high impact immunizations, PHC interventions in targeted underserved communities to increase and su stain demand for immunization. It is believed that it will result into - Reduce incidence of cVDPV transmission - Increase reach and access to vaccines and PHC services - Improve awareness and demand creation for routine immunization and other PHC services - Mobilize children for vaccinations and other PHC services 408 LGAs have been selected for intervention including XX polio high risk LGAs. A four -pronged strategic approach will be deployed to provide services through - Fixed Post (PHC) 74 o Provision of all serv ices previously rendered in the health facility o All health facilities are to be opened and providing services throughout the 5 days of RISP to target age group 0 -23 Months o Provision of Health Talks o Provision of Immunization services (all antigens) o Treatmen t of minor ailments o Nutrition Counselling - Measurement of Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) o Screening (hypertension, weight - body mass index) o Referral Services - Temporary Fixed Post o One outreach is to be conducted per ward o Provision of Health Talks o Immunization (all antigens) to target age group 0 -23 Months o Nutrition Counselling - Measurement of Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) o Referral Services o All antigens are to be provided after screening (vaccines are only to be administered relative to the im munization history of the child) - Mobile Teams o Conducted in hard to reach communities, nomadic populations, migrant/displaced people o Provision of Health Talks o Immunization (all antigens) to target age group 0 -23 Months o Nutrition Counselling - Measurement of Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) o Referral Services o All antigens are to be provided after screening (vaccines are only to be administered relative to the immunization history of the child) - Medical Missions o In collaboration with key associ ations (NMA, association of Nursing and Midwives, Pharmacist associations, specific NGOs) o Provision of immunization services (all antigens) o Conduct of Minor surgeries in limited numbers o Screening, Testing, Referrals, Treatment of minor ailments o Maternal se rvices o Counselling o Family Planning 75 o Nutrition Counselling - Measurement of Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) o Screening (hypertension, Diabetes, weight - body mass index) At least one medical Mission in each Senatorial District in all states of Nigeria will be conducted during the implementation of the se IMOs. The indicators for success will be based on the outcome of the NICs/ MICs 2020 and subsequent LQAs results. D. Strengthening data quality through the implementation of the DQIP o Data management training for frontline health workers o Conduct of data validation and review meetings at LGA level o Deployment of apps for facility level data entry o Strengthening data quality use and supervision exercises regularly o Mentoring of the data teams and improvement in behavior E.

Targets, milestones and indicators o Achieve greater than 50% immunization coverage for all antigens by 2020 in line with NERRIC's vision and the NSIPSS document. (NICs/ MICs data) o Implement RISP and assess outcome o Develop/Update RI REW plans based on GIS maps & population estimates and walk -through micro -plan data and session plans available by October 2020 o Data tools for capturing and monitoring routine immunizations performance available in priority LGAs by March 2020 o National and State EOCs/NERICC to continue monthly monitoring of RI performance o Conduct monthly RISS from the national to State/LGAs/HFs. Target of 80% of planned visits conducted by 2020 o Improve polio vaccine coverage for type 2 through quality SIA campaigns and intensification using fIPV/ IPV 5.6 Mobile populations and Cross Bord er Collaboration 5.6.1 Mobile populations 5.6.1.1 Background Underserved populations refer to groups that are collectively sub -optimally reached by the program. These population groups include nomadic, IDPs, traders, migratory fishermen and are typically found in scattered settlements in hard -to-reach, security compromised and border areas. The migratory underserved populations transect outbreak zones and areas with accessibility challenges and may contact other vulnerable populations (including trapped and displaced populations). This may enable an increased risk of exposure and spread Though the polio program has made progress in reaching underserved populations, these populations could still serve as a reservoir/sanctuary of virus transmission in the country. Reaching underserved populations remains a priority for the polio program. 5.6.1.2 Justification As noted by the Expert Review Committee (ERC) on Polio Eradication and Routine Immunization during its 37th session in December 2019, the migrant population plays a key role in the spread of polio across Africa and noted that the same pattern is playing out with cVDPV2 transmission in Nigeria. Further, the ERC noted that the presence of mobile and nomadic popul ations poses a major risk to ongoing efforts to interrupt cVDPV2 transmission in Nigeria. 77 The mobile populations' movements are very dynamic. As a result, extending the program reach fully to the mobile populations within Nigeria and across international b orders remains challenging due to their movement typically in security compromised, hard -to- reach scattered, and border settlements. Besides the existing data on these movements when known are not readily available or accessible to programs for use in the planning of Polio Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIAs) and outbreak response. 5.6.1.3 Goal and objectives The overall goal of the program is to build and sustain high population immunity in underserved communities to interrupt and prevent outbreaks of cVDPV2 and other Vaccine - Preventable Diseases in these populations. The objectives will include: Extending the polio vaccination and other antigens to all eligible children in the underserved nomadic populations Update the geo -mapping of nomadic popu lations To establish a database of mobile populations and their leaders, for effective program linkages and integration To detect and report AFP cases and other VPDs in these communities 5.6.1.3 Activities Coordination and collaboration Strengthen and mainstream effective coordination and planning of interventions to the mobile populations under the state Polio EOCs/state technical team Identify and engage mobile population stakeholders to explore leverage opportunities. The stakeholders include the Veterinary department and Fisheries department under the Ministry of Agriculture, National Commission for Nomadic Education (NCNE), Community Based Organizations such as Miyetti Allah Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO) Strengthen linkages between the NEOC, states, and LGAs on mobile populations Identify the mobile populations: nomadic populations, migrant fishing populations, refugees Identify program gaps and required support/intervention to address them Granulate unders erved populations data to ensure close performance monitoring Closely track SIA/OBR activities (at pre -, during, and post -implementation stages) Update the geo-mapping of nomadic, fishing, and other mobile populations Identify and geo -code nomadic and m igrant settlements including their accessibility status 78 Update mapping the GIS map to display nomadic settlement, population, routes, markets near routes, camping/sites for seasonal campaigns, water points, grazing areas. Update seasonality (temporal)mappi ng of the mobile population movement Establish a database of the mobile population and their leaders, to ensure effective community linkages Conduct Risk assessment prior to the implementation of OBRs and SIAs Review performance of previous OBR/SIAs (Low coverage, LQAs, independent monitoring, missed settlements and sites) reflecting the population status as at and during the planned OBR/SIAs Review missed children data (vaccination hesitant and child absent d ata) Analyze vaccination dose status of AFP cases (<3doses) Low routine immunization coverage In-between rounds and special Interventions to target mobile and nomadic population Leverage on animal vaccinations and integrate polio and other vaccination Organize Special nomadic vaccination campaigns Strengthen surveillance among the mobile population Identify surveillance informants within the mobile populations (e.g. Leaders, traditional healers, traditional barbers, TBAs) Conduct sensitizat ion on AFP surveillance Conduct analysis and tracking surveillance reach among nomadic communities (NP -AFP rate and stool adequacy) Routine Immunization among mobile and nomadic population s Update REW Microplans to capture all mobile pop Review RI perform ance among the mobile and nomadic populations Conduct defaulter tracking to ensure coverage during outreach and mobile planning and implementation Communication and Social Mobilization targeting nomads and mobile population Conduct advocacy visits and sensitization meetings with nomadic leaders (state, LGA, wards, settlements levels) Enhance reach to the mobile and nomadic populations through radio, IEC materials (to be used at selected sites such as markets, Traditional leader's houses, and telephone and word of mouth Identify health workers among mobile populations (nomadic settlements, focal persons in markets and mobile groups) 79 Monitoring and data management of mobile and nomadic population vaccination and surveillance activities Ensure monitoring t ools capture of disaggregated data on nomadic populations on all program areas including surveillance, vaccination (RI and SIAs, communication and social mobilization, special interventions Desegregate RIC Vaccination data to identify the number of nomadic settlements in inaccessible areas 80 5.6.2 Cross Border Collaboration 5.6.2.1 Background About 4% of states in Nigeria have an international border four countries: Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Benin republics. The borders are comprised of 201 wards in 60 LGAs. Except for the Chad republic, Nigeria is linked to these countries through land borders. About 56% of the international border LGAs in Borno state border with Chad republic via the Lake Chad waters. The border areas are associated with active population movement driven by social, economic, and humanitarian reasons. Most of these movements are temporary and include those to major commercial centers in various states. In addition, a complex pattern of diverse nomadic populations' seasonal movemen ts in search of pasture and water is a common feature. 5.6.2.2 Justification for intensified cross border activities in Nigeria The spread of cVDPV2 within Nigeria and beyond the border underscores the need to strengthen the coordination efforts to address surveillance and population immunity gaps in the Lake Chad basin countries. Of the 17 states with confirmed cVDPV2 in 2081 and 2019, 11 (65%) share an international border with neighbouring countries. The cVDPV 2 outbreaks that occurred in Benin Republic, Togo, Ghana, and Cote d'Ivoire were genetically linked and originated in Jigawa state and spread was facilitated by population m ovements The country has major commercial centers that draw local and international populations along major road networks and crossing points. Additionally, the major nomadic migratory routes are well established in the international border areas. The mig ration is regular and seasonal. However, insecurity due to rustling in the northwest, interethnic conflicts in the north -central, and insurgency in the NE have influenced changes to the migratory routes. Besides, these populations usually have poor access to health services, and by transecting through outbreak zones, and areas likely populated by vulnerable communities (including trapped and displaced populations) increases the risk of exposure and spread of the virus. Consequently, Nigeria will continue to strengthen cross border collaboration focussing on all border areas with special emphasis on states that reported cVDPV2 cases and the Lake Chad basin priority LGAs in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states. 5.6.2.3 Key Activities Coordination with post -closure of the Lake Chad Coordination Task Team : Broadly, the program will continue to strengthen coordination and mainstreaming the planning, implementation, and monitoring of activities 81 The country will liaise with the international border states t o ensure a strong corroboration link with the state and LGAs' counterparts in the neighbouring countries to facilitate rapid decision -making, deployment of resources, and problem -solving across the neighbouring countries. The country will leverage on the f ormer Lake Chad Task Team focal persons and representatives some of whom have transferred to the WHO AFRO headquarters in Brazzaville Establish bilateral linkages with individual countries including the Benin Republic, which has not been part of the region al coordination effort The state and LGAS mobile and nomadic working groups will regularly provide the counterpart teams (and vice versa) with information and data required to facilitate rapid analysis and identification of gaps in areas that influence cr oss-border surveillance, OBRs, SIAs, and in -between SIAs activities and inform risk assessments. Ensure adequate preparedness for potential further spread of the ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak within Nigeria and into other uninfected areas and other countries. The NEOC will collaborate with the states on review evolving risk and prepare contingency support plans for all areas at risk of an outbreak Conduct regular coordination cross -border state/LGA meetings to enhance collaboration on the identification and vaccination of high -risk and mobile populations including nomads. These for a will enable the gathering of information and mapping of the nomadic groups' migratory routes across international borders. Specific information will include lo cation, routes, and time of the movements in order to understand where and when populations move, variables impacting historic movements (e.g. insecurity), and how to reflect this information in the response activities. Update work -plan to ensure synchroni zation, efficient use of resources and maximum impact and incorporate monitoring feedback from NEOC/state EOCs/Technical teams Continue political advocacy and to ensure engagement and program ownership at all administrative levels across the neighbouring countries. Strengthen country program management and administration and strictly implement the accountability framework at all levels Sustaining cross -border activities in the Lake Chad Basin countries The program will ensure cross -border coordination and synchronization, communication, notification, and implementation of activities at local border LGA/district levels through: Updating and geo -referenced mapping of all the major crossing points along the international borders Conduct functional border/tra nsit point vaccination is established and all eligible children are immunized while coming and going outside Nigeria. Conduct border synchronization meetings attended by officials from across the borders leading to inform the generation of joint implementa tion plans 82 Conduct synchronized border vaccinations in settlements and transit points along the borders Quality planning for each round of SIA (TSA, HRA/HROPs, pre -implementation dashboard, schedule of activity) Implement EIM and LQAS with corrective actions after each SIA/OBR Provide additional resources to conduct quality revisit/mop -up with documentation in each of the priority LGAs that failed LQAS Develop an Integrated Communication Plan and assessment tools to inform the health - seeking behaviour of mobile populations Ensure adherence to the reporting formats and guidelines on cross border AFP notification Ensure prompt cross -border on all AFP cases detected along the borders to ensure timely investigation and plan for re sponse activities. Conduct analysis, and feedback of active surveillance visits by DSNOs of priority LGA using the standardized tool including silent wards analysis, tracking of zero reporting by informants and review during monthly /quarterly meetings Expand AVADAR to all state with international borders Conduct timely investigation of polio cases (WPV, cVDPV, Compatibles, AFP zero dose) and activate OBR SOPs as per the guidelines Identify priority LGAs in other international border states for targeted program interventions to strengthen surveillance, planning, and implementation of OBR/SIAs Engage states to identify priority border LGAs at national and state levels Conduct vaccination in Transit point, IDPs camp, Markets, Nomadic, CMAM sites, busy hospitals, International Border posts, and integrating livestock vaccination including AFP active case search. Intensification of routine immunization in specified transit points along with the priority LGAs Conduct profiling and vaccination of children vaccinated in -between rounds (special interventions) Enhance collaboration with other stakeholders to promote the integration of services Expand surveillance reporting network to include informants, VCMs, private and public health facilities including humanitarian partners Identify, train, and engage mobile population focal points (nomadic, IDPs, fishermen) in AFP surveillance Integrate the vaccine management a ccountability framework into the broader operational accountability framework 83 Sustain program performance in 15 Lake Chad priority LGA s (including Lake Chad islands) plus MMC and Jere LGAs to strengthen planning, and implementation of OBR/SIA and surveillance in insecure areas Update accessibility status of settlement including the mobile populations' Corroboration with relevant agencies and use of satellite imagery, to determine population e stimates of the high -risk population groups across borders. Sustain the engagement with the military authorities to continue the Reaching Inaccessible Children (RIC) with vaccinations and conduct AFP active case search (Borno and Yobe) Sustain the Reach Every Settlement (RES) with vaccination during IPDS /SIAs/ OBR and conduct AFP case search Explore the expansion of Routine Immunization to RES vaccination areas 5.6.2.4 Targets, milestones, and indicators These parameters will be measu red based on the standard indicators used to measure all PEI activities (including process indicators for vaccination, surveillance, and social mobilization). a.

Border vaccinations in other states Updated map of border crossing points by end of January 2020 Border vaccination reports - monthly 5.6 Improving and strengthening quality assurance of all Polio data The quality of Polio related data is an important concern for both the program and the country. The program can only be able to better review, plan and implement its activities driven by data, if such data are of highest qualit y, timely and complete. Hence the focus for 2020 is to consolidate and improve upon the program data generation, data analysis, data transformation and feedback. In 2017 , the National EOC embarked on a critical data reform strategy that culminated into signing of a Data protocol sharing agreement betwee n Government and all PEI partners. In addition, the Polio EOC data team was reactivated and the process to develop a Polio portal began. In 2018, the program finalize d and launch ed the Polio EOC portal which has provide d both the general public and Immuniz ation partners regulated access to Polio Information, reports, plans and data in a timely manner possible to ensure better understanding of actual polio performance for informed decision making. The portal will also improve transparency in matters related to data. Key Activities Support State EOCs and other State data team to improve quality and delivery of data generated from SIA activities Conduct data review meetings with State EOCs Use of ODK by supervisors and analysis/feedback by data team . Targets, Milestones and Indicators Quarterly Supportive supervision visit carried out in 2019 Periodic uploading of program data on the data portal 5.7 Transition Planning 85 Nigeria commenced the transition planning process in 2015 to sustain the gains made by the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) in over 30 years in line GPEI objective 4: Transition planning. Transition planning is a process of analyzing the infrastructure, knowledge, and functions of the polio programme, and managing their scale down or trans fer to other health programmes for future gains and also to support a country's entire health system. With support of the Federal Ministry of Health and other government and non -government stakeholders and Development Partners, the National Primary Health Care Development Agency set up two country -led committees (National Polio Transition Planning Committee, NPTPC; and the Polio Transition Technical Task Team PT4) to drive polio transition coordination and technical activities. While the National Transitio n planning committee provides general oversight and guidance, the task team is responsible for planning and executing transition technical activities. Membership of both the national steering committee and the technical task team includes wide representati on from the Federal Ministry of Health, Ministry of Budget and National Planning, Federal Ministry of Finance, other MDAs like the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC), Civil Society Organizations, Rotary International, Development Partners like WHO, UNICEF, CORE Group Partners Project (CGPP), BMGF, CDC -AFENET, CHAI, and many others. So far, several milestones have been achieved which include: Conducting comprehensive polio asset mapping and validation; Documentation of Lessons Learnt from the Polio Programme; Simulation exercise to identify 3 core priority areas for transition (PHC Revitalization, RI & Disease surveillance and OBR); Development and finalization of the Polio Business document which has been approved by the Expert Review Committee on P olio and Routine Immunization (ERC). Nigeria's transition strategy is aimed at strengthening three top priorities: Routine immunization coverage to greater than 80% for Penta 3 at national, state and LGA levels before the end of 2028; Disease Surveillance by facilitating integrated disease case detection and reporting; as well as PHC revitalization through improved governance and leadership to directly impact service delivery quality and coverage. These three priority areas represent value for money in ter ms of return on investment for the Nigerian Government and people. Presently, the PT4 is working with key public and private stakeholders to source money to fund the Polio Transition Plan (PTP). Many resource mobilization activities have been planned and w ill continue after the COVID -19 pandemic. State engagement activities which include advocacy to and through the Nigerian Governors' Forum (NGF) to all states of the Federation will also continue as soon as the pandemic is over. There are many potential ri sks to the Polio transition process. These include: The current ravaging COVID -19 pandemic which has stalled implementation of planned transition activities, Economic instability and insecurity in the country; Political will to prioritize and allocate reso urces required for transition by the different tiers of government; Shortage of 86 qualified human resource at all levels of the government tier system to support implementation of transition activities in the 3 identified areas, etc. Despite all the challeng es, Nigeria remains on course for polio transition and is optimistic that with the goodwill and support of its partners and transition stakeholders, transition activities will continue as soon as the COVID -19 pandemic is over. Key Activities Complete devel opment of Business case Endorsement of Business case and transition planning cost/ financial requirements by NPTPC and ICC Resource mobilization and funding commitment by partners/donors for transition plan implementation Communication and advocac y on transition planning in Nigeria Endorsement and signing of MOU on transition planning by Government and Partners Transition plan implementation scheduled for June -September -2020 Targets, Milestones and Indicators Resource mobilization by partners/donors for transition plan by June 2020 Communication and advocac y on transition planning completed by June 2020 Finalization of transition plan by April 2019. Transition plan implementation s cheduled for June -September 2 020 6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 6.1. Background Nigeria EOC strictly monitors and assesses the implementation of the surveillance and immunization activities in the polio eradication emergency plan. Through its four working groups and based on evidences generated through data analysis, it tracks the progress made, identifies observed gaps, and outline mitigation plan to address them. 6.2. Monitoring Process The overall guiding principle for monitoring of planned immunization and surveillance activit ies for polio eradication are: Increased quality of all polio eradication activities including campaigns, AFP Surveillance and routine immunization Increased programmatic access and reach with a focus on continuously missed children in security compromised areas Integration and coordin ated planning and implementation of Operations, Security and Communications through national and state EOCs. 87 Provision of timely and quality information, including spatial analysis, for decision making. Documentation of the polio eradication activities for polio free certification status and lesson learnt Priority activities to improve quality of immunization services, particularly scheduled SIA activities, and special rounds targeting cVDPV2 outbreak response immunization activities as well as underserved populations will be monitored using: Specific plans with detailed activities and monitoring indicators for prioritized LGAs, that have been flagged using prioritization which is updated every year. Regular and periodic feedback to VVHR and VHR LGAs with special emphasis to LGAs of Borno and other states from north east zone on implementation status of identified special activities. Monitor using data analysis feedback on a weekly basis on the implementation of surveillance, in -between round activities an d implementation of scheduled and outbreak SIAs at national and state EOC. Enhanced/real time monitoring of performance and increased accountability at all levels. Standard pre -implementation and implementation monitoring checklists and presentation of inf ormation in the polio SIA dashboard. Supportive supervision, including concurrent monitoring, using real time data collection on the Open Data Kit (ODK) platform. Enhanced independent monitoring. LQAs implementation of settlement selection using GIS. Syste matic analysis and triangulation of available data sources including LQAS, EIM, VTS, etc. In-depth analysis and feedback on vaccination tracking system. Programme audits and reviews. Monitoring of performance and increased accountability at all levels Avai l data assistance to better capture, analyze and use the data at the point where data is generated to improve program performance. Strengthen the data management support in Borno through coordination of data managers in the state under the state EOC. Specific activities that will be undertaken to monitor surveillance and polio laboratory activities will include: Weekly and monthly review of standard surveillance and laboratory performance indicators focusing on ward level performance 88 Monitor the utiliz ation of new initiatives in surveillance, implementation of AVADAR to strengthen sensitivity of surveillance in Borno state. Rapid surveillance appraisals, targeting areas with sub -optimal performance indicators. Documentation including polio free certific ation documentation. Annual laboratory accreditation missions. The information collected from the monitoring processes will be analyzed by EOCs and State Operations rooms and regular monitoring reports prepared for use by: Presidential and State Task Forc es High Level Advocacy Team (HiLAT) Nigerian Governors' Forum ALGON ERC and other oversight bodies Quarterly PEI review meetings 7.0 OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT 7.1 National, State, LGAs and Traditional Forum The Presidential Task Force on Polio Eradication and Routine I mmunization (PTFoPE) will continue to provide oversight to the PEI program in Nigeria. The PTFoPE will monitor progress at the State and LGA leve ls through quarterly meetings. The National EOC, which is the operational/programme m anagement secr etariat of the Presidential Force, will continue to provide an enabling environment for key government and partner staff to continue to work as a team with the aim of improving decision making, information sharing, conducting joint planning a nd programming, and implementing new strategies . This is aimed at increas ing t he effectiveness of the polio programme. The State EOCs and State Task Forces on Immunization will replicate the functions of the national EOC. The LGA Task Forces on Immunizat ion will meet at least once monthly to review the progress in achieving PEI and RI targets in LGAs, identify remaining challenges as well as appropriate strategies to address them. In 20 20, LGA Task Forces will continue to be an important forum to bring to gether key political leaders, Traditional and Religious leaders as well as health workers, to oversee critical activities implemented at LGA level and in all wards, particularly the Very High Risk and High -Risk wards. Traditional leaders play a very import ant role in the PEI programme. They have been incorpora ted in all the taskforces from P residential to the LGA . Aside from their involvement 89 in various task forces, the traditional authorities in northern Nigeria have an organization called the Northern Tra ditional Leaders Committee on PHC Delivery (NTLC) whose mandate among others is to lead the process of achieving PEI and RI goals through the systematic involvement in activities for Polio eradication. They have established committees at Emirate and Distri ct levels that coordinate activities in the LGAs, wards and settlements. These committees are involved in advocacy, micro planning, vaccination team selection, supervision of IPDS activities, resolution of non -compliance and promotion of community demand f or vaccination services. NTLC as well as the religious leaders through established structures such as the Nigeria Inter -Faith Action Association (NIFAA) and Federation of Muslim Women Associations in Nigeria (FOMWAN) will be expected to participate in the national coordination committees (PTFoPE, ICC, and ICC Working Groups) and thereby support planning, implementation and evaluation of priority activities in the 20 20 NPEEP. In 2020, continued focus will be placed on the engagement of Daawah Coordination Co uncil of Nigeria (DCCN) together with the NTLC. 7.2 Independent Advisory Bodies and Global Partners a) GPEI Partners: GPEI partners and donors are expected to support the national authorities to effectively implement the key activities included in the 20 20 NPEEP. The GPEI partners are also expected to support in resource mobilization. b) Expert Review Committee on Polio Eradication and Routine Immunization (ERC): The ERC is expected to meet 2 -3 times a year to provide technical guidance on programme implemen tation in improving SIAs quality, strengthening routine immunization as well as strengthening surveillance activities. c) National Polio Expert Committee (NPEC ): The NPEC supports virological classification of AFP by meeting quarterl y to review and classify AFP cases from adequate and inadequate stool specimen s. They will continue meeting on a quarterly and on Adhoc basis. 7.3 Accountability framework Accountability mechanisms and rewards : Enforcement of accountability continues to underpin all aspects of Nigeria's polio eradication programme and has contributed to the game changer since 2013. The EOC will continue to ensure that all programme officers are held accountable while delivering o n their assigned mandates. Increased accountability across all levels is needed to ensure campaigns and other activities are carried out with a high degree of quality. Programme officers in the high -risk polio LGAs will also be held accountable for perform ance of routine immunization. The Accountability Framework is an evidence -based tool used to promote 90 accountability, evaluate staff performance and increase inter -agency transparency. It is based on several key principles: a) Promoting individual accountabil ity at every level: People have been hired to achieve specific terms of reference for the polio eradication programme. This framework helps to identify those who are performing and those who are not, and to consider rewards and consequences accordingly. b) Rewards for strong performance: The individuals who demonstrate strong performance should be recognized through a reward programme. The programme has developed a reward scheme to recognize top performers in wards, LGAs and states. An award certificate w ill be issued to winning LGAs. However, these rewards may include public recognition, a congratulatory meeting with a senior leader, a mention in the media, enrollment in training of choice, etc. c) Consequences for weak performance: All weak performance will be documented and reported to appropriate policy makers and stakeholders. Furthermore, demonstrated weak performance will be sanctioned (e.g., including warnings, withholding of allowances and/or disengagement from the programme. d) Evidence based decision making: Assessments of critical impediments, their solutions, staff performance and progress will be evidence based. e) Independent assessments every month: The programme will conduct random indep endent assessments of critical impediments, solutions and performance at LGA and state levels throughout the year. f) Feedback to all levels: Constant feedback loops are critical to ensure a coordinated response and common understanding of challenges and progress. Feedback loops between wards, LGAs, state, Core Group and Presidential Task Force will be in place. g) Accountability of MSTs and supervisors: Through the use of harmonized supervisory checklist and tracking on ODK platform, with pro vision of feedback. This will be instituted, and outcome documented. The Accountability Framework will continue to be instrumental in evaluating staff performance by Government and partners with management actions taken base d on staff performance. 91 8.0 ANNEXES Annex 1: High Risk LGAs, EOC, January 2020, High risk states Annex 2: High Risk LGAs, by Zone, EOC, January 20 20 Zone state LGA AMAP HR Status NCZ Kogi Ibaji NIE Mashegu MNG Special Konduga KDG Special Nganzai NIE BOS NGZ Special NEZ Borno Damboa NIE BOS DAM Special NEZ Borno Bama NIE BOS BAM Special NEZ Borno Guzamala GBL Special Gwoza GZA Special Mafa NIE BOS MAF Special NEZ Borno Gubio NIE BOS GUB Special NEZ Borno Jere NIE BOS JRE Special NEZ Borno Kukawa NIE BOS KWA Special NEZ Borno Marte NIE BOS MAR Special NEZ Borno Mobbar NIE BOS MBR Special NEZ Borno Dikwa DKW Special Kaga NIE BOS KGG Special NEZ Borno Magumeri NIE BOS MGM Special NEZ Borno Kala/Balge NIE BOS KBG Special NEZ Borno Ngala NIE BOS NGL Special NEZ Borno Abadam NIE BOS ADM Special NEZ Borno Askira/Uba NIE BOS ASU Special NEZ Borno Biu NIE BOS BBU Special 93 NEZ Borno Bayo NIE BOS BAY Special NEZ Borno Hawul NIE HWL Special NEZ BOS KWY Special Borno Shani BOS SHN Special NEZ Borno Chibok NIE CBK Special NIE ENS UMU VHR SWZ Mainland SHK VHR SWZ Oyo Iwajowa NIE OYS WEL VHR Annex 3: Polio SIA Schedule, 20 20 "}
