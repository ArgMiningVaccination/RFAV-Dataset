Non-stick cookware may seem great initially but when you dig a little deeper it's easy to uncover the toxins lurking in them. The most common nonstick cookware out there is Teflon. Teflon is the brand name of the chemical, non stick coating and it contains Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). It's a popular choice for most people when it comes to cookware because it's non-reactive, non-stick and stain resistant. It basically is a cook's dream- that is until you read the fine print on the toxins it's releasing every time you cook with it! Scary enough, 95% of non-stick pots and pans are made with Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon). ( [1]) While Teflon was first made using the chemical Perfluorooctanoic (PFOA) in the 1950's, they started adding Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) acid, or C8, to it to help alleviate some of the lumpiness from just using Perfluorooctanoic (PFOA). However, this produced an even greater toxic substance overall. It has been linked to many diseases, from cancer, liver disease, thyroid issues and growth issues. I dive in deep in my Non Toxic Cookware post and share everything you need to know about Teflon and why it is a MUST to avoid.

Caraway Cookware is such an easy transition for anyone looking to swap their traditional cookware. You won't miss your old toxic cookware at all with Caraway! It's so easy to use and it's completely nonstick. I haven't had any issues with food sticking to the ceramic pots or pans at all. Even my husband was so impressed with the performance. He couldn't get over how easy it was to use. I've made ground beef, sausage, chicken, eggs, quesadillas, vegetable stir fry's and more. I love the small fry pan for cooking eggs or quick one person meals. The Sauce Pan I've used so much for sauces, oatmeal and pasta. The Saut\u00e9 Pan is great for cooking larger one pot meals, meat and stir fry's and the Dutch Oven is great for soups, chili, whole chickens and broth. I really have used them all for different things and they work so well. Another point I wanted to make is that Caraway Cookware doesn't feel quite as heavy as some other ceramic cookware I've had in the past. They are sturdy but not too heavy. I like being able to still lift the pan with one arm if I need too. As with any ceramic cookware you want to make sure you use wooden, or silicone utensils on the pans, no stainless steel to prevent scratching. I have been so happy with Caraway Cookware and the overall performance of their ceramic pots and pans. Often you find a cookware and you love how it looks but not how it performs- Caraway does it all. From the sleek design, to the amazing even cooking, easy cleanup and effortless storage- Caraway makes it easy to switch to nontoxic cookware without thinking twice!

The Always pan is so unique compared to anything else I've used in the past. It does so much and only requires one pan! The Always Pan is coated in a non-toxic, ceramic non-stick coating. That means no PFOA, PTFE, GenX chemicals or any other toxic chemicals for that matter! Since it is tested to the standard of ceramic coating that means that NO heavy metals are able to pass through it. Our Place takes it a step further and tests it to the standards of polymeric coating (this is a thin layered coating that provides superior adherence and protection from corrosion). These standards mean that NOTHING can pass through their ceramic coating and that makes it the safest non-stick coating available! Initially I wasn't even going to review The Always Pan as I had read where people were talking about it having lead. I looked into it further and read Lead Safe Mama's full review on The Always Pan and how she had found traces of lead and several other heavy metals in it. [You can read about her findings here.](https://tamararubin.com/2020/12/lead-free-toxic-metals-free-always-pan-tests-positive-for-lead-chromium-titanium-cobalt-more-14-metals-using-xrf-technology/) She wasn't able to determine if the trace amounts were in the actual coating or if they were in the substrate of the pan. Meaning, once the coating wear's off you are left with the substrate. Although they were in the safe range and technically at very low levels, she still had detected lead. I think this is important for people to know and be aware of when making the best decision for them and their family. Ok, now time to actually share what I thought of The Always Pan. I really loved it! It definitely lives up to the hype in my opinion. It can do it all, from saut\u00e9, steam, boil, sear, fry- everything. The goal of The Always Pan is to replace 8 pieces of cookware- so it makes cooking simpler. It comes with a stainless steel steamer basket, a beachwood spatula, and a pourable spout. It's also much lighter than a traditional ceramic pan coming in at 3lbs. It's higher sides on the pan make it unique to other pans and easier cooking. There really isn't anything I disliked about it- other than the lead findings! ???? It works great for steaming veggies, cooking meat, tortillas- anything. I think this would be a great addition for someone who hasn't made the switch over to nontoxic cookware or if you want to incorporate this into your overall nontoxic cookware options to try.
