Peppermint is now cultivated widely, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. The two main cultivated forms are the black mint, which has violet-colored leaves and stems and a relatively high oil content, and the white mint, which has pure green leaves and a milder taste. The leaves are used medicinally. [What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support. This supplement has been used in connection with the following health conditions: |Used for||Why| | | 3 Stars Irritable Bowel Syndrome 90 mg of peppermint oil plus 50 mg of caraway oil in enteric-coated capsules taken three times per day | | Taking peppermint oil combined with caraway oil may reduce gas production, ease intestinal cramping, and soothe the intestinal tract. The combination of 90 mg of peppermint oil plus 50 mg of Whole peppermint leaf is often used either alone or in combination with other herbs to treat abdominal discomfort and mild cramping that accompany IBS. The combination of peppermint, caraway seeds, | | 2 Stars Gingivitis (Caraway, Chamomile, Clove Oil, Echinacea, Menthol, Molmol, Sage) 0.5 ml in half a glass of water three times per day swished slowly in the mouth before spitting out | | A mouthwash containing sage oil, peppermint oil, menthol, chamomile tincture, expressed juice from echinacea, myrrh tincture, clove oil, and caraway oil has been used successfully to treat gingivitis. A mouthwash combination that includes A toothpaste containing sage oil, peppermint oil, chamomile tincture, expressed juice from Echinacea purpurea, myrrh tincture, and rhatany tincture has been used to accompany this mouthwash in managing gingivitis. Of the many herbs listed above, chamomile, echinacea, and myrrh should be priorities. These three herbs can provide anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial actions critical to successfully treating gingivitis. | | 2 Stars Indigestion, Heartburn, and Low Stomach Acidity 90 mg of oil plus 50 mg of caraway oil in enteric-coated capsules taken three times per day, for indigestion only | | A combination of peppermint, caraway, and fennel has been shown to reduce gas and cramping in people with indigestion Carminatives (also called aromatic digestive tonics or aromatic bitters) may be used to relieve symptoms of indigestion, particularly when there is excessive gas. It is believed that carminative agents work, at least in part, by relieving spasms in the intestinal tract. Among the most notable and well-studied carminatives are , | | 2 Stars Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Caraway Seed, Fennel Seed, Wormwood) Refer to label instructions | | A combination of peppermint, caraway seeds, fennel seeds, and wormwood was reported to be an effective treatment for upper abdominal complaints in one trial. Whole peppermint leaf is often used either alone or in combination with other herbs to treat abdominal discomfort and mild cramping that accompany IBS. The combination of peppermint, caraway seeds, | | 2 Stars Irritable Bowel Syndrome 0.2 to 0.4 ml in enteric-coated capsules, three times per day | | Peppermint oil reduces gas production, eases intestinal cramping, and soothes irritation. It has been reported to help relieve IBS symptoms in two analyses of controlled trials. In the intestinal tract, oil reduces gas production, eases intestinal cramping, and soothes irritation. Peppermint oil has been reported to help relieve symptoms of IBS in two analyses of controlled trials. Evidence supporting the use of peppermint oil has come from double-blind trials that typically have used enteric-coated capsules that supply 0.2-0.4 ml of peppermint oil taken two to three times per day. Some trials have found peppermint oil ineffective. However, a pooled analysis (meta-analysis) of 9 randomized controlled trials (with a total of 726 patients) found that enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are a safe and effective treatment for IBS. The combination of 90 mg of peppermint oil plus 50 mg of Whole peppermint leaf is often used either alone or in combination with other herbs to treat abdominal discomfort and mild cramping that accompany IBS. The combination of peppermint, caraway seeds, | | 2 Stars Postherpetic Neuralgia 2 to 3 drops to the affected area three or four times per day | | Peppermint oil applied to the affected area may be effective for pain relief. One case report has been published concerning an elderly woman with postherpetic neuralgia who experienced dramatic pain relief from topical application of 2 to 3 drops of peppermint oil to the affected area 3 or 4 times per day.Each application produced almost complete pain relief, lasting approximately 6 hours. The woman began to experience redness at the site of application after four weeks of use. The oil was therefore diluted by 80% with almond oil; the diluted preparation did not cause redness, and continued to produce \"adequate\" though somewhat less-pronounced pain relief. | | 2 Stars Tension Headache Spread a 10% oil solution across the temples three times over a 30-minute period | | Peppermint is a soothing oil that appears to have pain-relieving effects when applied topically. A preliminary report suggested that oil has relaxing and pain relieving effects, and may be useful as a topical remedy for tension-type headache. In a double-blind study, spreading a 10% peppermint oil solution across the temples three times over a 30-minute period was significantly better than placebo and as effective as | | 1 Star Chronic Candidiasis Refer to label instructions | | Volatile oils from peppermint have been shown to have significant antifungal action. Doctors recommend enteric-coated capsules, which break down in the intestines instead of the stomach. Volatile oils from | | 1 Star Colic Refer to label instructions | | This gas-relieving herb is usually given to the infant as a tea. Peppermint tea should be used with caution in infants, as they may choke in reaction to the strong menthol. Several gas-relieving herbs used in traditional medicine for colic are approved in Germany for intestinal spasms. These include | | 1 Star Common Cold and Sore Throat Refer to label instructions | | Peppermint, a source of small amounts of menthol, is believed to work by acting on receptors in the nasal mucous membranes, leading to a reduction of nasal stuffiness. | | 1 Star Gallstones Refer to label instructions | | In one study, a mixture of essential oils successfully dissolved gallstones. The most effective herb in that mixture is available only by prescription, but peppermint oil is similar to it. According to preliminary research, a mixture of essential oils dissolved some gallstones when taken for several months. The greatest benefits occurred when the oils were combined with chenodeoxycholic acid, which is available by prescription. However, only about 10% of people with gallstones have shown significant dissolution as a result of taking essential oils. oil is the closest available product to that used in the research described above. Use of peppermint or any other essential oil to dissolve gallstones should only be attempted with the close supervision of a doctor. | | 1 Star Halitosis 0.5 to 8 grams daily | | Volatile oils made from peppermint have antibacterial properties and may be effective in mouthwash or toothpaste form. The potent effects of some commercial mouthwashes may be due to the inclusion of thymol (from | | 1 Star Low Back Pain Refer to label instructions | | A combination of eucalyptus and peppermint oil applied directly to a painful area may help by decreasing pain and increasing blood flow to afflicted regions. A combination of | | 1 Star Poison Oak/Ivy Refer to label instructions | | Cooling essential oils, such as peppermint, have also been used topically to relieve burning pain and itch. Cooling essential oils, such as and menthol, have been used topically to relieve burning pain and itch. Such oils should not be applied full-strength, but should rather be diluted (for example in lotion or gel) to avoid further skin irritation. A great many plants have been used historically to treat skin inflammations like poison oak and poison ivy dermatitis. Examples include Traditional Use (May Not Be Supported by Scientific Studies) Recognized in the early 18th century, the historical use of peppermint is not dramatically different than its use in modern herbal medicine. Classified as a carminative herb, peppermint has been used as a general digestive aid and employed in the treatment of [indigestion](/medical-topics/id/hn-1037005#hn-1037005-need-to-know) and intestinal [colic](/medical-topics/id/hn-1191006#hn-1191006-need-to-know) by herbalists.1 [] How It Works How It Works Peppermint leaves yield approximately 0.1-1.0% volatile oil which is composed primarily of menthol (29-48%) and menthone (20-31%).2 Peppermint oil is classified as a carminative (prevents and relieves intestinal gas).3 It may also relieve spasms in the intestinal tract. Peppermint oil or peppermint tea is often used to treat gas and indigestion. Three double-blind trials found that enteric-coated peppermint oil reduced the pain associated with intestinal spasms, commonly experienced in [irritable bowel syndrome](/medical-topics/id/hn-1226001#hn-1226001-need-to-know) (IBS).4, 5, 6 However, another trial found no effect of peppermint on IBS.7 A double-blind trial found that an enteric-coated combination of peppermint and [caraway](/medical-topics/id/hn-2060004#hn-2060004-uses) oils was superior to a placebo for people with gastrointestinal complaints including IBS.8 A combination of peppermint, caraway seeds, and two other carminative herbs ( [fennel](/medical-topics/id/hn-2089002#hn-2089002-uses) seeds and [wormwood](/medical-topics/id/hn-2187003#hn-2187003-uses)) was reported to be effective for gastrointestinal complaints including IBS in another double-blind study.9 A tea of peppermint is a traditional therapy for [colic](/medical-topics/id/hn-1191006#hn-1191006-need-to-know) in infants but has never been investigated in a human trial. Peppermint should be used cautiously in infants (see side effects below). Peppermint oil's relaxing action also extends to topical use. When applied topically, it acts as an analgesic and reduces pain.10 A trial of topical peppermint oil applied to the temples of healthy volunteers (with or without [eucalyptus](/medical-topics/id/hn-2086009#hn-2086009-uses) oil) found that peppermint oil had a muscle-relaxing action and it decreased tension.11 Topical peppermint oil alone reduced pain in people with tension headaches as well. How to Use It For internal use, a tea can be made by pouring 1 cup (250 ml ) of boiling water over 1 heaped teaspoon (5 grams) of the dried leaves and steeping for five to ten minutes. Three to four cups (750-1000 ml) daily between meals can be taken to relieve stomach and gastrointestinal complaints.12 Peppermint leaf tablets and capsules, 3-6 grams per day, can be taken. For treatment of [irritable bowel syndrome](/medical-topics/id/hn-1226001#hn-1226001-need-to-know), 1-2 enteric-coated capsules containing 0.2 ml of peppermint oil taken two to three times per day is recommended. For headaches, a combination of peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil diluted with base oil can be applied to the temples at the onset of the headache and every hour after that or until symptom relief is noted. [] Interactions Interactions with Supplements, Foods, & Other Compounds Interactions with Medicines [] Side Effects Side Effects Peppermint tea is generally considered safe for regular consumption. Peppermint oil can cause burning and gastrointestinal upset in some people.13 It should be avoided by people with chronic [heartburn](/medical-topics/id/hn-1037005#hn-1037005-need-to-know), severe liver damage, inflammation of the gallbladder, or obstruction of bile ducts.14 People with [gallstones](/medical-topics/id/hn-1216008#hn-1216008-need-to-know) should consult a physician before using peppermint leaf or peppermint oil. Some people using enteric-coated peppermint capsules may experience a burning sensation in the rectum. Rare allergic reactions have been reported with topical use of peppermint oil. Peppermint oil should not be applied to the face\u2014in particular, the nose\u2014of children and infants. Peppermint tea should be used with caution in infants and young children, as they may choke in reaction to the strong menthol. [Chamomile](/medical-topics/id/hn-2066005#hn-2066005-uses) is usually a better choice for this group for treating [colic](/medical-topics/id/hn-1191006#hn-1191006-need-to-know) and mild gastrointestinal complaints.
