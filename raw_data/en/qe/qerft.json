Integrative medicine is commonly defined as a combination of conventional treatment and complementary methods, sometimes offered at a center for integrative medicine, that facilitate the body's innate healing response. Having spent 45 years developing this emergent field, I will add to that: A good integrative medicine doctor can combine different methods, knowing how much of each to apply with different clients at different points... Genuine Care But a great integrative medicine practitioner connects deeply with you and brings genuine care to every meeting. I call this somatic empathy and it facilitates an even more powerful healing response from the body, because the practitioner listens and attunes deeply to you.

Integrative Nutrition: Improve Your Mood with Food What you eat has been proven to affect how you feel. But contrary to all the myths you have heard, there is no one right diet for everyone. You may be a carnivore, vegetarian, or omnivore, yet if you're not putting the right fuel into the engine of your innate, unique biology, over time you can develop depression, anxiety, or more. But there is a bright side because the reverse is also true: there are easy steps you can take to improve your condition - even if you have PTSD or other challenging mental health diagnoses. Eating the right foods for your biological system is key, and I can guide you in discovering what those foods are and the right amounts of them for your system. I invite you to take my short quiz and learn how your system metabolizes food \u2014 including what percentages of macronutrients \u2014 protein, fat, and carbohydrates \u2014 will make your engine purr.

Integrative Medicine Leads to Mind-Body Integration and Better Health Conventional medicine focuses on illness and symptoms, and usually addresses them without treating their underlying causes. It can provide short-term benefits, like using medication to help you get better sleep or improve your mood... But by leaving the root cause untreated, these benefits may easily be undone. Your mood starts feeling \"off\" again, or your sleep doesn't continue to improve, so you end up just as irritable, depressed, or off-balance. These kinds of stories are common, and they're just the tip of the iceberg. Most of the issues in play remain hidden from view. If you struggle with complex or chronic health conditions, it's not that you lack willpower. It is directly tied to the fact that most Western physicians aren't trained to investigate deeper causes - let alone treat them during 20-minute sessions - to bring the body back to a state of health. Inflammation Doctors typically don't treat inflammation, for example, even though research now shows it is a root cause for many issues ranging from depression to bipolar, PTSD, IBS, allergies, and chronic headaches. Using a full integrative assessment, including taking both psychological and physical health histories, I can help put all the factors together and take in the whole picture. I provide my clients with truly holistic support, including education, tools, practices, and more, as we discover the roots of the problem and treat them to stimulate healing. In our work together, I may suggest: - Nutritional therapies - Herbal medicine - Somatic therapies - Detoxification protocols - Talk therapy and coaching - Specific exercises Questions and Answers on Integrative Medicine Alternative medicine is any practice used in place of conventional medicine. Integrative medicine is complementary to conventional medicine rather than serving as an alternative. Integrative medicine includes the functional medicine approach, a systems biology-based approach that determines how and why illness occurs and focuses on identifying and addressing the root cause of disease. In addition, integrative medicine may also draw on traditional cultural medicine, looking to ancestral methods of healing to support the client in their health journey. Integrative medicine may include the use of supplements and herbs, shifts in one's diet, massage therapy, hydrotherapy, biofeedback, meditation, acupuncture, exercise, human/animal relationships, and more. My [Brainbow Blueprint](https://drlesliekorn.com/about/brainbow-blueprint/) [\u00ae](https://drlesliekorn.com/about/brainbow-blueprint/) model offers an individualized roadmap for using the right kinds of integrative medicine for you and your unique condition. The 5 domains are a classification structure developed in 2000 by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), now named the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). In this model, modalities are identified by where they fit into systems: alternative medical systems, mind-body interventions, biologically based treatments, manipulative and body-based methods, and energy therapies. While these distinctions may be helpful for some, they must be matched carefully to the individual's needs. The [Brainbow Blueprint](https://drlesliekorn.com/about/brainbow-blueprint/) [\u00ae](https://drlesliekorn.com/about/brainbow-blueprint/) draws on modalities from all 5 domains via a person-centered protocol. It works as a holistic and person-centered system of care rooted in and responsive to each client's physical and psychological history and wellness goals. Most university hospitals now offer integrative medicine clinics and clinics exist in the US in Atlanta, San Diego, and New York City, as well at University of Arizona, the Mayo Clinic, and the Cleveland Clinic. Before returning to private practice, I founded and directed an integrative clinic for over 25 years in Mexico and then in Olympia, Washington. The clinic offered psychotherapy, body-oriented psychotherapy, nutritional services, neurofeedback, yoga therapy, and three different types of bodywork including massage, Polarity therapy and craniosacral therapy.
