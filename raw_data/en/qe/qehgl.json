In the United Kingdom (UK) the annual incidence in children up to four years old is 2.8%,and for five to 15-year-olds it is 1.6%. 1Impetigo was described in 1864 by Tilbury Fox as a disease characterisedby 'circular, umbilicated quasi-bullous spots which increasecentrifugally, and become covered by yellow flat crustswhich cover over superficial ulceration'. 2It is generally a minor illness, causing few systemic ill effects. Less than 1%of cases lead to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis andtreatment of the impetigo lesions does not seem to stop sus-ceptible individuals developing this complication. 3Impetigo is a contagious infection and schools are advised to excludeaffected children until lesions have healed/crusted over oruntil they have received at least two days of treatment. 4 Impetigo can occur as a primary infection or secondary to pre-existing skin conditions, such as eczema or scabies. Ithas two forms: bullous 70% ofcases are the latter. 5Staphylococcus aureus has become the main bacteriological agent involved in the non-bullousform, either alone or with S. pyogenes (Lancefield group A). 6,7It tends to affect exposed areas, such as the face and extremities. The bullous form, in which the blisters are usu-ally less than 3 cm in diameter, is always caused by S. aureus . 8,9Its usual distribution involves the face, buttocks, trunk and perineum. There is some uncertainty regarding the optimal treatment of impetigo. Advice ranges from the use of oral flucloxacillin,erythromycin, penicillin or cephalosporins to topical treat-ment with acid mupirocin, and oral flucloxacillin orerythromycin for widespread disease. 13It is unclear whether topical or oral antibiotics are more effective, or indeedwhether specific treatment is indicated. Other treatmentsthat have been advocated include topical antifungal prepa-rations (with or without corticosteroids), treatments containing tea.17The ques- tion of whether an antibiotic is necessary at all, and if sowhich one, also has implications in current thinking aboutlimiting antibiotic use. 18,19 The diagnosis of impetigo is a clinical one and treatment decisions are rarely based on the results of skin swabs. Skinswabs do not reliably differentiate between infection andcolonisation 20and if samples are not taken correctly results may be unrepresentative.21It is therefore important to look at evidence that is based on the clinical appearance ofimpetigo, rather than bacteriological results. Rapid clinicalrecovery is important to patients and some authors havesuggested that patients should be re-examined after sevendays. 5,9,22For this reason evaluation of treatment effect with-A George, B Clin Sci, MB ChB, clinical research fellow; and G Rubin, FRCGP, professor of primary care, Centre for Primary and Community Care, University of Sunderland.

Uncertainty exists as to the most effective treat-ment, or indeed if treatment is necessary. Aim: To determine the most effective treatment for impetigo in a systemically well patient.Design of study: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Method: Databases were searched for relevant studies. The Cochrane highly sensitive randomised controlled trial (RCT)search string was employed and combined with the word'impetigo' as the MeSH term and keyword. The bibliographies ofrelevant articles were searched for additional references. RCTsthat were either double- or observer-blind, and involved system-ically well patients of any age in either primary or secondary caresettings, were included. Studies that selected patients on thebasis of skin swab results were excluded, as were studies thatwere not in English. Cure or improvement of impetigo reported atseven to 14 days from start of treatment was the primary out-come measure. Meta-analysis was performed on homogeneousstudies. Results: Three hundred and fifty-nine studies were identified, of which 16 met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis demonstratedthat topical antibiotics are more effective than placebo (oddsratio [OR] = 2.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49 to 4.86).There is weak evidence for the superiority of topical antibioticsover some oral antibiotics, such as erythromycin (OR = 0.48,95% CI = 0.23 to 1.00). There is no significant differencebetween the effects of mupirocin and fusidic acid (OR = 1.76,95% CI = 0.77 to 4.03).Conclusion: This review found limited high-quality evidence to inform the treatment of impetigo. From that which is available,we would recommend the use of a topical antibiotic for a periodof seven days in a systemically well patient with limited disease.Further research is needed on the role of flucloxacillin and meta- analysis.in seven to 14 days was a criterion for inclusion. Method Strategy The Cochrane highly sensitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) search string23was employed and combined with the word 'impetigo' as the MeSH term and keyword. Databaseswere searched in August 2002. They included MEDLINE(1966-2002), EMBASE (1980-2002), CINHAL (1982-2002),and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register as well as theNHS National Research Register, the NHS R&D register,Clinical Evidence , , and Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin . The bibliographies of relevant articles were searched for additional references. Pharmaceutical compa-nies were also contacted to obtain additional unpublisheddata. Study selection Randomised controlled trials of treatments of bullous or non-bullous impetigo, irrespective of extent of disease, wereincluded in this review. Included studies had to be double-or observer-blind and had to be conducted on systemicallywell patients of any age in either primary or secondary care.Studies were included if they were not exclusively aboutimpetigo (for example, pyoderma or bacterial skin infec-tions), but contained discrete data on impetigo. They had toreport cure or improvement of the condition within seven to14 days of starting treatment. Studies that selected patientsfor entry by bacteriology (skin swabs), or that excludedpatients from final analysis if swab culture proved negative,were excluded. Non-English studies were also excluded.One author (AG) checked the titles and abstracts of all stud-ies identified in the search process and selected relevantarticles. The full reports of these studies were scrutinisedand further studies excluded based on the inclusion criteria.Both authors independently reviewed the remaining articlesand the final selection of studies was agreed by discussion. Assessment of methodological quality Both authors independently scored selected papers for methodological quality using the Jadad scale24 (Table 1). This scale scores for randomisation, blinding, and patientattrition. Further marks can be added or subtracted basedon an assessment of the appropriateness of the randomisa-tion and double-blinding methods. The scale ranges fromzero to five, with a score of three or more suggestive of a'good' paper. Data extraction and statistical methods Data from included studies was extracted using a structuredpro-forma. This was done independently by both authors.Data was entered into RevMan MetaView software (version4.1) 25and analysis performed using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects model. Quantitative analyses of outcomes wereperformed on an intention-to treat basis where possible, andresults expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidenceintervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was calculated as a 2value with -1 degrees of freedom and significance at the 5% level. Results The search strategy identified a total of 359 titles. Of these,112 titles appeared to meet the inclusion criteria and theirfull texts were examined. After further selection, 40 of the 112papers were assessed independently by both authors(Figure 1). After discussion, a final selection of 16 paperswas made 6,7,14,15,26-37 (Table 2). Writing to pharmaceutical companies identified no additional data that met the inclu-sion criteria. Of the 16 trials included, 12 had a Jadad scoreof three or more, with six of the studies scoring five. The fourstudies deemed to be of poor quality (i.e. a score of lessthan three) were either not double-blinded in design 28,29,34or inappropriately blinded (comparing an ointment with acream 35). One study36had a score of three despite being single-blind because it adequately described its randomisa-tion procedure. For 12 of the 16 studies, sufficient data wereavailable to enable calculation of outcomes on an intention-to-treat basis. For the remaining four, data are presentedhere as completely as possible. 28,29,35,36 Five studies commented on the extent of impetigo (mild, moderate or severe), either defining it in terms of the size ofthe affected area, 27,29the number of lesions,33or not defin- ing the term.34,35However, outcomes were not reported in relation to these categories. Two studies explicitly excludedpatients with widespread disease. 6,7Most of the studies excluded patients who were systemically unwell or whowere taking topical or systemic antibiotics. Topical treatment versus placebo Three trials compared topical treatment with placebo.7,31,37 The combined number of patients in the three trials withimpetigo was 233 and most were children. One excludedpatients with widespread lesions (covering more than 5% ofthe skin surface area). 7Meta-analysis of these studies shows that topical treatment is more effective than placebo(OR = 2.69, 95% CI = 1.49 to 4.86). This equates to anabsolute benefit increase of 0.20 or a number needed to British Journal of General Practice, June 2003 481Review article HOW THIS FITS IN What do we know? Impetigo is a common bacterial skin infection presenting to general practitioners. Uncertainty exists as to the best treatment for the condition,or even if treatment is necessary. What does this paper add? There is a lack of high quality evidence for the treatment ofimpetigo. The available evidence indicates that topical antibi-otics are more effective than placebo, with a number neededto treat of five. Topical antibiotics may be more effective thansome oral antibiotics, though the evidence for this is weak.Treatment duration of seven days is sufficient and there is nodifference in effectiveness between mupirocin and fusidic acid.Further studies are required to examine the role of flu-cloxacillin and non-antibiotic treatments for impetigo. treat of five (Figure 2). Topical versus systemic antibiotics Four studies compared topical antibiotics with systemic antibiotics. One study concluded that oral antibiotics weresignificantly better than topical antibiotics 26while another study, which specifically excluded patients with widespreadlesions, came to the opposite conclusion.6The remaining two trials could not detect significant differences in effectbetween treatments. 27,33Differences existed, both in terms of patient groups and interventions. Three studies comparedoral erythromycin with topical antibiotics (mupirocin, 6,27bac- itracin33). 4.59, df [degrees of freedom] = 2, P = 0.1). Meta- analysis favoured topical treatment and tended towards sig-nificance (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.23 to 1.00) (Figure 3).Inclusion of the fourth study, 26which compared cephalexin topical treatment (OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 0.64 to 2.26) but was not significant. Mupirocin versus fusidic acid The BNF advises use of mupirocin or fusidic acid as topical treatment for impetigo.13Of the four studies comparing these two treatments, one showed 100% cure or improve-ment in both groups 31and one favoured fusidic acid,34while the other two favoured mupirocin35,36(with only one of these showing mupirocin to be significantly better than fusidicacid). The three studies that showed differences in treatmenteffects were all set in UK general practice. There was nostrong evidence of statistical heterogeneity ( 2= 5.94, df = 2, P= 0.051) and meta-analysis shows no difference between the two treatments, (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 0.77 to4.03) (Figure 4). Oral antibiotics Two trials compared the effects of different oral antibiotics.One, comparing co-amoxiclav with cefaclor, included 36patients aged between six months and 12 years with impeti-go. 32No difference between the two treatments was detect- ed. The second study29compared penicillin, erythromycin, and cephalexin in children. It concluded that cephalexin wasthe most effective, with erythromycin almost as effective, butthat penicillin was inadequate for treating impetigo. 482 British Journal of General Practice, June 2003A George and G Rubin Table 1.

Thiscould have implications for practice, as topical antibioticsare likely to have a better systemic side-effect profile thanoral antibiotics 38and may achieve better compliance with treatment. The greater effectiveness of topical therapy inskin conditions in general is plausible, and there is evidencefrom in vivo animal 39and human40studies that drug con- centrations at the site of disease are higher than with sys-temic drug administration. There is a lack of information onthe effectiveness of oral antibiotics in general, and flu-cloxacillin in particular. The most commonly studied topicalantibiotics are mupirocin and fusidic acid and meta-analysisshows that there is no difference between them. Treatmentduration of seven days appears to be effective for impetigo.The studies in this review were selected because inclusionwas based on clinical diagnosis, making its findings directlyapplicable to routine clinical practice. There is a lack of high quality evidence on the most effec- tive treatment of impetigo. Of the 359 studies identified, only16 were included in the final review. Many were rejected dur-ing the initial stages because of lack of randomisation, blind-ing, and comparative groups. Most of the studies were small(nine studies had fewer than 100 patients) and not allpatients included had impetigo. The largest study had 201patients with impetigo. 35Topical treatment appears to be effective in comparison with placebo. There were no trials oforal antibiotic against placebo that fulfilled the inclusion cri-teria. Some studies assessing the benefits of non-antibiotictreatments, such as disinfectant soaps, were identified, butagain these did not fulfill the criteria for inclusion. Limitations of this review Clinical heterogeneity between studies made meta-analysisdifficult. There was variation in how cure of impetigo wasreported and in the advice given to patients on preparationof skin before treatment (for example, advice to removecrusts, wash with soap or disinfectant). Some studies didnot describe the extent of impetigo, though the exclusion ofpatients who were taking, or had recently taken, systemicantibiotics might mean that less widespread disease wasbeing studied. The review was not designed to look at theside effects of treatments or to examine the effects of antibi-otic treatment on bacterial resistance. Studies that were notin English were excluded and as a result some importantfindings may have been missed, though there is some evi-dence to suggest that studies not in English contribute smallnumbers to the totals and this has little effect on treatmentestimates. 41In this case, the meta-analyses involve small numbers and their inclusion may have influenced theresults. Only one study not in English 42was included in a previously published review,43suggesting that its inclusion here would not have greatly influenced the results.

Several assessment scales have been devised; eachwith its limitations. That described by Jadad 24is a widely used scale and can be applied to different settings. It focus-es on three dimensions of internal validity \u2014 randomisation,blinding, and withdrawals. One criticism is that it gives moreweight to the quality of reporting rather than to actualmethodological quality 44and studies may be graded inac- curately as a result. Though some studies scored highly onthe Jadad scale, the overall quality of the majority of research identified was poor.

Thismakes its findings less applicable to routine clinical practice. Implications for practice Topical treatment for localised impetigo appears to be effec-tive and there is little difference between the two most com-monly used treatments. None of the studies identified in thisreview specifically evaluated the treatment of widespreadimpetigo, either as a primary objective or in subgroup analy-sis. The BNF 13and others advocate treatment with oral antibiotics for widespread impetigo, though the term 'wide-spread' is not defined. In practice, limited disease is usuallydefined as a small number of lesions confined to a singleanatomical area and widespread disease is anything else.There is a marked lack of evidence about the relative effica-cy of flucloxacillin and it is therefore not possible to saywhether this oral treatment is better or worse than topicaltreatment. There remains uncertainty about the effective-ness of non-antibiotic therapies and, though it may presentmethodological difficulties, further work in this area meritsattention from researchers. Given the lack of evidence forthe use of flucloxacillin, comparative studies of this andother oral antibiotics are also required. References 1. McCormick A, Fleming D, Charlton J.
