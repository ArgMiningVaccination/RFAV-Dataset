In a child's hands, a Bunny Hopkins \u00ae Wobble Board can become anything. The open-ended design of the Wobble Board encourages children to play with their endless imagination and creative freedom and gives the adult insight into children's thinking.

Each Wobble Board is finished by hand at Bunny Hopkins Atlanta workshop. And since every wood is different, each Wobble Board will be unique based on how the wood grain manifests itself on the wood stain and finish. In other words, your Wobble Board will be the one and only in the world! And that's by design! Are these safe for children? Yes, they are safe for children and are recommended for children 18 months and above. The wood we use is natural. All wood stains and coatings have been tested and are non-toxic, water based and do not contain heavy metals. Our products meet or exceed the CPSIA (Consumer Protection Safety Improvement Act), standards set by the CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission and ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) requirements. To keep everyone honest, we third-party test all our products. What is the age and weight limit? Our Wobble Boards are ideal for children aged 18 months and up. We have made it durable enough so that children can grow with it. Please look at our Instagram feed [@bunnyhopkinstoys](https://www.instagram.com/bunnyhopkinstoys/) (reposts from our customers) to see children having fun and creatively playing with our products. The weight limit on the Starter sized wobble boards is 350 lbs and the Regular sized wobble boards is 450 lbs. What is - and isn't - a defect? If you look closely at your wobble board, you will see wood grain which shows the unique nature of wood. These boards provide you with a wonderful way to talk with children about nature and the beauty of individual differences. Grain and streaks make your wobble board truly one-of-a-kind. Unlike plastic toys, no two Wobble Boards will ever be identical. Also, since the staining and finishing process is done by a human and not a machine, you would see personal touches and minor bleeding in the Rainbow and Diversity Wobble boards, which is normal and not a defect. However, if your wobble board is cracked or damaged within a year of your purchase, please let us know. We will assess and replace it.

As it goes with any wooden toy, we recommend taking good care of your toys. Please put them away when children are not playing with them. Keep them out of a child's mouth, away from your pets and away from food or other materials which can soil / dirty the wobble board. Clean them only when necessary. It is advised to clean with a damp cloth, combined with a mild detergent if necessary. It's important to wipe it with a dry cloth after cleaning. Just apply some natural beeswax every couple of years to make them look good. If you get a slight nick or dent, just sand it down lightly with 220 grit sandpaper/block and finish it with beeswax. These wobble boards durable enough to last several years. Can we use a wobble board on the floor? Please do not use this Wobble Board directly on the hardwood floor and tile floor to avoid the risk of slipping. Using hardwood may cause scratches on the hand-made finish. The product is intended to be used on carpet or rug to enhance the friction between the wobble board and the ground. Why don't you have felt bottom wobble boards? Our wobble boards do not have a felt option as we believe it reduces the degree of open-endedness of this amazing toy, especially when being used as a slide / bridge / car ramp and similar other creative play scenarios. Call us purists in this matter but that is a conscious design choice we have made. Warnings: Adult Supervision is recommended for use by children under the age of 6 years to prevent children from pinching fingers and toes underneath the board and to reduce the risks of falling off the Wobble Board.
