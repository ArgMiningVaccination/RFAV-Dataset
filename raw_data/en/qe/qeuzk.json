As many of us have experienced firsthand, it can be especially challenging when we try to make lifestyle changes that radically alter our previous routines\u2014not to mention the disorientation it can cause our bodies and minds. Balance is a difficult and delicate thing, not only to achieve but also to maintain on a long-term basis. In Ayurveda, there are a number of small practices that promote balance in a profound way, practices that add up to contribute meaningfully to our overall well-being. These kinds of practices are not only easy to approach, but they are easy to incorporate into one's daily routine, making it more likely that we'll maintain those habits and reap their long-term benefits. Seamless, quick rituals like [oil pulling](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/uma-oils/what-is-oil-pulling?_pos=1&_sid=c93dc4964&_ss=r), [dry brushing](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/uma-oils/dry-brushing-is-the-simple-wellness-booster-you-didn-t-know-you-needed?_pos=2&_sid=59d247c5d&_ss=r) and using a [kansa wand](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/uma-oils/the-kansa-wand-is-a-powerful-ayurvedic-tool-for-your-skin-here-s-how-to-use-it?_pos=2&_sid=c8ea9fe23&_ss=r) all promote detoxification, radiance, youthfulness and more. What's more, they often serve as acts of self-care that are indulgent and pleasurable to experience. One radically simple way you can alter your daily wellness routine is also by taking Ayurvedic herbal supplements. Herbs, herbal formulas and adaptogens are a crucial component of Ayurvedic practice. These natural remedies were formulated by ancient Ayurvedic practitioners who developed profound knowledge from the plants and various earth substances around them. As Dr. Vasant Lad notes, \"The pharmacology of Ayurveda is a vast science including thousands of medicines, many of them herbal preparations.\" Ayurvedic supplements are all-natural, potent ways to make a profound difference on your overall physical and mental health. You can cultivate some serious long-term benefits by simply taking one capsule a day. Does it get any better than that? At UMA, we have four different herbal supplements which offer various benefits for the mind, body and spirit. Here's a breakdown of each of them; they all have different targeted purposes, so you can formulate a supplement regimen that is best suited for your individual needs. [UMA Digestive Detox Herbal Supplement](https://www.umaoils.com/collections/herbal-supplements/products/digestive-detox-triphala-herbal-supplement?variant=35594449256615) Formulated with triphala, an ancient blend of three fruits native to India (bibhitaki, amalaki, and haritaki), our Digestive Detox Herbal Supplement cleanses muscles, fatty tissue and blood; boosts the immune system; lowers cholesterol; and eases inflammation. It's a powerhouse for boosting one's overall health and an especially potent supplement for improving, detoxifying and regulating the digestive system. [UMA Love-Thy-Liver Herbal Supplement](https://www.umaoils.com/collections/herbal-supplements/products/love-thy-liver?variant=35133702930599) This healing, detoxifying supplement targets the liver, a vital organ that expels toxins and keeps our blood clean, metabolizes nutrients, stores energy and even aids us in processing our emotions and experiences. As such, it's an extremely important organ to protect and keep healthy; when our liver health declines, we can experience immediate negative (and potentially fatal) effects on our overall health. This supplement, formulated with Triphala, was specifically designed to protect and bolster the liver, providing essential support to this hard-working organ. [UMA Brilliant Brain Herbal Supplement](https://www.umaoils.com/collections/herbal-supplements/products/brilliant-brain-brahmi-herbal-supplement?variant=35594157097127) This potent supplement boasts a wide array of mental benefits. It's formulated with Brahmi, which is revered for its abilities to promote overall brain enhancement, improve memory and even potentially treat neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Brahmi is also known to promote restorative sleep. By incorporating a Brahmi supplement into your everyday routine, you can take a powerful step toward maintaining cognitive function and focus. Ashwagandha is one of the most well-known Ayurvedic herbs. It's highly revered in the wellness world\u2014and for good reason. Ashwagandha's benefits include alleviating physical and psychological stress, reducing inflammation and promoting overall vitality. [UMA Deep De-Stress Herbal Supplement](https://www.umaoils.com/collections/herbal-supplements/products/deep-de-stress-ashwagandha-herbal-supplement?variant=35593801859239) [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252722/)demonstrates that the herb also has profound effects on one's mental health, promoting memory and proving to be a helpful source in treating neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Harnessing this potent herb for stress relief, mental sharpness and physical detoxification, our Deep De-Stress Herbal Supplement will renew both mind and body.
