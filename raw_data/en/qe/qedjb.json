Great ingredients! Love the Clean Carbs, definitely my favorite addition to post workout shakes. Not only is the product amazing, but the customer service definitely deserves a shout as well. My original order showed up damaged (a carrier issue not a packaging issue) and I wrote them company an email to let them know; two days later my replacement was at my front door. Thanks for rocking, Swolverine! This stuff is amazing. It tastes great and give me more energy before and during my workouts. It the best carb product by far!! Especially since its made from real food. Payment & Security Your payment information is processed securely. We do not store credit card details nor have access to your credit card information. First Time Buyer I was surprised that it was actually powder sweet potatoe/yams, vs just a white powder. I like the taste and the oats are nice added texture. I drink before bicycle rides with protein and I do think it helps with my workouts. Love the carbs!! I find this item to be very helpful in fueling my workouts as well as replenishing my body after I complete workouts. It's super easy to digest and tastes great. Funciona! Te recuperas m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido entre sesiones, era por la que quer\u00eda comprarlo y FUNCIONA. Con leche de avena y en nosotros y en nuestra marca Delicious I add it to my shake and it gives my shake that oatmeal texture and really helps to drink it faster than without it. I haven't had any stomach issues with the product which is always a good sign. Swolverine Jonathan! Pumped you're loving the clean carbs. It's one of our favorites! Love it! Love the ingredients and the taste especially mixing it with protein powder. It also works great if you want to experiment with cooking and/or baking. "}
