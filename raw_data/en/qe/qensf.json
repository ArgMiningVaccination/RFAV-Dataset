At the morning Poster Show, 55 presenters made up of undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, staff, and post-docs presented their research through short talks to visitors and judges, using their posters to supplement their explanations. Regardless of the discipline, the research presented from the College revolved around bettering individual and community health and promoting physical, mental, and social well-being. Winning poster presentations were determined by judges and the Poster Show award-winners were announced at the end of the day. Award-winners included studies on insomnia sleep-habits, gluten-sensitive consumption alternatives, psychometrics on inhibition tasks in young children with down syndrome, eating disorders within the CSU population, women of color in science speaking truth to power, and more. Keynote speaker This year, the keynote address was given by Gerald Buckwalter, chief innovation officer for the American Society of Civil Engineers and president of his consulting firm, Strategy Essentials. He has served on the National Infrastructure Advisory Council under both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush and is also a member of the board of the Center for Public Policy Innovation and has served on the board of the National Homeland Defense Foundation. Additionally, Buckwalter oversees the [Future World Vision](https://www.futureworldvision.org/) initiative, a forward-leaning strategic assessment and visualization project that is creating a virtual and interactive computer model to assess potential built environments 50 years into the future. Buckwalter's speech, titled \"Envision The Future,\" highlighted this initiative and provided a glimpse into the future through visualization and prediction based on research. Buckwalter explained the various environmental challenges derived from improvements in technology, using examples from past advancements to assess the feasibility of future projects. His research delved into ways technology and the human population have changed the environment, as well as ways society needs to better plan around the environment. For example, Buckwalter stressed the importance of vertical structures that are conducive to the area around them, integrative strategies to reduce the expanding carbon footprint, and developing tangible plans to increase overall efficiency in an ever-expanding population. \"It is often easier to focus only on incremental changes.\" Buckwalter said. \"We all need to learn how to ask the right questions, think critically, be bold and comprehensive in our planning, develop potential solutions, and collaboratively promote those solutions to change our culture, improve everyone's quality of life, and help make the communities we serve healthier than what they are now.\" [Watch Buckwalter's full keynote address ](https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/research-and-scholarship/chhs-research-day/2023-chhs-research-day-speakers/)on the college's website. Following Buckwalter's keynote address, faculty and Dean's Fellows gave four-minute lighting talks. Researchers in seven of the College's disciplines provided concise overviews of their work. This year's Dean's Fellows are: Mohammad Teymouri, Construction Management; Elliot Graham, Food Science and Human Nutrition; and Heidi Tseng, Human Development and Family Studies. Teymouri discussed sustainable and more effective alternatives to concrete and concrete de-icing. Graham illustrated how obesity detrimentally impacts the gut microbiome and may interact with immune responses to viruses like SARS-CoV-2, presenting potential guidance for obese populations. Tseng shared research focusing on the motivational and attitudinal factors contributing to better health and well-being for aging adults. Each of the seven faculty presenters from the College outlined their research studies revolving around sustainable clothing production, food processing and replacing traditional ingredients for consumption, cancer survivors maintaining positive mental health, aging paradoxes in older adults, impact of yoga on individuals with disabilities, metacognition and understanding in education, and sexual violence prevention.
