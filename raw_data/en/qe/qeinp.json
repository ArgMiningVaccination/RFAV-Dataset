Menopause is a natural biological process that all women experience at some point in their lives. During this time, the body goes through numerous physical changes as it adjusts to fluctuating hormone levels. Many women have unpleasant symptoms during menopause, including hot flashes, mood swings, and insomnia. Hair loss is another common occurrence. Most women experience overall hair thinning rather than noticeable bald spots. The thinning can occur on the front, sides, or top of the head. Hair may also fall out in large clumps during combing, brushing and hair wash. Hairloss in menopause is a result of hormonal imbalance. Specifically, it's related to a lowered production of estrogen and progesterone. When the levels of estrogen and progesterone (female hormones) reduce, hair grows more slowly and becomes much thinner. A decrease in these hormones also triggers an increase in the production of androgens, or a group of male hormones. Androgens shrink hair follicles, resulting in hair loss on the head. In some cases, however, these hormones can cause more hair to grow on the face. This is why some menopausal women develop facial and small thick hair on the chin. There are many other factors that can contribute to hair loss during menopause. These include extremely high levels of stress, illness, or a lack of certain nutrients. Diagnostic blood tests that can help rule out other causes of hair loss include thyroid tests, and/or a complete blood count. Follow these tips to keep your locks healthy and strong during menopause. 1. De-stress Yourself It is important to keep your stress levels in check to prevent a hormonal imbalance. Reduced estrogen production can affect your brain and cause mood swings, anxiety, and depression. However, doing yoga and other breathing relaxation methods are especially effective in fighting menopausal symptoms. Exercising regularly can also help reduce stress. 2. Exercise Daily Exercise is a key component of a healthy lifestyle. You'll feel stronger and happier once you incorporate exercise into your daily routine. It also helps prevent some of the other symptoms of menopause, including mood swings, weight gain, and insomnia. All of these factors are important for maintaining hormonal balance, which promotes healthy hair growth. Choose a form of exercise that works for you. You may want to consider taking a walk with a friend, joining a gym, going for a run, yoga or meditation. 3. Eat a Well Balanced Diet Eating a balanced, low-fat diet is your best defense against hair loss. Make sure you include an adequate amount of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in every meal. It's also important to incorporate mono-saturated oils, such as olive oil and sesame oil, into your diet. Drinking green tea and taking vitamin B6 and folic acid supplements may help restore hair growth as well. Essential fatty acids also play a crucial role in maintaining hair health. Your body needs to be hydrated in order to function properly. Load up on water all day long. The amount of water needed varies from person to person and depends on various factors, including overall health and exercise intensity. As a general rule, however, you should aim to have eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. 5. Limit the use of Chemicals and Instruments for your Hair In order to prevent drying and breakage; it's best to stay away from heat tools, such as hair dryers and straightening irons. If you must dye your hair, choose an all-natural hair color. Artificial chemicals found in dyes and perms can compromise your scalp and hair health. When you wash your hair, always use a nourishing conditioner to keep your scalp healthy and promote healthy hair growth. 6. Talk to your Homoeopath for natural treatment without any side-effects Homoeopathy is a holistic system of medicine. A woman suffering from menopause related problems for example hot flushes is not only treated for hot flushes but the homoeopath will look at the person as a whole and prescribe the medicine. This is called a constitutional medicine. If a homoeopathic remedy is prescribed in this way it will treat the overall imbalance and there will be great improvement of overall health. HRT (hormone replacement therapy) have known side-effects like bloating, breast tenderness or swelling, leg cramps, headaches and vaginal bleeding. Homeopathy is free from any side-effects. Not only do homoeopathic medicines reduce hairloss but they also protect the body from harmful side-effects that are common with conventional drugs. Underlying other hormone problems like thyroid problems can also be effectively treated with homoeopathic medicines. Homoeopathy is a mind-body medicine. Homoeopathy treats not only the physical complaints, but also targets the mind and gently restores mind-body equilibrium- thus it treats the patient as a whole. "}
