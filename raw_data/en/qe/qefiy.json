We believe we're supposed to fit the standards of the day. And if we're not in the 1 percent of the population born with the body du jour, we feel it's our fault. We believe we can get there if only we eat less, eat differently, work out more, go vegan, throw up what we eat, give up gluten, take laxatives, fast, give up sugar, fill in the blank. But the reality couldn't possibly get any clearer: This is not a personal issue. This is not about your weakness or my laziness or her lack of self-discipline. This obsession is bigger than all of us. It's become epidemic, endemic, and pandemic. It comes from all around us, but it's dug its way deep under our skins, and it festers there.\" Harriet Brown Body of Truth Implicit in the title of Harriet Brown's new book, Body of Truth: How Science, History and Culture Drive Our Obsession with Weight -- and What We Can Do About It, is the idea that there is a body of lies. As a clinical psychologist who has been following the research on weight and health for more than 30 years, I can tell you that the framework on which purported weight loss \"treatments\" are hung is scientifically shaky and ethically problematic. Body of Truth does an excellent job documenting the fat hatred, [diseasemongering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_mongering) and profiteering feeding obsessions with weight and the conflation of weight and health. Brown teaches magazine journalism at Syracuse University. She is also the author of Brave Girl Eating, which chronicles her family's fight to save her daughter from anorexia nervosa. In Body of Truth Brown reports that a sixth-grade \"wellness\" class triggered her daughter's eating disorder -- and that when her daughter was a gaunt 14-year-old appearing near death, women came up to her on the street and asked for diet tips. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, according to the National Association of Anorexia and Associated Disorders ( [ANAD](http://www.anad.org/)). But government agencies and the medical establishment are focused on waging a \"war on obesity\" -- a war being advised by those who profit from selling weight-loss drugs, surgeries and devices, diet programs and diet books, and so-called workplace \"wellness\" programs, as well as researchers and agencies whose funding is tied to perceived public health threats. (Brown was told by many researchers that \"the easiest way to get a study funded now is to include the word 'obesity' in the proposal. Even better, cite 'childhood obesity.'\") Body of Truth skewers the myths and misconceptions conflating weight and health, including the assumption that fat is unhealthy. \"We have fat on our bodies, all of us; you can't be alive without it. More than half your brain is made of fatty acids; without enough fat, your brain deteriorates, leaving you vulnerable to ailments from depression and anxiety to fatigue and cognitive decline.\" Another misconception is that there actually is an \"obesity epidemic.\" The average American is only about 20 pounds heavier and 1 inch taller than in 1960, Brown notes, and in contrast to the fearmongering, \"the rates of overweight and obesity leveled off around 2000.\" If you still assume that weight gain and weight loss are simple matters of eating less and exercising more, or calories in vs. calories out, you may be surprised by Brown's reporting of the additional factors associated with weight gain and Type II diabetes, the latter frequently -- and erroneously -- assumed to be due to weight gain, rather than weight gain in some people being a symptom of insulin resistance. Such factors include persistent organic pollutants, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, psychiatric drugs, and artificial sweeteners. Yes, you read that right -- recent research suggests that artificial sweeteners (which, of course, are pitched as weight-loss aids), alter the bacteria in our guts, which in turn alters metabolism and can lead to weight gain. By the way, while people have gotten somewhat heavier (and, remember, taller) in recent decades, guess what? Animals have, too. Not just family pets, either -- lab animals, whose diet and activity are carefully regulated, and wild animals have been found to be heavier now than they were a few decades ago. Scientists suspect these animals' weights are being affected by environment toxins, viruses, and other factors besides overeating or inactivity -- just like human beings. Body of Truth should be on the shelves or the e-reading devices of all those who have been told they should lose, watch, or manage their weight. Or better still, all those who police others' weight or diet or exercise. Fat activists and proponents of the weight-neutral Health At Every Size approach (which Brown endorses) should add Body of Truth to their arsenal of weapons for fighting external and internal fat hatred. You can point to Body of Truth for Brown's debunking of the often-cited \"obesity epidemic\" claim that today's children will have a shorter life expectancy than their parents. You may also find useful her explanation of why the words \"overweight\" and \"obese\" are problematic: \"The word overweight, for example, implies excess; to be overweight suggests you're over the 'right' weight. The word obese, from the Latin obesus, or 'having eaten until fat,' handily conveys both a clinical atmosphere and that oh-so-familiar sense of moral judgment.\" Body of Truth: How Science, History, and Culture Drive Our Obsession with Weight --and What We Can Do About It is available in hardcover from the usual retailers (including [BookDepository.com](http://www.bookdepository.com/Body-Truth-Harriet-Brown/9780738217697), a store whose free shipping worldwide may be of interest to those outside the U.S.) and in ebook formats including [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PWX7SW8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00PWX7SW8&linkCode=as2&tag=pearlsongpres-20&linkId=WR4PKTSP2C6HXKIV) and [Nook](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/body-of-truth-harriet-brown/1120517713?ean=9780738217703&itm=1&usri=body+of+truth).
