Health officials in France and Israel are already giving third doses of mRNA vaccines to people with severely compromised immune systems. Solid-organ transplant recipients exhibit a weak immune response to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2).1 Patients with clinically or therapeutically suppressed immunity (e.g., transplant recipients, patients on cancer treatment or on immunosuppressive therapy), patients with rheumatologic conditions, immunodeficiency syndrome, hematopoietic cell cancers, asplenia, advanced kidney disease (e.g., dialysis or nephrotic syndrome) are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19, have prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection and have a higher susceptibility to infection with SARS-COV-2 variants.2-4 In the normal population, mRNA COVID-19 vaccination is highly effective with initial efficacy at around 95-97% and with efficacy maintained at approximately 75-77% after 250 days.5 Unfortunately, in immunocompromised individuals, the standard mRNA vaccination strategy for COVID-19 has suboptimal protection. Immune response to vaccination is significantly lower in these patients than the normal population. Data show that mRNA vaccine efficacy against new variants such as Delta B.1.617.2 is around 79-88% in the normal population after the second dose, but even lower in the immunocompromised patients.6,7 Percent antibody response after mRNA vaccination, even with two doses, are among the lowest in solid-organ transplant recipients compared with normal population or with other immunocompromised states such as hemodialysis or cancer patients, underlying the necessity for a booster vaccination in transplant recipient patients.1,8-10 Approximately half of cardiac transplant recipients do not generate IgG antibodies following two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.8 Evolving evidence supports that a booster with a third dose of the mRNA vaccination in solid-organ transplant recipients is safe and effective, with evidence of improvement in immunogenicity and protection from clinical COVID-19 infection.9,11,12 Initial reports of case series are now followed by strong evidence from a randomized clinical trial demonstrating that a third dose of mRNA vaccine given to 120 solid organ transplant recipients (18 of which were heart transplant recipients) three months after the first two doses resulted in a substantially higher immunogenicity compared with placebo and was quite safe.9,11,12 No hospitalizations or any cases of organ rejection were reported among the patients who received the booster dose of the mRNA vaccine. These data support that a third dose of the mRNA vaccination is highly beneficial with low risk in solid-organ transplant patients and should be considered in cardiac transplant recipients. It should be kept in mind that in the recently published randomized clinical trial, even after the third dose, only 55% of the transplant recipients had an antibody level above the protective threshold of 100 U per milliliter. Thus, barrier measures should continue to be maintained, and vaccination of the relatives and contacts of these patients should be strongly enforced in addition to the third booster consideration in cardiac transplant patients.11 References: - Boyarsky BJ, Werbel WA, Avery RK, et al.
