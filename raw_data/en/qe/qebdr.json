Why do you need to detox?: The best way to kick-start a diet is to detox your body so that you start fresh. Your raging appetite is the result of the buildup of toxins in your body. When toxins build up, your body is no longer able to successfully digest and absorb all of the nutrients in your food. This leaves you feeling hungry because your body is craving nutrients that are crucial for normal body function. Despite the fact that you may be eating a sufficient amount of food, you still find yourself hungry an hour after eating. When you remove all of the toxins in your body, you should be able to effectively absorb the nutrients from your food. Our detoxifying tea contains ingredients that have been used for years for removing toxins, cleansing the colon, weight management, and suppressing appetite. The best part? Total Tea detox tea is delicious and it is gentler on the digestive system than other teas.* Detox Tea Tips: Clients typically get results within 1-3 days, but it can take longer depending on the age, weight & other factors. We recommend drinking 1 serving of our herbal detox tea in the evenings for a minimum of 1 week to see the cleansing health benefits and then adjust as needed. If the results are too strong, decrease the steep time and/or the amount taken. If you need something a little stronger, increase the steep time and/or use less water. If that still isn't doing the trick, you can drink 1 serving of detox tea in the morning and 1 in the evening. Once you begin to experience the detox effect, drop back down to 1 serving in the evenings. And as with any detox, DRINK PLENTY OF WATER!
