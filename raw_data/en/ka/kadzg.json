We explored topical vaginal application as an approach to initiate local antigen-speci ci m m u - nity, enhance previously existing systemic immunity or re-target responses to the mucosae. To deliver a protein vaccine formulation to the vaginal mucosal surface, we used a novel vaginal ring device comprising a silicone elastomer body into which three freeze-dried, rod-shaped, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose inserts were incorpo- rated. Each rod contained recombinant HIV-1 CN54gp140 protein (167 g) \u00b1 R848 (167 g) adjuvant. The inserts were loaded into cavities within each ring such that only the ends of the inserts were initially exposed.Sheep received a prime-boost vaccination regime comprising intramuscular injection of 100 g CN54gp140 + 200 g R848 followed by three successive ring applications of one week duration and separated by one month intervals. Other sheep received only the ring devices without intramuscular priming. Serum andvaginal mucosal fluids were sampled every two weeks and analysed by CN54gp140 ELISA and antigen-speci c B cells were measured by flow cytometry at necropsy. Vaccine antigen-speci c serum antibody responses were detected in both the intramuscularly-primed and vaginal mucosally-primed groups. Those animals that re-ceived only vaginal vaccinations had identical IgG but superior IgA responses. Analysis revealed that all animals exhibited mucosal antigen-speci c IgG and IgA with the IgA responses 30-fold greater than systemic levels. Im- portantly, very high numbers of antigen-speci c B cells were detected in local genital draining lymph nodes. We have elicited local genital antigen-speci c immune responses after topical application of an adjuvanted anti- gen formulation within a novel vaginal ring vaccine release device. This regimen and delivery method elicitedhigh levels of antigen-speci c mucosal IgA and large numbers of local antigen-reactive B cells, both likely essen- tial for effective mucosal protection. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

Introduction While it is relatively easy to elicit antigen-speci c serum antibodies, it is much more dif cult to establish meaningful levels of speci ca n t i - bodies at mucosal surfaces, the major route of viral invasion. In this study, we sought to determine if mucosal vaccination using topical vag- inal application could initiate local antigen-speci c immunity, and/or enhance or re-target previously existing systemic immunity to the mu- cosae. Previous studies in mice have shown that vaccines generatinghigh levels of systemic antigen-speci c immunity can lead to the ap- pearance of genital tract mucosal surface responses, derived from the systemic compartment [1-3]. Also in mice, studies have shown that di- rect mucosal vaccination via the intranasal, sublingual or intravaginalroutes ciently enhance immune responses at other mucosal sur- faces. This observation is generally attributed to common mucosal link-age, but this distribution of mucosal associated responses has been found to be very weak or absent in larger animals, and particularlyman [4-7]. In an effort to generate local mucosal immunity, a number of researchers have explored genital tract targeted vaccination to estab-lish regional vaccine speci c immunity by injecting genital tract associ- ated lymph or immunisations, these mucosal-directed in- terventions elicited higher levels of both B and T cell vaccine speci ci m - mune responses [8,9].Journal of Controlled Release 249 (2017) 74 -83 Corresponding author at: Mucosal Infection and Immunity, Section of Virology, St Mary's Campus, London W2 1PG, AP: NanoXpert Technologies, Mumbai, India. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.01.018 0168-3659/\u00a9 2017 The Authors.

The application of vaginal ring technology to controlled release of macromolecules, includ-ing protein antigens, is considerably more challenging owing to the thermal instability of proteins under the processing conditions com-monly used to manufacture rings and the limited permeability of pro- teins in the polymeric materials. Nonetheless, a small number of papers have been published reporting ring technologies offering sustained/controlled release of macromolecular therapeutic agents [14 -16]. We previously reported a silicone elastomer vaginal ring de- vice comprising a one-piece ring body into which various drug-loadedinserts could be placed [15]. The body of this ring device had a similar design to that of the matrix-type dapivirine-releasing vaginal ringbeing developed for HIV prevention by the International Partnership for Microbicides [17 -19], except for the inclusion of three small cavities for placement of the protein drug delivery inserts. With this ring design,it is possible to deliver combinations of macromolecular and small mol- ecule therapeutic agents (e.g. HIV antigen + HIV microbicide combina- tions) at independently-controlled release rates. In this study, we sought to establish whether this vaginal ring device could be used to de- liver recombinant HIV-1 envelope protein CN54gp140 as a vaccine cargo that could be 'seen 'by the immune monitoring system of the fe- male sheep genital tract. The sheep vagina and cervix are anatomicallyand histologically similar and of comparative dimensions to the human female genital tract and have been used to test the delivery and pharmacokinetics of a variety of anti-HIV retrovirals and contracep- tives within vaginal ring devices [20 -22]. We also examined the role of an adjuvant in eliciting immune responses, its effect on the vaginal vault and detailed the relative antigen-speci c humoral immune responses in the mucosal and systemic compartments. 2. Results2.1. Vaccine carrier system: release of vaccine antigen Werst assessed the release kinetics of the CN54gp140 vaccine an- tigen from covered elastomer tube. The recombinant HIV Enve- lope (Env) protein was released into 2 mL of either PBS (pH 7.2) or a simulated vaginal fluid (SVF; pH 4.2) to model release within the vagi- nal vault. CN54gp140 protein released into the media was quanti ed using a speci c capture ELISA with a known concentration CN54gp140 standard curve. The CN54gp140 protein was released in a sustained manner over a period of 24 h, with N99% of the total protein being released by all rod formulations in either PBS or SVF at the 24 h sample timepoint (Fig. 1 ). However, there were clear differences in the release kinetic de- pending on the nature of the release medium and whether the formula-tion contained R848. Freeze-dried rods released the protein more quickly into the low pH SVF media than PBS and rods containing R848 were more easily reconstituted in solution. When incubated in SVF, CN54gp140 + R848 rods released 88% of the recombinant protein with-in 6 h and 98% in 12 h whereas in PBS pH 7.2 67% release is achieved in 6 h and 84% in 12 h. Freeze-dried CN54gp140 alone released 71% (6 h) and 86% (12 h) of the recombinant protein when incubated in SVF, and 53% (6 h) and 70% (12 h) when incubated in PBS pH 7.2 ( Fig. 1 ). 2.2. Mixed route prime-boost combinations with TLR7/8 adjuvantation elic-it high levels of CN54gp140-speci c humoral immunity We initiated a series of vaccinations to assess the ability of silicone elastomer intravaginal ring devices to deliver recombinant antigen di-rectly to the cervicovaginal mucosa and elicit systemic or local vaccineantigen-speci c humoral immunity. Sheep received either an intramus- cular (IM) priming vaccination of 100 g CN54gp140 + 200 gR 8 4 8a d - juvant followed by three intravaginal ring immunisations at monthlyintervals, or intravaginal rings without any prior IM priming vaccina- tion. The intravaginal rings all contained 500 gr e c o m b i n a n t CN54gp140 antigen, matched to previous intravaginal doses used inhumans [23]. Two of the four animal groups received intravaginal rings that also contained the TLR7/8 adjuvant R848 (groups 1 and 2)while the other two groups received rings containing CN54gp140 anti- gen without any R848 adjuvantation (groups 3 and 4; Table 1 ). Anal control group of sheep received four IM immunisations at monthly in-tervals (group 5; Table 1 ). The sheep were bled every two weeks and vaginal samples were taken at regular intervals, according to theimmunisation and sampling schedule as shown ( Fig. 2 ). Sheep that received an IM prime with adjuvant and were then boosted with an intravaginal ring device containing adjuvanted antigen exhibited strong generation of systemic antigen-speci c humoral re- sponses to the HIV Env CN54gp140 vaccine protein, increasing mean blood serum antigen-speci c IgG antibody levels from 6.35 g/mL (day 28 after IM prime) to 1375 g/mL (day 42, two weeks after the IVag ring boost), a 216-fold increase ( Fig. 3 a,Table 2 ). Indeed, the gp140-Speci c IgG responses initially elicited by the R848 adjuvanted IM injection were enhanced after each successive ring application reaching peaks of 2228 g/mL at day 70, two weeks after the second ring application, and 2683 g/mL at day 98, two weeks after the third andnal ring was inserted. In animals that did not receive any IM prime (group 2 in Table 1 )t h erst ring application was able to generate antigen-speci c humoral immunity that was detectable in the serum. Interestingly, the second ring application substantially boosted theserum IgG gp140-speci c responses by 70-fold, from 10.7 g/mL to 739 g/mL at the peak response two weeks after insertion of the IVag rings and the third ring application in these IM unprimed animals0 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48050100 HoursCumulative % ReleaseCN54 gp140 Protein Released + R848 - SVF Fig. 1.

A comparison of the antigen-speci c IgG antibody levels between the IM primed (group 1) and unprimed (group 2) animals revealed that the peak levels on day 28 and day 42 were statistically different (** p= 0.0079) with there being no difference at any other time. The systemic antigen-speci c IgA achieved signi cantly higher levels in animals that did not have any IM priming immunisation incomparison to those animals that had the potent systemic prime (Fig. 3 b,Table 2 ). At the end of the vaccination schedule, following three separate intravaginal ring inoculations, the antigen-speci c IgA present in the serum compartment was signi cantly higher than in those animals that had received an IM prime (* p= 0.0317), although levels were N3 logs lower than that seen for speci cI g G . We next examined the antigen-speci c immunity at the mucosal surface. We sampled the vaginal mucosae at various times during the schedule and measured gp140-speci c IgG and IgA ( Fig. 4 ). IM primed gp140-speci c mucosal IgG responses were effectively enhanced by intravaginal vaccination with the ring device that contained antigen adjuvanted with R848 and antibody levels were boosted by subsequent ring applications. The speci c antibody levels were statistically different between the IM primed and the unprimed groups at day 42, 2 weeks after and at day 56, one month after the insertion of the rst ring (Fig. 4 a; **p = 0.0079). There were no statistical differences at other sampling timepoints, and at the end of the vaccination schedule (after three intravaginal ring inoculations) the CN54gp140 antigen-speci c antibody levels were ( 4 a,Table 2 ). Interestingly, anti- gen-speci c mucosal IgA followed the same pattern. Levels were statis- tically different after the rst ring application (day 56), where the IM primed group had higher levels in the vaginal vault, but after the second and then the nal ring vaccination the levels were equivalent. Impor- tantly, the levels of mucosal IgA were substantially higher at the muco-sal surface compared to the systemic serum compartment. Animals that had not been previously primed with an IM vaccination had 20-fold higher IgA in the vaginal vault while those that had received an IM prime followed by immunisation with the vaginal rings exhibited a marked difference, with the vaginal vault having 400-fold more speci c antibody when compared to the serum responses ( Figs. 3 b,4ba n d Table 2 ). 2.3. Sheep immunised with intravaginal rings without local mucosal R848adjuvantation fail to elicit signi cant CN54gp140-speci ch u m o r a l immunity In order to determine the contribution of the R848 TLR7/8 adjuvant to the size and kinetics of the immune response, we next examined the elicitation of antigen-speci c serum and mucosal IgG and IgA in animalsthat immunised with intravaginal rings that contained antigen butno R848 adjuvant. Sheep received an R848 adjuvanted IM prime and were then boosted with a vaginal ring device containing only gp140 an- tigen. The systemic CN54gp140-speci c IgG levels were very low, though the response was enhanced after the second ring applicationbut not after third. Animals that had not received an IM priming vacci- nation had statistically higher levels of mucosal IgG than primed ani- mals at day 70 ( p= 0.0159; two weeks after the 2nd ring insertion),Fig. 2. Vaccination, bleed and vaginal sampling schedule. Two-year-old sheep were immunised at monthly intervals using intravaginal rings containing CN54gp140 HIV Env antigen \u00b1 R848 adjuvant. The rings were maintained in place at the cervicovaginal area for 1 week before removal. Some sheep received a prior IM vaccination one month before the insertion of the rings. Animals were bled weekly and had vaginal mucosal antibody Weck-Cel\u00ae swabs taken at the times indicated. Fig. 3.

However, peak systemic responses in these animals that did not receive the R848 adjuvant with the CN54gp140 vaccine in the ring were 300-fold lower than those seen when using rings containing R848 ( Fig. 3 a). In these an- imals no antigen-speci c IgA was detected throughout the vaccination schedule ( Fig. 5 a, b and Table 2 ). Animals that did not receive an IM prime mounted only barely de- tectable antigen-speci c IgG responses that were 2000-fold lower than animals that also received no IM prime but were exposed toR848 adjuvanted protein within the intravaginal rings ( Figs. 3 and 5 ). There were no detectable antigen-speci c IgG or IgA mucosal antibody responses in any of the animals that were vaccinated with intravaginal rings containing antigen without R848 adjuvant. At necropsy, there were no antigen-reactive cells in any of the compartments tested(Table 2 ). As a comparison, animals that received four IM vaccinations at monthly intervals with R848 adjuvanted CN54gp140 protein produced a good systemic IgG response reaching a maximum peak two weeks after the third vaccination with a mean of 1972 g of CN54gp140 anti- gen-speci c IgG ( Fig. 6 ). The subsequent fourth vaccination failed to augment this peak response further. There was no systemic or mucosal antigen-speci c IgA detected in these animals during the entire vaccina- tion schedule ( Fig. 6 ). Interestingly, systemic responses (IgG and IgA) were lower than those seen in animals receiving mucosal adjuvanted rings ( Table 2 ). Mucosal antigen-speci c IgG was detected at low levels in the vagi- nal mucosal samples and followed the pro le of the systemic serum IgG precisely indicating the antibody present was derived from serum exu-date ( Fig. 7 ). Again, there was no detectable antigen-speci c IgA in the vaginal samples taken throughout the vaccination regimen ( Fig. 7 ). 2.4. Sheep that received intravaginal rings containing both CN54gp140 and R848 adjuvantation contained large numbers of antigen-binding cells in the local vaginal draining LN The notable observation that the vaginal vault contained dramatically higher levels of antigen-speci c antibody in either unprimed or IM primed animals that received intravaginal rings containing CN54gp140 + R848 led us to hypothesise that this local production may be re flective of local B cell expansion and residency in the lymph nodes draining the femaleTable 2 Serum and mucosal IgG and IgA levels ( g/mL) 2 weeks after each vaginal ring insertion (Days 42, 70 and 98) and at end of vaccination schedule (Day 112) (\u00b1SD in parentheses).

At the end of the immunogenicity study, we inserted a new ring (500 g CN54gp140 + 500 g R848) into each sheep at day 112 before the animals were necropsied one week later. Our aim was to determinethe in flammation caused by the ring after a typical 7-day application and also to examine the local lymph nodes immune response at the sametime as responses in the systemic compartments. At necropsy, we re- moved the external iliac lymph nodes, spleen and peripheral blood from each sheep, processed to isolate lymphocytes and then incubated with a fluorochrome-labeled vaccine antige n CN54gp140-Alexa 647 or a control Tetanus Toxoid antigen (TT)-Alexa 647. B lymphocytes expressing an anti- gen receptor on their surface should bind the labeled antigen and the num- ber and intensity of the bound labeled antigen positive cells wasdetermined using flow cytometry. While the peripheral blood cells showed very low antigen-speci c staining and the splenocytes demon- strated slightly more, the level of speci c staining in the draining lymph nodes clearly revealed a sizeable population of cells with cell surface recep-tors that speci cally bound the vaccine CN54g p 1 4 0a n t i g e ni nc o m p a r i s o n to the control ( Fig. 8 ). In the absence of R848 the vaginal ring containing the unadjuvanted CN54gp140 protein did not elicit this population of an- tigen binding cells in the vaginal draining LN (Supplementary Material S1). Nine out of the 10 animals that received intravaginal rings contain- ing antigen and R848 adjuvant had large populations of antigen-speci c cells in the draining external iliac lymph nodes ( Table 3 ). We statistical- ly compared the levels of antigen-stained cells between the blood, spleen and the vaginal draining lymph node using an unpaired t-tests with Welch's correction for unequal variances and found that as expect-ed there was no difference between the levels of speci c cells found in the blood and spleen for both groups of animals. However, group 1iliac LN contained statistically higher numbers of speci c cells than both the blood ( p= 0.0207) and the spleen ( p= 0.0225), and group 2 iliac LN also had higher numbers though only just achieving statistical differences to the blood and the spleen ( p= 0.0499). An important consideration when using intravaginal rings that re- lease antigen and an adjuvant at the mucosal surface is the degree of as- sociated in flammation. Each ring that was removed was examined for the presence of blood and none was found. At necropsy, each vaginawas removed and closely examined for redness, tissue pathology and inflammation. The vaginal wall appeared normal with no apparent in- flammation; a photograph showing a typical vagina with the ring still in situ is shown (Supplementary material S2). 3.

This involves dissolution of the drug in the surrounding polymer, diffusion of the dissolved drug molecule to the ring surface, and then partitioning into the vaginal fluid. This simple permeation mechanism is generally not useful for release of biomole-cules, since their hydrophilic character and high molecular weight result in poor solubility and diffusion through the polymeric material. In the past ten years, the application of ring technology to vaginal administra- tion of HIV microbicide molecules has led to very considerable innova- tion in vaginal ring design, mostly aimed at providing viableformulation solutions for lead candidate microbicides having a very broad range of physicochemical properties [10]. However, despite these advances, the development of practical ring devices that are sim-ple and inexpensive to manufacture and can offer clinically signi cant drug release rates remains a challenge [16]. Here, we opted to use a ring technology previously reported for the sustained release of a model protein and a monoclonal antibody [15].T h i sa p p r o a c hp e r m i t - ted the silicone elastomer ring body and the antigen-loaded freeze-dried rod inserts to be manufactured separately, thereby reducing expo- sure of the antigen to the high processing temperatures normally asso- ciated with ring manufacture and exploiting use of established lyophilization techniques for formulation of the antigen. With this ring design, it is also possible to easily vary the dose of the antigen by reduc- ing or increasing the number of inserts, or to incorporate anantiretroviral microbicide, such as dapivirine, into the ring body to pro-duce a combination microbicide-vaccine formulation. This current study examined the potential of the vaginal mucosae as a site of initiation and/or enhancement of vaccine antigen-speci ci m - mune responses. We compared a direct vaccination to a boost of anexisting IM-elicited immune response using the vaginal ring delivery device, with the expectation that direct delivery of antigen to the vagi- nal mucosae alone might not have the potency to initiate a combined systemic and vaginal antigen-speci c immune response. Surprisingly, we discovered that vaginal vaccination alone was as potent (group 2) as IM-prime, vaginal boost (group 1, Table 2 ), with R848 being neces- sary to induce high levels of antigen-speci c systemic and mucosal an- tibody responses. Importantly vaginal vaccination with R848 was essential to induce localised mucosal responses. Further studies are now required to address the issue of dose response in relation to optimi- zation of antigen:adjuvant ratios. Animals receiving only IM immunisation (group 5) expressed no antigen speci c vaginal IgA while IgG levels were 1/10th of those seen in groups 1 and 2(Table 2 ). These data are supported by the local expansion of speci c B cells in lymph nodes draining the genital tract. In the absence of de-ned B cell markers for sheep, the nature and phenotype of local responding B and T cell responses will require further study in non-human primate and/or clinical studies. The lack of immune response to non-adjuvanted vaginal vaccination alone and very limited response following an intramuscular prime (groups 3 and 4, Table 2 )r eflects human clinical studies [24,25] . Very few clinical studies have assessed response to adjuvanted vaginal vacci-nation. In a previous human study using CN54gp140 and HSP70 as an adjuvant, IVag administration failed to induce detectable systemic or mucosal antibody responses but did induce adaptive CD4 and CD8 T- cell proliferative responses [9]. The difference in response may re flect difference in the adjuvant potential of HSP70 and R848, the latter asso-ciated with promoting mucosal IgA [6]. Indeed, two additional clinical studies of vaginal immunisation performed using recombinant choleratoxin subunit B (CTB), were shown to elicit vaginal and systemic Fig. 8. Elicitation of Antigen-Speci c B cells in vaginal local draining lymph nodes. Cells were harvested from the peripheral blood, the spleen or the vaginal external iliac lymph nodes and stained with Alexa-647 conjugated recombinant CN54gp140 protein.

McKay et al. / Journal of Controlled Release 249 (2017) 74 -83antibodies [23,26,27] . This may re flect the \"self-adjuvanting \"properties of CTB, known to be an effective mucosal adjuvant for other proteins [28]. None of these studies assessed responses to vaccine delivered by vaginal rings that may offer additional advantage through direct local-ised delivery over topical administration of an aqueous formulation. Both our data and previous observations in humans suggest that the inclusion of a mucosal adjuvant is likely necessary to establish effectiveand long-lasting mucosal immune responses. However, the downsides of using an in flammatory mediator in genital mucosal tissue are clear -the recruitment and activation of CD4 T cells has the potential to in- crease mucosal targets for HIV-1. Also, in flammation may compromise the integrity of the mucosal barrier increasing risk of infection notonly by HIV but also other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), al- though an increase in mucosal expression of interferons by adjuvants may protect against pathogen infection [29,30] . Nevertheless, this po- tential in flammation is likely to be short-lived. In this respect, the fact that no localised signs of in flammation were visually apparent at the end of the study is encouraging. A major advantage of the ring deviceis that a topical antiretroviral, such as the lead candidate microbicide dapivirine, can readily be co-delivered to the precise site of any local in- flammation, protecting the mucosae during the vaccination window. In addition, the adjuvant quantity or adjuvant combinations can be tai-lored to maximise the immune response while preventing unnecessary bystander in flammation [2,31,32] . In summary, the ability to generate these vaccine-reactive B cells with local cervicovaginal adjuvanted vaccine administration using a ring release delivery system is a signi cant and important observation, with potential application to the future delivery modalities for any vac-cine against pathogens that enter through genitourinary mucosae. 4. Conclusions In this present study we have explored an intravaginal ring device for administration of a vaccine antigen at a cervicovaginal mucosal sur- face. We demonstrated that in the presence of a potent adjuvant a local mucosal antibody response can be generated with high levels of vaccine antigen-speci c antibody and also that a population of vaccine antigen- reactive cells are established within the local draining lymph nodes,ready to respond to any re-infection with the same or similar pathogen. In this study, we used HIV Env gp140 as a model antigen but our nd- ings are likely to be applicable to any mucosal vaccine candidate and rel-evant to a number of sexually transmitted diseases. 5.

All procedures were performed under iso flurane an- aesthesia when appropriate, and all efforts were made to minimize suf-fering. There was a detailed protocol in place, as per requirement of the humane endpoints described in the animal licence, for early euthanasia in the event of onset of illness or signi cant deterioration in condition. For sheep the humane endpoints included; loss of appetite suf cient to lead to weight loss - the animals were monitored for weight weekly, loss of movement, sedentary state, calls of distress indicating pain or dis- comfort, bruising at site of blood withdrawal, excessive or uncontrolled bleeding from site of blood withdrawal, incontinence, breathing dif culty, infection or necrosis at site of sampling (leg vein and vaginal). The pres-ence of one of these indicators led to an assessment by a veterinary sur- geon and further welfare of the animals was directed by them. In thecase of an emergency if an animal became seriously ill or injured at any point when they were on the designated premises then the animal would be rst stunned by captive bolt and then killed by exsanguina- tion before the animal regained consciousness (a non-schedule 1method). If it were possible to handle the animal without causing it further stress and/or injury to it or staff then a schedule 1 method would be used. The captive bolt would be administered by a personlicensed to use a captive bolt. One animal became ill and stopped eat- ing during the experiment, the animal was monitored by the onsite vet, but started losing weight and exhibited a deteriorating condi- tion. It was determined that the licence endpoint was likely to be reached and so to prevent this occurrence and any potential suffer- ing by the animal, it was culled by the schedule 1 method of overdose of anaesthetic. Death was con rmed by cessation of blood flow. All other animals enjoyed excellent health for the duration of the exper-iment. At the end of the experiment all animals were culled using a schedule 1 method and death con rmed before necropsy. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. 5.2. Recombinant proteins and R848 HIV gp140, a trimeric gp140 clade C envelope (gp120 plus the exter- nal domain (ED) of gp41) and designated CN54gp140, was produced as a recombinant product in CHO cells and the protein manufactured to GMP speci cation by Polymun Scienti c (Vienna, Austria). The identity of the product was con rmed by mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic fragments by the Medical Biomics Centre at St. George's, University of London. The trimeric product was stable, and has been extensively test-ed to validate stability even when kept at room temperature (D. Katinger - personal communication) and has previously been reported to be immunogenic. Water soluble resiquimond (R848), a low molecu- lar weight imidazoquinoline compound was obtained from Axxora (NY, USA). MED-6382 silicone 6cps), were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. 5.3. Preparation of rings Human sized silicone elastomer vaginal rings, containing three cav- ities spaced equidistantly around the ring, were prepared by elevated temperature reaction injection moulding ( T= 80 \u00b0C, 2 min) 2.5% w/w TPOS using an overhead stirrer. 30 g of this mixture was mixed with 0.5% w/w of stannous-2-ethylhexanoate (catalyst) using a DAC 150 FVZ-KSpeedmixer (3000 rpm, 30 s) and injected into the moulds, mounted on a custom, laboratory scale, electrically-heated injection moulding machine. The dimensions of the ring were: outer diameter: 5.8 cm, inner diameter: 4.3 cm and cross-sectional diameter: 0.76 cm. 5.4. Preparation of rod-inserts Resiqimod (27.7 mg), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (799.8 mg), gp140 solution (2700 L), and sterile water (473 L) were added se- quentially to a 10 mL Speedmixer container and mixed (60 s, 3000 rpm). The gel mixture was hydrated overnight at 2 -8 \u00b0C, followed by further mixing. The gel was injected into pre-cut sections of medical- grade PVC tubing (Nalgene\u00ae metric, 7.0 mm length, 2.0 mm internal di- ameter, 4.0 mm outer diameter) using a 1 mL disposable plastic syringe tted with a modi ed micropipette tip. Gel- lled tubes were placed on a stainless steel tray and freeze-dried (AdVantage freeze drier, VirTis,USA). The freeze drying involved ramping to 60 \u00b0C and holding for 2 h, followed by primary drying at 30 \u00b0C for 15 h and n ally ramping t o+2 0\u00b0 Co v e r6 0m i na n dh o l d o r1 0h [15]. After freeze-drying, the80 P.F. McKay et al. Journal of Controlled Release 249 (2017) 74 -83rods ( Fig. 9 c) were removed from the tubes and weighed. A single rod was inserted into each ring cavity ( Fig. 9 d). The rings were packaged in pre-labeled semi-permeable paper-plastic ring pouches and heat- sealed using a PacSeal\u00ae impulse heat sealer. Each ring device carried a total of gp140 (500 g) and R848 (500 g). Similar rods not containing resiqimod were also prepared by omitting its addition duringpreparation. 5.5. Release of CN54gp140 protein from s ilicone elastomer encapsulated rod Individual silicone elastomer rods containing CN54gp140 protein or CN54gp140 protein plus R848 were individually placed into 15 mL polypropylene tubes with 2 mL PBS pH 7.2 or 2 mL simulated vaginal fluid (SVF) pH 4.2 [33]. Each rod contained 167 g CN54gp140 and 167 g R848 with n= 6 repeats for each rod formulation type and buffer, tubes were incubated in an orbital shaker at 37 \u00b0C, 100 rpm. The total 2 mL release media was removed with complete media re- placement at the sampling timepoints 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 h. CN54gp140 was quanti ed by a quantitative direct cap- ture ELISA. Brie fly, maxisorp high binding 96-well plates were coat- ed overnight with 10 g/mL sheep anti-gp120 HIV polyclonal 1% BSA,0.05% Tween-20, washed and then incubated with the sample before d e t e c t i o nw i t ht h ea n t i - g p 4 1H I Vh u m a n5 F 3a n t i b o d yf o l l o w e db y anti-human IgG HRP and nal development with 50 L/well of KPL SureBlue TMB substrate (Insight Biotechnology, UK) and stoppedafter 5 min by adding 50 L/well 1 M H 2SO4, and the absorbance read at 450 nm on a VersaMax spectrophotometer using SoftmaxProsoftware. All incubations were for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and plates washed be- tween each step. 5.6. Sheep, immunisation and sampling Female Welsh Beulah Speckled Face sheep were used in all experi- ments. All ewes had previously been used for breeding and were between 2 and 3 years of age. Sheep received an intramuscular injection of 100 g HIV CN54gp140 + 200 g R848 followed by three successive ring applica- tions, each of one week duration and separated by one month intervals to allow development of somatically hypermutated antigen-reactive B cells in the draining lymph nodes. Each IM do se was administered in a total vol- ume of 500 L. Other sheep received only the ring devices without IM priming. The ring inserts contained a total of 500 g CN54gp140 recombi- nant protein per 3 rods, with some rods also containing 500 g R848 per 3 rods. 3 rods were inserted into each ring. Rings were inserted into the va- gina using a medium sized speculum to open the vaginal canal and were placed around the cervical opening. Serum and vaginal mucosal fluids were sampled every two weeks and an alysed by CN54gp140 ELISA. Anti- gen-speci c cellular responses were determined at necropsy. The studies utilizing the model antigen HIV Env CN54gp140 used ve animals per group. Blood drawn from the leg vein was allowed to clot at room temper- ature for 30 min then centrifuged at 500 \u00d7g for 10 min and the serum removed and stored in aliquots at 80 \u00b0C. Vaginal sampling was per- formed by rst inserting a medium-long sized speculum into the vagina to allow access to the vaginal wall and 2\u00d7 Weck-Cel\u00ae (Beaver-Visitec International, USA) cellulose sponge spears, pre-wet with 30 L anti- body extraction buffer (2\u00d7 PBS + Protease Inhibitor cocktail) were Fig. 9.

McKay et al. / Journal of Controlled Release 249 (2017) 74 -83placed into the vagina and the speculum removed. The sponges were allowed to absorb fluid within the vagina for 5 min before removal by hand and the tips cut off while being placed into the top chamber of aSpin-X column. A further 300 L of antibody extraction buffer was added into the top chamber of the Spin-X column with the two Weck-Cel\u00ae cellulose spears and allowed to incubate at RT for 10 min. The Spin-X\u00ae column was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min to removelarge debris and isolate the fluid containing the high salt eluted antibody which was then frozen at 80 \u00b0C. 5.7. Antigen-speci c antibody semi-quantitative ELISA Serum and mucosal antigen-speci c binding antibodies against HIV CN54gp140 recombinant protein were measured using a standardized ELISA. Maxisorp\u00ae high binding 96-well plates were coated with 50 L recombinant proteins at 5 g/mL in PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The standard IgG or IgA immunoglobulins were coated onto the Maxisorp\u00ae plates overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Coated plates were washed three times in PBS-T be- fore blocking with 200 L PBS-T containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at \u00b0C. further washing, sera diluted 1/100, samples diluted 1/10, 1/50 and 1/250 were added to the antigen coated wells at 50 L/well and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Plates were washed four times before the addition of 100 L of a 1/500 dilution of rabbit anti-sheep IgG-HRP or a 1/1100 dilution of rabbit anti-sheep IgA secondary antibody and incubated for 1 h at37 \u00b0C. The plates were washed four times and developed with 50 L/ well of KPL SureBlue TMB substrate (Insight Biotechnology, UK). TheIgA isotype, required a secondary antibody incubation step using goat anti-rabbit Ig biotin and a subsequent streptavidin-HRP (R&D systems) ampli cation step prior to TMB development. The reaction was stopped after 5 min by adding 50 L/well 1 M H 2SO4, and the absorbance read at 450 nm on a VersaMax spectrophotometer using SoftmaxPro software. 5.8. Flow cytometry Cells were harvested from the animals at necropsy. External and in- ternal iliac lymph nodes, the spleen and peripheral blood were harvest- ed and lymphocytes isolated. Single cell suspensions of lymphocytes derived from each of these tissues were incubated with an aqua viabilitydye, washed 1\u00d7 with 10 volumes FBS with 1g/mL Alexa 647-conjugated protein or the con- trol 1 g/mL Alexa 647-conjugated TT protein for 30 min at room tem- perature, washed 2\u00d7 with 10 volumes PBS/0.5% FBS and then resuspended to a single cell suspension in 250 L PBS before xation with paraformaldehyde, nal concentration of 1.5%. Dead cells were gated out using the live/dead cell aqua dye and the Alexa-647 positive staining assessed on live cells. 5.9. Statistical analysis The mean serum, mucosal antibody and antigen-speci cflow bind- ing data were compared using two-tailed Mann Whitney non-paramet- ric tests or an unpaired t-test with Welch's correction if the data variance was not equal.
