Having revie wed the documents, the relevant law, and the file as a whole, the Court now enter s the following opinion and order s GRANTI NG Thaler 's motion, and DENYI NG Panetti's petition. Background Panetti asks the Court to vacate his 1995 Texas state court conviction for capital murder, and his subsequent death sentenc e, on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision in Indiana v. Edwards , in which the Court held that \"the Constit ution permits States to insist upon representa tion by counsel for those c ompetent enoug h to sta nd trial under Dusky [v. United States , 362 U.S. 402 (1960)] but who still suffe r from sever e mental illness to the point wher e they are not competent to conduct trial proce eding s by themselves.\" 554 U .S. 164, 178 (2008). Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 1 of 148There can be no question Panetti suffe red from mental illness, to varying degrees, throug hout much of his life. It is likewise beyond dispute that Panetti's mental condition affected his ability to represent himself at trial. Nor was Panetti's trial performanc e impressive, though the Court thinks he might be overstating the case somewhat by descr ibing it as \"abysmal. \" Pet. [#17] at 74. Ultimately , howeve r, the Court finds it lacks authority to grant habeas relief , because retroa ctive application of the Edwards rule to Panetti's case is barred by the Supreme Court's decision in Teague v. Lane , 489 U.S. 288, 311-16 (1989). According ly, the Court must deny Panetti's petition. In the alterna tive, a revie w of the record persua des the Court tha t Pane tti, thoug h unskilled and ineffe ctive, was not incompetent, by reason of sever e mental illness, to conduct trial proce eding s by himself. Consequently , the Court finds Edwards does not rende r Panetti's trial unconstitutional, and conclude s Thaler is entitled to judgme nt as a matter of law. According ly, the Court grants Thaler 's motion for summary judgme nt. I. Prior P roceedings A jury found Panetti g uilty of ca pital murder on Septembe r 21, 1995, in the 216th J udicial District Court, Kerr County , Texas, for the September 8, 1992 double murder of his parents-in-law, Joe and Amanda Alvara do. The following day, in accordance with the jury's unanimous answe rs1 to the specia l issues submitt ed to them, the trial judge sentenc ed Panetti to death. On December 3, 1997, the Texas Court of Criminal Appea ls affirmed Panetti's conviction and sentenc e, and the United States Supreme Court subseque ntly denied Pane tti's petition for writ of ce rtiorar i. Having exhausted soug ht post-conviction habea s relief . On May 20, 1998, the Texas Court of Criminal Appea ls denied Panett i's state application for writ of Panetti admitted he shot the Alvarados, but asserted the defense of insanity.1 -2-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 2 of 148habea s corpus without written order . On Marc h 9, 2001, this Court denied Panetti's federal habea s petition. The Fifth Circuit affirmed this Court's judgme nt, and the United States Supreme Court again denied Pane tti's petition for writ of ce rtiorar i. Upon the exhaustion of his dire ct and collater al attacks, Panetti's execution was schedule d for Februar y 5, 2004. Panetti subsequently filed a federal habea s petition, arguing he was not competent to be ex ecute d. Following an evidentiary hearing, this Court denied Panetti's petition, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgme nt. Finding the Fifth Circuit's competenc y standard inconsistent with the protec tions of the Eighth Amendment, howeve r, the Supreme Court reversed, rema nding Panetti's case to this Court for further proce eding s. According ly, on Februar y 6, 2008, the Court held another evidentiar y hear ing on Pane tti's competency to be executed, a nd on Marc h 26, 2008, ag ain conc luded he wa s competent to be e xecute d. Panetti appea led, but befor e the Fifth Circuit could addre ss his competenc y-to-be- executed claims, he filed a mot ion to stay and abate the proce eding s so he could return to Texas state court to raise a claim under Indiana v. Edwards . On December 17, 2008, the Fifth Circuit granted Panetti's motion. On October 21, 2009, the Texas Court of Criminal Appea ls dismiss ed Panetti's2 succe ssive state habea s application because his claim \"fail[ed] to meet the dictates of Article 11.071, \u00a75.\" Ex parte Panetti , No. WR-37,145-02, 2009 WL 3368707 at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 21, 2009). Although the record is unclear, the Court presumes Panetti's competency-to-be-executed case remains stayed2 in the Fifth Circuit, pending the resolution of this case. -3-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 3 of 148II. This Case The following day, on October 22, 2009, Panetti filed his federal habea s petition in this case. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)( 3), Panetti soug ht, and received, permission from the Fifth Circuit to file a succe ssive petition f or writ of habea s corpus. Panetti f iled an amende d habea s petition on Marc h 26, 2010, but the Court found many of the attache d exhibi ts illegible; conseque ntly, the Court order ed Panetti to file a second amende d petition with legible e xhibits, which Panetti did on April 15, 2010. On April 27, 2010, Thaler filed his motion for summary judgme nt. The Court g rante d two unopposed motions filed by Panetti, giving him until June 24, 2010, to respond to Thaler 's motion. Howeve r, on June 17, 2010, Panetti filed a motion to stay this case so he could once again return to the Texas Court of Criminal Appea ls and seek reconsideration of its dismiss al of his habea s application in light of a subsequently decide d case from that court. On July 1, 2010, the Court grante d Panetti's motion, and stayed further proce edings in this case, pending the outcome of the state court proce eding s. On December 15, 2010, the Court of Criminal Appea ls dismiss ed Panetti's succe ssive application, again concluding his claims \"fail[ed] to meet the dictates of Article 11.071, \u00a7 5.\" Ex parte Panetti , 326 S.W.3d 615, 615 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). On June 20, 2011, the United States Supreme Court denied Panetti's petition for writ of certiorari. On June 28, 2011, Panetti soug ht, and was g rante d, a stay of proc eeding s in this case for thirty additional day s. On August 19, 2011, Panetti filed a response to Thale r's motion to summary judgme nt, which he supplemented on September 22, 2011. On September 30, 2011, the Court order ed Thaler to file within fifteen da ys his reply , if any , to Panetti's motion. Thaler did so on October 6, 2011. -4-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 4 of 148Analysis The Court begins its analy sis with an ex amination of Edwards , and it s potential relevance to this case. The Court then considers, and rejects, Thaler 's argument that Panetti's federal habea s petition is proce durally barred. Finally , the Court turns to the merits of Panetti's petition, and finds he is not entitle d to relief , because the Edwards rule does not retroa ctively apply to his collater al attack; and, alterna tively , because Panetti was not incompetent to represent himself under Edwards . I. Indian a v. Edwards At the outset, the Court rejects Thaler 's argument that the Supreme Court's decision in Edwards is, by definition, inapplicable to Pane tti's case. Of course , the Court agrees the issue in Edwards is not the same as that raised by Panetti in this case. Indeed, the claims are polar opposites, factually : wher eas Panetti was allowed to represent himself at trial and now arg ues he should not have been, Ahmad Edwar ds twice requested that he be allowed to represent himself at trial, and was twice denied. Edwards , 554 U.S. at 167-69. According ly, the Supreme Court characterized the issue befor e it as whether , when a state court finds a criminal defenda nt \"mentally competent to stand trial if repr esente d by counsel but not mentally competent to conduc t that trial himself,\" \"the Constit ution pr ohibits a State from insisting that the defendant proce ed to trial with counsel, the State there by deny ing the defendant the right to represent himself.\" Id. at 167. The Court conclude d the Constitution does not prohibit a State from so insisti ng, under suc h circ umstances. Id. Here, of course , the question is whether the trial judge erred by not insisti ng that Panetti proce ed to trial with counsel. As Thaler correctly points out, the question of what the Constit ution permits a State to do is not the same as the question of what the Constit ution requires a State to do, -5-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 5 of 148and the answe r to the former is not necessarily germa ne to the latter. Howeve r, the Court disag rees that Edwards is there fore irrele vant to Panetti's claims, as Thaler suggests. For instance, if the trial judge allowed Panetti to represent himself only because he believed he was not constitutionally permitted to insist on appointed counsel\u2014a n erroneous belief, as Edward s later revealed\u2014then Panetti's trial might have been constitutionally defic ient, even though Edwards speaks of \"may \" and not \"must.\" Howeve r, this hypothetical also assumes Panetti is a \"gray-area defendant,\" as Edwards refers to one who is competent to stand trial under the standard articula ted in Dusky v. United States , but who never theless \"lacks the mental capacity to conduct his trial defense unless represente d.\" Id. at 173-74. Edwards gives little expli cit guidance about whether Panetti ( or any defendant) falls into this categ ory, though, be cause the Supreme Court declined t o articula te a specific competenc y-to- represent-one self standard, deferring instead to case-spec ific trial judge s: \"[T]he trial judge . . . will often prove best able to make more fine-tune d mental capacity decisions, tailored to the individualiz ed cir cumstance s of a pa rticular de fenda nt.\" Id. at 177. This approa ch, though it sensibly gives trial judge s room to exercise their judgme nt and discretion, also puts them in an awkwa rd position. Under Edwards , judge s are called upon to predic t, in advanc e of trial, whether a given defendant will be of suffici ently sound mind, during trial, to conduct his defense unassist ed; and, presumably , to revie w this predic lly as the trial proce eds. Such predic tion, difficult under any circumstances, is only made more so by the absenc e of a clear standar d. Nor is the revie w proce ss straig htforwa rd in all cases, as a pro se defendant's defic ient trial performanc e may be cause d by mental illness, simple inexperience , fear of public speaking, or a -6-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 6 of 148combination of these or many other factors. As this Court reads Edwards , States are permitted t o restric t a criminal defendant's const itutional right of self-repr esenta tion only when that defendant is incapa ble of conducting his or her trial defense because of a lack of mental capacity ; other forms of incapa city, though they may in fact be equally devasta ting to the presentation of an effective defense, are left to the defendant to weig h against the perceived benefits of self-r epresentation. Edwards thus require s trial judge s, unassisted by any definite standard, t o play both fortune- teller and psy chiatrist in making their dete rminations about a cr iminal defenda nt's constitutional rights. Regardle ss of these practical difficulties, however, the Court conclude s that Edwards is potentially applicable to Panetti's case. According ly, the Court proce eds to the parties' other arguments. II. Procedural Defau lt Thaler argues Panetti's claims are proce durally defaulted because the Texas Court of Criminal Appea ls based its dismiss al of Panetti's state application on an independe nt and adequa te state g round, name ly Texas's abuse- of-the- writ doctrine. T he Court disag rees. A. Legal Stand ard \"In the habea s context, the application of the independe nt and adequa te state ground doctrine is grounded in conce rns of comi ty and federalism.\" Coleman v. Thompson , 501 U.S. 722, 730 (1991). \"A federal habea s claim is proce durally defaulted when the state court has based its rejection of the claim on a state proce dural rule that provides an adequa te basis for relief , independe nt of the merits of the claim.\" Hughes v. Quarterman , 530 F.3d 336, 341 (5th Cir. 2008). The Fifth Circuit has recognized Texas Code of Criminal Procedur e Article 11.071, \u00a7 5, as a valid basis for proce dural default under the independe nt and adequa te state ground doctrine. See id. at 342 (\"[S] ince 1994, the -7-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 7 of 148Texas abuse of the writ doctrine has bee n consistently applied as a proce dural ba r, and . . . it is an independe nt and ade quate state ground for the purpose of imposing a pr ocedur al bar .\"). Howeve r, considera tion of the independ ent and adequate state ground doctrine is complicated somewhat wher e, as here, the reason for the State court's rejection is not clear. \"[W]hen . . . a state court decision fairly appea rs to rest p rimarily on federal law, or to be int erwoven with the federa l law, and when the adequa cy and independe nce of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion, we will acc ept as the m ost reasonable ex planation t hat the state court decide d the case the way it did because it believed that federal law require d it to do so.\" Michigan v. Long , 463 U.S. 1032, 1040-41 (1983). Howeve r, this presumption \"applies only when it fairly appea rs that a state court judgme nt rested primarily on fede ral law or wa s interwove n with federal law, that is, in those cases wher e a federal court has good reason to question whether there is an independe nt and adequa te state g round for the dec ision.\" Coleman , 501 U.S. at 739. Dismissal of a succe ssive state habea s application under Texas Code of Criminal Procedur e Article 11.071, \u00a7 5 can be based on either State proce dural grounds, or federal constitutional grounds. Section 5(a ) states: If a subsequent applica tion for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing an initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant relief based on the subsequent application unless the application contains sufficie nt specific facts establishing tha t: (1) the current claims and issues have not been and could not have been prese nted previously in a timely initial application or in a previously considere d application filed under this article or Article 11.07 because the factual or legal basis for the claim was una vailable on the da te the applica nt filed the pre vious application; (2) by a prepond erance of the evidenc e, but for a violation of the United States Constit ution no rational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; or -8-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 8 of 148(3) by clear and convincing evidenc e, but for a violation of the United States Constit ution no rational juror would have answe red in the state's favor one or more of the specia l issues that were submitt ed to the jury in the applicant' s trial under Article 37.071, 37.0711, or 5(a ). In Ex parte Campbell , the Texas Court of Criminal Appea ls stated that, \"to satisfy Art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a), 1) the factual or legal basis for an applicant' s current claims must have been unavailable as to all of his previous applications; and 2) the specific facts alleg ed, if established, would constitute a constitutional violation that would likely require relief from either the conviction or sentenc e.\" 226 S.W.3d 418, 421 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). The Fifth Circuit has characterized the first Campbell element as a state law question, and the second as a question of federal constitutional law. See Balentine v. Thaler , 626 F.3d 842, 853 (5th Cir. 2010) (\"The first element of the Campbell analy sis is a state -law que stion, but Rivera categorizes the second element as a question of federal constitutional law.\") (interna l quotations omitted) (citing Rivera v. Quarterman , 505 F.3d 349, 359 (5th Cir. 2007)). Given the ambig uity inhere nt in \u00a7 5, what is a federal court to do in cases such as this, wher e the state c ourt judgme nt is silent on whether the applica tion was dismissed on state or fe deral law grounds? The Fifth Circuit has considere d the issue on at least two occasions, and has provided this Court with much-appre ciated g uidance on how to proce ed. In Ruiz v. Quarterman , the Fifth Circuit stated the Michigan v. Long presumption \"gives to state courts control over the federal revie w of their opinions. It has become a rote rule at the fingertips of every writing member of state courts of last resor t\u2014where studied ambig uity or clarity in the decisional footing is an art form and an absenc e of clarity in an opinion is seldom inadver tent.\" -9-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 9 of 148504 F.3d 523, 527 (5th Cir. 2007). Faced with an ambig uous judgme nt from the Court of Criminal Appea ls, the Ruiz court broade ned the scope of its inquiry , noting: \"both the concur ring and dissenting opinions, by their unanswe red language, strong ly suggest that the CCA debate d and reached the fede ral mer its question, not t he indepe ndent state law ground.\" Id. at 528. In , the Fifth Circuit expli citly addre ssed the issue of how a federal court should proce ed, in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Coleman , supra page 7, when the Court of Criminal Appea ls' judgme nt is sil ent on its precise grounds for dismissal under A rticle 11.071, \u00a7 5: \"Ther e must be more tha n silence. In some form, the state court ha s to make a f air indica tion that the merits of the claims were reached.\" 626 F.3d at 854. A \"fair indication\" exists where one or more state court judge s addre ss the merits of a prisoner' s claim, or wher e a merits revie w can be inferr ed from the parties' arguments at the state c ourt. Id. B. Appli cation Here, the opinion of the Texas Court of Criminal Appea ls gives a fair indication that the state judge s considere d, and rejected, the merits of Panetti's federal constitutional claim. First, Panetti's original state habea s application was disposed of by the Texas Court of Criminal Appea ls in 1998, and the United States Supreme Court announce d the new constitutional rule in Edwards in 2008: it is there fore difficult to imag ine P anetti's successive applications were dismissed for his failure to raise a n Edwards claim ten y ears befor e that ca se wa s decide d. More telling, howeve r, is the dissenting opinion of Judges Holcomb and Johnson in the Court of Criminal Appea ls' dismiss al of Pane tti's second succe ssive habea s application. The dissenting opinion discusses the merits of Panetti's challeng e at some length\u2014indeed, at far greater length than the majority 's summary dismissal\u2014and ultimately conclude s: \"The trial record in this case -10-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 10 of 148establishes conclusively that Panetti is sever ely mentally ill and has been so for a very long time. The Eighth Amendment was thus violated when the trial court permitted Panetti to represent himself.\" Ex parte Pane tti, 326 S.W .3d 615, 620 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (Holcomb, J., di ssenting) . It strains credulity to suggest that Judges Holcomb and Johnson devoted so much attention to the merits of Panetti's claim, but the majority based its dismiss al solely on state proce dural grounds that are, to this Court's thinking, highly dubious, if not temporally impossibl e. Of course , the Court of Criminal Appea ls easily could have said it was dismiss ing Panetti's application on state proce dural grounds if it had wanted to, there by largely insulating his claim from federal revie w. Its election instead to rema in silent, though obviously a decision wholly within its authority and discretion, was, as the Fifth Circuit noted, unlikely to have been inadver tent. Thus, althoug h this Court has neither the inclination nor the authority to second- guess Texas courts on matters of Texas law, it never theless cannot defer to the Texas Court of Criminal Appe als' ambig uous resolution of Panetti's case . C. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds the state court judgme nt gives a fair indication that the Texas Court of Criminal Appea ls consi dered the merits of Panetti's federal constitutional claims. According ly, the Court rejects Thaler 's argument that Panetti's federal claim is proce durally defaulted under the independe nt and adequa te state ground doctrine, and proce eds to address its merits. III. Panetti's Edwards Claim A. Retroact ivity of th e Edwards Rule At the outset, Thaler argues Panetti is not entitled to habea s relief because the rule announce d -11-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 11 of 148in Edwards does not apply retroa ctively to Panet ti's case, under the principles announce d by the Supreme Court in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 311-16 (1989). Although the question is close, the Court ag rees. \"Teague's nonretroa ctivity principle acts as a limit ation on the power of federal courts to grant habea s corpus relief to state prisoners.\" Beard v. Banks , 542 U.S. 406, 412 (2004) (quotation and altera tions omitted). Accordingly, \"federal habea s corpus courts must apply Teague befor e considering the merits of a claim, whene ver the State raises the question.\" Id. (quotation and altera tion omit ted). \"Unde r Teague , the deter whether a constitutiona l rule of criminal proce dure applies to a case on collater al revie w involves a three -step proce ss.\" Id. at 411. First, a court must deter mine the date on which the defendant's conviction became final, and second, the court must deter mine whether the rule is actua lly \"new ,\" in light of existing constitutional precedent as of that date. Id. The parties appea r to agree that Edwards announce d a new constitutional rule of criminal proce dure, in lig ht of the pre cedent as of the da te Panetti's conviction bec ame f inal. 3 \"Finally , if the rule is new, the court must c onsider whether it falls within e ither of the two exceptions to nonretroa ctivity .\" Id. \"First, the bar [to retroa ctive application] does not apply to rules forbidding punishment of certain primary conduct or to rules prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a c lass of def endants be cause of their status or of fense .\" Id. at 416 (quotation and altera tion omitted). \"The second exception is for water shed rules of criminal proce dure implicating Any argument to the contrary would be unavailing, in any case. Edwards was decided long after Panetti's3 conviction became final, and the Supreme Court itself acknowledged the rule in Edwards was not compelled by then- existing precedent: \"Our examination of this Court's precedents convinces us that those precedents frame the question presented, but they do not answer it.\" Edwards, 554 U.S. at 169. -12-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 12 of 148the fundame ntal fairne ss and accuracy of the criminal proce eding .\" Id. at 417 (quotation omitted). Because Edwards neither forbids punishment of any primary conduct, nor prohibits any category of punishment because of a defenda nt's status or offense, the first exception is clearly inapplicable. Howeve r, whe ther the se cond exception applies is a c loser question. At first glance , the Edwards rule seems to fit square ly within the second Teague exception. Indeed, Edwards specific ally emphasized the importance of its newly announce d rule to the fairne ss of criminal proce eding s: \"[I]nsofar as a defendant's lack of capacity an improper conviction or sentenc e, self- representa tion in that ex ceptional context underc uts the m ost basic of the C onstitut ion's criminal law objectives, providing a fair t rial.\" Edwards , 554 U.S. at 176-77. In addition to the actual fairne ss of trials, the Court was simil arly conce rned that they appear fair: \"proc eeding s must not only be fair, they must appea r fair to all who observe them.\" Id. at 177 (quotation omitted). If this Court was asked to decide whether the Edwards rule fell under the second Teague exception solely on the basis of the language quoted above, its answe r would be an unequivoca l \"yes.\" Howeve r, the Supreme Court has \"repeatedly emphasized the limit ed scope of the second Teague exception, explaining that it is clearly meant to apply only to a small core of rules requiring observa nce of those proce dures that are implicit in the conce pt of order ed liberty .\" Beard , 542 U.S. at 417 (quotation and altera tion omitted). \"In providing guidance as to what might fall within this exception, we have repeatedly referred to the rule of Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L .Ed.2d 799 (1963) ( right to counsel), and only to this rule.\" Id. By contra st, the Supreme Court has held that other, less fundame ntal, rules of criminal proce dure d o not fall wit hin Teague 's second exception: that a capital defendant m ust be allowed -13-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 13 of 148to inform the sentenc er he would be ineligible for parole if the prosec ution argues future dang erousnes s, see O'De ll v. Netherland , 521 U.S. 151, 167 (1997); that it is \"constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentenc e on a deter mination made by a sentenc er who has been led to believe that the responsibility for deter mining the appropriateness of the defendant's death rests elsewhe re,\" Caldwell v. Missi ssippi , 472 U.S. 320, 328-29 (1985), a rule the Beard court broadly characterized as one that \"effectively withheld relevant information from the sentenc er,\" Beard , 542 U.S. at 419; and the rule announce d in Mills v . Maryland , 486 U.S. 367 (1988), which invalidated \"capital sentenc ing scheme s that require juries to disreg ard mitigating factors not found unanimously ,\" Beard , 542 U.S. at 408, 419-20. In concluding the Mills rule did not fall within the second Teague exception, the Beard court said the f ollowing: Howeve r laudable the Mills rule might be, it has none of the primacy and centr ality of the rule adopted in Gideon . The Mills rule a pplies fairly narrowly and works no fundame ntal shift in our understanding of the bedroc k proce dural elements essential to fundame ntal fairne ss. We there fore conclude that the Mills rule does not fall within the second Teague exception. Beard , 542 U.S. at 420. The Edwards rule thus faces a higher bar than the language of Teague , taken alone, m ight suggest. I s it on par with Gideon 's rule, announcing a univer sal rig ht to counsel for de fenda nts in felony cases? Does it work a fundame ntal shift in our understanding of the bedroc ural elements essential to fundame ntal fairne ss? Is it implicit in the concept of order ed liberty ? Even held to such a standard, and considering the guidance above, resolution of this issue is not certain. On one hand, the Edwards rule was motivated by a conce rn for the actua l and perceived fairne ss of trial proce eding s. Moreov er, it clearly represente d a depar ture from the conventional wisdom, that competenc y to stand trial was equivalent to competenc y to represent oneself. Further, -14-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 14 of 148Edwards struck a blow for individual dignity , allowing judge s to make a frank assessmen t of a criminal defendant's mental competenc e, there by potentially avoiding a \"spec tacle . . . at least as likely to prove humiliating as ennobling .\" Edwards , 554 U.S. a t 176. Finally , the Edwards rule is not entirely dissimi lar to the rule in Gideon , which guarantees counsel to criminal defendants in felony cases. Requiring judge s to allow \"gray-area\" defendants to conduct their own defenses, when such defendants are by definition incompetent to do so, is tantamount to deny ing them counsel; thus, to the extent the Edwards rule allows judge s to appoint counsel to \"gray-area\" defendants, it is cut from the same cloth as Gideon . In some ways, therefore, Edwards appea rs to satisfy the second Teague exception, by announcing a rule that: (1) significantly shifted our understanding of the proce dural e lements nec essar y to guarantee a trial that is fair; (2) respe cts a def endant' s autonomy and dignity in a meaningf ul, but realistic, way ; and (3 ) satisfies s ociety 's ex pecta tions of how our system of justice should opera te. On the other hand, it must be acknow ledged that the Edwards rule applies to a limit ed class of criminal defendants. Specifica lly, the Edwards rule applies to: (1) criminal defendants; (2) who are competent to stand trial; (3) who insist on representing themselves; and (4) who potentially fall into the \"gray area\" of Edwards . Data cited in Edwards suggests this is a very small subset of criminal defendants, likely less than 0.1% of the total. See id. at 178 (citing a study indicating approximately 0.3-0.5% of defendants elect to proceed pro se, and approximately 20% of federal pro se defendants are order ed to undergo competenc y evalua tions). Obviously , this is mere ly an estimate, and not a precise figure, but it calls into question whether the Edwards rule, no matter how fundame ntal it may be to those af fected by it, can be de emed c ompara ble to the bellwether rule of Gideon , that ever y felony criminal def endant is entitled to counsel. -15-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 15 of 148Ultimately , the Court reluc tantly conclude s the Edwards rule does not satisfy the second Teague exception, and there fore cannot be applied retroa ctively to Panetti's trial. The Court is conv inced Edwards represente d a substantial shift in criminal proce dure, and one that is likely to improve the fairne ss of trials. Howeve r, \"in the years since Teague ,\" the Supreme Court has \"rejected e very claim that a new rule sa tisfied the re quirements for water shed status.\" Whorton v. Bock ting, 549 U.S. 406, 418 (2007). As noted above, this set of non-\"w atershed\" rules include sever al affec ting when and how t he death penalty may be im posed, a subject t hat evokes some of society 's most profound feelings about the conce pts of fundame ntal fairne ss and order ed liberty . If such rules do not satisfy Teague , the C ourt cannot see how the Edwards rule, im portant t houg h it may be, does. B. Merits In the alterna tive, even if the Edwards rule is re troac tively applicable to Panetti's c ase, the Court finds Panetti is not entitled to habea s relief . To reiter ate the Court's conclusion above, the Court thinks Panetti is entitled to habea s relief under the circumstances of this case only if he can show: (1) the tr ial judge would have a ppointed counsel against Panetti's wishes if the judge had felt constitutionally permitted to do so; and (2) Panetti was incompetent to conduct trial proce eding s by himself because he lacke d the mental capacity to do so. Having carefully revie wed the trial court record and the other relevant evidenc e,4 the Court finds Panetti has met his burden with re spect to the fir st element, but has failed to do so with respec t to the second. There is no question Panetti was at least competent to stand trial. Although his first competency trial ended4 with a hung jury and a mistrial, Panetti was found competent at his second trial. -16-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 16 of 1481. Would Judge Ables Have App ointed Coun sel Against P anetti's Wishes? The Court is persua ded Judge Stephen Ables, who had the dif ficult and une nviable task of presiding over Panetti's trial, would have appointed counsel against Panetti's wishes, if he had felt constitutionally permitted to do so. The trial record contains ample evidence of Judge Ables's reluc tance to allow Panetti to proce ed pro se. First, in a June 22, 1995 hearing on a motion to withdraw, filed by Panetti's appointed attorne ys, . I want you to unde rstand that I do not want you to represent yourself. I would feel more comforta ble if you had an attorney representing you . . . .\" 15 RR 10. Shortly there after, Judge Ables require d Panetti to confe r with5 counsel befor deciding whether Panetti \"really, truly want[ed] to represent [him]self,\" and was, in fact, \"insisting on that.\" 15 RR 11. During the same hearing, the State itself convey ed its misg ivings about allowing Panetti to represent himself: \"[T]he State has a conce rn here because of the nature of the case and any time we get into this issue I think it prese nts conce rns for the Court and the State and everyone else, but from what the Defendant has stated today , the State has a conce rn.\" 15 RR 23-24. The District Attorney continued: \"[T]he State does have an interest in protec ting [Panetti]'s rights, and for that reason, . . . I would technica lly or off icially lodge an opposition to thi s motion t o withdraw.\" Id. After listening to Panetti's negative reaction to the State's opposition, Judge Ables said: \"Your const itutional right, Mr. Panetti, is that you have a constitutional right to voluntarily and intelligently waive your right to counsel and represent yourself, and I cannot take that right away Consistent with Panetti's method of citation, the Court will cite to the reporter's record in the format [volume]5 RR [page]. -17-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 of 148from you . . . .\" 15 RR 25. Judge Ables referred again to Panetti's \"constitutional right to represent himself\" later in the hearing, when he found Panetti had voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel. 15 RR 29. In a hearing on July 20, 1995, approximately one month later, Judge Ables made another reference to Panetti's constitutional right to represent himself, and assure d Panetti any standby counsel a ppointed by the cour t would not \"interf ere in tha t right.\" 16 RR 24. On Aug ust 8, 1995, in a hearing on Panetti's motion to dismiss his standby counsel, Judge Ables made a more forceful statement on the subject to Panetti: \"You've asked me to be your own attorney . Constit utionally , you can insist on that, and I can' t take that aw ay from y ou . . . .\" 18 RR 6. Later in the same hearing, the Court suspects Judge Ables may have come very close to stating expli citly that he would not allow Panetti to represent himself if he felt he had a choice : \"Mr. Panetti, all the warnings and all the instructions that I gave you at the previous hearing still hold true, that as far as you having a right to represent yourself, you can. You can insist on it. You have insisted on it and I have no choice , even though\u2014\" 18 RR 16. Unfortuna tely, Judge Ables did not finish his thought, because Panetti interrupted him with a rambling speec h, the purpose of which appea rs to have be en, at lea st in part, to praise his standby counsel. 18 RR 16-17. These statements by Judge Ables demonstrate two things with clarity. First, Judge Ables was strong ly opposed to Panetti's self-r epresentation. In addition to making an outrig ht statement to that effect, J udge Ables made repea ted attempts to convince Panetti to accept both appointed counsel, and, failing that, standby counsel. Second, Judge Ables considere d self-r epresentation to be a constitutional rig ht tha t Panetti could \"insist\" on, and one that Judge Ables himself could not take away, and indee d had \"no c hoice\" but to honor. -18-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 18 of 148By contra st, there is little in the record to suggest Judge Ables was comforta ble with Panetti's decision. Although Judge Ables did his best to inform Panetti about his options, and ultim ately found that Panetti voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel, the record, taken as a whole, gives the strong impression that Judge Ables made these finding s because he felt compelled to do so, and not beca use he w anted to do so. According ly, the Court conclude s Panetti has satisfied the first require ment for relief under the Edwards rule. 2. Was Panetti Incom petent to Condu ct His Own Trial Defense Becaus e of Mental Incapacity? As noted above, it is an undeniable fact that evidence of Panetti's mental illness pe rmea tes the trial record. Howeve r, the Court does not believe Panetti's ment al illness rende red him incompetent to repres ent himself under Edwards . The Court is aware this is a rema rkable conclusion, particula rly in light of Panetti's long history of serious mental illness. For this re ason, and to allow for meaning ful appellate revie w, the C ourt analy zes, in detail, P anetti's performa nce throug hout his trial, from voir dire to Panetti's closing statement at the punishment stag e. a. Voir Dire Qualification of t he Jury Qualifica tion of the jury in Panetti's trial took place on August 21, 1995. After Judge Ables gave the venire panel general information about jury service , he allowed jurors to come to the bench6 to claim exemptions or give re asons why they should be excused from jury service . The record indicates Panetti was actively engaged in this proce ss, and was appar ently taking As explained further below, Judge Ables examined half of the panel in the morning, and half in the afternoon.6 -19-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 19 of 148notes, as he occasionally asked the court to repeat a juror's number after hearing that juror's exemption or excuse. See, e.g., 20 RR 16, 30, 32, 41. After hearing the potential jurors' exemptions and excuses, Panetti aske d for \" a moment to sort of study these na mes,\" stating that \"ther e is [sic] a couple of them, they 're are [sic] kind of border line that I would like to think about.\" 20 RR 45. The court suggested in response that Panetti and the State should take care of the \"obvious\" cases first, and they could take up \" border line\" ca ses af ter Pane tti had a cha nce to think about them. 20 RR 45-46. Rather than going into needle ss detail about the potential jurors who were excused by agreement, the Court simply notes the record clearly shows that Panetti had been taking notes about the jurors' excuses, and appea red to have a rational understanding of those excuses. See, e.g., 20 RR 46 (Panetti agreeing to excuse one juror becaus e \"he's under contra ct to have the work [for the Department of Public Safety ] done,\" and a second because of \"adoption and leaving the state\" ). Panetti asked for time to think about ten potential jurors\u2014numbers 12, 35, 48, 73, 87, 106, 107, 135, 185, and 227 \u2014but the court ove rruled his re quest with respe ct to juror 185. 20 RR 45-58.7 8 Of the nine \"borde rline\" jury panel members examined in the morning , Panetti initially asked to retain seven for voir dire: 107, an elementa ry school teacher; 135 and 106, both Jehovah's Witnesses; 35, a nurse at State Hospital; 73, who was in Fredericksburg (the town in which Panetti shot the Alvarados) on the date of the murders; 48, who knew Panetti's first wife; and 227, a Although the record of Panetti's trial is public, the Court will nevertheless refer to jurors by number, out of7 respect for their privacy. Juror 185 was a doctor, who Panetti was apparently considering because of his \"education and his knowledge8 of afflictions overall.\" 20 RR 56. Judge Ables excused this juror because he was \"a family practitioner with a real extensive practice in town.\" Id. -20-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 20 of 148pharma cist. 20 RR 59-62. Of the two who were released, one (juror 87) was disqualified for a9 prior felony conviction, and one (juror 12) was excused at Panetti's reque st, appare ntly because of with fathe rs.\" 20 RR 61-62. Upon learning that juror 135 was seven months pregnant, and had conce rns about her health and the health of her child, Panetti agreed to release he r as we ll. 20 RR 65-66. Qualifica tion of the second half of the panel occur red in the afternoon of August 21, and the court followed the same proce dure. Again, the record shows Panetti was attentive to the proce eding s, asking for juror numbers to be r epeated. See, e .g., 20 RR 95, 106. Although Panetti expressed som e concern over relea sing jurors 230, a middle s chool t eacher; 244, a surge on; and10 357, a taxidermist, he ultimately agreed they should be released. 20 RR 107-114. Likewise, Panetti was reluc tant to retain jurors 254, a city council member; and 279, whose brother was a lawy er, but11 finally agreed they both should be retaine d for voir dire . 20 RR 109-111. It is, of course , questionable whether Panetti made wise decisions about which people to release, and which to retain. Howeve r, the re cord shows Pane tti wa s aware of both the purpose of jury qualifica tion, a nd the basic proce dures for going about it. Further, to the extent the Court c an make a deter mination from this record, Panetti appears to have made meaning ful decisions, grounded in fac t, about which pane l members to excuse, and w hich to keep. Panetti indicated he was considering keeping juror 227 because of his \"knowledge of medication.\" 20 RR 57.9 Panetti expressed concern with excusing jurors like 230, saying he was reluctant to release \"people that have10 an education.\" 20 RR 108. Panetti withdrew his objection when he learned her brother was a criminal defense attorney. 20 RR 111.11 -21-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 21 of 148Gene ral Voir Dire Gene ral voir dire took place the next day, on August 22, 1995. At the beginning of the proce eding s, Panetti informed the court he was feeling \"quite paranoid\" and \"quite sick\" that day. 21 RR 8. Judge Ables responde d: \"Oka y, just take a deep breath and we'll move pretty slow.\" Id. After the panel was seate d, the court gave its preliminary instructions and conducte d a basic voir dire. 21 RR 31-50. The State then conducted it s general voi r dire, after which the court allowed Panetti to procee d. 21 RR 51-63. Panetti's general voir dire, like much of his later trial performanc e, was unfocuse d. Although he began by questioning certain observe rs about why they were in the courtroom, he quickly segued from that topic to a discussion of his history of alcoholism, his recent sobriety , and his religious beliefs. 21 RR 63-64. He briefly hinted at his inexperience with legal proce dure (\"I was prese nted with a ragtag law book in Atascosa County .\"), tried to impre ss upon the jury the importance of the case (\"It's a matter of my life and liberty , whether I have a future, rehabilitation, any help to the future a s far as society .\"), a nd expressed his intention to testi fy. 21 RR 64. Panetti then told the panel about both his current feelings of paranoia, as well as his long history of mental illness, spe cifica lly telling them he had suffe red from schizophrenia since 1986. 21 RR 65. After a br ief and questionably relevant introduction about cow boys and cow boy pride, Panetti told the jury about a sever e electric shock he rece ived i n his youth, as a result of which he spent time in a hospi tal burn ward and became addicted, briefly , to morphine. 21 RR 65. Panetti went on to make a vague reference to having \"had some death experience s,\" id.\u2014a theme he would return to se veral times throughout his trial. Next, Panetti discussed his attempts to get proper medication for his schizophrenia, his -22-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 22 of 148lengthy pretria l incar ceration, and prison conditions generally. 21 RR 66. After telling the panel he did not have a criminal record, he said he had \"had a rough time as far as jailhouse doctors go, getting the proper medication . . . .\" Id. Panetti then recounted, at some length, his difficulty while incar cerated in getting the medication he thought was appropr iate. 21 RR 66-67. He conclude d by telling the panel: \"I 'm not going to expect to expl ain mental illnesses t o you and ex pect y ou folks to unde rstand all these medicines. I do expect a little bit of compassion as far as that I do have the affliction and it's documented well befor e I was ever in trouble.\" 21 RR 67. As will be seen, Panetti went to some leng ths during tr ial to establish this poi nt as well. After making a passing reference to the Alvara dos, who Panetti said he 67-68. Again, Panetti's comments were unfocuse d and disjoint ed, and punctuated with frequent asides, but the gist of his statements was reasonably clear: althoug h he \"needed a lawy lawyers [were] in cahoots,\" and e \"put [his standby counsel, Scott Monroe ] throug h a lot of unnece ssary garbage.\" 21 RR 68. Later, howeve r, Panetti \" started to trust Scott Monroe,\" and to take his advice . Id. The import of Panetti's next statement on the issue is unclea r, because Judge Ables interrupted him to release the panel for a lunch break, but Panetti appea rs to have been about to comment on the financ ial implications of having a lawy er: \"[S]o I . . . need a lawy er, but I'm not going to throw money at a situation that I don't have or expect my pare nts to . . . .\" 21 RR 68-69. 12 The remainder of Panetti's comment, before he is interrupted by Judge Ables, is, as best this Court can tell,12 a lead-in to one of his not-uncommon digressions, this one apparently on the subject of the wealth of hill country farmers and ranch managers. Whether Panetti would have circled back to his original point, or otherwise made this detour relevant to his self-representation, is obviously a question on which this Court can only speculate. -23-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 23 of 148The court may have had a dual purpose in breaking for lunch when it did, because, once the jury panel ha d been e xcused, Judge Ables said the f ollowing: Mr. Panetti, you said something right toward the end that I wanted to stop and finish up a little later. You told the jury panel that you do need an attorney and I'm alway s willing to appoint y ou an attorne y. I alway s have been, a lway s will appoint y ou an attorney, and I 'm not sure if I understood what you were say ing when y ou told the jury that y ou need a n attorney . Do y ou want to elabor ate on that a little bit? 21 RR 70. P anetti re plied: Well, I 'm not a n actor , but I kind of feel like\u2014like the cartoons w hen I was a kid stuck out one of those big old hooks, drug me off the stage. If you would have let me continue, I woul d have just went on to say how much I appre ciate the assistance, but I haven' t chang ed my mind, espec ially in light of what the DA said about the State alway s pursuing the death penalty . No, I was just in the proce ss, sort of making amends with Scott Monroe . . . . Scott Monroe is what's keeping this thing rolling, what's keeping me from not totally making too much of a darn fool of myself, and I was just thanking him . . . . 21 RR 70-71. The Court expli citly asked if Panetti still wanted to represent himself, to which Panetti replied, \"Oh, definitely .\" 21 RR 71. Judge Ables, scrupulously protec ting Panetti's rights (and maybe hoping he would relent), continued: \"[I]f you want court-a ppointed counsel, you absolutely , unequivoca lly will g et court-a ppointed counsel. You're entitled to tha t and I 'll appoint you court- appointed coun sel, if you don't feel like you can represent yourself or don't want to represent yourse lf.\" 21 RR 72. Panetti again confirme d he wanted to represent himself. Id. Immediately prior to recessing for lunch, the court inquired one last time whether Panetti wanted to represent himself, and Panetti said he did. 21 RR 74. After lunch, Panet ti resumed his general voir dire. He began by thanking the panel, apolog izing that they had to come back after lunch, and acknow ledging that some of them may have -24-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 24 of 148had to miss work to be there . 21 RR 75. Panetti also referred to his \"rambling on\" in the pre-lunch voir dire: \"I have a habit of doing that and it's not all mental illness. I ramble on, but I did ma ke a short list, which is probably bad, and I'll get it over with, turn you loose and I want to thank you again and we 'll start the individual voir dire, F rench word.\" 21 RR 76.13 Panetti then returne d to the matter of his self-r epresentation, emphasizing the authority of the jury to make the f inal decision in the ca se (and, perha ps, fore shadowing his insanity defe nse): [T]he reason I'm up here and not a lawy er is the same reason I'm not going to flood you with a bunch of doctors I couldn't afford, anyway, because it's going to be up to the jury, ladies and gentlemen. In that ragtag law book told [sic] me you could have five ex perts and the defense and prosec ution can both say this guy was completely flipped out and it's still up to t he jury . It's going to be y'all's de cision. 21 RR 76. Continuing, Panetti established a local connec tion (\"I dearly love the Hill Country and sevente en years in Fredericksburg , I was probably in Kerrville a couple of times a week.\"), and expresse d his displeasure at the release of doctors and teachers from the jury panel, because he \"thoug ht [they] would understand may be more about mental 21 RR 76-77. Appar ently demonstrating an appre ciation of the practical difficulties in preva iling on a defense of insanity , Panetti r eferred in passing to the distinction betwe en religious la w and secula r law (\"In my religious convictions I have this Old Testament law . . . . I didn't make the laws. In the State of Texas they say you can be acquitted by reason of insanity . . . .\"), and then attempted to refute the media's portray al of him as a \"thirty -nine-y ear-old Rambo.\" 21 RR 77. I n fac t, Panetti These opening statements to the panel well illustrate a larger trend that extends throughout Panetti's trial:13 although Panetti's presentations are typically made in an unpolished, stream-of-consciousness fashion, they are also usually appropriate, comprehensible, and apparently motivated by reasonable concerns. Here, Panetti seems to be trying to make a favorable impression with the jury panel, showing appreciation for their concerns and respect for their time, and addressing his own personal weaknesses as an advocate. This Court routinely sees trained lawyers doing the same thing with juries, though\u2014usually\u2014more directly. -25-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 25 of 148said, he was a thirty -seve n-year-old veter an with an honorable discharg e, who wore camo uflage when he bow-hunted. Id. Panetti 's next comments to the panel were more disjoint ed than usual, cover ing, in quick succe ssion: his drinking the night befor e the shootings; seeing \"the Sheriff and his cronie s in the [sic] Andy 's Diner\" ; that one member of the jury panel knew his ex-wife; and the fact that his mental illness went undiag nosed for a long time. 21 RR 78. His unfocuse d commentar y continued, with Panetti briefly touching on his confe ssion to the Texas Rang ers, mentioning in passing that he wrote a \"bucka roo poetry book,\" and reiter ating his intention to testify on his own behalf . 21 RR 77-78. In the midst of this circuitous speec h, Panetti told the panel, for the first of what would turn out to be many times throug hout his trial: \"I don't want to get into opening statement, but I can't tell you what happe ns if a jury was to ac quit me. I can' t tell y ou that. That's the la w.\" 21 RR 79. Returning to his scattershot commentar y, Panetti began by praising standby counsel Scott Monroe (\"he's been pretty much straig ht-up and I want to thank him for it\"), veered suddenly to the topics of drug and alcohol use and his unpleasa nt experience s while incar cerated (\"in a sense as far as court goes, yeah, I have suffe red some\"), and then returne d equally abruptly to the subject of his self-r epresentation: \"I just don't think that I can hire a lawy er or depend on a lawy er, that if I was sentenc ed to de ath or life, treatment, a nd I can [sic] trust a major dec ision li ke this to a nyone.\" 21 RR 79-80. In another quick shift, Panetti told the panel about his leg al setbac ks, including: his failure to have J udge Ables recuse d from the case; his lack of communication wit h his previous counsel; and the reversal of a ruling suppressing his confe ssion. 21 RR 80-81. Panetti referred to Judge Ables \"a very honorable man\" who had been \"tolera nt\" with him, but who had \"cut [him] no -26-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 26 of 148slack.\" 21 RR 81. Then, in what may have been an attempt to minimi ze the cruelty of his crime, but was almost certainly a serious tactica l error, Panetti stated: \"[F]rom what I have read, my in-laws died instantly , but no skill or no\u2014bec ause I didn't aim.\" RR 81-82. Panetti then began an extended, rambling speec h about religion which was, for the most part, irrele vant t o his case. 21 RR 82-84. Any fair r eading of this part of the record leaves li ttle doubt that Panetti was strug gling to maintain a coher ent train of thought at that time. Remarkably, howe ver, even in the midst of one of his most meande ring discourses, Panetti interjec ted two relevant points. First, he reiter ated his inexperience as an advoca te, while at the same time reaffirming his commitment to representing himself: \"I'm doing something right now I'm really not qualified to do, but I'm doing it and I'm not backing out now. It's sort of halfwa y throug h the ride.\" 21 RR 83. Second, Panetti made a surprising ly compelling statement about the importance of juror impartiality and the pr esumption of innocenc e: In the United States justice system it is important that the jurors have an open mind. They can't have their minds made up befor e they get into the courtroom. They must alway s remembe r that a per son is considered innoc ent until proven g uilty, even f or those who never expect to find themselves on the wrong side of the law. It is a comfort to know that g uilty [sic] is not assumed, but it has to be prove n. 21 RR 84. After Panetti be gan digressing from this point, Judge Ables called him a nd the District Attorney to the bench, a nd had a c onfer ence off the r ecord. When Panetti resumed speaking after the bench confe rence, he appea red to be somewhat more focuse d. He first addre ssed, at some length, the issue of his appea rance, and in particula r his limit ed , saying: -27-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 27 of 148I got thing s from my mom in the mail that say s [sic] \"Dress to ac quit.\" I t says O.J. Simps on's suits mean more than his blood samples. Menende z boys are wearing swea ters. Look innocent. . . . Well, I have never been able to afford\u2014this is a week's pay here. I get a pension check from Social Security for schizophrenia and disability . It's four seventy and I have had this outfit in a suitcase for three months and you will see nex t Monday I will be a [sic] differ ent colored shirt, but the day after it will be green [sic] shirt again . . . . I don't believe this garbage. I'm glad my mother sent it. I love m y mother. There is a lot of truth in it, but I'm going to depend on the jury, howeve r you twelve, fourtee n are to look throug h this O.J. crap. Jurors think that a dark blue is the most prova ble color, followed by gray and tan and\u2014this makes me sick.14 21 RR 85-86. After saying this, and indi cating he was \"going to wind it down,\" Panetti seeme d about t o addre ss the few members of the panel who had previously indicated they would, due to their religious beliefs, have difficulty sitting in judgme nt of another : \"Oh, the people with religious convictions that said, 'Well, I can't judge ,' my dear mother-in-la w wanted to go to Blanco to a Greek Orthodox minist er . . . .\" 21 RR 86. Howeve r, as the Court's trunca ted quotation indicates, Panetti almost immediately got sidetrac ked, and, upon returning to his original point, simply said: \"Well, by coming in a place and saying, 'I'm not going to judge ,' you have already judge d.\" 21 RR 86-87. The rema inder of Panett i's voir dire was likewise disjoint ed, with only brief and barely compre hensible references to insanity ; his near-death experience s; the racial prejudice he suffe red; his negative publicity ; his \"little suicide box\" at Gillespie County Jail; whether he was remorse ful; The Court finds this speech significant for several reasons. First, on a surface level, it suggests Panetti's14 mother believed he was mentally coherent enough to comprehend the strategy of putting on an innocent appearance through wardrobe choice, and, further, to carry out that strategy. Second, Panetti's statement demonstrates he did, in fact, absorb and retain the material. Third, regardless of whether Panetti's words represented his heartfelt feelings, or were merely an exercise in calculated artifice, they were practically overflowing with concepts that might reasonably be expected earn sympathy from a jury: Panetti's modest means, his schizophrenia and disability, his complete rejection of gimmicks and trust in the jury's good sense\u2014even love for his mother. Again, the weakness in Panetti's presentation was his delivery, not his message. -28-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 28 of 148and his appar ent intent to excuse panel members who seeme d antag onistic or unsympathetic to him. 21 RR 87-89. Judge Ables then excused the jury panel until August 28, 1995, when the court would proce ed with individual voir dire. 21 RR 89. With the exception of his closing , Panetti's general voir dire was rambl ing, but not incoher ent. As with the jury qualifica tion proce ss, Panetti's choice s about what to discuss in general voir dire, and what not to discuss, were perha ps poor ones. Howeve r, the same could be said of most pro se litigants, and, indeed, many lawy ers. As this Court reads it, Edwards does not apply to a criminal defendant who has the mental capacity to make meaning ful decisions, even if the actua l decisions that defendant makes are disastrous to his or her defense. Put another way, what Edwards protec ts against is a trial rende red unfair by a defendant's mental incompetenc e, not that defendant's inexperience or ineptitude. Extending the hol ding of Edwards to cover the latter situation would, considering the amount of legal traini ng enjoyed by most criminal defendants, be tantamount to requiring appointed counse l in all cases. All that said, however, the record indicates Panetti experience d extreme confusion, and difficulty conce ntrating , during portions of his closing voir dire statements. It is this Court's opinion that, if Panetti had display ed this same level of confusion and incoher ence throug hout any extended portion of his trial, he may well have been incompetent to represent himself. Howeve r, as discussed further below, the Court finds this was not the ca se. August 23 Pretrial Hearing On August 23, 1995, the court held a hearing, primarily to discuss which of Panetti's many reque sted subpoenas the court would issue. Notably , prior to discussing Panetti's subpoena -29-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 29 of 148applications, the court grante d Panetti's reque st for a list of the State's potential exhibi ts, as well as his reque sts for incre ased access to the law library , and copies of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedur e and Texas Rules of Evidence . 22 RR 17-24. At Panetti's reque st, the District Attorney was excused from the courtroom before the court questioned Panetti about his subpoena applications, because Panetti was conce rned the answe rs to the judge 's questions \"could incriminate [Panetti] or could be use d against [hi m].\" 22 RR 29. Because the record is voluminous, the Court w ill only briefly summarize the results of this hearing. During the morning , Judge Ables considere d many of Panetti's subpoena applications. Of these, Panetti's subpoena application wa s: quashed, for the judg e who r eversed the suppression of Panetti's confe ssion, 22 RR 32; withdrawn, for a Kerr County Jail doctor and associate d medical records, 22 RR 33; w ithdrawn, for Sheriff Kaiser , 22 RR 33; grante d, for Panetti's prior appointed counsel, 22 RR 34-35; grante d, for the Bexar County Coroner, 22 RR 36; quashed, for a person who serve d with Panetti in the Navy , and alleg edly put LSD into Panetti's beer, 22 RR 36-37; withdrawn, for a friend who would testify that Panetti was not a racist, 22 RR 37; grante d, for a doctor who conducte d a psychiatric evalua tion of Panetti, id.; grante d, for three doctors, and medical and financ ial records from Starlite Hospital (and quashed for the other employ ees of Starlite), 22 RR 38-47; withdrawn, without explanation, for Marsha ll Kuykendall, 22 RR 47; quashed, for a thera pist at Atascosa County jail, 22 RR 48-51; grante d, for a friend who could testify to Panetti's non-15 violent character, 22 RR 51; grante d, after a long, rambling explanation by Panetti, for three members of the Maenius family (and quashed as to two), 22 RR 52-56; withdrawn, for two The court later reconsidered, and granted Panetti's application as to this therapist. 22 RR 72.15 -30-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 30 of 148profe ssional acqua intances w ho could testify about Panetti's cha racter, 22 RR 56-57; gr anted, f or a veter inarian who worke d with Panetti, 22 RR 57; withdrawn, after a meande ring explanation, for an inmate who was housed for six months in Bell County , in a cell next to Panetti's, 22 RR 58-59; carried, again after a lengthy, unfocuse d explanation, for an inmate who could descr ibe Panetti's treatment while in jail, 22 RR 59-63; withdrawn, for various members of Panetti's family , 22 RR16 63-64; withdrawn, for a member of an unspecifie d \"treatment team,\" 22 RR 64; quashed, for a man Panetti used to work with, and who he descr ibed as his \"best friend\" (and withdrawn as to that man's fathe r), 22 RR 64-65; qua shed, for three friends from Panetti's youth, 22 RR 66; withdrawn, for a Navy friend of Panetti's, id.; quashed, for a bank president who could testify about a backg round check, appar ently related to Panetti's milit ary e, 22 RR 67; grante d, for a repor ter from the Fredericksburg Standard Post, and all article s written about Panetti in the previous twenty years, 22 RR 67-69; wit hdraw n, for va rious other members of the newspaper and radio media, 22 RR 70;17 quashed, for a man who worke d at a radio station and knew Panetti throug h Alcoholics Anony mous, 22 RR 71; withdrawn, for two more members of the media and one person at a law firm, 22 RR 74-75; withdrawn, for t wo friends, one of whom was the chapla in at Panetti's church, 22 RR 76; grante d, after a long, rambling explanation, for of Panetti's from Alcoholic's Anony mous, Panetti's long-winded explanation suggests he also wanted this witness at trial \"for the jury to see a man16 condemned to death\"\u2014a man, according to Panetti, who of everything wasn't,\" who \"whopped jailers,\" \"[threw] on corrections who had a \"prison record.\" 22 RR 60-61. Despite this man's much more serious record, however, Panetti said they both \"got the same treatment, . . . got the same cuffs, the same separation, the same discipline.\" 22 RR 61-62. The Court suspects, based on these comments, that Panetti may have wished to show the jury a hardened criminal, with a serious disciplinary record, and who was sentenced to death, in order to appear relatively harmless by comparison. The trial court later agreed to the issuance of a subpoena for this inmate. 22 RR 72. Panetti's explanation for why he wanted to call these witnesses was so he could \"make the relationship of how17 talk travels. Well, look at what the San Antonio Express-News wrote about me and a lot that was just totally inaccurate, but . . . a friend of my neighbor's, who described, thought he knew me, didn't know me and wrote some things that are inaccurate.\" 22 RR 73-74. -31-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 31 of 148but quashed as to tha t man's fathe r, 22 RR 76-79; quashed, for two other character witnesses who also knew about Panetti's history of mental illness, 22 RR 78-80; grante d, for the doctor who first treated Panetti for psychiatric problems, and related records, 22 RR 80; quashed, for a differ ent doctor who appar ently committed Panetti to State Hospital, 22 RR 81; granted, after extended discussion, for a jail of ficial in Fredericksburg who observe d Panetti during his incarc eration (and withdrawn or quashed as to other jailers) , 22 RR 82-85; gra nted, for two c orrections office rs (and withdrawn as to two others), 22 RR 85-86; quashed, for Panetti's ex-wife's attorney , 22 RR 87-88; quashed, f or a man Panetti thoug ht was a priest, and who he met in jail, 22 RR 89; withdrawn, for a man named \"Ronnie Ottmers,\" but who was not otherwise descr ibed, id.; grante d, for Panetti's first wife, id.; withdrawn, for four members of his first wife' s family , 22 RR 90; and grante d, after a very long discussion, for some character witnesses from Panetti's churc h (and withdrawn as to the rest), 22 RR 91-97. The court then broke for lunch, admonishing Panetti to get the rema inder of his list \"culled dow n to the bare minimum ,\" so they could finish in the afte rnoon. 22 RR 97. The Court recites the fates of Panetti's subpoena applications at length, not because the court's rulings are of particula r signific ance to the resolution of Panetti's claims in this case, but because Panetti's list of desired witnesses, and his explanations about why he felt they were necessary , are relevant to his mental capacity. The lengthy list above shows that, while Panetti cast far too wide a ne t in terms of desired witnesses, he was clearly aware that the issues of his mental illness and his character were going to be important to his trial. Indeed, Judge Ables refused to subpoena many of Panetti's reque sted witnesses (or Panetti withdrew his applications as to them) because their expected testimony was cumulative with that of witnesses the court had already agreed -32-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 32 of 148to subpoena, a nd not beca use the re quested witnesse s had nothing of re levanc e to say . Again, one could easily question Panetti's decision to reque st so many subpoenas, or his choice of potential witnesses. Further, the record shows that Panetti, in typical fashion, occasionally had difficulty articula ting why he wanted to call certain witnesses. Howeve r, the record also leave s the Court with the impression that Panetti knew wher e he was, what he was doing, and why he was doing it. In short, althoug h Panetti's mental illness may have had some negative impact on his performanc e during this hearing, the Court does not think any such impact was large enoug h to rende r him mentally incompetent.18 In the afternoon, the court resumed its considera tion of Panetti's subpoena applications. To salvag e what little brevity it may, this Court will forego an exhaustive recap of the proce eding s, and recite only matters of pa rticular note . One such matter occur red early in the afternoon, when Panetti asked the court for the criminal records of his ex-wife, his two victims, a nd sever al other members of the Alvara do family . 22 RR 99, 165. The court indicated Panetti's reque st was a matter that would have to be taken up when the State was present. Id. Later in the hearing , the court sent Panetti's criminal record request to the District Attorney , to see if he had any objections. 22 RR 131-32. The S tate ult imately agreed to Panetti's reque st. 22 RR 164-65. At the close of the hearing, after consulting with standby counsel, Panetti further reque sted the criminal records of sever al potential State witnesses. 22 RR 166. Again, the court advised Panetti the matter would have to be taken up with the District Attorney , and In reaching this conclusion, the Court is also mindful that Panetti at one point intended to subpoena Jesus,18 see Am. Pet., Ex. 9, a move that obviously calls into question Panetti's mental state at the time. However, it appears he later withdrew that subpoena, see 36 RR 1207, reducing its significance in the overall picture of Panetti's ability to conduct the basic tasks required to present his own defense. -33-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 33 of 148suggested it could be done during jury selec tion. Id. Judge Ables a nd Panetti also had an e xtended discussion about whether it was appropria te to subpoena Pane tti's children, including his eig ht-year-old daug hter Amanda Alvarado, who was prese nt when Panetti shot his mother - and fathe r-in-la w. 22 RR 138-41, 156-58. With respe ct to Amanda, Panetti said he \"[j]ust wanted the jury to see that [she wasn't] a scarred child,\" and that \"any suffe ring she did [was] by the re peate d questions by thera pists.\" 22 RR 140. After the cour t indicated it would quash the subpoe na for Amanda, Panetti added: \"T he issue is I want the jury to see tha t she's not sc arred, she loves me and that she doesn't see blood a nd guts and g ore . . . .\" 22 RR 141. The court likewise quashed Panetti's subpoena for his fourtee n-year-old son, althoug h Judge Ables indicated Panetti could reque sts after the case, if appropr iate. 22 RR 139-40, 156. Panetti a lso ha d a moment of particula r incoher ence during the afternoon, when discussing his subpoena re quest for a man named E lmer Sey bold: Elmer Seybold is in Texas. He taught me the farrier's art. He taught me how to be a blacksmith. If you called him up and said, \"Tell me about Scott Panetti,\" he wouldn't know. If you called him up and said \"John Way ne, Jr.,\" it wa s the handle he put on me, good friends with John Wayne. He was the only one that the Duke would let shoe Dollar. Although, Elmer Seybold is weird. He asked me\u2014I had\u2014whe n I went to the fa rrier's colleg e I had my wife Jani with me and I had the only woman and he kept offering me to sell me his opium bed. He has a dude ranch that half o f it is abandoned and i t's filled with\u2014what he would do is go to foreign countries that were being \u2014or like he taught the Shah of Iran shoers how to\u2014for all I know the guy's a witch, but so I don't think we need him, Your Honor, but, you know\u2014 22 RR 152. Panetti was appar ently cut off at this point by Judge Ables, who took Panetti's statements in stride: \"We won't issue on Seybold.\" Id. Despite Panetti's initial difficulty -34-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 34 of 148explaining Mr. Sey bold's rele vance , he appe ars to have recovere d quickly , stating: \" I think what I put on him [ sic] there for is that he knows that I know my trade . . . .\" Id. The afternoon was notable also Panetti mentioned \"Serg eant Iron Horse,\" lity that was appar ently somehow cause d or created by his schizophrenia. 22 RR 160. As discussed below, this alleg ed alterna te persona lity was centr al to Panetti's insanity defense. Finally , as the hearing was draw ing to a close, Panetti asked Judge Ables whether the court had excused two potential jurors: 387, a volley ball coach who was receiving treatment from a psychiatrist; and 201, who worke d at State Hospital. With respe ct to the former , Panetti said: \"[T]he reason I was reque sting him is that being a patient with a psychiatrist, he's going to know a little bit about mental illness if he suffe rs.\" 22 RR 167-68. With respe ct to the latter, Panetti appea rs to have trailed off, or been interrupted: \"You know, anybody that works at State Hospital, like the guy that's been to psychiatrist [sic], they're going to understand more about\u2014althoug h\u2014\" 22 RR 168. After establishing that juror 201 had been excused and 387 retained, the Court recessed until Monday , August 28, 1995, and the beg inning of jury selec tion. 22 RR 171, 173. As on previous occasions, Panetti's focus ebbed and flowed during the afternoon. Howeve r, as on previous occasions, Panetti was also attentive to appropr iate trial matters, including: potential impeachme nt of witnesses throug h reference to past criminal convictions; attempting to reduce , in the jury's eyes, the seriousness of his crime by minimi zing the harm it caused his daughter ; and considera tion of the sorts of people he wanted to serve on the jury. For all his lack of training , and his occa sional tendenc y to ge t sidetracke d, Panetti appea rs to have ha d rational g oals in mind. -35-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 35 of 148Individual Voir Dire Individual voir dire of the jury panel took seven days, running from August 28 to September 6, 1995. Because the record of these proce eding s is over 1,000 pages long, the Court necessarily omits t he vast majority of it, and discusses only the portions most significa nt to Panetti's claim. That said, the Court never theless begins with a relatively detailed summary of Panetti's voir dire of the first panel member, to give a sense of Panetti's manner , typical areas of inquiry , and overa ll mental ssing self-r epresentation: \"Do you find it kind of strang e that a man charged with such a crime would defend himself? \" 23 RR 15. After the panel member replied, \"A little bit,\" Panetti move d on to what the venire man had read in the newspa per about the shootings, and whe ther he knew e ither the District Attorne y or Panetti's standby counsel. 23 RR 16. After a brief discussion about the venire man's hay farming business, id., Panetti said, \"If you were selec ted as juror in this case, you must judge the facts and evidenc e prese nted in the courtroom. Could y ou do that, like just not hearsay or anything like that, just the facts,\" and the panel member said he could. 23 RR 16-17. After another short discussion about hay, Panetti asked a simil ar question, about the venire man's ability to follow the law: \"[Y]ou wouldn't have no problem, as the D.A. said, following the law as it comes to whether [sic] if you figured I was dang erous or if you figured I wasn't or if you fig ured I was g uilty or not just by the evidence and the law. You would just follow the law? \" 23 RR 17. The venire man said he w ould. Id. Then, Panetti broug room: \"Do you find it strang e that a man that is using the insanity defense can be capable enoug h to sit and talk with y ou like a normal -36-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 36 of 148human being ?\" 23 RR 18. Panetti followed up with questions about the man's feelings about mental instit utions (\"Would it terrif y you to ever end up like in an instit ution? \"), and whether he knew what would happen to Panetti if he was acquitted by reason of insanity . Id. The venire man19 answe red the latter que stion, \"No,\" and (after a short digression) P anetti went on to say: \"Oh, the conseque nces of being acquitted by reason of insanity is terrif ying. It's not an open door, I can tell you that much.\" 23 RR 19. It does not take an expert in psycholog y to detec t Panetti's not-so-subtle implication, that he would be locked up in a mental instit ution if he was acquitted by reason of insanity . Following this exchang e, Panetti discussed with the panel member his questionnaire answe rs regarding capita l punishment, threw in one more question about hay, and then moved on to the subject of drinking . 23 RR 19-21. Panetti then cover ed the venire man's knowledg e of the lawy ers in the case, his exposure to the news media, why he wanted to serve on the jury, and his feelings on criminal sentenc es and a ppeals. 23 RR 22-23. Panetti had a fairly extended discussion with the venire man about mental illness. The man indicated he did not know much about mental illness, but did have an uncle who had \"a problem,\" such that he was \"in and out of the State Hospital.\" 23 RR 23. Panetti questioned the panel member about his uncle' s specific diagnosis, as well as the venire man's feelings about it. 23 RR 24. After The full exchange is potentially revealing about Panetti's motive in asking these questions. When Panetti19 asked if it would terrify the panel member to end up in an institution, the man asked, \"Terrify me to end up in one?\" and Panetti confirmed, \"Yeah.\" 23 RR 18. The venireman answered, \"Yeah, a little bit.\" Id. Panetti: \"'One Nest' type Venireman: \"Yes.\" Id. Then, maybe significantly, Panetti: \"It is terrifying. It is terrifying to think you're going to.\" Id. Immediately thereafter, Panetti asked the panel member whether he knew the consequences of an acquittal by reason of insanity. Id. It seems likely Panetti was trying to make the connection, in the venireman's mind, between mental institutions and an acquittal based on insanity. As discussed below, this impression is strengthened by Panetti's subsequent questions. -37-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 37 of 148quickly mentioning that he, too, had been in the State Hospital, Panetti returne d to the venire man's feelings about criminal sentenc es. 23 RR 24-25. The two then discussed the panel member' s opinions regarding acquittal of criminal defendants because of \"technicalities,\" 23 RR 25-27, the value of steer, 23 RR 27, and whether the venire man had ever had \"any unpleasa nt experience with law enf orcement,\" 23 RR 28. Panetti questioned the man about whether he thought an insane person could be restore d to sanity , made a brief detour to the subject of hunting, then asked the panel member' s views on whether capital punishment wa s a dete rrent for drug addicts or the insane. 23 RR 28-29. During the course of this latter line of questioning, Panetti a sked a pointed question: \" [L]et's sa y the State proved tha t you wer e insane or a c ouple of pe ople said y ou was insane [sic], would that make y ou decide differ ent whether to find a man guilty or not guilty?\" 23 RR 29. When the man equivoca ted in his response (\"I t could have some bear ing on it, y es,\" but \" I don't think it would be clear -cut\" ), Panetti a sked: \"L et me see if I can ma ke that a little ea sier for you. The laws in the State of Texas say you can be acquitted if you're insane. If a guy was insane and you believe he was insane, would you acquit him? \" Id. The ve nireman sa id he would. Id. Moving on, the pair discussed the venire man's religious be liefs, his musica l tastes, and his family 's criminal record. 23 RR 29-31. They also briefly cover ed the man's prior jury service , his friends on the highw ay patrol, and his educ ational bac kground. 23 R R 31-32. Panetti at some length about the venire man's son's Navy service . 23 RR 32-33. Panetti asked the man wher e he lived, whet her (and how well) he knew a potential witness in the case, and his level of familiarity with Starlite Hospital. 23 RR 33-35. -38-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 38 of 148After Panetti asked about the panel member' s marital status, the two had the following weig hty exchang e: Panetti: I was going to ask you if you were going to go to a rodeo, would you go to see a good ride or to se e a cowboy fall? Venire man: I would rathe r see a good ride. Panetti: You don't wa nt to see nobody get hurt? Venire man: No. Panetti: Do y with? Venire man: Yes. Panetti: Do y ou think it's possi ble that I could g et the dea th penalty ? Venire man: I think it's possi ble, y es. Panetti: Do y ou think it's probable that I 'll get the dea th penalty ? Venire man: I don't know that without hear ing the evidenc e. 23 RR 35-36. After being prompted by Judge Ables to conclude, Panetti a sked the venire man: \"What if I got up and dec ided that I wasn't going to testify ? What would you think about that? \" 23 RR 36. The panel member said he had no problem with that, and Panetti followed up, asking both \"Do you know the reason why a man wouldn't do that,\" and \"I mean, legally, do you understand why a man wouldn't g et up and testify ?\" Id. Shortly there after, Panetti r eturne d to an earlier issue, asking , \"You don't have no problem with the fact that a man was insane or been [sic] restore d to sanity ? You think that's possible? \" 23 RR 37. The man again said he thought it was possible. Id. Panetti also returne d to the matter of his insanity defense, as it related to his decision to represent himself: \"And you don't find it contra dictory to your belief that a man can talk like a normal human being and defend himself in a court of la w if he w as insane?\" Id. -39-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 39 of 148Panetti the n asked more about the venire man's religious beliefs, befor e turning back to the question of legal technica lities: \"If a technica lity arose wher e you pretty much have to, or the State couldn't prove or if a situation came , could you put all the things aside and just follow the law as it's written and put y our consc ience aside? \" 23 RR 38. 20 The two discussed the panel member' s experience s playing football, whether he considere d himself a leader as a result of those experience s, and whe ther he would, there fore, be comfortable if chosen as foreman of the jury. 23 RR 38-39. The man's hypothetical role as foreman segued, fairly jarring ly, back into whether he would hold it against Panetti if Panetti did not testify . 23 RR 39. Panetti told the man, \"[T]he law says if I was to get up and incriminate myself, that it would ruin an appe al,\" confirme d that the man understood \"the law is tha t a man doesn' t have to testify ,\" and then asked (with some obvious difficulty ): \"Would you sort have [sic] been sympathetic wher e a man might have to bite his tongue in a situation as the law is written? In other words, instead of being able to\u2014if he's up for any future at all, that may not\u2014there' s some things that may not\u2014would that offend you if some things w eren't addre ssed? \" 23 RR 39-40. The man confirme d he would not be unduly inconvenienc ed if the trial took longer than a week, and said he had no problem with the State having the burden of proof. 23 RR 40-41. Then, he and Pane tti had the following exchang e: Panetti: Ever he ard the expression \"justice is blind\"? Venire man: Yeah. Panetti: Did y ou know if y ou're blind, y ou might not be a ble to be a jur or? Venire man: Right. Panetti: Did y ou know that? The transcript reveals the venireman interrupted Panetti twice during his question, both times to answer in20 the affirmative. 33 RR 38. The Court has omitted these interruptions from its quote, above. -40-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 40 of 148Venire man: I didn't know that. Panetti: You do now. Kind of crazy, isn't it? Do you think people kind of throw around the expression like \"I'm crazy\"? Do you think that gets thrown ar ound? Venire man: No, not rea lly. Panetti: Did y ou like to hit people when y ou play ed footba ll? Venire man: man: Mhm. Panetti: Some would say that's kind of crazy. I love the game, too. Not hurting people, but on the field. Did you have real fond memories of playing tha t game?21 23 RR 41. Finally , Panetti asked about the panel member's ex perie nces with, and feeling s regarding , domestic violence, moved quickly over the topi cs of luck, pray er, and (again) hay , and concluded by confirming the venire man had no particula r desire to serve , or not to serve, on the jury, but w as just doing his duty . 23 RR 42-45. After Panetti finished questioning the venire man, and the court had him step out of the courtroom, Judge Ables explained the proce dure for making challeng es for cause , as well as for exercising peremptory strikes. 23 RR 45-46. Neither the State nor Panetti challeng ed the man for cause , but Panetti had some difficulty deciding whether to strike him from the jury. 23 RR 46-49. In making his decision, Panetti sought c larifica tion from the cour t: Panetti: These peremptory strikes have to be used individually on each individual juror? They can' t be save d and used a t the end? The Court: Right. Panetti: It's on [si c] one-on-one thing? This exchange is remarkable for two reasons. First, it is a good illustration of Panetti's \"stream of21 consciousness\" style of speech that, while almost always present to some degree, tended to be exaggerated when he lost focus. Second, and related, it shows that, even when Panetti did lose his focus, he was nevertheless able\u2014sometimes\u2014to redirect his loose associations toward relevant subjects. -41-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 41 of 148The Court: Right. Panetti: That mea ns if I revie wed sever al jurors tomorrow and it looked like there was a [sic] influx of better than average and so I was to play poker and gamble and strike a few people today on the subjects, that maybe tomorrow I wouldn't strike nobody ; and so kind of turned out that after the cards went around the table that it would gradua lly end up by the time we picked twelve jurors that I used my\u2014I think there 's 17? The Court: Fifte en. 23 RR 48. P anetti ultimately opted to strike the venir eman f rom the jury . 23 RR 49. As noted above, with respe ct to the re mainder of voir dire, the Court mentions only topics of particula r signific ance to the issue of whether Panetti was mentally competent to represent himself. Thus, using the first venire man as a roug h baseline ( in terms of both topics cover ed, and overa ll cohere nce), the Court notes when Pane tti's perfor mance deviates substantially from it.22 Panetti broac hed the subject of insanity with the second venire man, as he had with the first. Howeve r, while questioning the second man, Panetti referred expli citly to multipl e persona lity disorder, asking whether the man had heard of it, and whether he thought it could exist. 23 RR 72-73. When the man said he \"didn't know for sure\" whether multipl e persona lity disorder could exist, Panetti asked whether expert testimony or \"pape rwork\" could persua de him that it could. 23 RR 73. Panetti also quarr eled with the man, accusing him of filling out his questionnaire \"hapha zardly ,\" 23 RR 76, and saying \"that's pretty much grounds for cause , sir,\" 23 RR 77. Shortly there after, while in the midst of questioning the venire man, Panetti addre ssed the court: \"I don't The Court acknowledges this method is inherently subjective, and obviously does not capture every nuance22 and detail of Panetti's conduct. However, given the extensive record in this case, it is simply not feasible to comprehensively document Panetti's performance at trial. Suffice it to say, the Court has reviewed the entirety of the trial record, and omits nothing that would change its conclusion about Panetti's competence to represent himself. -42-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 42 of 148know why we don't let this man leave right now , Your Honor, and save the Court a little time. He chang ed his mind on sever al [questionnaire questions] , 82 and 83 he marke d yesterda y, which is contrary to the laws of the State of Texas, and it seems like it was chalke d off as a stroke of the pen . . . .\" 23 RR 78. Later, Panetti sharply questioned the panel member about why he did not devote more time to the questionnaire. 23 RR 82. When the man admitted he would have preferred being questioned by an attorney , rathe r than by Panetti, Panetti berated the man, saying: \"Well, that's contra ry to the law, because I got the law [sic] to be asking you these uncomforta ble questions and you will be sitting up in a panel of twelve jurors, sir, and, you know, to sort of haphazar dly or to be passing time, I 'm not up here to\u2014y ou know, but \u2014I mean, y ou got to understand that what thi s is all about.\" 23 RR 84. At the end of his questioning, Panetti re turned to the subjec t, say ing: Well, the reason I'm asking you all these\u2014wha t you're going to say, \"This guy asked me a bunch of trick questions.\"\u2014is because of the way you filled out your application and the last questions, one of the major questions on the form, we should have turned you loose right in the beginning. . . . But the D.A. questioned you; you chang ed your mind, a nd you chang ed your mind ag ain, and it see ms to me like y ou just sort of want to sit in the air condi tioner and be here, but enoug h. There 's air conditioner a t the V.A. Hospital, too. 23 RR 92. Given Panetti's relentless attack, it is perha ps unsurprising that, when Panetti asked, \"Do you despise me,\" the man re plied, \"No, I 'll just be gla d when it's over. . . . This questioning.\" 23 RR 92. Also unsurprising ly, Panetti c halleng ed the man for cause . 23 RR 93. When the court denied Panetti's challeng e, Panetti used a pere mptory strike ag ainst the venire man. 23 RR 94. Panetti's questioning of the third venire man was brief, and notable only because it suggests Panetti had an appre ciation of the legal definition of insanity . 23 RR 117. Neither party challeng ed -43-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 43 of 148the man for cause , but the State exercised a pere mptory strike ag ainst him. Id. The fourth panel member, a seventy -nine year old woman, claimed an exemption based upon her age, and health problems she had experience d over the weekend. 23 RR 119-20. The court used the unexpected br eak to r esolve fur ther subpoena issues with Panetti. 23 RR 120-25. Panetti's questioning of the fifth panel member was fairly brief, and was unrema rkable . 23 RR 147-51. The State's challeng e for cause , and neither party exercised a peremptory strike ag ainst the woman. 23 RR 151-52. The sixth venire man, who said during the State's questioning that she had preconceive d notions about Panetti's guilt, and who could not swea r to set them aside in reaching her verdic t, was excused for c ause. 23 RR 156-161. The issue of Panetti's self-r epresentation was discussed at some length during the questioning of the seventh potential juror. On his questionnaire, the man indicated he did not want to be a juror in the case, \"a nd [hi s] answe r had to do with the fact that [Panetti was] representing himself.\" 23 RR 172. Perhaps the most notable part of the discussion, f or the purposes of this case, was not the venire man's comments, but the State's e xplanation of P anetti's right: \"Let me explain or say this: As you may already know, any defendant in any criminal case has the constitutional right to defend himself. . . . And that the Court c to have representa tion. . . . In fact, it would be a problem with the Court to force someone to have\u2014do you understand that? \" 23 RR 173. The State's comments, combined with the court's appar ent acceptanc e of them, simply reinfor ces the Court's conclusion that Judge Able s felt compelled to a llow Panetti to represe nt himself. Beyond a somewhat extended line of questioning about religion, 23 RR 197-200, the -44-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 44 of 148rema inder of Panetti' s examination of this panel member was unrema rkable . Panetti opted to exercise a peremptory strike, appar ently because of the man' s acquaintance with the District Attorney . 23 RR 202. Panetti's questioning of the eighth potential juror was extensive, and cover ed a varie ty of topics, but w as not otherwise exceptional. 23 RR 218-240. What wa s exceptional, howeve r, was Panetti's choice to exercise a peremptory strike against the man\u2014a choice he appar ently made after flipping a coin. 24 RR 241. Whether this was an arbitra ry decision on Panetti's part, an ostentatious theatric al display , or just a quick way to resolve a close question, the C ourt obviously cannot say ; but it is certainly noteworthy . The nint h potential juror, a recent w idow wit h an eleven-y ear old child, and who was also ten wee ks preg nant, was e xcused by agreement betwee n the par ties. 23 RR 256-57. The tenth and last panel member of the day was peremptorily struck by Panetti after a compre hensive, but unexceptional, examination. 23 RR 271-91. The parties questioned ten more potential jurors on the following day, August 29, 1995. Panetti exercised a peremptory strike against the first venire man after she indicated she would give him the death pena lty if he wa s convicted. 24 RR 320, 325. Aside from the brevity of Panetti's23 questioning\u2014upon hearing the woman's answe r, he quickly stopped questioning her and challeng ed her for ca use\u2014the e xamination was not notewor thy. The twelfth potential juror was excused by agreement, after she asked to be disqualified for The woman appears to have been confused by the questioning, and gave several inconsistent answers on this23 point. 24 RR 318-22. Ultimately, when questioned by the court, she indicated she could keep an open mind, and would base her answers to the punishment questions on the evidence presented. 24 RR 322. -45-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 45 of 148family reasons. 24 RR 326-37. Notably, Panetti reque sted, and was grante d, an additional peremptory strike, appar ently because he felt the eleve nth venire man should have been excused for cause . 24 RR 327. The thirteenth panel member became the second juror in the case, after Panetti opted not to question the man, and neither party challeng ed him for cause , or exercised a peremptory strike against him. 24 RR 339-40. The fourtee nth venire man told the court she was not sure she could be fair in Panetti's case, because her nephew had been killed in a shooting; conseque ntly, the woman asked to be excused. 24 RR 343. The parties e xcused he r by agreement. 24 RR 344. Panetti questioned the fiftee nth potential juror at length, with no rema rkable deviations from his usual topics. 24 RR 353-71. Neither party challeng ed the man for cause , nor exercised a strike, and he w as there fore selec ted as the third juror in Panetti's case . 24 RR 371-72. The sixteent h venirema n suffe red from heada ches, was hard of hearing, and had been a victim of domestic violence in the past, at the hands of her alcoholic husband. 24 RR 384-87. Panetti's examination of the woman cover ed these topics, but was otherwise unexceptional. Id. The State pere mptorily struck her from the jury . 24 RR 388. After the sevente enth pot ential j uror indicated s he could not impo se the death penalty , the State challeng ed her for c ause, a nd the cour t sustained the State's cha lleng e. 24 RR 396-98. Panetti did not question the eighteenth panel member, nor did he challeng e her for cause or peremptorily strike her. 24 RR 411-12. Thus, she became the fourth juror in Panetti's case. 24 RR 412. -46-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 46 of 148Panetti's questioning of the nineteenth venire man was both more adver sarial, and (from what the Court can glean from the transcr ipt) more agitated, than normal. 24 RR 427-40. Panetti appea red particula rly conce rned with the panel member' s prior exposure to media cover age, 24 RR 433, and whether he could acquit someone by reason of insanity , 24 RR 434-35. Panetti also questioned whether the venire man felt he should serve on a jury, given the man's history of depre ssion. 24 RR 436-37. Most of questions, and his characterizations of the venire man's answe rs, seem to ha ve been aimed at getting the man to agree he did not want to, and should not, serve on the jury . Panetti, unsurprising ly, challeng ed the ve nireman f or ca use, but the court de nied his challeng e, so Panetti exercised a pere mptory strike ag ainst the man. 24 RR 441. Panetti de clined to que stion the twentieth, and the day's final, potential juror. 24 RR 459. Neither party challeng ed him for cause, nor exercised a peremptory strike against him, and he conseque ntly beca me the fifth juror . 24 RR 459-60. August 30, 1995, day three of individual voir dire, saw the examination of nine potential jurors. Panetti did not question the first venire man, but he opted to exercise his eighth (of sixteen) peremptory strike ag ainst her. 25 RR 495-97. The State questioned the twenty -second potential juror at length, 25 RR 498-525, and Panetti indicated he had no questions for her, 25 RR 525-26. When Judge Ables asked Panetti if he wished to challeng e her for cause , Panetti gave some insight into his lack of questioning: \"No, Your Honor. The District Attorney is asking the questions wher e they're eliminating a need for me to ask a lot of them. It's not because I'm drifting away; althoug h, I'm drifting away. I'm ready to go on.\" 25 RR 526. It is unclea r what, exactly , Panetti meant by his second- to-last sentenc e, but it suggests to the -47-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 47 of 148Court that, despite some difficulties, Panetti was never theless paying attention to the proce eding s. The State pe remptorily struck this venirema n. Id. The twenty -third panel member was excused by the court, without examination, because she was unde r accusation for theft. 25 RR 527. Although Panetti's questioning of the twenty -four th venire man began with a few seeming ly unusual questions (\"Ever had any bad experience s with cowboy s?\" \"Didn't you wear an earring when I seen you in here? . . . Why ain't you got it on today?\" 25 RR 540), his examination was coher ent and r eleva nt. The State exercise d a per emptory strike ag ainst the man. 25 RR 546. Panetti ha d no questions for the next potential juror, and neither party challeng ed or struck her. 25 RR 567-68. Acc ording ly, she bec ame the sixth j uror in Panetti's ca se. 25 RR 569. Panetti made a signific ant comment at the beginning of the State's questioning of the twenty - sixth venirema n. After the man lef t the room, Panetti addre ssed the cour t, say ing: I haven' t really had time to contemplate this specific juror; althoug h, with my paper work in my right pocket, I can open it up and by what the District Attorney asks come to a decisi on; although, he was an after-lunch juror that's here early. May I reque st of the Court to confe r with my standby counsel, sir? 25 RR 571. Although the cour t allowed Panetti to so confe r, Panetti chang ed his mind, indicating he would \"g o by what's in [his] pocket a nd by what the D.A . has to ask the man.\" 25 RR 572.24 Nor was the rema inder of the questioning routine. During the State's questioning, the man admitted he was biased against Panetti. 25 RR 575. The judge asked the venire man to ste p out of The Court finds these comments significant for two reasons. First, they indicate Panetti typically prepared24 in advance for his questioning of potential jurors, an impression consistent with some of Panetti's comments during examinations of several veniremen. Second, they demonstrate that Panetti felt free to ask the court for time or assistance when he felt he needed it. This impression, too, is consistent with other parts of the trial record. -48-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 48 of 148the courtroom, after which the judge asked Panetti if he wished to challeng e the man for cause . Id. Oddly , even though the judge indicated he was prepa red to excuse the juror for cause , Panetti asked to question the man. 25 RR 575-76. Panetti's examination was brief, and was aimed mostly at learning how the Hispanic community viewed his crime. 25 RR 577-580. Panetti said he was \"just trying to get a feeling for the scuttlebutt of the community ,\" a topic he found \"very helpful for [his] defense\" of insanity . 25 RR 579. After Panetti's questioning, he challeng ed the man for cause , and the cour t granted his cha lleng e. 25 RR 581. After the twenty-seve nth venire man expressed, during the State's questioning, his serious difficulty in compre hending the term \"reasonable doubt,\" he was excused for cause , over Panetti's objection. 25 RR 586-89. The twenty -eighth venire man was likewise excused for cause , because he indicated to the State that he could not a cquit an otherwise- guilty defendant by reason of insanity . 25 RR 596-98. August 30th was not a good day for jurors, because the twenty -ninth panel member was also excused for c ause, a fter she told the State that she had \" basica lly\" already formed the opinion that Panetti was \"pr obably guilty.\" 25 RR 603, 605. Panetti's questioning of the thirtieth potential juror was extended but unrema rkable , and Panetti exercised a pe remptory ainst her. 25 RR 626-45. Another nine venireme n wer e examined on Aug ust 31, 1995. Panetti opted not to ask any questions of the first panel member, stating: \"I believe the District Attorney has asked about all the questions tha t need to be asked of this woma n, Your Honor.\" 26 RR 674. The State peremptorily struck the woma n from the jury . 26 RR 675. -49-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 49 of 148Nor did Panetti ask any questions of the thirty -second potential juror, who went uncha llenged and unstruck by both sides, and there by became the seventh juror in Panetti's trial. 26 RR 701-02. By contra st, althoug h Panetti also asked no questions of the thirty -third panel member, that venire man was excused for cause at Panetti's reque st, after the venire man indicated he thought Panetti was a liar, and already had \"a couple of strikes against him\" in the venire man's mind. 26 RR 706, 729-30. Panetti continued his trend of not questionin g potential jurors with the thirty -four th venire man, saying the \"District Attorney pretty much asked [the venireman] the questions that [Panetti] might have.\" 26 RR 752. Neither side challeng ed or struck the man, and he was thus accepted a s the eig hth juror in the ca se. 26 RR 752-53. The next potential juror was excused, without examination, on the basis of his religious beliefs. 26 RR 754-55. Panetti briefly questioned the thirty -sixth venire man, and she was excused, by agreement betwee n the par ties, for e conomic re asons. 26 RR 778-79. Both parties questioned the thirty-seve nth potential juror routinely , and the State peremptorily struck him. 26 RR 781-94. Panetti cover ed a varie ty of topics with the next panel member, but focuse d primarily on the question of whether he would follow the law on the affirmative defense of insanity . 26 RR 811-21. Panetti exercised a pe remptory strike ag ainst the man. 26 RR 821. The thirty -ninth venire man became the ninth juror in Pane tti's c ase, after Panetti opte d not to question him, and neither side c halleng ed or pe remptorily struck the man. 26 RR 824-39. -50-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 50 of 148Panetti briefly questioned the last potential juror of the day, and ultimately exercised a peremptory strike against the man. 26 RR 861-66. The court indicated Panetti had five strikes rema ining, a nd the State had nine. 26 RR 867. True to form, the parties examined ten more potential jurors on September 1, 1995. The first potential juror of the day also bec ame the te nth juror in Panetti's case , afte r the parties questioned him\u2014unremarka bly\u2014and neither challeng ed him for cause, nor peremptorily struck him . 27 RR 876-900. Panetti very briefly questioned t he forty -second panel member, who was ult imately struck by the State. 27 RR 919-20. The next potential juror was excused for cause after he indicated, during the State's questioning, that he could not consider giving a person convicted of capital murder a sentenc e of life in prison. 27 RR 930-31. The following venire man was likewise excused for cause , after he told the State he could not follow the law on the insanity defe nse. 27 RR 940-43. Panetti declined to question the forty -fifth potential juror, and exercised a peremptory strike against her. 27 RR 965. He also opted not to question the following venire man, but appar ently both parties found her acceptable, a nd she wa s thus acce pted as the e leventh juror. 27 RR 989-91. Thoug h incomplete, a passing comment in Pane tti's que stioning of the ne xt pote ntial bears mentioning. Panetti told the venire man, \"In this case I have to prove that I was insane,\" which would \"be a tough thing to do, would you not agree? . . . Tell you straig ht up why I'm -51-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 51 of 148doing it because I don't figure no one else can explain it better than one who\u2014\" 27 RR 1016-17. 25 After Panetti's questioning, and a discussion with the court about peremptory strikes, Panetti once26 again flipped a coin, and decide d to exercise a strike against the potential juror. 27 RR 1017-19. The judge also grante d Panetti another peremptory strike (for a total of 17), because he had misinformed Panetti about the number of strikes he had rema ining; thus, after striking this venire man, Panetti had pere mptory strikes rema ining. 27 RR 1020-21. Panetti questioned the for ty-eighth panel member at length, particular ly about whethe r she could acquit by reason of insanity , even if she did not know what would happen to a defendant who was so acquitted. 27 RR 1044-52. Panetti ultimately decide d to exercise a peremptory strike against her. 27 RR 1052. After she told the State that she had formed a negative opinion of Panetti, and would be unable to be impar tial, the next venireman wa s excused for c ause. 27 RR 1058-60. Panetti peremptorily struck the final potential juror of the day, the fiftieth venire man overa ll, after routine questioning. 27 RR 1080-84. At the end of the day, the State was left with eight peremptory strikes, and Pane tti with t wo. 27 RR 1085. Voir dire resumed on September 5, 1995, on which date the parties examined nine potential jurors. Panetti's questioning of the first potential juror focuse d mostly on her knowledg e of potential The Court acknowledges that the meaning of this fragment is not crystal clear; however, it appears to reflect25 Panetti's reason for wanting to represent himself. Specifically, Panetti may have felt that he, with his purported history of insanity, would be best situated to prove that he was insane at the time of the offense. This is consistent with a later remark by Panetti, that \"when it comes to something as insane as insanity, [he] did not think that anybody could do it better than [he.]\" 28 RR 1293. Panetti asked the court whether his five remaining peremptory strikes carried over, and could be used to strike26 alternate jurors, or if he lost them after choosing the twelfth juror. 27 RR 1018. After consulting the statute, the court said the latter was correct. 27 RR 1019. -52-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 52 of rly David Morquec ho. 28 RR 1106-12. Panetti challeng ed the woman for cause , on the basis of her casua l acquaintanc e with Mor quecho, but the court overr uled challeng e. second- to-last strike ag ainst her. Id. The next venire man was excused for cause , because she said her religi ous beliefs neither allowed he r to sit in judgment of a nother, nor to impose the de ath pena lty. 28 RR 1118-20. The fifty-third potential juror was likewise excused, because she suffe red from migr aine heada ches, bility to conce ntrate. 28 RR 1123-25. The trend continued with the nex t potential juror, who was ex cused for cause because she had \"some preconceive d ideas or just maybe emotions\" about the case, based on her husband' s medical tre atment of Pane tti's children. 28 RR 1130-32. After extended questioning by both parties, during which the venire man acknow ledged that some of Panetti's comments during general voi r dire might affect her decision in the case, Panetti challeng ed the next woman for cause , but the court overr uled his challeng e. 28 RR 1135-56. Howeve r, Panetti opted not to peremptorily strike the woman, and the fifty-fifth panel member became the twelf th juror in Panetti's case . 28 RR 1156-57. The court continued with voir dire proce eding s, so the parties might selec t two alterna te jurors. The first of the potential alterna tes was a cceptable to both parties a fter the ir examinations, and wa s acc ording ly selec ted as fir st alternate . 28 RR 1162-79. The second pot ential alternate juror was ex cused for cause, for persona l reasons, based on answe rs he g ave dur ing the State's questioning . 28 RR 1184-86. After very extensive que stioning, particula rly on the issue of the insanity defense, the third -53-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 53 of 148potential alterna te juror wa s excused for c ause a t Panetti's reque st. 28 RR 1187-1214. The final venire man of the day was also excused for cause at Panetti's reque st, be cause the man indicated he could not cre dit testim ony from psy chiatrists or psy cholog ists. 28 R R 1226-32. On September 6, 1995, the final day of voir dire in Panetti's case, the parties questioned two potential jurors. Panetti questioned the f irst of the two, a la w enf orcement office r, at great length, occasionally quarr eling with him, and making clear his opposition to the venire man's serving on the jury. 29 RR 1245-75. Panetti was chastised on sever al occasions by the judge for taking too long, and once by the State for making a joke about the O.J. Simps on trial. 29 RR 1263, 1269, 1270, court denied Panetti's challeng e for cause , at which point Panetti exercised his sole peremptory strike ag ainst the man. 29 RR 1275. Finally , Panetti questioned the sixth potential alterna te juror, and the sixty-first potential juror overa ll, but did not challeng e her for cause , and had no rema ining peremptory strikes. 29 RR 1289-98. Because the State did not challen ge or peremptorily strike her, she became the second alterna te juror. 29 RR 1298-99. Having concluded voir dire, the court, at Panetti's reque st, indicated it would hold a pre trial hea ring after a br ief re cess. 29 RR 1300-01.27 Panetti's conduct during individual voir dire was, for a pro se litigant, actua lly fairly impressive. As in past proce eding s, Panetti's style of speec h and manner of questioning were often28 Panetti requested the hearing to discuss outstanding subpoena issues, the court's resolution of which is27 unimportant to this case. As noted below, the court also complimented Panetti on his performance during voir dire, and Panetti raised the issue of an upcoming psychiatric appointment. 30 RR 5-12. Judge Ables himself appears to have felt likewise: \"I thought you did a good job, Mr. Panetti, and I thought28 that considering you were unfamiliar with the technical aspects of it, you picked up on it well, and I appreciate how you handled voir dire, and we have picked a jury in a reasonable amount of time, so I'm happy with the time it took and how it went.\" 30 RR 6. -54-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 54 of 148unusual, and sometimes difficult to follow. Howeve r, Panetti's questions were usually relevant, and clear enoug h for potential jurors to unde rstand them. With the possible e xception of his coin flips (which, again, may simply have been a way to resolve close calls in Panetti's mind), Panetti appea rs to have exercised his peremptory strikes with delibera tion. His challenge s for cause , while sometimes leg ally insufficient, did not appe ar irr ational. In sum, Panetti manag ed to keep his wits about him during the quest ioning of sixty-one potential jurors, over the course of seven days. The record shows he clearly knew wher e he was, what he was doing, and why he was doing it. When he opted not to question potential jurors, it appea rs he made that choice because the State's e xtensive examination left him with no questions of his own. To the extent ther e were defic iencies in Pane tti's voir dire questioning, they appea r to have been cause d by his la ck of skill and legal knowledg e, and not a ny mental incompetenc e. Not to overstate Panetti's effectivene ss, but the Court has seen many pro se litigants perform far below this level of competenc e; nor, sadly , are lawy ers uniformly better. Thus, the Court finds nothing in this recor d to indicate Panetti was me ntally incompetent to conduc t his own defense . b. Guilt-Innocence P hase The guilt-innocence phase of Panetti's trial began on September 12, 1995, and lasted until September 21, 1995. Because the Court is primarily conce rned with Panetti's performanc e, and not necessarily the merits of the case, the Court will omit most of the court and the State's comments and questions. With respe ct to Panetti, the Court will, in light of the extensive record, mostly summarize his statements and questions, except wher e verba tim quotations are particula rly relevant. On the morning of September 21, 1995, befor e the jury was broug ht into the courtroom, -55-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 55 of 148Panetti expressed, in a rambling (and appar ently frantic) monologue , that he was not prepa red to proce ed. 31 RR 13-17. I n small and hea vily edited par t, Panetti said: I'm not prepa red to prese nt my case, even, or to cross-e xamine the witnesses. . . . [I]n light of a situation of my mental illness, paranoid schizophrenia and the thought disorder a nd the manic de pression that I could say it was simply a shower, a shave, a night [sic] sleep and a decent meal woul d help me. I'm not looking for a long delay , but I'm going to definitely need a couple of days to get the medicine, to see my doctor and to prepa re me on the suicide watch [in jail], my treatment has basica lly been isolation, sepa ration and quite I could just say give me a shower, shave and a hairc ut and a decent meal and I'll be ready to go; but to get the medicine, to see my psychiatr ist, to be prepa red to cross-e xamine, to think clearly, to cross-e xamine witnesses clearly, I in no way want to turn it over to someone I feel probably no more c ompetent en neg lected c ertain rig hts that I have unde r the Constit ution. In other words, I'm expected to prepa re my case without my shot of insulin, and I consider my mental illness just as debilitating when I have be en on a pension since '86 and it s been there since before this happe ned, this ever came to trial, that I have be en kept f rom the normal pr ocedur es of c are . . . . I wish I could just say a shower and a shave and a hairc ut and a decent meal I'm ready to go, but with the doctor and the medicine and the files, the prepa ration, not being able to clearly cross-examine the witness, I don't think it would be comforta ble for the Court for me to recall all of the State's witnesses because I'm not prepa red. I could wing it on opening statement, but it just seems like it's just all strikes of just trying to run me throug h the shoot [sic] without just a simple adequa te time to prepa re simply when I prepared and bent over backw ards as far as law enfor ceme nt to make this run smoothly . 31 RR 13-17. Judge Ables indicated the case would proce ed to trial in approximately ten minutes, but that Panetti's case , if any , would probably not be pre sented for sever al day s. 31 RR 18. -56-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 56 of 148After Judge Ables had the jury sworn, and he gave them preliminary instructions, he asked if Panetti was ready for trial. 31 RR 19-23. Although Panett i replied that he was not, the court indicated the trial would never theless proce ed, at which point the State read the indictment against Panetti. 31 RR 23-24. Panetti enter ed a plea of \"not guilty by reason of insanity .\" 31 RR 24. The State gave a brief opening statement, and Panetti elected to give his opening statement immediately there after. 31 RR 24-27. Opening Stateme nt Panetti's opening statement wa s, to put it simply , not good. I n addition to being de livered in a pronounce d stream- of-consciousness manner , it also rambled betwee n topics without regard for their relevancy , and was so long that the court eventua lly cut it short. 31 RR 27-39. In brief summary , Panetti's opening statement cover ed the following topics: his appea rance (and specifically his inability to shower and s have prior t o trial), 31 RR 27; his S arge Ironhorse persona lity, 31 RR 28; mental illness, id.; voluntary intox id.; gaps in the State's chosen evidenc e, id.; his own lack of prepa ration, in part because of his incar ceration, 31 RR 28-29; the insanity defense, 31 RR 29; an alterna te theory of the hostag e situation involving his wife and daug hter, 31 RR 29-30; the suppression of his confe ssion, and the subsequent reversal of that ruling , 31 RR 30; questionable practices and statements by law enfor ceme nt and Fredericksburg residents, 31 RR 30-31; the term insanity , which Panetti sa id me ant \"just not in sound mind,\" 31 RR 31; his religious rebirth as \"the born again April fool,\" and how he \"depe nded on the Lord to do for [him] what the medicine wasn't doi ng,\" 31 RR 31-32; his earlier competency hearings, 31 RR 32; his29 As noted above, Panetti's first competency trial ended with a hung jury and a mistrial; he was found29 competent after his second trial. -57-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 57 of 148difficulties with various doctors and medicines, 31 RR 32-33; the court's denial of his reque st to postpone the trial, 31 RR 33; more about the difficulties of prepa ring for trial while incar cerated, id.; how \"total honesty ,\" and not sympathy or luck, kept him sober, 31 RR 33-34; his conver sion to30 Catholicism, 31 RR 34; the fact he was being denied his proper medication, 31 RR 35; more about his lack of pr eparation, and the f act he \"may have to call back c ertain witnesses,\" 31 RR 36; more about multipl e persona lity disorder, and that \"Sarg e Ironhorse [was] known over the last couple of years or a good year befor e [Panetti] was arrested,\" 31 RR 36; his lack of time to speak with witnesses, and his observa tion that it \"could be an advanta ge, because there 's no coaching going on,\" 31 RR 36; another less-than-luc id comment (\"Demons, demons, evil spirits. A demon affects mental stability .\"), followed immediately by what appea rs to have been an attempt to impeach the credibilit y of some of the State's witnesses, and concluding with another reference to his untrea ted schizophrenia and manic depression, 31 RR 37; the mishandling of his medication betwee n jail facilities, 31 RR 37-38; and, befor e Panetti was cut off by the court, a reference to his milit ary service and the \"major quantity of LSD\" somebody put into his beer, 31 RR 39. Panetti objected to the cour t's limit ation of his time to make an ope ning sta tement. 31 RR 38-40. State's Case-in-Chief Herbe rt W. Vorauer The State's first witness was Herbert W. Vora uer, a Fredericksburg police office r who was Panetti concluded this point with a fairly unintelligible narrative: \"You might say three years in jail, well, it's30 easy to stay sober. After the Mexican mafia put me on trial in Atascosa County, a kangaroo trial at a church meeting, there was no more church meetings after this, but mysteriously the next day the a.k.a. Roy Rogers showed me up and handed me a ragtag law book and I passed up some jailhouse intoxicants, not by luck, but by prayer and grace.\" 31 RR 34. Although this story may have some basis in fact, and seems tied to the larger theme of his religious rebirth, it is an example of one of Panetti's less lucid moments during his opening statement. -58-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 58 of 148the first re sponder to the Alvara do home, the scene of the murders. 31 RR 40-42. After the State walked through Vorauer's investiga tion of the scene , Panetti Vora uer's interpre tation of the crime scene , specific ally his conclusion about how one of the Alvarados' bedroom windows had been broken: \"With your experience , if someone was to bust throug h a door, there would be a lot more glass on the inside? \" 31 RR 51-53. Later, Panetti tried to get the witness to agree that the chaotic nature of the crime scene was a sign of a spontane ous, rather than a preme ditated, crime: \"And in your experienc e wouldn't y ou think in most\u2014if someone was to plan out a crime, they don't leave their weapons lying around, do they?\" 31 RR 54. When V oraur er avoided that question, Panetti f ollowed up: \"B ut not usually in your ex perience if someone was going to go think out and do a crime, they leave a firear m laying around? \" Id. The witness unhelpfully answe red, \"I couldn't really answe r that question. I have never planned a crime. I don't know.\" Id. The rema inder of Panetti's questions were of questi onable relevance , but (as he did many times with later witnesses) Panetti took advanta ge of his pro se status on sever al occasions by essentially testify ing during his cross-e xamination. Although there are sever al examples in Panetti's questioning of Vora uer a lone, the Court provides only a sing le example: But alls you noticed is tha t the glass and that most of the glass was on the concr ete, abandone d shotgun, when you walked in the house, my mother- and fathe r-in-la w laying there ? The \"in-law \" sticks, because they were truly my mother- and fathe r-in- law, but in a lot of ways they were my mom and dad. They treated me such. It's really difficult to addre ss a situation a nd be callous and then\u2014but also stipulate the remorse is involved in a y ear in jail. 31 RR 57. Panetti's editorializing eventua lly became so pronounce d that the State objected because -59-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 59 of 148he wa s \"making statements and a rgument, appar 31 RR Panetti's cross-e xamination of Vora uer was not particula rly effective, but that is not surprising , for at least two reasons. First, and most obvious, Panetti was not skilled a t que stioning uncooper ative witnesses, and was thus often unable to get Vora uer to agree with him. Instead, Panetti often argued with the witness, which proved to be as unpersua sive as it was ineffe ctive. Second, Vora uer simply had little to contribute to Panetti's insanity defense. Panetti tried to31 establish that his crime was spontaneous and unpreme ditated, and also that he had deep affection for his victims\u2014both of which are consistent with his defensive theory . Panetti did not get the answe rs he wanted from Vora uer, and did not know how to handle Voraue r's reca lcitranc e, but he did ask questions releva nt to his i nsanity defe nse. Sonja Alvarado The State's second witness was Sonja Alvara do, Panetti's ex-wife and the daug hter of Panetti's victims, Joe and Amanda Alvara do. 31 RR 59-60. Sonja witnessed the murders, and the State, natura lly, examined her at length. 31 RR 61-85, 88-103. Panetti's cross-e xamination, of course , put her in the distressing position of being questioned by the man who had killed her parents. Obviously recognizing this unpleasa nt fact, Pane tti began his questioning with a preamble, and an a ccusa tion that she had lied during direc t examination: Sonja, for the benef it of the jury, I'm going to have to ask you some questions, because if I was to call you in a couple of days, there would be doubt that I may not have questi oned you, so there 's some pretty much spontaneous, uncomforta ble questions I 'm going to ha ve to ask, so the jury knows the truth. As later testimony and evidence revealed, Panetti had no factual defense to the charges against him;31 accordingly, he was obligated to rely solely on his legal defense of insanity. Because some of the State's witnesses had little of relevance to say on that topic, Panetti's cross-examination of them was necessarily limited in its effectiveness. -60-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 60 of 148I know this is difficult for you, as it would me [sic], and half of the questions I was going to ask you that I thought about I didn't write down, and it doesn't make any sense; so I'm just going to do like I did in the beginning and this morning , is just no strateg y, no g uts, just honesty , and, Sonja, y ou're not being honest. 31 RR 103-04. Immediately after this accusation, Panetti began addre ssing Sonja in a persona l fashion ( \"You look lovely , and I know I don't, but\u2014\"), at which point the S tate objected. 31 RR 104. The unusual and unpleasa nt circumstances of Panetti's questioning of Sonja, combined with Panetti's fre quent editorializ ing a nd commentar y, made airly disjoint ed and obje ction-filled cross-e xamination. The Court will generally omit from its discussion the many instances in which Panetti made some inappropria te statement rathe r than asking a question, the State objected, and the court sustained the objection. Suffice it to say, there were many such instances, and Panetti seeme d to use his cross-e xamination of Sonja as much as an opportunity to communicate with her, as a way to present e vidence to the jury . When Panetti did finally question Sonja, he first broac hed the subjects of his gun owner ship, and her claim that he had previously hit her with the butt of a rifle. 31 RR 107-08. Panetti tried to downplay his imag e as a gun fanatic (\"In other words, Sonja, I didn't have a lot of guns, and I only had a bow and arrow and I just acquir ed the saddle rifle, the 30.06, not long befor e all of this? \"), and also tried t o cast doubt on Sonja's testimony , that Panetti had tried to shoot her after he killed her parents, but that the rifle had jammed: \"Well, Sonja, you said it jammed, but it was brand new.\" 31 RR 108. -61-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 61 of 148Significa ntly, Panetti explained why, even though he was insane at the time of the killings,32 he could never theless reme mber the details: \"Sonja, this is difficult, because Sarge was in possession of me a nd being I wasn't dr unk, I can r emember these thing s.\" 31 RR 108. Panetti asked Sonja a lot of questions about the beginning of their relationship, and occasionally interjec ted questi ons that appea r to have been aimed at showing Sonja's bias against Panetti (\"Did you ever make a rema rk after all this that you wanted to see me burn and do life or die, not to have me with another woman or have a life?\" ), and to impeach Sonja (\"What were you in jail for, Sonja? \") and her family (\"[Y]ou were in a family with a lot of domestic violence, a lot of trouble with the law? \" ). 31 RR Sonja's drug use: \"Did you make a habit of smoking a joint or half a joint as you took your shower to prepa re yourself for work as a waitre ss?\" 31 RR 118. Later, Panetti r eturne d to the subject of \"Sarg e Ironhorse ,\" and Sonja's familiarity with the name or persona . 31 RR 120-21. He also asked questions ( or, more accurate ly, made statements) seeming ly desig ned to pa int himself as a g ood provider f or Sonja: \"[I] didn't turn down any work, picking peaches or whateve r job came , breaking rock. I took it to give us more money .\" 31 RR 121. In what was probably a serious strateg ic error, Panetti started to walk throug h Sonja' s account of the crime, sometimes narrating what he did, and sometimes askin g Sonja questions. 31 RR 122-125. He implied he hit Sonja with the butt of the 30.06 rifle because Sonja had arme d herse lf with a knife from the kitchen: \"The only time I ever hit y ou with the butt of that 30.06 was at that This is significant for at least three reasons. First, it is another example of Panetti taking advantage of his pro32 se status to testify while questioning a witness. Second, it shows Panetti was focused on his chosen defense of insanity. Finally, Panetti's claim\u2014that he was somehow observing events, while not being in control of his actions\u2014put him in the advantageous position of being able simultaneously to disclaim responsibility for the crime, but also try to impeach witnesses. -62-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 62 of 148tragedy, and did you have a knife in your hand? \" 31 RR 124. Perhaps realizing he was undermining his own defense by indicating what he had done, Panetti \"clarified\" the matter for the jury: \"[T]here's a lot of things I reme mber, because I wasn't drunk out of my mind, but you have to reme mber this is the person. This is Sarge, so when I say 'I,' I'm saying Sarge, and not to make it confusing , and for the benef it of the jury and the truth, I'm just trying to go throug h what happene d.\" 31 RR 124. After the court sustained an objection by the State, Panetti moved to a differ ent line of questioning. 31 RR 124-25. During the lunch re cess, the Court c hastised Panetti for a rguing w ith witnesses, say ing: If you don't quit with y our dialog ues, I 'm going to ha ve to cut off the questioning. I would never allow Mr. Curry [the District Attorney ] to do that. . . . In your mind you can make a note that she disag rees with you and you can testify or have somebody else testify to tha t event, but y ou can't stop a nd give a little commentar y about her answe rs. That's inappropriate , and perha ps you need to talk to Mr. Monroe, y our standby counsel, for him to explain the technical a spects of how you do elicit testimony from a w itness . . . plied, in part: Your Honor, I will not use my untrea ted thought disorder for an excuse, but my thoughts do run a gambit and whe n I have to go far enoug h into the case as the tragedy and then go back to where we first met, it's difficult, and the reason I elabor ated or added any details is to get to the point a nd the memory , and to get the facts, and to get the truth and I will c onfer with Scott Monroe. I will be more blunt and question more pr ecise ly . . . . 31 RR 128. After lunch, Panetti resumed his questioning of Sonja Alvara do. 31 RR 129. He quickly moved into Sonja's family problems, and particula rly her fathe r's alleg ed drinking problem, and her mother's a lleged stabbing of her fathe r. 31 RR 131. He also asked whether Sonja kne w what he r mother had been arrested for, to which she replied, \"No, I didn't even know she was arrested.\" 31 -63-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 63 of 148RR 134. Panetti replied: \"I think I have a record somewher e, probably . Your mom was arrested for assault. I was just wonder ing did she assault your dad or did she assault another lady or do you reme mber any details about that? \" 31 RR 134. Panetti also referred to one of Sonja's sisters, saying she \"ha d a bunch of problems with the law.\" 31 RR 135. Panetti moved on t o other topics, but later returne d to the issue of Sonja's drug use. After deter mining Sonja was living with a particula r woman, Panetti asked: \"Did she offer you that place to stay or was it just convenient, because she had the marijuana and she was the weed deale r and that? \" 31 RR 143. Panetti then returned to the day of the murders, and what happene d at the bunkhous e after Panetti killed Sonja's parents. 31 RR 144. Panetti's versi on of events was very differ ent from Sonja's, and appar ently involved her wanting to make a getawa y with him and their daug hter, after Panetti shot her parents. Id.; 31 RR 150. He also implied that Sonja recognized him as \"Ironhorse ,\" and not as himself: \"Do y ou reme mber in the bunkhous e whether y ou looked at my hair and said, 'You'r e not y ou. You're not the same.' D o you reme mber me saying, 'Ironhorse '?\" 31 RR 145. He also flatly denied that she was his hostag e at the bunkhouse (\"Well, I never had you. I never took you hostag e.\"), and suggested they parte d on surprising ly amicable terms: \"Well, w hen we left the bunkhouse and we all hugged and you got in the Jeep and left, there was no law enfor ceme nt except way down may be ther e was a [sic] law reme mber making rema rks about when I was out of my mind, or do you reme mber hearing any stories about Jane Luchenba ch or in '86 when I was gunshot or that I was -64-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 64 of 148insane? Do you reme mber hearing any rumors about when I was out of my mind or insane or rumors about just being crazy?\" 31 RR 153-54. Sonja likewise refused to agree with Panetti, that their daug hter develope d a speec h impediment not because she witnessed the murders of her grandpa rents, but be cause of the State's extensive questioning of he r about the killing s. 31 RR 158. In another appar ent attempt to place the blame on \"Sarg e Ironhorse ,\" Panetti asked whether Sonja reme mbere d what he was we aring , and if she rec alled \"making any rema rks about [Panetti] being possessed or having a demon look or that it wa sn't [him] . . . .\" 31 RR 159. He also tried to establish the existence of his separ ate persona lity prior to the murders: \"Do you reme mber anybody ever making fun of me because of Sarge or differ ent names? \"; and \"Do you reme mber my persona lity ever chang ing drastica lly from one persona to another, from one person to another and then questioning me about it? \" Id. Panetti asked a long series of questions, including some about Sonja's marijuana use, his suspicions about her infide lity, his beha vior toward the ir daug hter, be fore he re turned to the subject of his w ork history . 31 RR 159-68. Appar ently , Panetti took umbrag e with Sonja' s characterization of him as a man who did not work: \"[D]o you ever reme mber me lazy, because that's kind of the picture you're painting of me like I didn't work.\" 31 RR 168. He then asked more questions desig ned to show Sonja's bias: \"[D]id you have a deep contempt or hatre d for me when you came to the jail to get that Jeep title? \" 31 RR 170. \"Is it pretty safe to say that espec ially after my confe ssion that you hate me pretty much? \" Id. Sonja answe red both questions \"Yes.\" Id. \"Do you think your hatre d for me might want to paint a picture to get me -65-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 65 of 148killed and not treat me\u2014\" Id. Panetti was cut off at this point by Sonja, who said: \"You know what you're doing, Scott. You a lway s have since I have know n you.\" Id. After many questions on irrele vant or repetitive topics, Panetti challeng ed Sonja's earlier characterization of him as a stalker who violated a protec tive order she had against him: \"Now, while this protec tive order was in force, you came to the bunkhouse when I was out there to visit me a few times? \" 31 RR 178. Sonja replied, \"I don't reme mber when that was.\" Id. Panetti followed up: \"Well, there 's a witness here that will reme mber, but what I'm saying is the clear cut\u2014in other words, we were both sort of sidestepping the protec tive order .\" Id. Panetti and Sonja also had differ ent recollections of a jail visit she paid him after the murders: [W]hen you came to jail to visit me that day you don't reme mber me breaking down. You don't reme mber coming back later with the Jeep title. You don't reme mber me telling\u2014wha t we spoke about, fo rgiveness and the Bible, and there 's just so many things that aren't reme mbere d that\u2014but you told me then in the jail that you kept the deer, but then now you're saying that the day after I was arrested, you went out to the bunkhouse to the Petsch Ranc h? 31 RR 181. In what the Court c an only characterize as a critical tactica l blunder, Panetti walked Sonja, in de tail, thr ough his shooting of her pare nts. 31 RR 183-190. Panetti a ppear s to ha ve done so to demonstrate that Sonja had lied about events (\"Truth, the truth will set you free. It has for me. . . . You know, just because of your hatre d, the truth is going to have to come out.\"), and to establish that it was \"Sarg e\" who was responsible: \"Do you reme the door, Sarge, berse rk, shot the door?\" 31 RR 186-87. He also tried to point out purported inconsistencies in Sonja's account, and to call into question her memor y of eve nts: -66-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 66 of 148Sonja, is it safe to say there 's a lot of stuff in the shock and the situation that you just flat don't reme mber? Numbers of bullets, guns [sic] jams, wher e Joe was, who had the knife? Where Birdie [Panetti's nickname for their daug hter Amanda] was sitting down, in my arms, picked her up, wher e you ran from the bed that I picked up Birdie , and the shock of the situation? Is it safe to say that as you point-blank told the D.A. everything that happene d and the jury, that it may not really be what happene d, that you may not remembe r fact for f act? 31 RR 188. Later, Panetti was even more blunt: \"[E]ither you don't reme mber or you're not telling the truth. I don't know if it is out of hatre d for me or you just don't reme mber and that's okay , plead the Fifth, but to get to just basic questio ns on what happene d, because I wasn't drunk, so I reme mber.\" 31 RR 189. Subsequently , Panetti returne d to questioning Sonja's recollection of the crime. 31 RR 189-193. Ag ain, Panetti tried to get Sonja t o credit his version of events, in which Panetti shot her parents, was \"restored to sanity ,\" turned and ran for the Jeep, and, t o his surprise, saw that Sonja had followed him of her own free will. 31 RR 190-91. Then, according to Panetti,33 Sonja said something like, \"Make a run for it.\" 31 RR 191. In Panetti's version, after he, Sonja, and their daug hter went to the bunkhouse, \"[w]hen the sun was coming up,\" they \"all got together,\" and Sonja told Panetti she would \"alwa ys love [him ],\" where upon they hugged and Panetti told Sonja that she and Amanda should leave . 31 RR 191-92. Unsurprising ly, Sonja refused to agree that was what had ha ppened. Id. After a brief recess, Panetti continued. 31 RR 194. Unfortuna tely, he returne d to a detailed and methodical account of Sonja's recollection of the crime. In particula r, Panetti seeme d intent on impeaching Sonja by recounting\u2014several times, and in excruciating detail\u2014how he shot her parents, and why, given her descr iption of the murders, their daug hter could not have been wher e Sonja In typical fashion, Panetti conveyed his story in part through leading questions, and in part through comments.33 -67-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 67 of 148claimed she was a t the time. 31 RR 195-212. In fact, Panetti went over the details of the shoot ings so many times, the Dis trict Attorney objected, saying: \"Your Honor, I object. It is just badg ering . We have heard this fiftee n times.\" 31 RR 207. Although the court sustained the objection, and a simil ar one shortly there after, Panetti persisted in his questioning, until eventua lly the court cut him off, and instructed him to ask something else. 31 RR 211-12. Still, Panetti continued to ask about the shootings, and the court ultimately excused the jury, and admonished Panetti: \"I have sustained Mr. Curry 's objections about six or seven times about you going over the same matters, and we're not going to do this anymore. If you continue it, I 'm just going to stop y ou from questioning the witness.\" 31 RR 215. Panetti replied: Your Honor, befor e the jury comes in. The reason I felt it necessary to ask the same question is I got differ ent answe rs. Beg the Court's permission, or the Court's apolog y for doing so. I'm not going to blame it on mental illness and thought disorder, that it's that, or lost my train of thought. I was trying to get what happene d to the jury, which over the next few days will come out with pictures and all the evidenc e. I was trying to get a straig ht answe r, and I will play by the rules, but in considering all things, on per se defending myself, I haven' t had the opportunity , the benef its of being \u2014of anothe r attorne y asking Sonja these diffic ult questions. 31 RR 216. Despite many warnings, Panetti persisted in asking Sonja about details related to the shootings. 31 RR 216-22. The court sustained sever al State objections, and, apart from reiter ating his theme that Sonja e ither did not remembe r the de tails of the cr ime or wa s lying, Pane tti elicited no testimony of par ticular re levanc e. Id. 34 The State conducted redirect examination, and Panetti recrossed, but no significant testimony relevant to this34 Court's conclusion was elicited during either examination. 31 RR 222-34. -68-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 68 of 148Panetti's questioning of Sonja Alvara do was, from the standpoint of his defense, an unmitigated disaster. Any sympathy the jury might still have had for Panetti after Sonja's direc t testimony likely evapor ated when he forced her to relive the murder of her parents, in excruciating detail, over and over again, simply so he could impeach her on matters of little relevance to his defense. He also showed his inexperience , and his lack of cross-e xamination skill, by asking Sonja the same question multipl e times, appar ently expecting more favor able answe rs on his later attempts than he received on his former . Finall y, whether by choice , accident, or as a result of his mental illness, Panetti display ed very little empathy for Sonja, questioning her aggressively , confr ontationally , and at leng th. Howeve r, none of these things rende red Panetti incompetent, by reason of mental illness, to conduct his ow n defense. Panetti obviously had sever al points he wanted to emphasize to the jury in his questioning of Sonja, and his questioning frequently returne d to these areas during his cross- examination. To name but a few, Panetti tried to show: (1) Sonja had a substantial drug history ; (2) Sonja and her family , including her parents, had previous trouble with the law, and in some cases had cr iminal recor ds; (3) he himself w as ver y close to Sonja' s parents; (4) he was a good provider for Sonja, and a good fathe r to Amanda; (5) he had display ed the \"Sarg e\" persona lity well befor e the crime, and it was \"Sarge\" who actua lly committed the crime; (6) Amanda was not devasta ted by witnessing the murders; (7) Sonja was somehow accepting of, or maybe even complicit in, Panetti's crime; a nd (8) ent strateg y\u2014impeaching a hostile witness; casting doubt on the character of Of course, Panetti also tried to show that Sonja later grew to hate him, and that she was therefore biased and35 untrustworthy in her testimony against him. -69-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 69 of 148the victims; minimi zing his own culpability while emphasizing his positive traits; downplay ing the negative effects of his conduct; and trying to establish his defensive theory \u2014was, if not ideal, at least reasonable. Howeve r, his actua l performanc e suffe red from two major flaws, mentioned above. First, Panetti simply did not know how to ask the right questions to make his points effectively . Second, and far more important, any points he might have score d with the jury throug h his probative questions were minuscule in compar ison to the points he lost by forcing Sonja to explain, repeatedly and in horrif ying de tail, exactly how he ha d killed her pa rents. Neve rtheless, these errors of strateg y, execution, and judgme nt are common to all pro se litigants, and do not, in this Court's opinion, rende r Panetti i ncompetent to represent himself. To be frank, Panetti put himself in a nearly impossibl e position when he chose to represent himself, knowing he would either have to let Sonja's no-doubt-damning version of events stand, or to cross- examine her and risk alienating the jury. Even a lawy er of consummate skill would be hard presse d to question a witness who, along with her young daug hter, witnessed her estrang ed husband murder her parents. That Panetti failed\u2014spe ctacularly \u2014to come away from that situation looking like a decent man who was a slave to his mental illness is not a sign of his constitutional incompetenc e to conduct his own de fense , but simpl y a reflection of the Her culea n task he c hose to underta ke. Johnny W aldrip The State's third witness was Johnny Waldrip, a Texas Rang er who responde d to the hostag e situation at the bunkho use. 31 RR 238-40. During the State's direc t examination, Waldrip36 After killing Sonja Alvarado's parents, Panetti took Sonja and their daughter to the bunkhouse. However,36 he appears to have released them voluntarily, before law enforcement fully responded to the scene. As will be seen, Panetti objected to the term \"hostage situation,\" in light of his voluntary release of Sonja and their daughter. -70-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 70 of 148testifi ed mostly about how Panetti looked when he surre ndere d himself, the appea rance of the bunkhouse, and the evidenc e seized from within it. 31 RR 241-53. The State used Waldrip as a sponsoring witness for the se ized evidence and photog raphs of the sce ne. cross-e xamination, Panetti f irst a term \"hostag e situation,\" saying: \" First of a ll, sir, y ou sat down to the jury and you said, 'This particula r hostag e situation.' There were no hostag es, and can you see how when you mention hostag e situation, it might stick in people' s mind as a hostag e situation, when, indee d, it wasn't a hostag e situation? \" 31 RR 255. Later, Panetti challeng ed the objectivity of the law enfor ceme nt investiga tion: \"So you sort of pick and choose the evidenc e that you think is going to be part of . . . . You collecte d the evidenc e that you think is part of the case, but\u2014y ou pick some and leave some? \" 31 RR 270-71. Panetti also asked, sever al times, whether Waldrip had heard about Panetti's mental illness: \"Wh en you were having your briefing was there any talk about my mental state? \"; \"The re was no talk of me being mentally disturbed? \"; \"And the Sheriff never mentioned to you that I had a history of mental illness or\u2014\" 31 RR 271. Panetti also snuck in another reference to his confe ssion, and implied that other Texas Rang ers may have been reprimanded or disciplined for their roles in taking a \"secret confe ssion\" or \"having a sec ret tape .\" 31 RR 273. Finally, Panetti made the point that he voluntarily surre ndere d, and took no aggressive actions toward la w enf orcement. 31 RR 275. htforwa rd. Apar t from attempting to impeach Wald rip about the details of exactly wher e evidenc e was found, Panetti made the -71-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 71 of 148point\u2014effe ctively \u2014that he was not involved in a traditional hostag e situation or standoff with law enfor ceme nt. He voluntarily released his hostag es, and, later, also voluntarily surre ndere d himself. These w ere potentially valuable points to make, a nd Panetti did so in a fairly direc t way . Nothing about his cross-e xamination of this witness suggests Panetti was incompetent to conduct his own defense bec ause of serious mental illness. Day two of Panetti's trial began with routine housekee ping matters, including Panetti's reque st that the court issue additional subpoenas (which was granted), and Panetti's reque st for a press c onfer ence (which was not ). 32 RR 309-11. The S tate then called its next witness. 32 RR 313. Bob Bertelson The State's first witness of the day was Bob Bertelson, a detec tive with the Fredericksburg Police Depa rtment. The State questioned Bertelson about his inves tigation at the Alvara do house, and used him as a sponsoring witness for some of the evidenc e taken from that location, and some photogr aphs. 32 RR 315-22. Panetti objected to the introduction of some of the photogr aphs of the A lvara dos' bodies: There 's four pictures that are above and beyond the actua lity of what happene d, the crime scene . Two of them are posed. It's not natura l as what happene d, and the facts of\u2014there 's two of them. Maybe we should address this with the crime scene photogr apher . Well, there 's four pictures in here wher e wounds are being exposed, wher e there 's my mother-in-la w is flipped over, and shots that are not the facts. My in- laws, my mother and fathe r laying there as they died, a pool of blood, I can see how that's necessar y, but after my mother-in-law laid for hours and hours or five or six hours, whate ver it wa s, in her blood, to be flipped ove r, to have wounds opene d up with rubber gloves, I don't think the jury needs to see four pi cture s in this array of photos, Your Honor. -72-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 72 of 148. . . . They 're graphic and they're just fla t unne cessa ry on the facts that they were shot, died, wher e they fell. The other pictures, they're graphic and sickening as gruesome a s they are. 32 RR 323-24. Panetti c ontinued in the same fashion, stressing the gruesome and artificia l nature of the pictures, as well as their being unnece ssary , for some time. 32 RR 324-35. The court ultimately overr uled Panetti's objection. 32 RR 325. Most of Bertelson's direc t testimony consisted of desc riptions of the evidenc e and photog raphs. 32 RR 325-45. Panetti revisited posed nature the photogr aphs on cross-e xamination. 32 RR 348-52, 357. He also questioned wheth er the wounds depicted in some of the photogr aphs were gunshot wounds, or knife wounds. 32 RR 352-53. Later, Panetti que stioned Bertelson at length about the broken glass in Sonja Alvara do's bedroom, and what it meant about how the window was broken. 32 RR 358-62. Specifica lly, \" about whether he \"bust[ed] throug h\" the window, or simply tapped on it and broke it. 32 RR 361-62. Another area of obvious conce rn to Panetti was the effect of the crime on his daug hter Amanda. Panetti questioned Bertelson about a photogr aph of Amanda: \"[T]hat first picture was that of my daug hter and my heart soare d like an eag le because she looked happy . She looked l ike she wasn't\u2014how was my daug hter in the law enfor ceme nt building, like a normal kid or\u2014\" 32 RR 365. Bertelson indicated he had not had the opportunity to speak with Amanda at the time the picture was taken, and Panetti responde d: \"Just judging from the pictures, she smiled for the came ra, and she's wearing that T-shirt. You didn't see her in the jail at the time going throug h any strang e\u2014like she was in deep shock or, from what I heard, that she was pretty much unaff ected?\" Id. Again, -73-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 73 of 148Bertelson indicated he did not know: \" I was a t the scene the whole time. I couldn't answe r that.\" Id. Neve rtheless, Panetti my daug hter. She wasn't cowe ring or was she doing anything abnorma l like she had just been throug h what she had been throug h, but was it kind of\u2014did she\u2014we ll, did she appea r a little bit in too good a condition, consider ing what she went throug h, or would you have any opinion on that or\u2014\" Id. Bertelson repeated that he was at the scene during that time. Id. Panetti made two more attempts to get Bertelson to acknow ledge that Amanda was unaff ected by the experience , with simil ar answe rs from Bertelson. 32 RR Notably , Panetti admitted nine photogr aphs into evidenc e during these photogr aphs, Bertelson's interpre tation of what they depicted, and a previously created diagram of the crime scene , to attempt to impeach Sonja's testimony from the day befor e. 32 RR 370-74. Panetti asked Ber telson if he knew any thing a bout Panetti's reputation, and Ber telson said he had heard only about P anetti's \"family problems\" with Sonja. 32 RR 374-75. Panetti tried t o get Bertelson to acknow ledge he knew that Panetti was receiving a pension for psychiatric problems, but Bertelson said he did not reme mber having heard that. 32 RR 376-78. Panetti tried, over sever al sustained objections, to ref resh B ertelson's memory on the topic, but to no avail. 32 RR 378-80. After some questioning about the number of shots he fired at the Alvara do house, Panetti used a photogr aph taken at the bunkhouse to impeach Rang er Waldrip's testimony , from the day befor e, about wher e the 30.06 rifle and other items were found. 32 RR 380- 84. Panetti also introduced his sawe d-off shotgun into evidenc e, and asked several questions about its condition, -74-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 74 of 148seeming ly for the purpose of challe nging Bertelson's statement that it had been cut to an illega l length. 32 RR 385-91. Panetti's cross-e xamination of Bertelson is rema rkable for three reasons. First, it demonstrates Panetti knew the importance of introducing evidenc e into the trial record, and that he was sufficie ntly competent to do so when necessary . Second, it shows that Panetti was capable of using one witness's testimony , and other evidenc e, to impeach prior witnesses. Finally , althoug h Bertelson often did not have the answe rs Panetti wanted, Panetti's questions (particularly those aimed at showing that his daug hter Amanda was not seriously traumatized by the murders) were not random or inc ohere nt, but seem to have be en desig ned to adva nce his c hosen trial theor y.37 Donna Stanley After a recess for lunch, the State called Donna Stanley , a Texas Depa rtment of Public Safety DNA serolog ist. 32 RR 402-03. Stanley had conducte d an investiga tion at the Alvarado house, direc ting that aphs be taken, including \"luminol\" photogr aphs desig ned to reveal the prese nce of blood that may not normally have be en visible. 32 RR 405-12. The State also used38 Stanley to introduc e, among other things, bullet f ragments and casing s found at the scene . 32 RR 430-38. On cross- examination, Panetti questioned Stanley about the luminol photogr aphs, and Of course, Panetti's choice of trial theory was itself overly optimistic\u2014for instance, no reasonable jury is37 likely to believe that a young girl would be unaffected by witnessing the murder of her grandparents by her father\u2014but this is an error of judgment, to which all people are susceptible, and is not sufficient to render Panetti mentally incompetent to represent himself under Edwards. The State's questioning of this witness was interrupted by the arrival of the Travis County Medical Examiner,38 who was, for scheduling purposes, examined out of order. The Court nevertheless discusses Stanley's testimony in a single section. -75-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 75 of 148observe d \"it looks like blood everywher e, but in all reality that's m inute amount of blood that the chemica l puts on and shows up; correct?\" 32 R R 445. Panetti tried to question S tanley about the ballistics repor t sever al times, but Stanley told him she was not a firearms expert, did not prepa re the repor t, and there fore could not discuss it with him. 32 RR 445-50. Most signific antly , Panetti got Stanley to acknowle dge ther e was no blood on the tip of the 30.06 rifle. 32 RR 453-54.39 Panetti's questioning of Stanley was confuse d at times, and his confusion seems to have been cause d or aggravated by the mid-questioning interruption to accomm odate the examination of an out- of-or der witness. Neve rtheless, howeve r, Panetti score d probably his most important victory , in terms of impeaching the State's version of events, by getting Stanley to flatly contra dict the Medica l Examiner. Of course , being that Panetti admitted to having shot Joe and Amanda Alvara do, this victory proved relatively minor. But Panetti's cross-e xamination shows he was paying attention to witnesses' testimony , and wa s able, a t least at times, to use it effe ctively against other witnesses. Robert J. Bay ardo The State interrupted its examination of Donna Stanley to call Travis County Medical Examiner Dr. Robert J. Bayardo. 32 RR 412-13. Bayardo performed the autopsies on the Alvara dos, and the State examined him about t he causes of their deaths, and about their wounds. 32 RR 415-21. On cross-e xamin ation, Panetti established that Joe and Amanda Alvara do's deaths were This is significant because it directly contradicted the testimony of the Medical Examiner, who said the rifle39 had to be touching Amanda Alvarado to cause the wounds he observed, and that there \"definitely\" would have been blood on the tip of the rifle under those circumstances. 32 RR 426. -76-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 76 of 148immediate. 32 RR 424. In light of this, Panetti tried to cast doubt on Sonja's story , that her fathe r40 had spoken a fter ha ving be en shot. 32 RR 427. Pane tti also got Bayardo to agree that Panetti had not been aiming for J oe Alvar ado's he art, but that \"the hear t just happened to be in the w ay of the bullet.\" 32 RR 428-29. Panetti's questioning of Bayardo was fairly brief, but fruitful. Potentially very signific ant to the punishment stage of his trial, Panetti tried to show, with some succe ss, that he did not act with delibera tion by aiming, a nd that his victims di d not suffer after he shot them. Russell Johnson The next State witness was Russell Johnson, a Texas Depa rtment of Public Safety ballistics lab employee. 32 RR 396, 458. Johnson testified that, althoug h most of the bullet fragment s41 recovere d at the scene had no marks or pattern areas, and there fore could not be matched to any firearm, two bullet fragments found at the scene were fired from Panetti's 30.06 rifle. 32 RR 460-66. He likewise testified that shell casing s recovere d from the scene were fired from Panetti's rifle. 32 RR 466. Finally , he testified that one of the shells recovere d from the rifle may have cause d a jam. 32 RR 467-68. On cross-e xamination, Johnson acknow ledged he could not tell, by examining a shell casing , when the bullet had been fired. 32 RR 475-76. Panetti also tried to call into question Sonja's story , that Panetti was going to shoot her as well, but was prevented by his rifle jamming, by noting the As noted above, Bayardo testified, in response to Panetti's questioning, that the muzzle of the rifle was40 touching Amanda Alvarado when Panetti fired. 32 RR 426. In another scheduling anomaly, Russell Johnson was actually sworn as a witness before Donna Stanley, but41 his testimony was preempted both by hers, and by Dr. Bayardo's. -77-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 77 of 148rifle wa s new, a nd by getting Johnson to admit t he gun did not jam dur ing any of his te st fires. 32 RR 481-84. Panetti questioned J ohnson, at gre at length, about t he number of bul lets that were fired on the morning of the murders, and tried to get him to comment on repor ts prepa red by other members of the investiga tion team. 32 RR 484-501. He also asked a number of seeming ly irrele vant questions about the shotgun found at the scene , befor e trying (unsucc essfull y) to get Johnson to acknow ledge that the barrel had been sawe d off \"hastily .\" 32 RR 501-08. The rema inder of Panetti's leng thy questioning w as devote d primarily to points he had already made, a bout the lack of evide nce tha t the rifle ha d jammed, and the numbe r of bullets fire d. 32 RR 508-21. Although Panetti's cross-examination of Johnson may have cast some doubt on Sonja's story , that Panetti would have killed her if his rifle had not ja mmed, he devoted a vast amount of time to the questio n of whether three or four bullets had been fired on the morning of the murders. This issue, though it may have had some small value in further impeaching the State's theory of the case, was certainly not worth this amount of effort. In this Court's view, it was a poor choice , but not evidenc e of me ntal incompetenc e to conduc t his own defense . Donna Stanley \u2014 Re call The next day, on September 14, 1995, the State resumed its case-in-chie f by recalling Donna Stanley , the DPS serolog ist. 33 RR 541. The State seems to have recalled Stanley primarily to addre ss questions raised by Panetti during his cross-e xamination of Russell Johnson, particula rly the potential discrepa ncy betwee n the number of bullet fragments retrie ved and the num ber of bullets fired a t the scene . 33 RR 542-46. -78-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 78 of 148Panetti's cross-examination was lengthy and fairly unfocuse d, and the court instructed Panetti on a number occasions to ask questions, rathe r than thinking out loud or narrating . See, e.g., 33 RR 549, 551, 554, 556, 560, 564, 568, 572, 575. Panetti called into question whether bloody boot prints found at the Alvara do house belong ed to him, or to law enfor ceme asked these questions not to deny his prese nce at the scene , but to impeach Sonja Alvara do's earlier testimony . 33 RR 563-64. Panetti also spent a lot of time, at various point s in his cross-e xamination, following up on the issue of the number of bullet casing s and bullet fragments found at the scene , and how many bullets were actua lly fired. 33 RR 548, 552-54, 567-68, 571-77, 583-84. Another topic of considera ble interest to Panet ti, but of little appar ent relevance to his defense, was exactly wher e his shotgun was found, how it was broken, and whether it had come into contac t with a nearby wooden post. 33 RR 549-51, 554-55, 564-66, 582-83. Panetti also got Stanley to acknow ledge that the prese nce of smeare d blood in Sonja's room did not necessarily indicate that a struggle had taken plac e ther e. 33 R R 580-81. Finally , Panetti spent some time discussing his cante en that was found at the Alvarado home, and how full it was when it was r ecove red. 33 RR 568-70, 583. Panetti's second cross-e xamination of Stanley was disorganized, and included as much narration as it did questioning, but it was not w holly without pur pose. Although Panetti devoted a great deal of time to pointi ng out minor purported discr epanc ies and inconsistenc ies in the State's theory of the crime, he also tried to cast doubt on Sonja Alvara do's characterization of Panetti as having acted with purposef ul aggression. Indeed, much of Panetti's cross- examination, of this and other witnesses, seems to have been aimed at creating the impression in the -79-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 79 of 148jury's mind, \"I f Panetti went to the Alvarado hom e intending to murder its occupa nts, why would he do X, or bring Y? Only somebody who was insane would do that.\" In other words, Panetti may have been trying to demonstrate he was insane at the time of the murders, not throug h expert testimony , but throug h an accumulation of circumstantial evidenc e. Or, failing that, he might have been hoping to pa int his crime as a spontaneous reaction to rapidly esca lating e vents, rathe r than a preme ditated, cold-blooded murder. The Court obviously cannot say with certainty what Panetti's trial strateg y was, but his questioning of Stanley does not indicate that he was incompetent to conduct his own de fense , by reason of seve re me ntal illness. Jame s Denman The State's next witness was James Denman, a sergeant with the Texas Rang ers. 33 RR 586. Although Denman had been involved in the investiga tion at the Alvara do home, the State called him to establish that he obtained a tape recorded confe ssion from Panetti approximately twelve hours after the murders. 33 RR 587-92. Denman testified Panetti appea red to have been alert during the interrog ation, and that he did not seem to have been intox icated. 33 RR 591-92. The State also used Denman to rebut Panetti's earlier suggestion, that some member of law enfor ceme nt had been disciplined for their r ole in taking Panetti's confe ssion. 33 RR 592. the interrog ation and confe ssion. Without going into needle ss detail on Panetti's lengthy (and repetitive) cross-e xamination, Panetti attempted to l. 33 RR 598-649.42 After a very lengthy line of questioning about the location of the tape recorder in the interrogation room, and42 whether it was \"open and obvious,\" Panetti finally scored a victory by impeaching Denman with his testimony at the suppression hearing. 33 RR 643-44. -80-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 80 of 148Thoug h legally irrele vant, Panetti's attempt to paint his confe ssion as having been obtained throug h dishonest, improper, or illega l means could potentially have been signific ant to the jury. In particula r, jurors who believed that law enfor ceme nt office rs resor ted to tricker y to obtain Panetti's confe ssion might be inclined to view the testimony of those office rs, or law enfor ceme nt generally, with greater suspicion than they otherwise would. Indeed, Panetti forced Denman to acknow ledge that he had previously testified the tape recorder was not open and obvious to Panetti during the interrog ation. The Court finds this strateg y, though inexpertly executed, was well within the broad scope of constitutionally competent se lf-represe ntation. Fred Cummings Next, the State called Fred Cummi ngs, another Texas Rang er, who was prese nt during Panett i's interrogations. 33 RR 651. The State used Cummi ngs in part to rebut Panetti's characterization of the interviews a s improper or illeg al, but mostly to introduce into evidenc e the audio tapes and written transcr ipts of Panetti's statements, the former of which were played for the jury and tra nscribed into the tria l record. 33 RR 651-740. On cross-e xamination, Cummi ngs admitted he heard from Sonja Alvarado that Panetti suffe red from mental illness. 33 RR 743, 763-67. Panetti also tried, with limit ed succe ss, to get Cummi ngs to acknow ledge that there was a discrepa ncy betwee n Panetti's coher ence appe arance. 33 RR 744-45. Panetti also had a moment of greater than usual incoher ence while questioning Cummi ngs. For reasons best known to Panetti, he tried on sever al occasions to refresh Cummi ngs's memory about various items that Panetti may have had on him when he was arrested, including a belt buckle. -81-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 81 of 14833 RR 751. Panetti wanted to introduce the belt buckle into evidenc e, and the court sustained the State's objection on relevance . 33 RR 751-52. Panetti tried to convince Judge Ables to reverse his ruling , prompting Judge Ables to say : Mr. Panetti, at this tim e I don't see how the belt buckle is re levant to any issue this jury is going to deter mine and so if you can't explain the relevance to me, I'm going to sustain the objection. Can you explain to me how the belt buckle is relevant to any issue in this case? 33 RR 755. P anetti re plied: Yes, I can, Your Honor. It has to do with ja ilhouse religion. It has to do what [sic] some men would do for a belt buckle. It has to do with the differ ence betwee n a rodeo hand and a buckar oo poet. It has to do with my whole out look and thi s will come up, God f orbid, in the punishment stag e. Id. The c ourt aff irmed its orig inal ruling . 33 RR 756. Later, Panetti returned to the topic of the initial suppression of his confe ssions, and the eventua l reversal of that ruling . 33 RR 757-58. The State objected, and the court sustained the objection, indicating the question of the legality of the confe ssions wa s not be fore the jury. 33 RR 759-60. In response , Panetti explained his rationale for asking the question\u2014and, in so doing, display ed a f airly impressive deg ree of imag do it appropr iately , Your Honor, but I wanted the jury to know why, and there was a lot of questions about time of justice, and I thought the jury neede d to know why it took three years, instead of one year in most cases. One year things are done. Why it took\u2014in other wor ds, so the jury didn't think it was lega l wrangling on my part whe n it was indeed the State's. 33 RR 760. As he had with Denman, Panetti cross-e xamined Cummi ngs about the circumstances of his -82-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 82 of 148interrogat ions, with the appar ent goal of calling into doubt their propriety and legality. 33 RR43 767-75; 34 RR 791-94, 796-805. After admitting the diagram of the crime scene into evidenc e, the State rested. 34 RR 806. With the exception of the belt buckle incident descr ibed above, Panetti's cross-e xamination of Cummi ngs to most of his others: lengthy, disorg anized, and often of questionable relevance . Howeve r, Panetti focuse d his questions on issues he felt were important, such as the alleg edly deceptive nature of his interrog ations, and the evidenc e of his mental illness. Even his less- than-c ohere nt comment about the relevance of his belt buckle demons trated that Panetti was conce rned with creating a good imag e of himself with the jury, or at least rebut ting the negative imag e created by the State's evidenc e. Likewise, Panetti wanted to make sure the jury knew that he was not try ing to de lay his trial throug h \"leg al wra ngling.\" As with other witnes Panetti faced an uphill battle in cross-e xamining Cummi ngs. In addition to having to question a hostile witness, trained in how to testify effectively , Panetti had to contend with two fairly damning confe ssions. Under the circumstances, it is unlikely Panetti could have done much more than attack the circumstances surrounding the confe ssions, hopefully painting Cummi ngs as an unscrupulous office r bent on obtaining a confe ssion throug h any means necessary , and himself as a mentally ill man who was unable to resist such devious law e nforc ement tac tics. In any case, althoug h it appea rs Panetti lost focus during a portion of his questioning of Cummi ngs, the Court nevert heless conclude s, based upon the great bulk of his other cross- Panetti's cross-examination of Cummings spanned from the afternoon of September 14, 1995, to the morning43 of September 15, 1995. -83-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 83 of 148examination, that he was not rende red inc ompetent to represent himself because of serious mental illness.44 Panetti's Defe nse Case Jacque line Goettsche Panetti's first witness was Jacque line Goettsche , a friend of Panetti's family . 34 RR 808-09. After establishing he had not coached her in her testimony (a question Panetti asked virtually all of his witnesses), Panetti moved on to the questi on of his mental i llness. 34 RR 809-10. Goettsche said she \"alwa ys thought [Panetti was] an unstable person,\" and that she had felt for approximately ten y ears that he wa s mentally ill. 34 R R 810-11. Significa ntly, Goettsche commented on Pane tti's cohere nce dur ing his trial: \"You seem to be better right now than I have seen you ever. I don't know why. If you're on some kind of medication or you're not or\u2014\" 34 RR 813. Panetti responde d: \"No, ma'a m, I'm having a lot of problem with an unmedicate d thought disorder and I'm trying to get some medicine.\" 34 RR 814. Somewhat later, at Panetti's prompting, she elabor ated about how he looked like \"a differ ent person\" that day: \"Yes, you do, very differ ent, in fact. When I called the Court last week, I said whether you would be shackle d, because I was afraid, and they said no, but that you were doing well; so I came , and I do see a differ ent per son here .\" 34 RR 816. The Court is forced to acknowledge another possibility regarding Panetti's strange comments: as he was44 relying on the insanity defense, any unusual behavior, feigned or genuine, might reasonably have been expected to inure to his advantage in the jury's deliberations. Of course, the Court has no reliable way of knowing what Panetti's motives were, much less the impression his various statements left with the jury; thus, the Court merely notes the double-edged nature of his strange courtroom behavior, and does not base any conclusions upon this observation. -84-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 84 of 148Goettche also testified to Panetti's prior drug use, althoug h she knew few details. 34 RR 815. The State did not cross- examine Goettsche. 34 RR 819. Goettsche 's comment, that Panetti seeme d better than he had in years, is signific ant not only because it sug gests Panetti ma y have been experiencing a particula rly lucid period during his tria l, but also because the same sentiment was later echoe d by both Panetti's brother, and his mother. See 35 RR 1121; 36 RR 1315. These comments are, in large part, why the Court focuse s so closely on Panetti's trial performanc e, rathe r than his undeniable history of mental illness. Panetti obviously had good days and bad, but the Court's revie w of the record suggests the days of Panetti's trial may have be en some of his most coher ent. Sam Preston Douglass, Jr. Panetti's next witness was Sam Preston Doug lass, Jr., Panetti's prior court-a ppointed attorney acknow ledged on direc t examination that, althoug h he and Panetti had several heated arg uments cause d, in part, by Panetti's mental illness, Doug lass was not afraid of Panetti. 34 RR 821-22. Doug lass also testified about Panetti's history of being instit utionaliz ed for his mental illness, and Panetti used Doug lass to introduce into evidenc e Panetti's medical records from the va rious hospitals in which he had r eceived trea tment. 34 RR 824-26, 830-34. On self-r epresentation, Panetti asked Doug lass: \"When we met here in the courtroom when I stood up and stated to the Judge that I was going to defend myself, what did you tell me? \" 34 RR 830. Doug lass replied: \" I told y ou I thought it was a terrible mistake .\" Id. After Panetti introduced additional medical records into evidenc e, the court allowed him to proce ed with questioning , at which point Panetti said: -85-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 01/31/12 Page 85 of 148Your Honor, I didn't prepa re and I did not take the advice of my standby counsel and sleep, and I made sure all the records were all from the hospital in the records, but I didn't prepa re a list of questions for Preston and at this time I really can't offha nd think of\u2014have anything to ask and his partne r in the law firm may be called later, so I don't anticipate calling Preston back, or at this time, Your Honor, I don't have any further questions. 34 RR 834-35. As before , the State elec ted not to cross-e xamine Panetti's witness. 34 RR 835. Panetti's direc t examination of Doug lass was, as usual, pepper ed with irrele vant comments, explanations, and asides. Howeve r, Panetti advanc ed his case substantially by using Doug lass to introduce the records of Panetti's various hospital stays. These records provided objective, documentar y evidenc e of Panetti's mental illness, and corroborate d much of the testimony from previous witnesses. Indeed, if the jury had been inclined to credit Panetti's account of multipl e persona lities, or even just suspected he m ight not have known right from wrong at the time of the shootings, these documents m ay well have been disposit ive of the case. Thus, even considering45 Panetti's occasional random tangents, his examination of Doug lass was not constitutionally defic ient under Edwards . Louis John Panetti Panetti's next witness was his fathe r, Louis John Panetti. 34 RR 842. Although Panetti's questions sometimes appea red irrele vant, his fathe r was a friendly witness, and provided a great deal of favor able testimony for his son. In brief summary , Louis te stified about: Panetti's sever al near- death e xperie nces; the various kinds of work he and Panetti ha d done over the y ears; the first time As it happens, of course, the jury obviously did not believe that Panetti was insane at the time of the murders,45 thus making any evaluation of the potential importance of this evidence mere educated guesswork. However, this Court believes Panetti's failure in his trial was a pragmatic one, in that he failed to persuade the jurors, and not a legal one, in that he failed to produce sufficient evidence to support his defensive theory. -86-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 86 of 148he suspected Panetti was mentally ill; Panetti's Navy service ; Panetti's drug and alcohol addiction;46 Panetti's prior problems with the law; his having heard that Panetti had been shot in the leg; and his having urged Panetti's ex-wife to have Panetti committed. 34 RR 842-60. Again, the State conducte d no cross-e xamination. 34 RR 860. Louis Panetti prese nted to the jury the imag e of Scott Panetti as a man who had experience d many hardships, and who was a victim of serious and longsta nding mental illness. Although much of his testimony was probably more relevant to the question of punishment than guilt or innocenc e, Louis Panetti told the jury about his son's history of mental illness, an issue direc tly relevant to Scott Panetti's insanity defense. Of potentially equal practical, if not legal, importan ce, Louis Panetti humanized his son, by prese nting him as a hard- working but troubled m an, rather than a cold and aggressive killer. Considering the plausible value of Louis Panetti's testimony , neither Scott Panetti's decision to call his fathe r as a witness, nor the questions he asked during direc t examination, sugg est he wa s mentally incompetent to conduc t his own defense . Lester Ray Me ier Next, Panetti called Lester Ray Meier, a rodeo produce r who appar ently knew Panetti from his bull riding days. 34 RR 862. Panetti's decision to call Meier seems to have been unplanned (\"I didn't know y ou were here and I didn't have a nything e xcept just what's on top of my head about just a few things about the little bit we know each other.\" ), and his questioning was almost entirely irrele vant to the question of Panetti's guilt or innocenc e, althoug h it may have had some minor relevance to the question of punishment. 34 RR 862-68. His few potentially relevant questions Panetti also introduced his military records into evidence through his father's testimony. 34 RR 849-50.46 -87-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 87 of 148were about Meier' s general knowledg e of Panetti's character and reputa tion (\"[I]n other words, just from being a lifelong resident in Fredericksburg , just explai n to the Court and jury just what you know about anything, about Scott Panetti? . . . The good, the bad, and the ugly, as\u2014\") , and Panetti's alcoholism (\"You ever heard any scuttlebutt in town about me going to A.A., having drinking problems or getting into pr oblems? \"). 34 RR 865, 867. The State once again opted not to ask any questions. 34 RR 868. There seems to have been little reason for Panetti to call Meier, and Meier did not add much useful testimony . The record suggests Panetti may have called Meier simply because other witnesses were not yet in the courtroom, and not for any specific purpose. On the other hand, P anetti m ay47 have called Meier to discuss Panetti's rodeo accomplishm ents, and his skill as a farrier, two subjects of obvious pride for Panetti. Even assuming Panetti c alled Meier completely at random, howeve r, this is insufficient, in the context of the entire record, to persua de the Court that Panetti was mentally incompetent to re prese nt himself. Richard Mosty After lunch, Panetti called his other former court-a ppointed the question of his self-r epresentation, and Mosty explained that he \"did everything possibly do . . . to [Panetti] of it.\" to summarize Panetti's various hospitaliz ations; Mosty discussed them in detail, including in his summary , among other thi ngs, Panetti's sever al diagnoses. 34 RR The court had difficulty serving some of Panetti's requested subpoenas, with the result that Panetti was unable47 to call witnesses in the order he had planned. -88-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 88 of 148876-81. Mosty also testified that Sonja A lvara do knew a bout \"Serg eant I ronhorse \" as f ar ba ck as 1990. 34 RR 882. Panetti admitted into evidenc e, throug h Mosty , sever al items of clothing Panetti had been wearing at the time of his arrest, including Panetti's watch, his belt and buckle, his tie and tack, and his shirt and coat. 34 RR 883-85. Mosty addit ionally recounted an argument he had had with Panetti, which culminated in Mosty throwing a casse tte tape at Panetti. 34 RR 886. Panetti asked: \"When you threw your fit and you chucke d the tape at me, what did I do?\" Id. Mosty replied: \"You didn't do anything. You shortly there after gave me my tape ba ck.\" Id. Panetti finally returne d to the issue of his mental state, and in particula r seeme d to be asking Mosty to confirm that Panetti display ed multipl e persona lities: \"[D]i d you ever see differ ent varia tions of my persona lities? \" 34 RR 887. Breaking its pattern of silence, the State elected to cross-examine Mosty . 34 RR 888. The State emphasized Panetti's many diagnoses of alcohol ism over the years, and conclude d by observing that the State had a lso, along with Mosty , opposed me stating why I decide d to defend myself, briefly ?\" 34 RR 895. Mosty responde d: \"Well, if I could summarize it, I would say that you said God wa s going to g uide y ou.\" Id. Panetti replied, in closing : \"Amen.\" Id. Mosty 's testimony was potentially very helpful to Panetti's case, as it contained the most detailed verba l account of Panetti' s various hospitaliz ations and diagnoses of any testimony -89-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 89 of 148prese nted to the jury. Panetti also stressed his status as an underdog , by showing how opposed Mosty was to Panetti's self-r epresentation. Finally , Panetti e mphasized his religious faith, a move one reasonably could anticipate would win favor with a rural Texas jury. In short, nothing in Panetti's examination of Mosty demonstrates tha t Panetti was incompetent to def end himself. Patrick Schue tte Panetti's next witness was Patrick Schuette, an old friend. 34 RR 896-97. One of Panetti's main goals in calling Schuette seems to have been so Schuette could identify , and ex plain the use why Panetti carried knives, and wore milit ary clothing. 34 RR 899. Panetti then asked a slightly more pointed question: \"Have you ever known me to be in a paramilit ary group or to be\u2014to be\u2014to do milit ary maneuve rs or glorify a wa r or the ta king of human life or find any \u2014did I ever make a ny rema rks about blood trails? \" Id. Schuette testified he knew Panetti used sever al differ ent names, but that he \"thoug ht that was just the way [Panetti] signe d poetry . . . 901. Panetti also asked questions appar ently aimed at showing he was a hard worke r: \"If there was ever a time I was around and y'all were doing the job\u2014well, y ou know t his was w ork I preferred and didn't prefer the life, but if it come to you calling me up to work, even if it was digging ditches or breaking concr ete, would I take that job?\" 34 RR 902. Returning to its previous laconic strateg y, the State did not cross-e xamine Schuette. 34 RR 905. It seems Panetti called Schuette to combat his \"Rambo\" imag e, and to demonstrate that, althoug h Panetti carried knives and wore milit ary outfits, he was not a violent war veter an. Rather, -90-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 90 of 148Panetti's questions suggest, he wished to give the jury the impression that he was a practical and hardw orking hunting enthusiast. Although creating a favor able imag e with the jury is important in any case, it was of crucial importance in Panetti's case\u2014which featured both gruesome violence and a fairly unsympathetic, potentially alienating , defendant\u2014that he rehabilitate his imag e as much as possible. Schuette's testimony was probably too little, too late, but Panetti's decision to call him was not unrea sonable, unde r the c ircumstance s. John W olfgang Braeutigam Next, Panetti called John Braeutig am, whose exact relationship to Panetti is slightly unclea r, but for whom Panetti appe ars to have worke d as a dr iver. 34 RR 907-10, 913. For the most part, Braeutig am had little memory of the matters about which Panetti asked, and his testimony was essentially irrelevant to either Panetti's guilt or innocenc e, or his proper punishment. 34 RR 907-13. Predictably , the State did not cross-e xamine the man. 34 RR 913. David Morque cho Panetti's next witness was David Morquec a statement to law enfor ceme nt on September 11, 1992, about a meeting he had with Panetti the day befor e the murders. 34 RR 922-23. Presumably by way of impeachme nt, Panetti wanted Morquec ho to admit that he sold marijuana to Panetti, but Morquec ho was having none of it. 34 RR 920-21, 925. Panetti also asked a number of questions about Morquec ho's criminal record, his drug and alcohol use, and whether he was an informant for police. 34 RR 925-29. Indeed, Panetti asked several questions, and made sever al statements, that called -91-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 91 of 148Morquec ho's honesty into question: \"Well, David, what I'm going to ask you that has relevance to my guilt or innocenc e is the credibilit y as you being a witness and you made a statement that could mean my life and w e got to f ind out if y ou're telling the tr uth,\" 34 RR 929; \"David, I 'm not g oing to inter rogate you, but do you know the penalty for perjury in a case such as this,\" id.; \"Are you on parole right now, on probation? . . . What would happen if you were to be arrested today ,\" id.; \"Well, David, I'm going to ask you these questions once and just come up with a straig ht answe r, because I don't want to interrogate\u2014take the Court's time, because I'm asking you questions about how many times you been busted and what for and you're being evasive , and I can't get to what you said is on the statement, David,\" 34 RR 930. The State cross-e xamined Morquec ho about the statement he gave police , and about the me eting with Panetti the day befor e the murde rs. RR 930-33. On redire Morquec ho was lying (\"David, alls [sic] I want you to tell is the truth and not put on a show.\"), a nd ag ain implied he was a police informant (\"I'm going to ask you why when someone gets busted they go to jail, and you been able to stay out of jail with your arrest record.\") . 34 RR 935. After sever al more references to Morquec ho's prior convictions, Panetti concluded his que stioning. 34 RR 935-37. Morquec ho gave a damaging statement to police about an interac tion he had with Panetti shortly befor e the to impeach Morquec y, not only by bring ing up Morquec ho's prior convictions, but also by suggesting Morquec ho would lie to police to avoid legal problems of his own. And althoug h this Court can only specula te how much credence the jury gave Morquec ho's testimony , it seems likely Panetti's questions, and Morquec ho's often evasive or inconsistent answe rs, at least raised substantial -92-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 92 of Morque cho's credibilit y. Of course , impeachme nt of a negative witness is a perfectly sound trial strate gy, and one Panetti employ ed with reasonable effectivene ss in this instance. Curtis B. Allerkamp Panetti's next witness was Curti s B. Allerkamp, a who appar ently knew Panetti from Alcoholics Anony mous meeting s, and last saw him one or two y ears prior to the m urder s. 34 RR 937-39. Allerka mp's direc t testimony was essentially irrele any issue in Panetti's case, but Panetti appea red to be trying to make a connec tion betwee n intox ication and insanity , as well as validating the idea of being restore d to sanity through spirituality . 34 RR 942-44. On cross- examination, the St ate clarified the legal issue: \"Ha ve you ever known the De fenda nt to not know the diffe rence betwe en rig ht and Allerkamp: \"N o.\" Panetti e licited no relevant testimony on redire ct, but he did de monstrate his know ledge of the legal definition of insanity : \"Did you know that when the D.A. asked you that question, that the whole stem of an insanity defense depends on a couple of issues and one of them is knowing the differ ence betwee n right and wrong ?\" Id. Considering that Panetti obviously knew what he had to prove to preva il on his insanity defense, it is unclea r why he called Allerka mp as a witness. Howeve r, as Panetti's final question48 During voir dire, Panetti asked several potential jurors whether they believed a person could be restored to48 sanity through spiritual means. Panetti may have been attempting to use Allerkamp, and his knowledge of Alcoholics Anonymous principles, to lend credence to the possibility that Panetti was rendered sane by his post-murder spiritual conversion. Of course, as before, this is speculation by the Court and not a basis for any of its conclusions. -93-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 93 of 148amply demonstrates, he had an appre ciation of the legal issues centr al to his guilt or innocence. 49 Although Panetti appea rs to have called an unnece ssary witness in Allerka mp, there is no particula r indication this mista ke was cause d by Panetti's mental illness, nor that it was a mistake of such magnitude that it render ed him constitutionally incompetent to re prese nt himself. Kenn Knopp Panetti then called as a witness Kenn Knopp, an ordaine d deacon who visited Panetti in the Gillespie County Jail after the murders. 34 RR 948-49. Knopp appea rs to have been a strong proponent of Panetti's multipl e persona lities theory (\"I have never been involved . . . in a situation like this, so I would have to judg e it on its own merit and see if I'm not even betra ying you or your alter eg o. . . . Ego, no, not in a sense of thinking the re's something more than what y ou really are, but in what per sonalities may be wor king within you.\"), and Panetti began by trying to bolster hi s credibilit y: \"[I]n other words, doctors aren't gospel and\u2014and your [sic] clergy may know as most doctors.\" 34 RR 949-50. Knopp belief about Panetti's mental illness: \"I believe that probably you're a victim of chemistry , and in a system, in a bodily system, in schizophrenics that can't handle chang es in sugars and drugs and alcohol, whatnot, then they just, like Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde, they just turn and then you're the victim. . . . And nothing you can really do about it.\" 34 RR 953. Panetti added a comment befor e proce eding to his next question: \"And the victims hurt the ones they love the most.\" Id. Also scattered throughout Panetti's questioning of witnesses is his acknowledgment that voluntary intoxication49 is not a legal excuse for murder. -94-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 94 of asked a more direc t question: \"Kenn, befor e you head back to Fredericksburg or I pass the witness, and to bring it down to the legal matter, in all your years of counseling as clergy, have you ever encounte red anybody that was schizophrenic to where you can conce ive that they might not know rig ht from wrong ?\" 34 RR 956. The State cross-e xamined Knopp on the issue of Panetti's alter ego, and specific ally whether Knopp only learned about Panetti's alleg ed separ ate persona lity during the trial, but Knopp gave fairly unhelpful answe rs: \"Oh, I knew it long ago, in a sense. . . . Wher e did I learn he had a n alter ego? Well, he's alway s coming up in costume, y ou know. I'm in a costume. He 's in a costume. Every body is in a costume.\" 34 RR 958-59. The State followed up with a series of questions tha t this Court assumes were intended to impeach Knopp's credibilit y: \"Do you have not a medical doctor? \"; and, \"But you're certain that a demon wasn't roaming around and affected Mr. Panetti on the 8th of September? \" 34 RR 959-61. Panetti did not take the witness on redire ct. 34 RR 961. Talk of demons aside, Panetti's examination of K nopp was most notable for his attempt to link schizophrenia with legal insanity . Also rema rkable was Panetti's sidebar comment, about how schizophrenics ar e victims, and how they hurt the ones they love most. These theme s\u2014Panetti as a victim of mental illness, his affection for his victims, and, of course , his insanity \u2014wer e consistent throug hout Panetti's trial, and perme ated his examinations of witnesses. Whether Panetti could have come up with a better defensive strateg y is debata ble, but ultimately irrele vant; what matters is whether Panetti was mentally capable of performing the tasks require d to conduct his own defense in a constitutionally sufficie nt manner . As the Court has reiter ated many times throug hout its -95-Case Filed 01/31/12 Page 95 of 148discussion, Panetti has failed to demonstrate that his mental illness rende red him incompetent to proce ed pro se . Marcie B runschmid Panetti Panetti's witness was his sister-in-law , Marc ie Brunschmid Panetti. 34 RR 962. Marc ie testified about her strong belief, upon first meeting Panetti and later, that he was mentally ill. 34 RR 964-65. Marc ie reiter ated the notion that Panetti was a victim, and suggested his mental illness was aggravated by the incorre ct and excessive medication he was given. 34 RR 965. During his direc t examination, Panetti referred to the \"legal range war [he had] had trying to get to a psychiatrist,\" and blamed his inability to see a psychiatrist on jail officia ls. 34 RR 976. Marcie was appar ently also a proponent of persona lity theory . Panetti asked: \"[B]efore you came to court and heard testimony or what wa s on the buckle or did y ou ever hear50 of any other na mes I had? \" 34 RR 971. Marcie 's reply: Yes, I have heard of a Sergeant Ironhorse . I do believe people can have two persona lities and when one persona lity is out there that we see, the other person is hidden, and when Scott Panetti comes out, I don't know he reme mbers what Sergeant Ironhorse did. I think people ca n have multiple per sonalities. 34 RR 972. Panetti asked no further questions, and the State elected not to cross-e xamine Marc ie. Id. As September 15, 1995 was a Friday, the court recessed Panetti's case until Monday , September 18. Id. Vernie Harris Panetti's first witness on Monday morning was Vernie Harris, a man who used to attend The name \"Ironhorse\" was apparently on the belt buckle Panetti was wearing when he was arrested.50 -96-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 96 of 148churc h with Panetti. 35 RR 989-90. Panetti asked sever al questions about whether Harris had heard about Panetti's mental illness, or noticed anything unusual about Panetti during churc h, but Harris had little to say on the matters. 35 RR 990-91. In fact, Harris seeme d only casua lly acqua inted with Panetti, and was unable to answe r many of his questions. 35 RR 989-91. According ly, Panetti's direc t examination was very brief, a nd the State aske d Har ris no questions. 35 RR 991. John Paul Ramse y Panetti's next witness was Dr. John Paul Ramsey , a family physician in Fredericksburg who treated Panetti in 1984 or 1985 for a gunshot wound, and who appar ently first asked Ramsey to explain why some of Panetti's medical records were unavailable , which he did. 35 RR 993-94. Then Panetti asked Ramsey to descr ibe how he tr eated Panetti's g unshot wound. 35 RR 994-95. Ramsey also testified about sever al visits Panetti made to him for psychiatric reasons. 35 RR 997. Panetti asked specific ally about Ramsey 's impressions of Panetti's mental illness, and whether Ramsey had hea rd about Pane tti \"going into treatment.\" 35 RR 998-99. Later, after many irrele vant questions about treatment Panetti received for a sebac eous cyst while in jail, Panetti asked a catch-all question of Ramsey \u2014one he would repeat, in various forms, to many future witnesses: \"[I]s there anything that I may not have touched on or that you know about Scott Panetti that may give some insight to the jury about, and may be helpful or\u2014in other words, honestly anything that I may not have questioned you or asked you about that has anything to do with the innocenc e or guilt of\u2014\" 35 RR 1004. In response , Ramsey offered to testify about his treatment of Panetti, or Panetti's mental illness, but indicated he was uncomforta ble with the open-e nded -97-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 01/31/12 Page of Panetti's q uestion. 35 RR 1004. Panetti's reply was notable: \"No, I think just from my recollection I have asked questions f or Scott to find out more about Sar ge, and I think if there wa s anything bizarre or when I initially came in for the Lithobid and I was prescribed to that, I didn't know what y ou diag nosed or wha t you thought may have be en my problem.\" 35 RR 1004-05. The State cross-e xamined Ramsey about his treatment of Panetti, appar ently trying to establish that his treatment occur red well befor e Panetti's crime, and after it, but not immediately preceding it. 35 RR 1007-08. Panetti's questions on redire ct elicited no signific ant testimony . 35 RR 1008-09. In sum, Panetti's questioning of Ramsey further develope d the evidenc e of Panetti's mental illness, and allowed him to discuss the narcotic pain medication he received after his gunshot wound. Although much of this evidenc e was cumulative, and potentially unnece ssary , it was consistent with Panetti's appar ent trial strateg y; thus, it does not appea r to have been unrea sonable for Panetti to call Ramsey as a w itness. Arnulfo Rendon The next witness Panetti called was Arnulfo Rendon, who was an old friend of Panetti's. 35 RR 1009-11. After some preliminary questions, Panetti returne d to the subject of his gunshot injury : \"[A]bout when I got shot did you notice any chang e in Scott Panetti? \" 35 RR 1012. Later, Panetti asked a question in a simil ar vein: \"[I]s there just honestly anything that stands out in your mind as bizarre or peculiar about me?\" 35 RR 1013. At the end of his examination, Panetti returne d to this theme: \"When y ou saw me smoke [marijuana ] once in a while, did I turn into something diffe rent than most people when they smoked? \" 35 RR 1015. The State did not cross-e xamine Rendon. 35 -98-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 98 of 148RR 1015. Panetti got few helpful answe rs, but it appea rs he was hoping Rendon would corroborate his separ ate persona lity theory , or at least cast doubt on Panetti's sanity prior to the murders. As usual, of course, his examination was pepper ed with random asides and irrele vant tangents, but nothing that rende red his examination of this witness constitut ionally incompetent. Jame s S. Bell Panetti next called J ames S. \"Micke y\" Bell, who had previously attended the same church as Panetti, and who was casua lly acqua inted with him. 35 RR 1016-17. As with sever al of his prior witnesses, Panetti asked B ell a very open-e nded question about hi s past behavior : \"Micke y, as fa r as my attendanc e at the churc h and bring ing my daug hter to Sunday school, is there anything about me that ex plains for the jury\u2014I know s everal different lay witness es, ideas or impressions or odd conduct or general all\u2014g eneral social functions of me?\" 35 RR 1018-19. In response , Bell referred to Panetti as \"an unusual person,\" and noted both his penchant for \"very unusual poetry ,\" and his habit of attending churc h with a \"B owie knife strapped a t [his] side.\" 35 RR 1019. Appar ently fishing for more, Panetti later asked another broad question about his strang e behavior : [D]o you reme mber me in churc h ever doing any thing bizarre or do y ou reme mber me having any arguments with anybody in churc h about theolog y or do you reme mber anything in your mind befor e I pass you as a witness that stands out in your mind or anything you know about my mental history or if I was on medicine or anything that would be helpful about my history ? 35 RR 1021. When Bell indicated he did not recall anything that would suggest Panetti was imbalance d or argumentative, Panetti conclude d: \"Well, it's true that I didn't\u2014y ou didn't ever hear -99-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 99 of 148around town that I was in jail a lot or an outlaw or althoug h I did strang e things, that you weren't aware of me being a criminal? \" 35 RR 1021. The State again opted not to conduct any cross- examination. 35 R R 1022. With Bell, and sever al other witnesses, it appea rs Panetti may have had only a couple of specific topics he wished to cover , after which he would ask very broad questions, presumably hoping for favor able replies about his unusual beha vior or reputa tion for mental illness. Thoug h questionable as a trial strateg y, it does not appea r to be product of a person so mentally ill that he cannot pe rform the basic func tions of self re prese ntation. Harold Clint on W oods, Jr. Panetti's next witness was Harold Clint on \"Woody \" Woods, Jr., who appea rs to ha ve been another old friend of Panetti's. 35 RR 1022-24. Panetti started his examination by questioning Woods about a mutual acqua intance, but none of Panetti's questio ns appea r to have had any relevance to his case. 35 RR 1024-26. Later, Panetti got to a more pertinent issue, specific ally Woods's familiarity with Panetti's milit ary gear, and Panetti's tendenc y to wear it for everyday occasions. 35 RR 1028-30. Woods also agreed Panetti's camouf lage would be appropr iate for bow hunting. 35 RR 1031-32. After getting Woods to acknow ledge that Panetti worke d, in addition to getting a pension, Panetti asked his ty pical, wide- open question: Could you just sort of straig ht out from the top of your mind just can you think of me doing anything that stands out in your mind as being bizarre, or can you think just not\u2014the jury can tell if someone is trying to kill me or cure me, and is there anything about me led you to believe I might have had\u2014beside s the fact I took medicine, that I wasn't y our normal Joe? 35 RR 1034. Woods's response was rema 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed of 148demea nor during his trial: \"'Goofy' would probably be as accurate as\u2014y our mind was alway s working , but it wasn't working in a straight line. Oh, y ou would go off on tangents in the m iddle of a c onversa tion Id. Panetti asked if Woods reme mbere d Panetti going by any other name but his own, presumably hoping Woods would recall the name \"Serg eant Ironhorse ,\" but Woods appar ently had no such recollection. 35 RR 1035. Panetti followed up with a shrewd question about his mental illness and persona l responsibility : You ever reme mber me saying I could get away with anything because of my mental condition or use that as an excuse to be foolish, or do you think in any way that I ever mentioned that I could do anything that would give me\u2014not just the having disease and the infliction [sic] involved; did I ever mention to you that I could do things and that were unkosher and blaming it on being a sicko or do you reme mber any offha 35 RR 1035. Panetti continued in simil ar fashion, asking about his reputation in the community and whether he had ever been \"run off because of any cussing ,\" before c oncluding with unremar kable questions, primari ly about Woods's recollection of various items of Panetti's clothing. 35 RR 1036-38. The State did not cross- examine Woods . 35 RR 1038. Panetti's direc t examination of Woods was fairly typical, with Panetti trying to rebut his Rambo imag e; to legitimi ze his Sergeant Ironhorse persona ; to establish his odd behavior and reputa tion for mental illness; and to challeng e the State's characterization of him as a violent misfit. Howev er, Panetti's examination contained one particula rly notable feature, specific ally his question, quoted above, about whether he had ever used his mental illness to get away with improper behavior . -101-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 101 of 148Given Panetti's conce rn that the jury would view his insanity defense as a mere technica lity\u2014a conce rn he made clear on sever al occasions during voir dire\u2014 this question seems to have been aimed at rebutting the ideas, either that Panetti was sim ply faking his insanity , or that P anetti was in the habit of using it as an excuse for bad behavior . To the Court, it suggests Panetti was very conscious of his imag e with the jury, and had an appre ciation of some of the difficulties in preva iling on an insanity defe nse. Veronica Kee n After a recess, Panetti called Veronica Keen, a poet who attended churc h with him. 35 RR51 1039-40. Panetti used Keen to admit into evidenc e, over the State's relevancy objection, a collection of poems Panetti had wr itten prior to the murder s. 35 RR 1041-42. Panett i then moved to the question of his separ ate persona lity, asking : \"Victor ia, may be uncomforta ble, but could y ou explain if you reme mber any thing about Ironhorse ?\" 35 RR 1043. When Keen responde d she recalled Panetti referring to himself by that name on one occasion, Panetti followed up: \"Did you ever find it strang e or think that it might have been something than [sic] just a pen name? \" Id. Keen said she did not find it strang e, at which point Panetti asked a superb leading question: \"Ms. Keen, is there anything you know about Sarge Ironho rse that you\u2014it is maybe uncomforta ble for you, but\u2014and you may not, but is there anything you may wish to share with us about this persona lity?\" Id. Keen refused to take the bait, howeve r, reply ing: \"I'm not familiar with that persona lity.\" Id. Panetti conclude d his questioning almost immediately there after, and the State As Keen explained when she was called as a witness, her real name was Veronica, but she wrote poetry under51 the name \"Victoria.\" 35 RR 1039. Panetti referred to her by the latter name. -102-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 102 of 148did not cross-examine Kee n. 35 RR 1044. Victoria Panetti Panetti's next witness was his young er sister, Victoria Panetti. 35 RR 1044-45. Predictably , Panetti asked his sister about hi s purported se parate per sonality : \"[W ]ould you please tell the jury briefly what you know about Ironhorse or my history or please \u2014\" 35 RR 1047. Unpre dictably , after Victoria recounted how Panetti had gone to cosmetolog y school and used to cut her hair, Panetti asked he r if she w ould like a hairc ut. 35 RR 1050. Victoria declined. Id. Finally , in addition to questions of more dubious relevance , Panetti asked Victoria about his behavi or and medications over the y ears. 35 RR 1050-54. Aga in, the State conducte d no cross-e xamination. 35 RR 1054. Hugo Mae nius Next, Panetti called Hugo Maenius, a rancher whose son was marrie d to Panetti's sister. 35 RR 1055-56. Some of Panetti's questions to Maenius were more disjoint ed than usual, but Panetti did ask his typical open-e nded question: \"Any comments, anything strang e about things I said or did or looked or anything? \" 35 RR 1057. When Panetti asked an even broade r question (\"Is there anything you would like to tell the jury about my actions up to the time that I was arrest ed?\"), Maenius balked, asking Panetti to make his question \"a little clearer.\" 35 RR 1058. After some questions about the hostag e situatio n at the bunkhouse, which Maenius could not answe r, Panetti conclude d, asking a question that gives some insight into what he believed was relevant to his defense: \"Hug o, is there anything that you would like to tell the jury about me, my actions ever since you known me that may be relevant to my guilt or innocenc e, my mental state, my conduct as a human being , anything at all, sir?\" 35 RR 1059. The State did not cross-e xamine Maenius. 35 RR -103-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Page 103 of 1481060. Randall L. Maenius Panetti's next witness was Randall L. Maenius, Hugo Maenius's son and Panetti's brother- in- law. 35 1061-62. Panetti asked his traditional open-e nded question (\"You briefly just explain how I looked [in jail] and how I acted and what I said that might stand out in your mind.\"), then moved to the topic of his gunshot injury . 35 RR 1063, 1065. Panetti also asked questions about his purported persona lity change after he got shot, as well as whether Maenius recalled \"any strang e names or anything [Panetti] said,\" or whether he \"one day looked differ ent.\" 35 RR 1065. The State opted not to cross-e xamine the witness. 35 RR 1066. John Matthew Pe nick Next, P anetti ca lled J ohn Matthew Penick, a man appare casua lly acqua with to Panetti's standard open-e nded question about his strang e behavior (\"At those Das I st Alles Fest, at any family or any functions can you think about me doi ng anything biz arre or strang e?\"), Penick rec ounted having seen Pane tti on the day prior to the murders, at which meeting Panetti c laimed to be a differ ent person. 35 RR 1068. Panetti got52 Penick to acknowledg e that Panetti had d with or for him, and Penick identified \"Ironhorse \" as a nickname Panetti used to go by. 35 RR 1069. In conclusion, Panetti asked: \"[W]ere you aware of any thing that the jur y needs to know tha t's rele vant to what this is all about? \" Id. The State briefly cross-e xamined Penick about his meeting with Panetti at the Das Ist Alles Fest, and may have made a tactica l blunder when it asked whether Panetti seeme d unusual that day, Penick later acknowledged some doubt about the exact timing of the meeting. 35 RR 1070.52 -104-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed Penick replied: \"Yeah, he seeme d very unusual that day. I don't know whether it was from the alcohol or what, bec ause I didn't\u2014y ou know, brief ly visited with him .\" 35 RR 1069-71. On redire ct, Panetti followed up on this line of questioning: \"John, whe n you saw me there at the Das Ist Alles Fest, was there more to it than just the fact that I was drinking ? Was I drunk or just drinking and st range or in a word? \" 35 RR 1072. Panetti conclude d his questioning by once again asking questions about hi s past work pe rformance and whe ther he had ever acted especially strang e, and the State asked no f urther que stions. 35 R R 1073. Doyle Thomas Dic kens After lunch, Panetti's first witness was Doyle Thomas Dickens, a corrections office r at Bell County Jail. 35 RR 1074-75. Right off the bat, Panetti revealed his lack of prepa ration in questioning Dickens: \"Sir, I didn't have any prepa red questions, so I'm just going to have to off the top of my head what's relevant to what's here today .\" 35 RR 1075. After Dickens testified that Panetti was classified as an \"aggressive\" prisoner, Panetti question ed that classifica tion: \"Do you reme mber any documentation at all or even just any jailhouse scuttlebutt about my striking, verba lly threa tening or harming another office r or another prisoner in any way?\" 35 RR 1078. Panetti also got Dickens to acknow ledge that Panetti display ed mood swing s, and that he had visited a psychiatrist while in jail. 35 RR 1078-79, 1081-82. After a lot of questions about jail conditions generally, and Panetti's experience s in particula r, Panetti asked: \"Well, could you tell the jury what you heard about my mental state? \" 35 RR 1082-84. Dickens replied: \"You' re very unstable.\" 35 RR 1084. Howeve r, Dickens denied Panetti's suggestion that he had received \"strang e treatment because of [his] mental afflictions.\" 35 -105-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 105 of 148RR 1085. The State cross-e xamined Dickens, first getting him to agree that mood swing s were common among jail prisoners. 35 RR 1086. Dickens further testified that Panetti seeme d to know right from wrong , but that he \"wa sn't really hip on rules.\" Id. Finally , he testified that Panetti w as classified as aggressive, in part, because of a \"conf rontation\" he had had with some Gille spie County ct, Panetti reiter ated his suggestion received unusual treatment from jail officia ls: [D]o you sort of feel that I was put in to the same classifica tion as priso ners who, indeed, had a record, not verba l, but a standing record of violence to other corrections office rs? Do you feel that because I was charged with what I was charged with, that I was sort of put into a slot and that there wasn't the record and, indeed, did you not mention that I did not aggressively or threa tened [sic] you or harm you or any other office rs and that to y our knowledg e ther e's no pa perw ork of that? gested his ative was re ligious per secution: Do you reme mber, sir, at the very near the end that you descr ibed I was handcuf fed with the cuffs and the leg irons and the weig ht belt? Do you reme mber any comments I made to you that they added extra chains for preaching the word of God or did y ou rea lize that ther e was additional chains put on me besides wha t the ones you just described? 35 RR 1090. Panetti closed by once a gain asking whether he had ever threa tened or struck a c orrections office r, and the State elec ted not to re-c ross Dicke ns. 35 RR 1090. Panetti's alleg ed unfair treatment while in jail, and his purported religious perse cution, were obviously matters of great emotional importanc e to him, thoug h they were of little leg al relevanc e -106-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 106 of 148to his case. The record is replete with Panetti's complaints about jail conditions generally, his perceived lack of adequa te medical care, and alleg ed discrimination by jail officia ls. The Court can only specula te why (or whether ) Panetti thought these matters were relevant to his guilt or innocenc e, but his comments at various points suggest he felt the jury had a right to know about the alleg ed unfair treatment he received at the hands of the governme nt. Whether he hoped this would win him sympathy , would explain his lack of trial prepa ration, or would se rve some other purpose entirely , is not clear. Howeve r, many prisoners wish to air befor e a jury their grieva nces with their respe ctive jail or prison systems, and the Court does not believe this (often understanda ble) desire is an indication of mental illness or incompete nce. Joe A nthony Me drano Panetti's next witness was Joe Anthony Medra no, a law enfor ceme nt office r in Temple who appar ently used to work at the Bell County Jail. 35 RR 1091. Panetti immediately launche d into53 his classifica tion as \"aggressive,\" asking : \"Did you have any records or see any records of why I was labeled 'aggressive prisoner' ?\" Id. When Medrano referred to Panetti's past Gillespie County corrections office rs, Panetti sug gested Medra no might have him c onfused with a differ ent inmate. 35 RR 1091-92. Panetti resumed this line of questioning after a long string of irrele vant questions: Did you hear of any instance I had with any specific jailer where I threa tened them or you said y ou hear d scuttlebutt that y ou hear d from another county that I got into an alterc ation, which is not for me to say truth or untruth, but the documents will Although Panetti referred to Medrano as both a \"corrections officer\" and \"reserves officer.\" 35 RR 1090-91. Nevertheless, Medrano appears to have worked at Bell County Jail at the times relevant to Panetti's questioning. -107-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 107 of 148show that? Did you hear anything about just flat rumor and then when you got to know who I was, that it sort of cha nged your mind about who I really was? 35 RR 1092-95. Reasonably , Medra no responde d: \"I don't understand what you're trying to tell me, trying to a sk me.\" 35 RR 1095. Finally , returning to familiar ground, Panetti asked his famous open-e nded question: \"[D]i d I have any bizarre ideas or did I make any statements or anything that comes to mind that y ou find unusual? \" 35 RR 1096. On cross-examination, the State, appar ently trying to establish Panetti's sanity, asked whether Panetti had bee n lucid during Medra no's conve rsations with him, and Medra no said he ha d been. 35 RR 1096-97. Standing somewhat in contrast to this statement, when Pane tti asked on redir ect why Panetti had given up \"all medicine, Medra no responde d: \"You mentioned something abou t evil spirits or something like that.\" 35 RR 1097. The State asked no further questions. 35 RR 1098. Thomas Raymond Pane tti Panetti's next witness was his brother, Thomas Raymond Panetti. 35 RR 1098-99. After establishing that Thomas had a criminal record for violent c rime, Panetti a sked Thomas to recount complaints that Panetti had made a bout his treatment in jail. 35 RR 1099. Later, Panetti referred back to Curtis Allerka mp's testimony , and got Thomas to reiter ate the conce pt of being restore d to sanity throug h God. 35 RR 1103; 34 RR 942-44. From this, P anetti moved smoothly throug h his reputa tion for mental illness, the issue of his chemica l depende ncy, and the existence of his Serg eant I ronhorse persona lity. 35 RR 1103-06. Then, in the guise of asking -108-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 108 of 148Thomas questions, Panetti testified about his assault charge from 1980: \"Tom, is it true that the details with the nurse and the hair was scuttlebutt and it was no felony and it was a misdemeanor and I did 15 day s in jail and never been in a ny trouble since? I s that a fa ct?\" 35 RR 1108. Panetti's next line of questioning is signific ant, because it potentially sheds light on why he asked pr evious witnesses about his nea r-death experienc es: Tom, what happene d to me when\u2014wha t chang ed in me when you saw the first\u2014not that I had to take a handful of pills or be on medicine, or what event in my life di d you think that\u2014and that goes way back to when we w ere kids. W hat do y ou think made me\u2014cha nged me signific antly , stands out in your mind that made me differ ent? 35 RR 1109. Thomas replied that Panetti had chang ed when he almost drowne d as a child. 35 RR 1109-10. Moving on, Thomas testified about Panetti's difficulties obtaining proper medication, both pre- and post-arr est, Panetti's unfair treatment while in jail, a nd Panetti's religious c onversion. 35 RR 1110-16. Then, P anetti asked a point ed question about hi s mental i llness: \"Tom, whe n is the first time that you realized that I had a mental disease and that I was doing some things that I didn't really have control of or when was the first time you realized that I did things that I didn't know what I was doing ?\" 35 RR 1116-17. Panetti took pains to separ ate the issue of his mental illness from the issue of his sobriety : \"Tom, do you reme mber a time when I had a pretty good stretch of sobriety and I was still having pr oblems, that I was doing things that\u2014\" 35 RR 1117. Appar ently taking full advanta ge of both his brother's cooper ation and the State's lack of objections, Panetti once again testified throug h Thomas: \"Tom, you're aware of I been arrested three times. Do y ou reme mber me ever saying that I couldn't afford to fight it and that I pled out, pled -109-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 109 of 148guilty?\" 35 RR 1118. Thomas replied: \"Well, I guess that's why you're here. It's been a m oney thing. Where you're at now, y eah, sa me thing. . . . Same story .\" Id. Thomas testified that Panetti had honored his first wife' s protec tive order , mentioned Panetti's treatment at a psychiatric hospital, and agreed that Panetti had used the money he received as a r esult of his g unshot wound to pay his ex -wife 's family and his bills. 35 R R 1119. Panetti then moved to more directly relevant m atters, first asking: \" Tom, can y ou descr ibe any talk we had about remorse or how I felt about what Sarge did?\" Id. Continui ng, Panetti testified in question form: \"Tom, when I called you up from the jail did I ever make the rema rk that Scott would have never went over there ? Did I ever make the rema rk that Scott fights a knife with a knife, if a knife ever foug ht? Did I ever make the r emar k that it was just impos sible for me, Scott, to do that crime? \" 35 RR 1119-20. On the issue of his self-representation, Panetti asked: \"Tom, did I ever make a statements [sic] to you that there ain't a team of experts in the world that can explain insanity , except someone who's been?\" 35 RR 1120. Then: \"Tom, have many times have you and Mom and the family and all people c onsidered ha ve tried to talk me out of de fending myself in this case?\" 35 RR 1121. Panetti's next exchange , which the Court briefly alluded to above, is of particula r signific ance to this case: \"Tom, did you ever see me or most recently not as I am now, asking coher ent questions, when I found out that I couldn't get evalua ted and I couldn't get an expert witness? Did you see me break down and panic? \" Id. Thomas's response : \"Any other time befor e it would have been a differ ent story , but now I have never seen you this well . . . for years, for years.\" Id. -110-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 110 of 148Shortly there after, Panetti emphasized his remorse : \"Tom, did I ever take on the guilty [sic] of what my families and y'all have went throug h to the point of where I was ready to destroy myself? \" 35 RR 1123. And: \"Do you reme mber me talking about my suicide attempts in Gillespie County Jail?\" 35 RR 1124. Finally : \"Tom, did I ever make a rema rk ever that when I got arrested, that I wanted to be a drunk cowboy and go to meet my death? Did I ever rema rk that I wanted to die, that I wanted to be specific ally reque st shot through the he art?\" Id. Once again testify ing thr ough his questions, P anetti later asked: Tom, in light of this whole situation have I spoke in disrespec t or that I\u2014my attitude with untruths and law enfor ceme nt of being just part of the way things are done? Tom, have I ever said that I have a deep love affair for the law as the law is written, and that when certain people go ahead and try to do things their way, that\u2014and break the law, that it cause s the problems, such as, Tom, did I ever tell you that my\u2014how I felt about the two y ears of appe al proc ess that I have w aited in jail for tria l? 35 RR 1125. on sever al levels: \"Yeah, you told me about that, and I want to answe r your last question, too. You got to slow up on your questions. I have been trying to he lp you, Brother [sic], but y ou got to slow up on them questions.\" Id. The State did not cross-e xamine Thomas Pane tti. 35 R R 1127. Throug hout his questioning of Thomas, Panetti w as able to, and did, testify without taking the witness stand. Further, Panetti could hardly have hoped for more helpful and cooper ative answe rs to his questions than those he received f rom his brother. Pane tti hit virtually ever y major theme of his case during his examination of Thomas, including: his mental illness and insanity ; his improper medication befor e and after the murders; his chemica l depende ncy and alcoholism; his miraculous return to sanity and mental health; his experience s; Sarge 01/31/12 Page 111 of 148representa tion; his unfair treatment by law enf orcement and cor rections officer s; his remorse ; and the illeg al conduc t by police in his case . Although Pane tti's questions g ive the strong impression he had a pretty good idea wha t he was doing, perha ps the most signific ant piece of evidenc e, for the purpo se of this case, was Thomas's st atement that he had not seen Panetti so coher ent in years. This reinforc es the Court's finding that, no matter how incoher ent Panetti may have been at other times, he was not incompetent to repre sent himself during his trial. Jacque line P. Maenius Panetti's next witness was his sister, Jacque line P. Maenius. 35 RR 1128-29. In summary , Panetti's questions to his sister cover ed the general issues of Panetti's disability pension; Panetti's willingness to give those funds Panetti's conce rn for difficulties mental states at va rious times; and Panetti's suicidal thoughts. 35 RR 1129-48.54 Later, Panetti moved to more novel areas, such as his past belief that the Devil was in his house and had to be exorcised from it, and his having had conver sations with animals. 35 RR 1148-49. Panetti conclude d with questions about Sarge Ironhorse . RR 1149-50. The State did not cross-e xamine Panetti's sister. 35 RR 1150. Russell Thomas Next, Panetti called Russell Thomas, a veter inarian who had worked briefly with Panetti As Panetti's questions covered topics already discussed, and were otherwise unremarkable, the Court does54 not recite them at length or in detail. -112-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 112 of 148approximately fiftee n years prior to the trial, and who attended the same churc h. 35 RR 1151-52. Although Panetti asked various broad questions, Thomas was unable to provide any relevant testimony , and the State did not cr oss-examine him. 35 RR 1152-55. Shelly Britton Panetti's final witness of the day was Shelly Britton, a former neighbor of Panetti and Sonja Alvara do. 35 RR 1155-57. Britton testified that she and her husband had seen Panetti in camouf lage at various times, which she took to mean Panetti was a hunting enthusiast. 35 RR 1157-58. Panetti asked: \"Oh, so you didn't think I was a paramilit ary Rambo or nothing, huh? \" 35 RR 1158. Panetti asked his usual question about his reputa tion in the community , which Britton repor ted as fairly negative. 35 RR 1158-59. Following up, Panetti asked: \"Shelly , when y ou did get to know me, did you feel scared of me?\" 35 RR 1160. Britton responde d: \"Until I got to know you, I did.\" Id. Later, Panetti got Britton to acknow ledge she knew Panetti sometimes went by the names \"Sarg e Ranaha n\" or \"Ironhorse .\" 35 RR 1162. The State asked no questions of Britton. Id. Jerry D. Anderson Panetti's trial resumed on September 19, 1995, with Panetti calling as a witness Jerry D. Ander son, an old hunting and riding friend. 36 RR 1178-79. Ander son either ha d no knowledg e of, or could not reme mber, many of the matters about which Panetti questioned him. 36 RR 1179-82. Eventually , Panetti asked: \"[J]ust honestly , did you think there was more wrong with Scott Panetti than just a drinking problem,\" and Ander son acknow ledged having had such suspicions. 36 RR 1182. Regarding six-year gap in their acqua intance, Panetti asked: \"From when you knew me in 1980 to when you saw me that night in 1986 was there anything differ ent about me? Did I seem -113-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 113 of 148like a differ ent person or did I chang e in any way or is there anything that sticks out in your mind that\u2014\" 36 RR 1184. Panetti's appar ent attempt to establish change may have responde very inder of Panetti's questions were unrema rkable and, for the most part, irrele vant. 36 RR 1184-85. The State de clined to cr oss-examine Anderson. 36 RR 1185. Lance Dwayne Bledsoe Panetti's next witness was Lance Dway ne Bledsoe, a corrections office r at Bell County Jail. 36 RR 1186. Panetti confirme d Bledsoe had not heard of any prior alterc ation betwee n Panetti and corrections office rs. 36 RR 1188. Bledsoe testified that Panetti chang ed for the better after he stopped taking his medication, and was alway s polite to the fema le corrections office rs. 36 RR 1190. The State did not cross- examine Bledsoe . 36 RR 1191. Curtis Allen Eck hardt Panetti's next witness was Curtis Allen Eckha rdt, a veter inarian who did work for Panetti's fathe r. 36 RR 1192-93. In response to Pane tti's que stioning, Eckha rdt testified that Panetti was a farrier, and had previously made a hoof pick for him. 36 RR 1194. Panetti asked about his reputa tion as a fa rrier, which Ec khardt de scribed a s \"good.\" 36 RR 1195. Panetti asked a familiar open-e nded question: \"[I]s there anything in your mind you would like to share with the Court about Scott Panetti that may have relevance to getting to know m e or how I acted in the communi ty?\" 36 RR 1195. The State a sked no questions. 36 RR 1196. -114-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 114 of 148Eugene Charles W aters Panetti's next witness was Eugene Charles Waters, a contra ct psychologi st for the Bell County Jail, who had spoken wit h Panetti while he was incarce rated. 36 RR 1198-99. With two notable exceptions, Panetti's questioning of Waters was unr emar kable, a nd primarily consisted of a walkth rough of Panetti's various medical visits while in jail, and his resulting chang es in medication. 36 RR 1199-1218. The first notable aspec t of Panetti's direc t examination was that he once again testified in the form of a question: \"Do y ou reme mber me ma king a rema rk or try ing to assure y ou that no matter what they said about me when I got to jail, that I'm nonviolent or that I wasn't going to hurt anybody or anything like that? Do you reme mber any rema rks that don't believe what they\u2014the repor ts they they [sic] said about m e?\" 36 RR 1204. Second, P anetti m ade an unus ual remark on the issue of subpoenas: \"Well, we subpoenae d Dr. Howell and I mean, I didn't want to go subpoe na cr azy and I turned the Pope loose and J.F.K. and I never subpoenae d them, but Jesus Christ, he didn't need a subpoena. H e's right he re with me, and we' ll get into that.\" 36 RR 1207. Although neither exception is of profound signific ance, the former demonstrates that Panetti was willing and able to take advantag e of his pro se status by effectively testify ing w ithout taking the stand; and the latter represents a substantial depar ture from Panetti's typical questioning style and substance. Daniel Patrick O' Neal Next, Panetti called Daniel Patrick O'Ne al, another veter inarian, whose Panetti appar inary service appar ently had employ ed. 36 RR -115-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 115 of 1481219. Panetti quickly became suspicious of O'Ne al, howeve r, when the latter testified he was forced to euthanize Panetti's dog because the dog had consumed marijuana and had become comatose. 36 RR 1220. I n response , Panetti said: Well, Doc, you're just flat blowing my cookies. In light of that situation of everything that has happene d, have you formed an opinion of me or a dislike or has it consolidated y our fe ar in\u2014or have you chang ed your ideas? In other wor ds, you didn't tell me nothing about, if\u2014and correct me\u2014about marijuana , dog being drunk, and we 're going to g et into this bi t right here and nip it in the bud, sir. 36 RR 1221. O'Neal maintained his opinion about the dog's cause of death, despite additional questioning by Panetti. 36 RR 1221-22. Panetti then asked whether O'Ne al reme mbere d Panetti dressing in military clothing (he had), whether he believed it was for hunting or for some other reason (hunting , or a war fanta sy), and whether he had ever heard Panetti refer to himself as Sarge or by a differ ent name (he had not). 36 RR 1222-23. Panetti's examination of O'Neal also featured an unusual, somewhat amusing, ex chang e. After O'Ne al expressed some displeasure at the night- time a nd early-morning braying of Panetti's mules back when they were neighbors, Panett i asked: \"Sir, you're a hostile witness,\" to which O'Ne al replied: \"No, I'm not a hostile witness. I just have an opinion that I would like to express.\" 36 RR 1223. Panetti r etorted: \"Did you ever hear me complaining about your dogs a'how ling and your chicke ns a'scooting? \" 36 RR 1224. O'Ne al shot ba ck: \"Never did. I didn't complain to you about your mule.\" Id. Neither Panetti, nor the State, asked any further questions of the witness. Id. -116-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 116 of 148Joanna Richte r After briefly considering calling himself, Panetti called Joanna \"Mag gie\" Richter, a fellow55 member of the Memorial Presby terian Church. 36 RR 1225-26. Panetti asked Richter to \"desc ribe Scott Pane tti in the churc h, Fredericksburg churc h, and anything [she kne w] anetti.\" 36 RR 1227. Later, he asked: \"[W]hen did you realize or did you ever think that I wasn't quite\u2014or that I might have had proble ms?\" 36 RR 1228. Appar ently at a loss for relevant questions, Panetti finally asked: \"Is there anything that could be helpful or unhelpful? Is there anything honest? \" 36 RR 1230. When Richter responde d that guy basica lly,\" and pe ople used would \" [g]et control of [him] self,\" Panetti seized on those words: \"Do you think sometimes that I wasn't in control of myself? \" Id. When Richter equivoca ted in her answe r, Panetti persisted: \"Did you ever hear anything on the order of I was doing things that I didn't know what I was doing?\" Id. Richter gave no definite reply , and the State elec ted not to cross-e xamine her . Id. Milton Curt is Bierschwale After a brie f recess, Panetti c alled Milton Curtis Bier schwa le, Pre sbyterian pa stor from Panetti's churc h, who had also visited Panetti in jail. 36 RR 1232, 1243-44. Although the first part of Panetti's examination contained little of signific ance to his trial, or to this case, the latter half was notew orthy for se veral reasons. First, in response to a question regarding what Bierschwa le reme mbere d about Panetti's attendanc e at church , Bierschwa le recounted an interesting encounte r he had had with Panetti: \"I \"By golly, I might call myself, but then again it's not time, but then again I might not.\" 36 RR 1225.55 -117-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed one morning . . . you were betwee n the two buildings sitting on a stump or a bench or something . . . . You said you almost killed a person that morning with a crossbow befor e you came to churc h, Sunday school.\" 36 RR 1236. Under standably , Panetti did not want this statement to go unexplained befor e the jury, so he commented on the incident, using his familiar testify ing-throug h- questions tactic: I don't know if I subpoenae d Mark [Cosper] or for a character witness, because that would really clear up the\u2014do you reme mber him and I talking about getting in arguments or anything . . . . We're dear friends, but we had a spat and he\u2014I don't reme mber if you reme mber any details. He held a shotgun on me, and I didn't have any guns, so I only had a bow and do you reme mber me saying that \"I'll drive an arrow up the barrel of your shotgun,\" or any details about that? . . . . . . It would have started like, \"When a man faces56 a shotgun with a bow, that even single shot obsolete slugs and buck are hard to beat,\" or any thing like that? 36 RR 1239-40. Then, immediately on the heels of that series of questions, Panetti asked a superb leading question: \"Sir, when is the first time you knew that I wasn't right?\" 36 RR 1240. He followed that up with a testimonial lea ding question about his purported persona lity chang e: \"Did you know me well enoug h befor e then to know what drastic chang e in me when I got burned then or you did y ou know me well enoug h befor e I got burned to know that there was a drastic chang e in my when I got that burn? \" 36 RR 1241. Later, when Bierschwa le made passing reference to having had \"strang e\" conver sations with Panetti answe r: \"About that word 'strang e,' sir, did y ou ever see me seem li ke I was a differ ent per son one day and the ne xt a diffe rent pe rson Given Bierschwale's answer to this question, \"No, I had some of your poems, but I'm not aware that you ever56 wrote anything about that,\" it appears this may reflect a transcription error, and Panetti may actually have said \"poem.\" 36 RR 1240. -118-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 118 of 148or cha nge from cowboy to commando or\u2014\" 36 RR 1242. Shortly there after, Panetti asked a question, presumably intended to help rebut his Rambo imag e: \"In all our visits, religious counseling is really secret, but do you reme mber me talking about wars or hurting children or\u2014\" 36 RR 1243. If that was Panetti's intention, howeve Bierschwa le's answe r was decide dly unhelpful: \"Well, you talked about having killed people and that you were going to chang e your life.\" Id. Panetti: \"In jail?\" Id. Bierschwa le: \"No, that was out in front of the churc h one morning , and y ou wer e rather hig h.\" Id. , Panetti asked: do you reme mber in the jail was I\u2014do you feel I was sincere ly remorse ful?\" 36 RR 1244. Again, Bierschwa le's answe r was probably not what Panetti was looking for: \"You never did exactly express it.\" Id. After a short Biblica l discussion, Panetti asked a direc t question, \"[D]i d you ever see Sar ge come out in jail or not,\" and he r eceived a dire ct answe r: \"No.\" 36 State cross- examine Bier schwa le. 36 RR 1250. Margaret Ann Bierschwa le. 36 RR 1252. Panetti tried, sever al times, to get Marg aret to talk about Sarge Ironhorse , but she proved no more helpful as a witness than her husband had been. 36 RR 1253-55. Nor did the State opt to cross-examine her. 36 RR 1255. Veronica Kee n \u2014 Recall Next, Panetti recalled his poet friend, Veronica \"Victor ia\" Keen. 36 RR 1256. After using her to introduce into evidenc e his book of poetry , Panetti asked her about his alleg ed alter ego -119-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 119 of 148(\"[T]ell what y ou know about Ironhorse .\"), but K een had little to say. 36 RR 1258. The State did not question Keen. Id. Trial Hearing After Keen was excused, the court asked Panetti to call his next witness, to which Panetti replied: Sir, I have been shuffling so many paper s and so much has been going on so fast that I'm a bit confuse d, and at the risk of taking [sic] off the jury, I think they're going to make a decision either way. I don't think they expect me to act like a smooth attorney , Your Honor . 36 RR 1259. The court then held a bench confe rence, at the conclusion of which the court excused the jury to lunch, and held a hear ing outside the jury's pre sence . 36 RR 1259-60. Panetti expl ained his re quest for the hear ing: I wanted to explain a few things about witnesses and subpoenas and reason and whatnot, but I find myself in my\u2014I don't have my paper s, Your Honor. . . . The paper s what you're going to guide me, and what I'm going to say to reque st proper ly reasons why I wish to ask for or recall certain witnesses, Your Honor. I felt I neede d to explai n it and then I hand you documentation such as children in question from differ ent marr iages\u2014some ar e victims and some ar e not\u2014and in my brief study of law of children victims, there is a proper proce dure and certain reasons and documentations I must show when I reque st the prese nce of children, whether they're victims or not, and I don't have the paper work right now to match up what I need to prese nt to y ou to adequa tely explain. 36 RR 1260-61. Panetti asked to call his daug hter, Amanda Alvara and, when Judge Ables asked why, Panetti replied: \"Well, I don't have the documentation, but it regards her being a victimless victim.\" 36 RR 1261. The court denied Panetti's reque st to call Amanda, noting \"she was three at the time of the incide nt.\" Id. Panetti objected to the c saying: -120-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 120 of 148[F]rom the evidenc e given to the jury shows a child in the law enfor ceme nt building who seems besides her top, unaff ected, and I heard throug h testimony , reliab le witnesses, who I could have questioned had we had this hearing earlier in the churc h that my daug hter did not see, that she was not affected, that she made reque st after reque st to see me, that she was used as a puppet and interrog ated to the point wher e she went into a speec h impediment. I'm very conce rned over my gringita being turned\u2014a lthough I feel the credibilit y of my former wife as a mother, but they're as adequa te or great, but in light of this situation, I have deep fear of the welfa re of my daug hter, and I think it would be adequa te or appropr iate for the jury, after explaining that this is an unaff ected child, for the jury to see, in fact, Your Honor, an unaff ected child. I do not wish to question her. I do not wish to int errogate. 36 RR 1262. Panetti further said that Amanda had been five at the time of the murders, but the court maintained its prior ruling . 36 RR 1262-63. Panetti also wished to call his fiftee n-year-old son, Chase Louis Panetti, for the purpose of57 showing that Panetti had been insane in 1986, but the court denied that reque st as well. 36 RR 1264-65. By way of explanation or objection, Panetti said: No, sir, he can testify that he would go bring me beers. He could testify whether or not he seen me beat his mom. He can testify as much as I could testify as lots of things, Your Honor, and him being a 14-year-old-boy , I do not think it would cause him to wet the bed at this point, to state the facts, if Dad was cuckoo in 1986 or if Dad\u2014if he ever witnessed his fathe r beating his mom or dad. \"Dad, why are you\"\u2014he made a rema rk to his mother maybe once t hat\u2014about comments I made or why is Dad doing certain bizarre acts, wher e I mentioned he asked me, \"Dad, why are you doing this? \" I said, \"I don't know.\" 36 RR 1265-66. Aga in, the court stood by its original r uling. 36 RR 1266. Finally , after the jury returne d, but befor e Panetti called his next witness, he introduced into evidenc e, without objection, re cords f rom Be ll Count y Jail. 36 RR 1272-73. As the Court quotes below, Panetti later referred to his son as having been fourteen years old at the time of57 the trial. 36 RR 1265. -121-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 121 of Panetti Panetti's next witness was his mother, Evonne Panetti. 36 RR 1274. Panetti asked his mother to testify about Sarge Ironhorse , which she did at some length. 36 RR 1276-78. Among other things, Panetti also: asked his mother about his having almost drowne d, 36 RR 1281-82; made a suggestion that the SWAT team commande r, who responded to the hostag e situation at the bunkhouse, had stolen his lighter , 36 RR 1284; implied he had been sexually abused by a baby sitter in his youth, 36 RR 1291-93; asked his mother about his electrical burn, 36 RR 1296-97; and asked about his strang e beha vior during his first marriag e, 36 RR 1298-1303, 1305, 1307. Later, Panetti and his mother had a potentially signific ant exchang e: Scott Panetti: You don't know what I'm doing, do you? You think I'm just head r unning, my self, don't y ou? Evonne Panetti: No, I don't. I think you're trying very hard to be profe ssional. Scott Panetti: I'm not profe ssional. I 'm not competent. Evonne Pane tti: But y ou're trying. Scott Panetti: And I was insane , and the doc ument\u2014 Evonne Pane tti: Yes, that's true . 36 RR 1312. Another important exchang e, which the Court has pr eviously mentioned, occur red slightly there after. In reference to the news cover age of his crime, Panetti asked his mother who he looked like during the broadc ast (presumably hoping she would say \"Sarg e Ironhorse \" or somethi ng simil ar), but she responde d: \"Oh, no, no, no, y ou are so much more\u2014y ou improved. I have ne ver seen you\u2014well, I take it back. Sometimes in Gillespie County jail when I would visit you there would be times when you looked halfwa y decent, but you are sounding better than you have in a long time now.\" 36 RR 1315. -122-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 122 of 148Panetti's final question was a lso telling: Is there anything the jury needs to know what, hasn't been said by Dad, in earlier testimony of other witnesses that has relevance , that has a meaning to whether I was or was not responsible for my actions, that I did not know right from wrong , not putting a label on it from a doctor of a mentality disease, or serious defect, but is there anything the Court\u2014that y ou would like to sa y befor e I pass y ou as my Mom witness with all apolog ies for my interrog ation? 36 RR 1319. The State did not Panetti. 36 1310. was Meridel Solomon Solbrig, who had occasionally represente d him as his attorney , including during his divorce from his first wife. 36 RR 1321-22. Panetti questioned Solbrig at great length, but, with the few exceptions discussed below, the examination was routine, and the matters they discussed were not novel, having been cover ed with prior witnesses. 36 RR 1322-58. The first notable part of Panetti's examination of Solbrig wa s that he used he r to introduce a fair amount of evidence, in one case over the State's objection. 36 RR 1332, 1334, 1337-38. Second, Panetti took advanta ge of his pro se status by (improper ly) using a discussion with the court about the introduction of evidenc e, in the prese nce of the jury, to attempt to impeach David Morquec ho: \"Your Honor, that David Morquec ho already testif ied and lied about his criminal record, and I couldn't prese nt it to the jury.\" 36 RR 1348. Finally , Panetti asked a question in which he expli citly attempted to link his mental illness, his alterna te persona lity, and his insanity defense: \"Mer idel, do you feel, because of my mental i llness and the serious m ental dis ease and all factors -123-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 123 of 148conce rned, tha t it's probably [sic] that I didn't know what I was doing, as Sarg e Ironhorse , as that persona lity?\" 36 And Panetti received a helpful answe r: \"The Scott Pane tti that I know would not, could not have done that.\" Id. The State's cross-e xamination of Solbrig was very brief, and not sig nificant to this case , as wa s ct. 36 RR 1356-58. Ernest Louis Betts Panetti's final witness of the day was an old friend of his, Ernest Louis Betts. 36 RR 1359-60. Although Panetti and Betts cover ed a varie ty topics, none were particula rly novel in light of Panetti's prior questioning , nor is the examination other wise espec ially signific ant to this case. 36 RR 1360-75. The State asked no que stions. 36 R R 1375. Procee dings Outside the Presenc e of the Jury Before the court recessed for t he day , Judge Ables had a discussion with Panetti about hi s other anticipated wit nesses, and in particula r the fact that one of Panetti's potential witnesses, Dr. Simes, would be unavailable for the rema inder of the trial. 36 RR 1375-76. Panetti objected, claiming he had confuse d doctors Simes and Selck, but the court never theless released Simes, as he was schedule d to underg o surg ery. 36 RR 1379-80. Panetti his objections, saying: \"I have an untrea ted thought disorder, sir, and I'll use it as excuse, sir, and I apolog ize, sir.\" 36 RR 1380. Shortly there after, Panetti explained why he wanted Simes to testify : \"I wish to have my few profe ssional doctors . . . that I think will have great weig ht to the jury on whether or not I was insane at the time.\" Id. Finally , Panetti asked if he could use \"prior documentation of Dr. Simes,\" and Judge Ables replied: \"I'm not going to make a ruling in advanc e, but he has testified at two -124-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 124 of 148competenc y hear ings unde r oath.\" 36 RR 1382. The next morning , befor e the jury was broug ht into the courtroom, Panetti told the court he was experiencing confusion: \"Your Honor, I'm having a little bit\u2014I 'm confuse d and I'm having a little bit of trouble, and I want to get this trial over with, sir, and I'm not throwing up a flag, but\u2014\" 37 RR 1394. Indeed, Panetti seeme d fairly unfocuse d during the morning hearing outside the prese nce of the jury . 37 RR 1392-96. The jury was brought in briefly , but, after Panetti tried calling Dr. Simes and another unavailable witness, he reque sted another hearing outside the prese nce of the jury, and the jury was conseque ntly excused. 37 RR 1396-97. Judge Ables expressed his frustra tion with Panetti: \"When you insisted on representing yourself, and I tried to talk you out of it, your attorney s tried to talk you out of it, the last thing I told you was I cannot\u2014the la w does not allow me to treat you differ ently from any body else who r epresents, who stands bef ore this bar .\" 37 RR 1397. Panetti referred again to his \"thought disorder,\" and reque sted a recess, which the court denied. 37 RR 1398-99. Panetti tried again: \"Sir, because of my mental illness and thought disorder\u2014I 'm not throwing up an excuse, but it's untrea ted. I know unmedicate d and I was very confuse d and I was told, sir, that I could have a few moments with these few expert veter inarians.\" 37 RR 1399. Without going into needle ss detail, Panetti and the court went back and forth for some time, with Panetti objecting that he was not able to call the witness es he desired, and the court instructing him to choose an available witness to call. 37 RR 1399-1403. The court then br ought the jury back into the c ourtroom and a sked Panetti to call his next wit ness. 37 RR 1403. -125-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 125 of 148Donald P. Langehennig After once again suggesting he might call himself, Panetti decide d to call as his next witness58 Donald P. Langehennig , a deputy sheriff with the Gillespie County Sheriff' s Depa rtment. 37 RR 1405-06. With the exception of questions about his two competenc y hearings, 37 RR 1413-15, 1416-17, Panetti's questioning of Langehennig was unrema rkabl e, and the State elected not to cross- examine the man. 37 RR 1406-18. Evonne Panetti \u2014 Recall Next, P anetti re called his mother to the stand. 37 RR 1419. Panetti had difficulty coming up with a question that was both specific and relevant, 37 RR 1420, but, after some additional proce dural problems, ultimately enter ed into evidenc e a picture of the bunkhouse, 37 RR 1421-23, as well as an affidavit, 37 RR 1427-28, and, without objection, a report by Dr. Simes, 37 RR 1429-30. The rema inder of Panetti's questioning of his mother was lengthy and rambling , but,59 being that it was mostly repetitive of his previous examination of her, not e specia lly noteworthy at this stage in the Court's discussion of Panetti's trial. 37 RR 1430-42. The State asked no questions. 37 RR 1442. At P anetti's re quest, the cour t then rec essed f or fifte en minutes.60 Scott Louis Panetti After the recess, Panetti elected to testify on his own behalf . 37 RR 1446-47. Panetti's Panetti: \"I might just call myself, sir.\" The you wish to call yourself, Mr. Panetti?\" Panetti: \"No,58 I wish to call Officer Langehennig.\" 37 RR 1405. Notably, Panetti indicated toward the end of his questioning that his \"thoughts [were] getting a little clearer.\" 59 37 RR 1441. This break, too, prominently featured Panetti objecting to the court that he was unable to call what witnesses60 he wanted to call, when he wanted to call them. 37 RR 1443-46. -126-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 126 of 148narrative can only fairly be descr ibed as semi-cohe rent, with Panetti rambling from topic to topic without appar ent regard for chronolog y or theme. Indeed, Panetti seems to have exercised his right to testify mostly for the pur pose of telling the jury selec t parts of his life story .61 Panetti began by recounting two of his near-death experience s, 37 RR 1447-48, then launche d into an explanation of his hairc ut and attire, his confusion about Dr. Simes, and moved from that to an appea l to the jury to carefully consider the documentar y evidenc e in the record. 37 RR 1449. Panetti then showed the jury a tattoo he got while he was in the Navy , and explained the story behind it. 37 RR 1450. From that, Panetti transitioned to when he lived with his parents in Tomahaw k, Wisconsin, descr ibing a horse they owned, their cabin, and his fathe r's various jobs. 37 RR 1451. Panetti testified about how he worke d with his fathe r, and how his fathe r's desire to return to farming broug ht Panetti's family to Poynette, W isconsin. 37 RR 1451-52. Panetti told the jury about t he work he and his fathe r did on the fa rm. 37 RR 1453. Panetti recalled how he received a camouf lage outfit for Christmas one year, and how at that time he idoliz ed cowboy s, sailors, and soldiers. Id. Panetti discussed bows and bow-hunting , then his school days. 37 RR 1454. After Panetti made an inappropria te comment about one of his In fact, after Panetti had gone on for some time about wholly irrelevant matters, the court interrupted him,61 saying: Mr. Panetti, let me stop you a second. Mr. Panetti, we need to get to the issues that are relevant to this jury about the guilt/innocence stage of this trial, and I'm not sure that with everything you're going into is relevant to the issues of whether or not you're guilty of the offense that you're charged with or whether or not it has anything to do with your issue of your affirmative defense of insanity that you have raised, so we don't need to hear all the details of your life story. 37 RR 1463. -127-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 127 of 148teachers, the c ourt admonished him to move on to something re levant. 37 RR 1454-55. The court's instruction went unheede d, howeve r, and Panetti proce eded to discuss two plays he had acted in, his overa ll school performanc e, and his high school football career. 37 RR 1455-56. Panetti then moved on to his first love, his first rodeo, his going to school to be an artificia l insemination technician, a nd his f irst experience s with drug s and alc ohol. 37 RR 1457-59. After that, Panetti told the jury about a palomino he used to own, his feelings about cowboy boots, and about selling his horse to buy a minibike. 37 RR 1460-61. The Court could go on: Panetti's testimony conti nued in this same fashion for some time, despite t he trial court's best efforts to redire ct him to areas of potential relevance to his case. For the sake of brevity , this Court will skip ahead in Panetti's testimony , to areas of potential relevance to this one. Unfortuna tely for the judge and jury in his case, Panetti continued telling various stories from his life until lunch, at which point the court e xcused the jury and addr essed Pane tti: Mr. Panetti, f or the last 35 minutes w e have been listening to Navy stories that I do not deem relevant. I am not going to let you ramble and tell the jury your life story . . . . I'm going to insist that you get to issues that you think this jury can use in making their deter mination of whether or not you're guilty or innocent of the charges against you. 37 RR 1478. P anetti's re ply was proba bly not what J udge Ables w as hoping for: Your Honor, with all due respe ct, I found my brief stint in the milit ary drama tic and I was moving right up to the incident [an alleg ed LSD overdose ], but to leave out that short duty station wher e I was trained as a combat medic\u2014I was not going to touch on anything classified that I did or didn't know to need to do my job, but in Pensacola , Florida , Your Honor , they went ahe ad and sent me to the hospital corps school, not on my reque st, but that comes back into\u2014 -128-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 128 of 148Id. Unsurprising ly, the court interrupted Panetti at this point, saying: \"I asked you what was it about your Navy experience s that are relevant, and you said, 'The LSD incident,' and I told you to go straig ht to the LSD incident and I would let you testify about it, and you refused to do it. . . . [I]f you get to rambling and telling stories, I 'm going to c ut you off a gain.\" 37 RR 1478-79. Proving that hope spring s eternal, when the jury was called back into the courtroom, Judge Ables said to Panetti: \"Mr. Panetti, I think wher e we were is that I had allowed you to go ahead and testify about what you descr ibed as an LSD overdose incident when you were in the Navy , so if you want to testify about that event, you need to go right to that event.\" 37 RR 1482. After a brief preamble, and some talking to himself, Panetti launche d back into his Navy to the 37 RR 1482-88. Panetti continu ed his narrative, discussing his first wife, his sever e electrical burn, his drinking , his brief stint as an extra in a movie, his commitments to (and escapes from) the State Hospital, and his fathe r's return to drinking after years of sobriety , befor e the State objected, asking63 that Panetti \"be instructed to talk something about guilt or innocenc e,\" which objection the court sustained. 37 RR 1488-1504. After sever al more objections, and some pauses while Panetti Panetti: \"I prayed I'm not going to have a flashback and\u2014\" 37 RR 1482. The court reporter added the note:62 \"At which time the Defendant talked out loud to himself.\" Id. The Court: \"Don't talk out loud, Mr. Panetti.\" Id. It is unclear whether this aside was the result of Panetti's mental illness, or mere theatrics. Even within the rambling narrative of his testimony, Panetti briefly lapsed into greater-than-normal63 incoherence during this discussion: \"Decade, fear of water in the Navy. Bulls scared me. Broncs, get on a bronc, but a bull is different. Maybe the Navy and water confront. I don't know. Maybe it's a macho thing. I don't know. I don't know, but\u2014don't know, and on a hay farm, and we took\u2014Don Nehr owned the Nehr ranch and Dad terrified me.\" 37 RR 1503. Again, whether this confused speech was genuine or feigned is a matter about which the Court can only speculate. -129-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 129 of 148appar ently examined his ring, he continued his testimony , but not on relev ant issues. 37 RR64 1504-07. Thankfully , Panetti then moved to potent ially relevant topics, testify ing about his time at various hospitals, his codeine and alcohol addictions, his lithium presc ription, and his hallucinations and insanity . 37 RR 1508-15. Gradually, howeve r, Panetti's narrative lost focus, and the court sustained the State's objec tion on releva ncy. 37 journey , Panetti . . . she got the new telephone. I would leave an answe ring machine and I started not just be the other persona lity. I\u2014he develope d a handle , Sarg Ironhorse , and I started using Ranaha n, and I had Ironhorse, but Sarge, and early I put in Sergeant Ranaha n Ironhorse , but the Sarge really came into. It wasn't hang ing back. It wasn't underly ing. It wasn't aslee p. It was\u2014wa sn't just a pen name. It scared me, and Sarge\u2014Sarg e\u2014excus e me, Your Honor. 37 RR 1524. After a lot more rambling by Panetti, and several further instructions by the court to move to relevant topics, Panetti finally began testify ing about the events leading up to the murders. 37 RR 1524-41. He told the jury how he boug ht a bottle of liquor, re turned to the bunkhouse, a nd drank until he fell aslee p. 37 RR 1541-42. P anetti continued: I wanted to go to sleep, but I didn't wake up, and that next morning , early in the morning , Sarge woke up and there was a mirror on the wall . . . and Sarge looked in the mirror and seen Scott and Scott was gone, but Sarge said, \"Scott, your hair,\" and that's when Sarge and Scott parte d ways, and I picked up them shear s . . . and I In the middle of a story about bounty hunting, the court interrupted Panetti, asking him how it was relevant. 64 37 RR 1507. Panetti replied, in part: \"This gets directly to when I ended up at Starlite Village Hospital. . . . [W]hat's relevant is that's the first time that I didn't know what I was doing or that first time\u2014and I hate using the 'I' word\u2014that I was insane.\" 37 RR 1508. This exchange shows that Panetti was aware of the relevant issues in his case, even if he refused to stick to them. -130-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 130 of 148clipped off my head and I didn't know why and then when I give myself a close clip, I grabbe d the ra zor.

Scott reme mbers about Sarge, what Sarg e did.\" 37 RR 1543. In a disturbing counter point to his earlier rambling life stories, Panetti then purpo rted to adopt the Sarge persona (\"Sar ge, I'm Sarge and I woke up. I'm Sarge and I woke up and I looked in that mirror.\" ), and proce eded to descr ibing \"Sarg e\"'s actions, but mostly from the viewpoint of \"Sarge,\" an entity separ ate from himself. 37 RR65 1544-46. After Panetti's chilling a ccount, the c ourt rec essed br iefly. 37 RR 1546. In concluding his testimony , Panetti referred to his fate if the jury acquitted him by reason of insanity , a subjec t he cove red of ten during the trial: Scott Louis Panetti w ill end his te stimony by saying you end up in\u2014I can't tell you what happens on a decision that the jury make [sic], but that if\u2014they 're tough. It's rough, and they can keep you, and this ain't no free bird situation that ever had anything to do with a ny of this. There just is no win win. There 's no win. There 's no victory . There 's the outcome is the outcome, and then there 's advanta ges and disadvantag es to any of them. Panetti's account was disturbing and, if accepted at face value, would raise substantial doubts about Panetti's65 sanity at the time of the murders. However, it is of relatively limited relevance to this case, for two reasons. First, no matter how incoherent Panetti's own testimony was, it was only a small portion of his overall trial performance. Second, and more important, it was potentially to Panetti's great benefit to appear as unstable as possible during his testimony, in light of his insanity defense. This latter point is emphasized by Panetti's apparent ability to move between in-court dialogue and his Sarge persona with ease: \"Just that\u2014to wind it up, Your Honor. Yeah, the demons were cackling at me and Scott went out the front and got in his Jeep and Sonja and Birdie jumped in the Jeep and I went to the bunkhouse and Sonja was in shock.\" 37 RR 1547. -131-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 131 of 14837 RR 1554-55. Shortly there after, Panetti made a statement about his mental state a t the time of the murders versus the time of trial, a statement also potentially relevant t o the issue of his future dang erousne ss: \"Because the Lord ain't g ot nothing to do with w hat Sarge did, a nd I'm not sa ying it was the Devil that got me, but I would say there was some demon spirits, and they did. They did cackle at me, a nd\u2014but that's all been de feated by the blood of the L amb . . . .\" Id. The State did not cross-e xamine Panetti. 37 RR 1556. The court then recessed for the day. 37 RR 1556-57. In this Court's estimation, Panetti's firsthand account of his murders did as much to convict him a s anything else in his case, with the possible e xception of Sonja A lvara do's testimony on the same subject. Howeve r, a bad decision is not the same as incompetenc e to conduct one's own defense by reason of mental illness. Further, it is not clear that the decision to take the stand in his own defense, standing alone, was a bad choice . Indeed, if Panetti's story was true, and he was insane at the time of the murders, but ne verthe less had a recollection of events, it seems nobody could possibly have been in a better position to both explain Panetti's state of mind, and also to rebut Sonja Alvara do's version of events. And, if the jury had believe d Panetti, it would have had little leg al choice but to acquit him. Finally , Panetti's comments in the record, some of which are quoted above, demonstrate he understood he had the right to, but did not have to, testify . That Panetti made a knowing choice that appea rs foolish in retrospe ct, or that he failed to persua de the jury, are not, in light of the entire record in this case, g rounds for a finding of incompete nce unde r Edwards . -132-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 132 of 148F. E. Seale September 21, 1995, the final day of the guilt-innocence portion of Panetti's trial, started with Panetti calling Dr. F. E. Seale, who had treated Panetti in 1986, while Panetti was at the Starlite Hospital. 38 RR 1567-68. Seale testified about Panetti's substance abuse and schizo phrenia , as well as his various medications. 38 RR 1568-74. After a discussion about Panetti's antipsy chotic medications, Panetti asked a signific ant question: \"[D]o you think that in that state without the antipsy chotics that I knew right from wrong ?\" 38 RR 1574. Seale replied: \"I don't think you do at times when you're psychotic.\" Id. Shortly there after, Panetti asked an even more pointed question: \"If I was to go sever al days without my antipsy chotics, do you think in your profe ssional opinion I could be insane? \" Id. Seale: \"Yes.\" Id. Panetti continued, asking , \"And being insane, do you think I could tell rig ht from wrong ,\" to which Sea le replied, \"Not at a ll tim es.\" 38 RR 1575. Panetti la ter asked a question that was probably improper, but w as definitely advanta geous to him: \"Doc tor, does there exist in knowledg e a maxi mum secur ity depar tment of Texas place State Hospital,\" befor State could object. 38 RR 1577-78. On cross-examination, the State confirme d that Seale had not treated Panetti since 1986, emphasized the differ ence betwee n the legal definitions of insanity and incompetenc e, and likewise differ entiated betwee n mental illness and insanity . 38 RR 1578-87. The State also used statements from Panetti's conf essions to try , with litt le success, to get Seale to a dmit that P anetti likely knew right from wrong at the time of the murde rs. 38 RR 1587-92. During his redire ct examination, Panetti tried to explain how he could be insane at the time -133-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 133 of 148of the murders, yet sane sever al hours later during the interrog ations: \"Being that I was insane without the medicine, as you descr ibed, that you would be without it, if you took that medicine and five or six hours later, could I be\u2014my psychosis be in control? \" 38 RR 1594. Seale ledged that confirme d with Seale, seve ral times, that he could be rende red insane by not taking his medic ation. 38 RR 1594-99. Wolfgang W . witness was ng W. a psychiatrist and psychother apist pre viously treated Panetti. 38 RR 1600-03. Panetti tried, wit h some succe ss, to get Selck to echo Dr. Seale' s opinions about Panetti's insanity . 38 RR 1603-06. Likewise, the State cross- examined Selck in much the same way it had Dr. Seale. 38 RR 1606-10. Except to emphasiz e Selck's Panetti was malinge ring, Panetti's redire ct examination was not particula rly novel or re marka ble. 38 RR 1610-16. Louis John Panetti \u2014 Recall Finally , Panetti recalled his fathe r, Louis John Panetti. Panetti's direc t examination was unrema , and the State elected not to cross-e xamine the witness. 38 RR 1624-29. The State and defense both rested and closed, and the court excused the jury until closing arguments that after noon. 38 RR 1629-31. Charge Conference Panetti made a general objection to the proposed jury charge, which was overr uled. 38 RR 1636-37. Notably , Panetti had standby counsel also revie w the charge, albeit briefly , and he found it unobjectionable based on his limit ed revie w. Id. After instructions about how closing argument -134-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 134 of 148would be conduc ted, the cour t recessed until the af ternoon. 38 RR 1637-39. Closing Argument The first topic Panetti cover ed during his closing statement was his own testimony : \"[Y]ou might wonder a little bit about when I testified, and Scott and Sarge and who talked and who talked about who and who talked about what in light of Dr . Simes not being he re, he did leave this letter and it will ex plain that . . . . I wish y ou not to mis take c harisma f or sanity .\" 38 RR 1645-46. Panetti then moved on to the issue of leg al insanity : I would just comment on the State giving you part of the enchilada , and I'll give you the re st. The eleme nts of this insanity defense are that the Defendant at the time of the conduct charged, as a result of mental disease or defect, did not know his conduct was right or wrong or was incapa ble\u2014this is the part you didn't hear from the State\u2014 was incapa ble of confor ming his conduct to the requirements of the law he alleg edly violated. That's Grand vs. the [sic] State . , the being c onduct. 38 RR 1646. Predictably , the State objected to Panetti's citation to a case outside the charge, and, equally predic tably , the court sustained the objection. 38 RR 1646-47. Panetti then briefly discussed anothe r of his hot-button issues, the leg ality of confe ssion. 38 RR 1647. Panetti continued: The evidenc e shows without reasonable doubt, as I prese nted it and profe ssionals and lay witnesses, that I was so sever ely impaired with mental defect and the mental afflictions, disea se, I couldn't reason and know right from wrong . This is no poker game. The re are no w inners and ma ny, many losers. 38 RR 1648. Later, Panetti appar ently reverted back to his persona , and, perha ps, added a third: I don't want to get into more scooter s and mare s that went to the kill or my broken heart for any situation, but to be capable of confor ming my conduct to the -135-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 135 of 148require ments of the law, that I, Sarge, violated, speaking of Scott Louis Panetti, but I have to depend on Will a bit to give me the eloquenc e, the confide nce to be convincing . . . . 38 RR 1649. As he had in his testimony , Panetti emphasized that he was no longe r insane or dang erous: The hell of insanity and having a mental disease is the lack of persona l understanding of not knowing what's happening to you. Now, I wish I could put a handle on everything, and I wish I could say that I will never be on that bridg e again, but I honestly can say this, that Sarge is on a leash, and he might have come out for a little while yesterda y, because Lord had him on a leash, but I don't think, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you felt threa tened, and I didn't see an office r standing betwee n me and y ou . . RR 1653. Somewhat later , returne d to the topic of his insanity , and the interplay betwee n his separ ate pe rsonalities: I didn't intentionally hurt anyone. Sarge, but when I tried to figure out Sarge and his motives, I probably don't know a whole lot much more about him as Scott Panetti or mediator Will than you do. I know it's bad medicine. I know without the medicine insanity will come back in sever al days, but you know when I found that out? When the doctor sa id it. 38 RR 1656. At the conc lusion of his arg ument, Panetti made a f inal appea l to the jury : I proved without a preponde rance of a doubt but I didn't know right from wrong and that I was insane, not lay experts or doctors, and in your hearts everybody knows. Do you honestly think any of you are going to go home after making a decision and second guess it? I think that without a hesitation y ou won't, and God bless Texas. Thy will be done. 38 RR 1663. The State delivere d its rebuttal argument, throug hout which Panetti made many speaking -136-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 136 of 148objections, and the jury was subsequently sent to delibera te. 38 RR 1663-84. The jury delibera ted for slightly under two hours befor e returning a guilty verdic t. 38 RR 1684-85. The court recessed the ca se until the following mor ning. 38 RR 1686. c. Punishme nt Phase Opening Stateme nts On Septemb er 22, 1995, after some preliminary matters, the parties made their opening statements i n the puni shment phase of Panetti's trial. 39 RR 8-23. Although the State's opening was very brief, 39 RR 16-17, Panetti's went on for some time. 39 RR 17-23. He twice addre ssed the issue of his future dang erousne ss, first saying, in pa rt, \"[S]incer ely in my heart I don't feel like I'm a threa t to anyone,\" 39 RR 18; and second, saying it more direc tly, \"I pose no future dang erousness to anyone, including myself, and even less and less if I was given a proper medication,\" 39 RR 22. Otherw ise, Panetti's opening statement was meandering and of little relevance to his punishm ent. 39 RR 17-23. State's Case-in-Chief Mel Gide on The State first called Mel Gideon, chief deputy with the Gillespie County Sheriff' s Offic e. 39 RR 23. Gideon testified that, while he was working at Gillespie County Jail, Panetti had threa tened him on \"many occasions.\" 39 RR 24. Most damning was Gideon's testimony that Panetti had thre atene d to \"kill [ Gideon] if he had ha lf a c hance .\" 39 RR 29. Panetti began cross-e xamination with a testify ing-via-que stion preamble: \"Mel Gideon, with a ll your years profe ssional la w enfor ceme nt training , I wish you to look me in the face and -137-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 137 of 148know that Offic er Tschirha rt can be called to state the facts contra dictory . Do you know the penalty for perjury in a case such as this? Of course you do.\" 39 RR 30. All of this was preface to the question: \"Can y ou briefly descr ibe when w e first met? \" Id. When Gideon re sponded, \"O h Lord, I really can't,\" Panetti shot back: \"The Lord ain't going to help you lie, sir. Just answer the questions.\" Id. The rema inder of Panetti's cross-e xamination continued in the same vein, with Panetti frequently imply ing, and occasionally outri ght saying, that Gideon was lying. 39 RR 30-39. Panetti's comments continued e ven af ter Gide on was e xcused. 39 RR 39. Jame s P. Grigson The State's second witness was Dr. James P. Grigson, a medical doctor who specia lized in psychiatry . 39 RR 42. By way of a lengthy and detailed hypothetical, Grigson effectively testified that Panetti \"certainly \" represente d a \"continuing threa t to society ,\" and \"that the likelihood of future violent acts would be ve ry great.\" 39 RR 45-49. On cross-e xamination, Panetti got Grigson to confirm that psychiatry is not an exact scienc e, and that the prese nce of the cante en at the scene seeme \"strang e.\" 39 RR 52-53. Grigson further that a person might become \"over tly psychotic\" if that person failed to take antipsy chotic medica tion for a pe riod of day s. 39 RR 54. On redire ct, the State emphasized the possibili ty of Panetti's future dang erousne ss to prison staff and other inm ates. 39 RR 60-61. On recr oss, Panetti broache d the subject of br ain damag e, and whether it could cause both mental illness and increased hostili ty. 39 RR 61. Grigson acknow ledged it could, and testified that medication could alleviate both mental illness and the -138-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 138 of 148symptoms of brain damag e. 39 RR 61-63. On redire ct, the State suggested Panetti did not have brain damag e, because it was not listed in his medical records, and Panetti responde d on recross by getting Grigson to agree that almost drowning could cause brain damag e. 39 RR 63. Although the State conducted a redire ct examination of Grigson, and Panetti recrossed, none of the testimony elicited wa s of par ticular nove lty in light of Gr igson' s previous comments. 39 RR 63-69. After Dr. Gr igson w as excused, the State r ested. 39 RR 69-70. Panetti's Case-in-Chief Scott Franklin Monroe Panetti's only witness was his standby counsel, Scott Fr anklin Monroe. 39 RR 71. On direc t, Monroe testified he was not a fraid of Panetti, a nd said that, althoug h he prese nt for the alterc ation betwee n Panetti and Deputy Gideon, he did not hea r Panetti thr eaten Gideon's life. 39 RR 73-74. On cross-examination, the State asked Monroe to recount the entire interac tion between Panetti and Deputy Gideon, which he did. 39 RR 75-78. Panetti and the State then closed and rested. 39 RR 79. Closing Argument After a brief charge confe rence, at which neither party objected, and a recess for lunch, the parties delivere d their closing statements. 39 RR 80-98. During his closing , Panetti stressed his potential value to socie ty, and his lack of dang erousne ss: [W]ith proper treatment and medication and mucking a lot of stalls, maybe I'll prove myself, because when I was on medici ne and I have the references, I 'm\u2014I believe I could be a benefit to society , and in my hear t, my hear t of hea rts, I don't think on -139-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 139 of 148a daily basis with my sobriety and all things considere d and the proper medicine I would ever hurt anybody , and I never intended to, but I take responsibility for Scott Panetti, and that includes no sca pegoats. 39 RR 86. Toward the e nd of his closing , Panetti reitera ted this point: The evidenc e, and this is wher e the hesitation and the doubt does come in and I think it may be to my favor , that I think there is some doubt in lot of y'all's\u2014ten, twelve, many of y'all that I won't hurt anybody again. I don't think that's been proved that I will hurt anybody ever again, and I won't. Now\u2014and given proper medication, that's a double w on't, and my sobriety . 39 RR 88. Ultimately , the jury answe red the specia l issues such that Panetti was sentenc ed to death. 39 RR 102; 40 R R 5-6. d. Conclusion \u2014 P anetti's Com petence Under Edwards As stated at the outset of this case, the Court finds Panetti was sufficie ntly competent to conduct his own defense. The Court recited Panetti's trial in fairly exhaustive, occasionally excruciating , detail to demonstrate that, althoug h Panetti obviously suffe red from mental illness, and was ofte n unfocuse d, he wa s never theless ac tively engaged in eve ry part of his trial. The recor d shows that Judge Ables, the ot her court staff, and even the State, went to great lengths to accommodate Panetti's inexperi ence and confusion, and that Panetti was meaning fully involved in every aspec t of the proce eding s. Indeed, Panetti took a more active role, and prese nted a more thoroug h defense, than most pro se litigants this Court has seen: he questioned potential jurors during voir dire; made delibera te decisions about which potential jurors to challeng e for cause or to strike; had extended discussions with the court about what witnesses to subpoena; made opening and closing statements; actively examined his own witnesses, and cross-e xamined the -140-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 140 of 148State's; impeache d witnesses, both with their own prior inconsistent statements, and with the testimony of other witnesses; objected to testimony , statements, and questions he felt were improper; and introduced evidenc e into the record. Finally , his statements befor e and during trial show he knew the issues relevant to both the State's case, and to his affirmative defense. In short, Panetti's conduct a t trial persua des the Court he w as able to \"ca rry out the basic tasks ne eded to pr esent his own def ense w ithout the help of counsel.\" Edwards , 554 U.S. at 175. Balance d against this, of course , was a great deal of irrele vant, sometimes incoher ent, conduct by Panetti. The Court acknowledg es, there were times when Panetti skirted the line of incompetence to represent himself, but these situations were brief and intermittent. More commonly, Panetti simply shifted quickly betwee n relevant and irrele vant matters, and subjected the court and jury to freque nt tang ents and a sides as he pr oceeded in his stream-of -consc iousness fashion. Panetti's manner and lack of overa ll strateg y certainly made him a poor advoca te for his defense, but the C ourt ca nnot conclude he was constitutionally incompetent to represent him self. As mentioned briefly above, this Court believes Panetti introduced enoug h evidenc e that the jury could have found in his favor, if it had been so inclined. P anetti's fa ilure to org anize evidenc e, to prese nt it in an effective manner , or simply to persua de the jury, hardly makes him unique among st litigants, pro se or otherw ise. Moreove r, the Court's considera tion of Panetti's performanc e must be made in the context of his pa rticular circumstances. As the Court has observe d, in light of the overw helming evidenc e of Panetti's factual guilt\u2014which included both eyewitness testimony from Sonja Alvarado, and Panetti's own confession\u2014his only reasonable hope for an acquittal was the legal defense of -141-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 141 of 148insanity . Given the reality of Panetti's situation, his decision to proce ed pro se, though it may have been desper ate, may not have been wholly unwise. Indeed, Panetti's self-r epresentation allowed him to show to the jury, in a manner and to an extent otherwis e impossible, evidenc e of his alleg ed insanity . Although it wa s ultimately unavailing , Panetti's strateg y may in fact have been his best66 option, under the c ircumstance s. The affidavits submitt ed by Panetti in support of his habea s petition do not chang e the Court's conclusion. See Am. Pet. [#17] , Exs. 7, 8, 10-17. To the extent these affidavits suggest Panetti was mentally ill, and that his mental illness affected both Panetti's performanc e at trial, and the jury's perception of him\u2014and many of them do so suggest \u2014the Court agrees. The record is reple te with examples of Panetti's loose associations, unfoc used narratives, and seeming lack of appre ciation for the potential impact of his conduc t on the jury . Howeve r, the rees that these defic in Panetti's performanc e equate to his constitutional incompetenc y to represent himself. Many people without mental illness are poor public speake rs, and would make atroc ious advoca tes. L ikewise, the Court suspec ts it would be a rare mental illness that would have no effect whatsoeve r on one's advoca cy, and would go unnoticed by a jury, over the course of a two week trial. Howeve r, Edwards does not authorize trial courts to unilatera lly appoint counsel for every person with a mental illness, nor eve n for e very person with a severe mental illness. Instead, a person' s constitutional right to self-r epresentation may be As this Court has noted, both in this opinion and in the past, there are substantial questions about the degree66 and sincerity of Panetti's delusions and other mental health problems, especially his alleged multiple personalities. See, e.g., Panetti v. Quarterman, No. 2008). 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 142 of 148overr ided by the trial judge only when that person is incompetent, by reason of sever e mental illness, to carry out the basic tasks require d to prese nt a defense on his or her own behalf . That was simply not the situation in P anetti's ca se, despite his poor pe rformance . Although the Fifth Circui t does not appea r to have meaning fully addre ssed the standard required by Edwards , the Court's conclusion in this case is supported by precedent from other Circuits. First, the Court considers a pair of cases from the Ninth Circuit, United States v. Ferguson , 560 F.3d 1060 ( 9th Cir. 2009), and United States v. Thompson , 587 F.3d 1165 (9th Cir. 2009). I n Ferguson , the Ninth Circuit rema nded the potential Edwards issue to the district court, but made some instructive observa tions along the way. 560 F.3d at 1066-70. In particula r, the Ferguson court said there were \"many indications in the record that Edwards might apply ,\" including the following examples of Fe rguson's \"de cidedly bizarre\" behavior : He repeatedly demande d that his counsel follow his six made -up \"duties\" and fired his lawy ers when they were unable to meet those \"duties.\" He repeatedly insisted that he was making only a \"spec ial appea rance,\" asked to settle the case \"in the private,\" reque sted the judge to recognize the \"public policy \" exception in the UCC and dismiss the case \"for value,\" and attempted to file a motion of \"dishonor\" against his lawy ers. Finally , Defendant' s behavior at trial and sentenc ing gives us pause, as it did the district court. At trial, Defendant did absolutely nothing\u2014no voir dire questions for the judge to ask, no opening argument, no closing argument, no objections, no cross-e xamination, no evidenc e, and no witnesses. At sentenc ing, he submitt ed three nonsensical motions, did not object to the PSR, and did not make any legal arguments. Id. at 1068-69. As noted above, althoug h Panetti's behavior at trial could sometime s be described as \"decidedly bizarre,\" he was aware of, prese nted evidenc e on, and otherwise pursued, a valid legal -143-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 143 of 148defense to his crime. Indeed, Panetti's case more resembles Thompson , in which the Ninth Circuit refused to rema nd the case in light of Edwards . 587 F.3d at 1173. In so deciding , the Ninth Circuit noted that Thompson, like Panetti, \" engaged in lengthy colloquies with the district c ourt in which he see med acute ly aware of what was occur ring,\" and \"participated extensively throug hout Simi larly, the Eighth Circuit's decision United States v. Turner , 644 F.3d 713, 725-26 (8th Cir. 2011), is in accord with this Court's conclusion. In Turner , the court held the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing sua sponte to order a competenc y hearing, after observing the pro se defendant's \"bizarre and irrational\" courtroom conduct. Id. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted Turner \"was polite and respe ctful at all times,\" and participa ted in his trial in meaning ful ways: \"He invoked the rule on witnesses leaving the courtroom, used cross-e xamination to his benef it, and tried on sever al occasions to appea l to the jurors' conscie nces in an attempt for them to 'forgive' him by finding him not guilty.\" Id. at 726. The Eighth Circuit deferred to the district court's judgme nt, and noted \" the evidenc e does not ra ise doubts sufficient to find an a buse of discr etion.\" Id. Although Turner is obviously distinguishable in that this Court cannot defer to any finding by the trial court, it is notable that the Eighth Circuit focuse d on Turner 's active, if ineffe ctual, involvement in his case\u2014a level of involveme nt display ed by Panetti in his t rial. The Court's conclusion in this case finds further support in an unpublished opinion from the Second Circuit, United States v. VanHoese n, No. 10-0713-CR, 2011 WL 6117294 (2d Cir. 2011) (unpublished). In VanHoese n, the Second Circuit affirmed the defendant's conviction, and rejected -144-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 144 of 148his Edwards argument, saying there was \"ample support\" in the record for the district court's conclusion that he was competent to represent himself. 2011 WL 6117294 at *3, 1-3. In particula r, the Second Circuit noted \"VanHoese n's written submissi ons to the district court demonstrating his active interest in his own defense, and his testimony and response s to court inquiries indicating that he had performed his own l egal research and had a detailed understanding of how a trial works.\" Id. at *3. Like VanHoe sen, Panetti clearly had an active interest in his own defense; and, althoug h Panetti may not have been an expert on trial proce dure, the record shows he had a meaning ful understanding of the proce eding s\u2014an understanding that was augmented by Judge Ables's frequent (and pa tient) assistance . A final interesting case comes from the Seventh Circuit. In United States v. Berry , 565 F.3d 385, 390-92 (7th Cir. 2009), the court affirmed a defendant's conviction in the face of his Edwards challeng e. Judge Eva ns descr ibed the def endant' s trial conduct a s follows: To be sure, Berry consistently behave d in a bizarre manner . Beginning with a slew of pro se motions filed in 2004, Berry made statements that we can only generously call absurd. (Berry was represente d by three differ ent lawy ers from 2004 to 2006, but the vast majority of motions he filed were pro se.) He said he met with Condoleezz a Rice at the Whit e House; that Citibank robbed him of $420 milli on (perhaps this is not as far-fetched as it seems given the situation in the spring of 2009!); that he was in the proce ss of \"[n]egotiat [ing] to reduc e [o]il price s and create milli ons of jobs in Americ a\"; that he drafted an international treaty; that two banker s (former associate s) were killed after working with him, and his own life was in dang er due to some sort of global financ ial conspirac y; that he was business partne rs with the \"contr oller of the space station\"; that he represente d the governme nts of China, Russia, and Taiwa n, and had met with financ e minist ers all over the word; and that Bill Clinton and Boris Ye ltsin had personally made pr omises to him. . . . . The trial lasted five days befor e the jury found him guilty as charged. Thoug h -145-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 145 of 148his strateg y failed, Berry aimed throug hout the trial to convince the jury that he was indeed a mover and shaker in global financ e. And to the extent his own view of things conflicted with the testimony of prosec ution witnesses-e xperts and otherwise- he chalke their relative ignor ance (in compar ison to his own sophistication) of f inancial. Berry , 565 F.3d a t 387, 389. The court ultimately concluded Edwards was inapplicable because there was no evidenc e Berry suffe red from mental illness, thus making the case legally inapposite here. Id. at 391-92. Howeve r, the c ase is neve rtheless instructive f or its evaluation of B erry's per formanc e: As far as pro se defenses go, it wasn't the worst we've seen. Berry manag ed to lodge object ions, cross-e xamine witnesses, call a witness of his own, and make opening and closing statements. He didn't call himself as a witness, but by choosing to represent himself he was effectively able to testify throug hout the trial without facing cross-examination. But to say that it wasn't an unmitigated disaster for a pro se defense isn't saying much. Berr y's decision to ride solo was clearly a poor one. At best, his performanc e serve d as a distraction from the governme nt's case, doing little (if any thing) to undermine it. Id. at 389. Panetti's performanc e here could be descr ibed simil arly. Panetti performed better than many pro se litigants this Court has observe d, and it seems he may have performed better than Berry; never theless, Panetti's decision to represent himself was obviously unwise, and his defense unpersua sive. But the Constit ution does not allow a trial judge to ignor e a defendant's right to self- representa tion just because it is a mistake to exercise it; nor, despite his mental illness, was Panetti constitutionally incompetent to conduc t his own defense . Conclusion For the fore going r easons, the Court f inds Panetti is not entitled to ha beas relief . First, the -146-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 146 of 148Court finds the Edwards rule does not apply retroa ctively to Panetti's case, under the principles announce d by the Supreme Court in Teague v. Lane . In the alterna tive, the Court finds Panetti was not incompetent to repr esent himself, unde r the standa rds ar ticulated in Indiana v. Edwards . An appea l may not be taken to the court of appea ls from a final order in a proce eding under \u00a7 2254 \"unless a circuit justic e or judge issues of appea lability .\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (1)(A). Pursuant to Rule 11 of al Rules Gover ning Section 2254 Procee dings, effective December 1, 2009, the district court must issue or deny a certificate of appea lability when it enters a f inal order adver se to the applica nt. A certificate of appea lability may issue only if a movant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2). The Supreme Court fully explained the require ment associate d with a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional rig ht\" in Slack v. McD aniel , 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). In cases wher e a district court rejects a movant's constitutional c laims on the merits, \"the pe titioner must demonstrate that re asonable jurists would find the district c ourt's assessment of the constitutional c laims de batable or wrong .\" Id. \"When a district court denies a habea s petition on proce dural grounds without reaching the petitioner's underly ing constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the petitioner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debata ble whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its proce dural ruling .\" Id. A certificate of appea lability shall issue in this case. The Court finds that reasonable jurists could di ffer about both the retroactive application of the Edwards rule, an d the ultimate merits of -147-Case 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 147 of 148Panetti's Edwards claim. The Edwards rule is a significant one , with substantial implications for the actual and appare nt fairne ss of trials for mentally ill defendants. The Co urt's conclusion, that the Edwards rule is not retroa ctive under Teague , is based in large part on the fact that the Supreme Court ha s been so unwilling to recognize e xceptions to nonr etroa ctivity . Further, a s the Court has stated on multipl e occasions, Panetti's mental illness had an impact on the quality of his self- representa tion. Although the Court conclude s the impact was insufficient to rende r him incompetent under Edwards , the issue i s by no means one-sided, par ticularly in the absenc e of a clear standar d for deter mining competenc e to represent oneself. Although these conclusions represent the considere d judgme nt of this Court, Panetti's claims are meritorious enoug h that they should be heard by another one, which mig ht decide the se issues diffe rently . According ly, IT IS ORDERED that Respondent Rick Thaler 's Motion for Summary Judgment [#22] is GRANTED; IT IS FURTHE R ORDERED that Petitioner Scott Louis Panetti's Amended Petition for Writ of Habe as Corpus [#17] is DENI ED; IT IS FINAL LY ORDERED that a c ertifica te of a ppeala bility is GRANTED. SIGNED this the 31 day of January 2012. st ____________________________________ SAM SP ARKS UNITED STATES DI STRI 1:09-cv-00774-SS Document 45 Filed 01/31/12 Page 148 of 148 "}
