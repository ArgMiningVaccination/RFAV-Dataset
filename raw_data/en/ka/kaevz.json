Helping couples communicate about reproductive health is viewed as vital for involvement of both the partners in decision making, treatment seeking and promoting health. It is hence crucial to understand 'communication' among married partners before designin g any couple-targeted strategies. Communication is a process which involves more than sendin g and receiving messages. For comprehensive understanding of communication, it is import ant to consider various components of communication such as the relationship between part ners, the context, the mode or channel, consequence in terms of behaviour and the content. The p resent study focuses on couple communication in reproductive health among married cou ples in rural Pune, India, emphasizing on learning the entire 'process' of communication. Chapter 1 introduces the study subject in the context of communic ation and its theories, couple communication studied in various subjects of healt h, couple communication in relation to reproductive health in India and elsewhere, the repro ductive health programme in India and trends in male involvement. It further states the gaps in the existing research and mentions the study aim and objectives. In India, the family is the most important institution that has survived through the ages. India, like most other less industrialized, traditional, easter n societies is a collectivist society and collectivism is reflected in greater readiness to cooperate with family members and extended kin on decisions affecting most aspects of life, including career choice, mate selection, and marriage. Families adhere to a patriarchal ideology an d endorse traditional gender role preferences. Traditionally, emotional ties between spou ses are considered a potential threat to the solidarity of the patrilineal group and hence the re is a tendency to limit communication between spouses. Traditions and values guide couples' rep roductive health behavior in such a way that most of the related issues are assigned to the women's domain. In other words, the family and kinship network, traditions, cultural norms an d gender-power relations influence young couples' reproductive health communication and beh avior. On the other hand, like elsewhere, the reproductive health programme in India , certainly intends to enhance male involvement in reproductive health. Most of the existing literature around couple communica tion in India as well as in other developing countries has focused on components of repro ductive health, mostly contraceptive iv behaviour, sexuality or high-risk sexual behaviour. Also, there are numerous studies about determinants of couple communication in terms of gende r-power relations, or family network. However, there is hardly any literature focusing on coupl e communication in rural married couples, with a comprehensive understanding of the detai ls of the process of communication. Further, in the seemingly traditional society as that of India, where couples do not marry by choice and are influenced by kinship and family network; reproductive health is mainly considered as an exclusive 'women's domain' and there are efforts to improve male involvement in reproductive health; non-existence of such a study fur ther widens the gap in body of literature. Present study aims To learn about process of reproductive health relat ed communication among young married rural couples- Scope of reproductive health in this study is restricted t o the most common events in the span of reproductive life , which are- fertility, planning parenthood, childbirth, sexual relations. The study does not include other issues such as abortion, infertility, Sexually Transmitted Infections or HIV. There are four specific objectives- 1. To explore communication and behavior of rural ma rried couples in relation to fertility during reproductive life span 2. To learn communication of married couples about thei r sexual relationship in relation to gender stereotypes 3. To understand communication and behavior of rural ma rried couples around childbirth against the backdrop of traditions 4. To analyze the narrations of the husband and wife a bout the wife's reproductive health problems Chapter 2 describes the study setting, population, tools of data co llection, sampling details and limitations of the study. The study was conducted in a rural set up on the outskirts of Pune city, in Western Maharashtra, India. It was a community b ased qualitative and exploratory research conducted between 2006 and 2008. The study a rea is one of the fastest developing tehsils of Pune District, surrounded by Western Ghats and the Pune-Mumbai Express Way cuts through the Tehsil. Reproductive health services are de livered to the community mainly through public sector having grass root health workers to improve the outreach. In spite of the development that has taken place in this Tehsil, due to urbanization especially around the Expressway; the area still represents a rural set up of W estern Maharashtra dominated by a kinship-oriented, Maratha caste, agrarian community. Mo st of the families are either joint or v extended. It is a patriarchal society, where families a re mostly headed by men. However, issues related to reproductive health are mostly women's dom ain. The study involved a preparatory phase during which Key I nformants from formal and informal sectors were interviewed in-depth to learn about tradit ions and norms related to couple communication and behavior. The main phase of the study involved in-depth interviews of 35 married couples selected with the help of the Village Health Functionaries. The sample selection for the couples was based on an inclusion criterion of ha ving undergone sterilization, not more than a year at the time of the interview, with a purp ose to cover different events on the reproductive life span. The study tool for interviewing the married couples was a Visually Assisted Interview guide, which consisted of hand-drawn ill ustrations of day-to-day life scenarios. Husband and wife were interviewed simultaneou sly and separately (with assistance from a male researcher) to avoid sharing of information . Mostly the interviews were completed in one session, though more visits were paid to approach and plan the interview. Data was thematically analyzed around themes such as- methodologica l issues, traditions regarding childbearing, male involvement in reproductive health, gender stereotypes related to sexuality and the concept of planning parenthood. Also process of communication was analyzed in terms of place, type and form, duration, content and barrier s for communication and about differential narrations by husband and wife. There are in all five research papers developed in this st udy based on the dataset of 35 married couples focusing on methodological aspects of the study an d different issues of couple communication. These research papers are included here a s different chapters from Chapter 3 to Chapter7. Chapter 3 is based on the methodological approach of the study a nd deals with the process of construction of the Visually Assisted Interview Guide and its validation at field level. It covers the literature around qualitative and quantitative tools of data collection used in various reproductive health researches and emphasizes the need to have interactive and friendly tool for eliciting sensitive and personal information from ma rried couples. The paper then describes the multilayered process of construction of the tool an d stresses that visuals in the tool should ensure value addition to the generally used in-depth interview guide. The next section in the paper includes validation of the tool in the field an d highlights the advantages and limitations of the tool. As the researcher used hand-drawn illustrat ions for interviewing married couples in this study, it was thought important to write about the en tire process of construction and validation of vi this tool, especially in the context of studying 'behind cl ose doors' subjects among married couples from a rural set up. Chapter 4 attempts to explore couple communication and behavior of rural married couples about fertility and planning parenthood. This paper drives us through various stages on the reproductive life span, where couples discuss fertility and plan their family. Couples seem to start discussing about planning family only after the birt h of the first child, due to obvious pressure for proving fertility and the negative values at tached to infertility. Opting induced abortion is also considered as an option for planning f amily, though elder women have mostly opposed these decisions. There are important players who initiate couple communication in this subject such local health provider; as well as those who i nfluence the decisions about fertility, such as the elder women in the family, especially the moth er-in-law. Men in the study have generally preferred to have a small family and have discuss ed this with their wives, however, due to family pressure their intentions did not always g et translated into behavior. The paper emphasizes on men being interested in discussion and decisio n making in fertility but family network, elder women in the family acting as gatekeeper s for fertility related decisions. This paper recommends strategies to involve the family in or der to create favorable environment for young couples to decide and implement their own ferti lity desires. Chapter 5 focuses on married couples' communication and behavior ab out their sexual relations and attempts to analyze the same against the gender based stereotypes of sexuality. Responses of men and women about initiation and decisio n-making in sex and sexual abstinence for various reasons are studied. The paper reveals that women do take part in the discussion and decision-making in sex and express their sexual desires though they are not the active partners in sex. Women have narrated about mutual ly decided sexual encounters as well as non-consensual sex, on which men have different opi nion. However, non-consensual sex is differentiated from 'forced sex' and the paper confirms the need to learn these nuisances of sexual experiences before labeling them as 'forced' or no n-consensual sex'. It is an important finding that sexual abstinence initiated by women for religious reasons, is mostly respected by men. The paper thus suggests a beginning of process of ch ange in sexual communication and behavior, where women were stereotypically expected to be passive partners in sex and not allowed to express themselves. Women's ability to express a nd negotiate sex is commonly vii considered as an indicator of autonomy having implication s on her reproductive health and hence the study findings should be appreciated as positi ve steps in this direction. Chapter 6 explores the change and continuity of couples' communi cation and behavior in childbearing against the backdrop of traditions. The pa per focuses on traditional practices in this subject based the data from Key informants and attempts t o plot the current practices of married couples against the backdrop of these traditions. The pap er points towards differential pattern ranging from adherence to and departure from the tra ditions in various issues of childbearing. Traditionally, couples are rarely encouraged to discuss chil dbearing issues and mostly family members are the decision-makers. Women in the study, contr ary to the traditional notions went for medical confirmation of pregnancy and sought ante natal care. Couples showed departure from traditional practices and communicated about certai n issues of childbearing such as antenatal care; whereas there was limited couple communi cation in other issues as place of delivery and issues around birth of the child. Traditions and influence of family network seemed to play differential roles in affecting couple communi cation and behavior around various issues of childbearing. However, generally, men's non-farm or non-traditional occupation was more associated with couples' departure from traditional pract ices of communication and behavior. The paper concludes that couples struggle between followi ng traditions and adapting change in relation to various issue of childbearing. It recommends that reproductive health programme should design strategies, depending on the differential role family and traditions play in different areas of childbearing and appreciate and encourage the existing involvement of men. Chapter 7 analyzes differential narrations of husband and wife about wife' reproductive health problems. Communication between husband and wife is an important determinant in reproductive health of the couple as it reduces risk of u nintended pregnancies, acquiring sexually transmitted infections and does influences health seeking behavior in case of reproductive health problems. Hence, it is crucial to lea rn about reproductive health problems in women from the perspective of husband and wife, especi ally in a society, where open communication between married partners around reprodu ctive health is limited. The results show that almost half of the women experienced reprod uctive health problems such as complications during pregnancy or delivery, side effects o r infections due to contraceptive usage or symptoms suggestive of Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI ). Husbands and wives narrated discrepantly about wives' problem during pregnancy and men hardly talked about the delivery viii complications that their wives had. Further, there was d iscrepancy in the narration about side effects due to use of contraceptive methods and almost no ne of them mentioned about any symptoms suggestive of RTIs, experienced by their wives. The paper attempts to analyze the reasons of discrepancy by using the communication model by F riedemann and suggests two pathways of malfunctioning communication-first between the woman and her husband and the second between the husband and the researcher, both as a result of either individual or collective norms. The paper suggests that synthesis of diffe rential narrations is essential for arriving at strategies to improve couple communicatio n or partner notification. Chapter 8 discusses overall findings of this research across the five d ifferent papers. The research findings are then discussed in the Indian conte xt, generally confirming the changing trend that young couples are being more supportive and co ncerned about each other's health desires and goals. However, one should not forget that this is only the beginning of change and young couples have a long way to go in order to achieve t he same. It needs to be appreciated that the pace of this process of change will differ in different parts of the country depending upon socio-demographic, political situations and health programmes in various populations. Hence, projections based on one such research may not be applicable for the entire rural population of India. The importance of community base d studies should not be underestimated though, to learn the specifics in different contexts. The study findings are also compared with similar other settings in the world, where gender-powe r relations, family network, culture and societal norms play an influential role for young couple s. This exploratory qualitative study represents a rural, ki nship-oriented, agrarian society of Western Maharashtra, where family and traditions play a crucial role in couples' married life, from arranging marriage to decision-making in all the life events. Though the couples in the study communicate about reproductive health issues, they ar e not always able to translate communication into behavior change, in their compulsion to respect family, traditions and culture. The study projects that for young married couple s from rural society, it may be challenging to follow traditions and yet adapt to chan ge. It, therefore, becomes important to understand the entire process of social change, particula rly in the area of reproductive health. Couple communication may have a cascading effect on larger health and social issues like family health, sexual and domestic violence and healthy ma rital relationship and thus should be understood in any given society. However, unless the existing couple communication is stu died as a 'process', efforts to improve the same may not be co nstructive enough. ix The study suggests some further research such as learning effects of existing health programmes on couple communication, determinants of co uple communication and translation of communication into behavior change. Within its limited scope, the study definitely has some imp lications for the local health programme. The present study findings can provide some lea ds in designing concrete initiatives and strategies for young married couples- for example, preparing counseling material around sexual abstinence method for various reasons. The study reco mmends that existing involvement of men in reproductive health, for example men accompanying wives during antenatal care, should not only be welcome by the progr amme and but further utilized as opportunities to build their skills in communication and motivate them to be more supportive towards their wife to have a share in decision-making. L astly, the study emphasizes on the fact that couples though empowered to communicate with each other about reproductive health, are not necessarily able to implement the same. Hence, it r ecommends that tailoring locally suitable strategies focusing on the young couples, without ignor ing their family, may work better to achieve their 'targets'. The study tool for interviewing married couples- the Vis ually Assisted Interview Guide- is enclosed as an Annex at the end of this thesis. x Tables and figures Tables Table 5.1 Socio-demographic characteristics of married coup les Table 6.1 Socio-demographic and childbearing related characteristics of couples Table 6.2 Profile of the key informants Figures Figure 2.1 Maps of India, Maharashtra and Pune Figure 2.2 Primary Health Centre Figure 2.3 A farmer with his buffaloes Figure 2.4 A woman on her way to the river for washin g clothes Figure 2.5 Examples of picture cards used as a part of VAI G Figure 2.6 Husband meeting his wife during post partu m Figure 2.7 Husband and wife working on the farm Figure 2.8 Husband wanting to have sex Figure 3.1 Husband-wife on the farm Figure 3.2.

It is more than a decade- since the International Conference on Populat ion and Development (ICPD, 1994) - that there has been a clear emphasis on empower ing couples to decide about their own reproductive health related issues. Communicat ion being the essential foundation for decision-making, couples should be able to communicate with each other about their sexual needs, be informed about their rep roductive health and make independent choices about family planning. More import antly, they should be motivated and supported to implement their own desires and inten tions to achieve reproductive health goals. Helping couples communicate about reprod uctive health is viewed as vital for involvement of both the partners in decision making , treatment seeking and promoting health. It is hence crucial to understand 'co mmunication' among married partners before designing or implementing any couple-t argeted strategies or programmes. The present study focuses on couple communica tion in reproductive health among married couples in rural Pune, India. 1.1. Communication Communication between two persons, i.e. interpersonal communication is defined as interaction taking place between two persons and ther e are different forms, styles and types of communication- for example verbal, non-verbal c ommunication, communication having different types of message such as factual or infe rence based etc (Keller, 1996). Communication is often recognized as a cornerstone of modern society. Communication is a process which involves more than sending and receivi ng messages. Scholars from various disciplines such as psychology, psychotherapy, sociology, linguistics and communication theories have stated models and theories e xplaining the components of communication as a process. The comment from one of the leading sociologists and a communication theorist, Lasswell Harold (1948) about co mmunication is well known- 'Who (says) What (to) Whom (in) What channel (with) Wh at effect. One of the most influential linguists of the 20 th century Roman Jacobson (1960) with his pioneering work in structural analysis of language, distinguished six communi cation functions, each associated with a dimension of the communication process-con text, message, channel, Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 4code, sender and receiver. An expert in the field of a nalytical psychotherapy, Paul Watzlawick in his communication theory (1967) - the famou s Five Axioms, states that communication is a cyclic process, based on the relationship o f the partners and involves verbal as well as non-verbal modalities. Psychologi st and communication expert- Friedemann Schulz von Thun (1981) in his commun ication square or Four Ears Model elaborates upon four layers of communication, whi ch are-matter, relationship, self-revealing and appeal. He further describes about th e differential understanding of messages between sender and receiver which can cause malfun ction in the interpersonal communication. It thus, becomes important i n any communication study, to learn the entire 'process' of communication, considerin g various components or layers of communication such as the relationship between partner s, the context, the mode or channel, consequence in terms of behaviour and of cour se the content or matter that is communicated. 1.2. Literature review about couple communication Couple communication is the backbone of marital relatio ns and has been widely studied in different settings around the world in the context of a variety of disciplines. The importance of couple communication has been studied in relation to promoting gender equality in the control over sexuality between marital p artners in Nigeria (Nigeria- Wusu and Isiugo-Abanihe, 2007). In a study in Nepal, it was stated that improved couple communication may achieve women's empowerment and their health goals (Mullany, Hindin and Becker, 2005). In the field of psychology, cou ple communication has been studied in relation to improving the psychosocial health of women in Australia (Ferroni and Taffe, 1997). In another study conducted among coupl es in the United States, the researchers studied couple interaction between spouses co ping with health failure and the importance of textual analysis of actual communicatio n (Rohrbough et al, 2008). In a biomedical randomized controlled study, the importance of couple partnering was stated as essential in adherence of health practices such as for L ipid Enhancing Strategies (Voils et al, 2009). In health research, Morgan (200 9) stated about quality of marital interactions being a strong predictor of health outc ome and hence recommended inclusion of communication pattern in clinical practices. I n an anthropological study, Hooper and Ong (2005) pointed towards the importance of understanding the interplay between patient and wife as a care provider by listening to the wife's narration of her husband's pain. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 5 Over the last decade a sizable body of literature has add ed a great deal to our understanding of couple communication in relation to r eproductive health (see Beckman, 1983 and Becker 1996, for review of earlier research) Couples who communicate with each other about reproductive health, reduce the risk o f acquiring Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and unintended pregnancies (Keller, 1996) . Douthwaite et al (1998) conducted a qualitative study among men and women (not couples) in Pakistan about couple communication related to withdrawal use. It was found that despite a relatively high level of communication leading to withdrawal us e, sexual pleasure was not discussed openly between the spouses and the researcher sug gested attempts to encourage positive couple dynamics. Razzaque (1999) in a survey of married couples from Bangladesh found that wife and husband agreeme nt was an important factor in translating preference for children into behavior and h ence suggested the need to motivate both the partners to agree about ceasing childb earing. Wolff, Bland and Ssekamatte (2000) used survey and focus group data in tw o districts of Uganda to study the role of couple negotiation on the unmet need of contraception and the decision to stop childbearing. They found out that opposition from partner significantly affected the unmet need as well as method choice among women. De-Si lva (2000) in his research in Sri Lanka studied about husband-wife communication inf luencing their contraceptive behavior and showed the positive association between th e two. Kimuna (2001) studied fertility and family-planning decision-making through Na tional Demographic Health Survey on a sample of 1257 matched couples in Kenya. Th is study showed that discussion of fertility and family-planning between the sp ouses was one of the important factors to influence ever-use of family planning. Ayaga (2002) in the longitudinal quantitative study among couples in Navrongo, presented the importance of couple communication on family planning behavior of couples. In a study among men from Turkey about withdrawal Ortayli et al (2005) have opine d that withdrawal may contribute to communication on both contraception and sexuality in couples. In Vietnam, Ghuman (2005) studied 800 men and women from rural and urba n communes. The researcher pointed towards women reporting lower levels of marita l sex suggesting that expression of sexuality is seen as more legitimate and natural for men than for women. Nahar (2005) studied the effect of spousal communication on in creased use of contraceptives among rural women of Bangladesh. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 6In India, as well, various qualitative and quantitative studies are carried out in and around couple communication and reproductive health. Ge orge (1998) in her study from Mumbai based on in-depth interview of 65 married wom en and 23 of their husbands, looked at sexual negotiation (as the process of communicat ion between two people) and studied the differential perspectives of men and women on sexual pleasure, sexual coercion and sexuality. Balaiah et al (2001) in the quan titative study conducted in rural Thane, Maharashtra found that family planning, spacing and contraceptive methods were not frequently discussed between spouses, indicatin g that husbands took their own decisions in planning families. Santhya and Dasverma (20 02) studied spousal communication on reproductive illness among rural women in South India and its influence on preventive and curative behaviors and state d various reasons for non- communication between spouses. Padmadas, Hutter and Wi llenkens (2004) based on the National Family Health Survey Data for Andhra Pra desh showed that a lack of interspousal communication about family planning is associa ted with a shorter reproductive span associated with low level of use of mo dern contraceptives to space births. Ravindran and Balasubraminan (2004) in their q ualitative research conducted among 66 women and 44 of their husbands in rural Tam il Nadu, studied the decision- making process of abortion in the context of women's se xual rights and found that non- consensual sex, sexual violence and women's inability to r efuse their husbands' sexual demands appeared to underlie the need for abortion. Bloom, Singh and Suchindran (2005) have studied couple communication as a protective factor against the risk of HIV in Northern India. In a recent study conducted in the clo se vicinity of this present research, in rural and urban Pune, by Alexander et al (2006), one of the findings was that partner communication and negotiation about se x were rare. However this study was conducted among unmarried young men and women. The review of literature regarding couple communicatio n in health issues, and especially about reproductive health stresses the importance of it for various health outcomes. The majority of these studies have focused on particular aspect of health or reproductive health and attempted to prove relationship between couple communication and the desired health outcome. Though most of these researchers h ave recommended the need to improve couple communication and learn the commu nication pattern, very little is known about couple communication as a process, in a com prehensive way. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 71.3. Reproductive health of young married couples i n socio-cultural context In India, the family is the most important institution that has survived through the ages. India, like most other less industrialized, traditional, eastern societies is a collectivist society that emphasizes family integrity, family loyalty, and family unity. More specifically, collectivism is reflected in greater readiness to cooperate with family members and extended kin on decisions affecting most aspects o f life, including career choice, mate selection, and marriage (Hui and Triandis 1986). In India, families adhere to a patriarchal ideology, follow the patrilineal rul e of descent, are patrilocal, and endorse traditional gender role preferences. The man-woman r elationship, most of the times, is based on the formal marriage system and the husband's f amily has tremendous hold on the couple's life, their behavior, their relationship with each other and, their health decisions. Hence it is important to understand the conce pt of \"couples\" in the Indian context. In India, majority of marriages are arranged m ainly by elders of the household and kinship and husband and wife are not known to each other before marriage. Goyal (2001) has mentioned about the ambivalence and inhibi tion in the mind of even educated people about having 'dialogue' with partners. Contrary to the occidental cultures where relationships culminate into sexual rela tions, in a typical rural society of India, the entire relationship between husband and wi fe \"begins\" with sex, consequent to marriage. Married couples are worried, especially in th e beginning of their relationship, about rejection in sexual life and hence may avoid d iscussing with each other, topics such as sex, childbearing or reproductive health in genera l. Also they are rarely encouraged to have open discussion around these issues. In fact, emotional ties between spouses are considered a potential threat to th e solidarity of the patrilineal group and hence there is a tendency to limit communicati on between spouses (World Bank, 1996). Cultural notions and family structure have important im plications for women such as on their autonomy to decide about their reproduc tive careers. For example- the traditional notion was that childbearing is not an ev ent worthy of medical attention (Kanitkar and Sinha, 1989) and the concept of special care during the antenatal period was not known traditionally in India (Jeejebhoy and Roy, 1995). Jeejebhoy and Bott (2006) have commented about power imbalances and wome n's inability to negotiate sexual matters possibly increasing young women's risk of nonc onsensual sexual experiences. Powerlessness of young married women in neg otiating fertility with husbands and extended families is documented also among Bangladeshi couples (Gipson and Hindin, 2007). Elder family members especial ly the mothers-in-law are known to play the role of gatekeepers in most of the deci sion-making related to fertility in Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 8India, but also in rural population in Mali (Madhava n, Adams and Simon, 2003). In many Sub-Saharan African cultures, spousal discussion of sexual matters is discouraged, and other persons\u2014commonly, in-laws\u2014act as conduits through whi ch partners can exchange ideas on these topics (Ezeh, 1993; Blanc, 1996 a nd Castle et al, 1999) Chowdhury (2003) studied about sociology of first birth i n rural Bangladesh and pointed towards objection from in-laws and financial concerns a s barriers to seeking health care. In other words, family and kinship network, traditions a nd social and cultural norms influence young couples' reproductive health communicatio n and behavior. Traditions and values guide couples' reproductive healt h behavior in such a way that most of the related issues are assigned to the women's dom ain. Similar to rural societies in China (Hardee, Xie and Gu, 2003), women in most o f the parts of India, do not carry on the family line, they leave home after marriage an d carry the burden of taking care of children and home in addition to taking almost sole resp onsibility for family planning. Gender-based inequities influence reproductive and sexua l health of couples, especially young women. While men are expected to, by and large, remain within the confines of a monogamous marriage, there is social indifference to their indulging in extra-marital sex, whereas female sexuality is defined as something threaten ing to society and requiring male control (Ramasubban, 1995). Ravindran and Subrama nian (2004) in her study from rural Tamil Nadu, India, have studied married w omen's sexual rights and ability or inability to refuse sex. Gender norms often dictate tha t women and girls should be ignorant and passive about sex, which greatly constrains thei r ability to negotiate safer sex or access appropriate services (Garg and Sharma, 2006). As Apte (2000) mentioned in a study of rural men on the outskirts of Pune, men w ere found to play almost no role in antenatal and postnatal care which was considered exclusive ly a women's domain. Men seldom perform the role of active and supportive part ners of women. However, women mostly follow the decisions taken by men as was also studie d among Latina women in the United States by Pulerwitz et al (2000). Similar t o India, gender power relations and stereotypes seemed to have influenced reproductive heal th in terms of contraceptive behavior in rural Nepal (Chapagain, 2005). Gender ba sed power inequities generally incorporate the belief that men should control women' s sexuality and their child-bearing capacity (Blanc, 20001). In India (Raju and Leonard, 2 000), as well in some other countries such as Ghana (Bawah et al, 1999) and Egypt (E l-Zanaty et al. 1999) and Tanzania (Maman et al. 2001), men control financial r esources and women's mobility which, in turn, affects women's access to and use of reprod uctive health services. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 9Verma and Mahendra (2004) express that gender stereotyp es in sexuality, about submissive females and powerful males, possibly restricts access to health information, hinder communication and encourage risky behavior among women and men in different but equally dangerous way. Blanc (2001) reviewed gender power relations with sexual health and stated that verbal communication between partners about reproductive health is low in many developing countries and that gender-base d power inequities contribute to a lack of communication. Thus, relationship between traditions, family network an d gender-power relations affecting couples' reproductive health is clearly stated b y researchers in India and elsewhere. 1.4. Facts and figures for India and Rural Maharash tra In India, the National Family Health Survey data (NFH S-III, 2005-06) shows a positive trend in various reproductive health indicators such as Total Fertility Rate (TFR) being 2.7, 53% of the rural population using contraceptives, 72% of rural women seeking antenatal care and 31% of rural women having instituti onal deliveries. Compared to previous survey data, these indicators show positive trends. Data for rural Maharashtra scores better in terms of lowered fertility rate (TFR-2. 3), increased contraceptive use (67.1) and institutional births (50.5), as compared to the national figures. District Pune (study site) presented TFR as 2.3 in the Census data of 20 01 (Guilmoto and Rajan, 2002). Studies in India and elsewhere have stated abo ut the link between improved couple communication affecting fertility decisions and con traceptive use of couples (Kimuna and Adamcheck, 2001; Sabu et al, 2004; Wolff , Bland and Ssekamatte (2000). Hence, the positive trend in indicators presented for rural Maharashtra and Pune, will help to contextualize the study results. 1.5. Male involvement in reproductive health Given the background of the traditional gender-based p ower relations and the influence of the family institution on reproductive health of you ng married couples in India as well as many of the developing countries, recent efforts to in volve men in reproductive health in these settings cannot be overlooked. Involvement o f men in reproductive health though specially stressed upon since the ICPD, 1994; has be en studied since more three decades. Ringheim (1993) examined two decades of social science research on male contraceptive. Edward (1994) wrote about role of men in contraceptive decision- Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 10 making mainly with US perspective. In recent years, studies from various setting in the world have documented changing role of men in reprod uctive health. In Turkey, (Turan et al, 2001) ideas about fatherhood seem to be under going change and now young men want to be helpful towards the wife during pregnancy and delivery. India's reproductive health programme has considered 'male involvement' as i mportant, in their national policy (Khan and Panda, 2004), ever since 1994. There a re studies and interventions by government as well NGOs to enhance participation of men in maternity care for example- study in New Delhi (Varkey, 2001) and rural M aharashtra in Ahmednagar (Barua 2006). There is an inclusion of 'Men's section' i n the National Family Health Survey-III report. In the report for Maharashtra, (NFH S-III, 2005-06- Maharashtra Report), this section based on men ' age 15-49 whose youngest living child was age 0-35 months' , highlights that 58% of rural men were present at an y ante natal visit of their wives. To about 46% of men from rural area health pro viders had ever told about what to do if the mother had any pregnancy complication. However , this percentage was as low as 24% and 27% in case of telling men specifically abou t convulsion and vaginal bleeding as signs of pregnancy complications; respectively. This report indicates that the reproductive health programme certainly intends to wel come more men in maternal care. Of course, male involvement has been criticized against th e issues of risk of increasing male dominance and effects on women's empowerment, in creasing the gender gap (Helzner, 1996 and Singh, 2002). But, increased couple communication and joint decision-making may achieve women's empowerment as well a s their health goals (Mullany, Hindin and Becker, 2005). To summarize, it is evident from literature review aroun d couples studies in reproductive health and communication that it is essential to have an understanding about how young married couples in rural set ups discuss their reproductive health. Most of the existing literature around couple communication in India as well as in other developing countries has focused on components of reproductive health such a s contraceptive behaviour, sexuality or high-risk sexual behaviour. Also, there are n umerous studies about determinants of couple communication in terms of gen der-power relations, or family network. However, there is hardly any literature focusing on couple communication in rural married couples, with a comprehensive understandin g of the details of the process of communication. Further, in the seemingly traditional society as that of India, where couples do not marry by choice and are influenced by kinship and family network; Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 11 reproductive health is mainly considered as an exclusive 'wo men's domain' and there are efforts to improve male involvement in reproductive health; non-existence of such a study further widens the gap in body of literature. 1.6. Aim and specific objectives of the study Aim- To learn about process of reproductive health related communication among young married rural couples Scope of reproductive health in this study is restricted to the most common events in the span of reproductive life, which are- fertility, planni ng parenthood, childbirth, sexual relations. The study does not include other issues such as abo rtion, infertility, Sexually Transmitted Infections or HIV. It was a purposive decision to achieve the most homogeneous sample in a community based qualitative stu dy. Couple communication in case of infertile couples, or decision-making regarding i nduced abortion are essentially different areas where couples may communicate differe ntly than in the normal course of events. The word 'process' includes, learning about plac e, content or matter, time and context of communication. It also covers the consequence of communication in terms of reproductive health behavior, problems faced and suppor tive factors. Thus, the process of couple communication will be studied across four majo r areas of reproductive health, stated as four specific objectives as follows- Specific objectives- 1- To explore communication and behavior of rural ma rried couples in relation to fertility during reproductive life span 2- To learn communication of married couples about th eir sexual relationship in relation to gender stereotypes 3- To understand communication and behavior of rural m arried couples around childbirth against the backdrop of traditions 4- To analyze the narrations of the husband and wife a bout the wife's reproductive health problems This study is expected to widen the knowledge about couple communication in terms of its channel, mode, type, context and content. It will fu rther throw light upon the relationship between couple communication and couple beh avior. It should enhance the understanding about the influence of family, kinship, cu lture, traditions and gender based stereotypes on the couple communication. It may also serve as a platform for studying Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 12 various subjects such as impact of male participation on reproductive health, strategies to improve partner notification, gender power relati ons influencing reproductive health and significance of traditions in given society. The stu dy will have implications for the local health programmes by suggesting strategies to impro ve couple communication and reproductive health behavior. Couple communication is o ne of the crucial facets on the entire marital relationship of the couple and hence understanding about their communication especially in sensitive issues as that of repr oductive health, may give insights on approaches towards establishing marital harmo ny among couples in general.

Methodology 2.1 Study site and population Maharashtra is India's second largest state in terms of i ts population (more than 96 million). More than 50% of the population is rural a nd the state has a Hindu majority (72%). Pune is one of 35 districts of Maharashtra state a nd has fourteen Tehsils. The district population is around 7.2 million (Census of In dia, 2001). The current study was conducted in the rural outskirts o f Pune, in Maval which is one of the tehsils (sub-divisions) of Pune district. Maval has a pop ulation of around 300 thousand spread among 184 villages. The Tehsil is surrou nded by the Western Ghats and the Mumbai-Pune Highway cuts through the Tehsil. I t is one of the fastest developing tehsils of Pune district, with many upcoming industries, educational institutes, plant nurseries and floriculture. Most of the villages h ave geographical access by road, though during the rainy season, the conditions of the roads deteriorate and commuting becomes a problem for some of the remote villages. Ther e are two main towns in the Tehsil, where most of the private medical practitioners, private multi-specialty hospitals, markets and shops are clustered. Maval Maharashtra Pune Figure 2.1 Maps of India, Maharashtra and Pune Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 16 Figure 2.2 - Primary Health Centre Reproductive health services are delivered to the communi ty through a strong public health system via 6 Primary Health Centres and their sub-ce ntres (one each catering to a population of 5000) and 2 Rural Hospitals (RH). Au xiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM) and Multi Purpose Workers (MPW) are the grass root level h ealth providers of this health system. The ANMs and Anganwadi staff 1 are mainly responsible for providing Ante Natal Care (ANC), promoting the use of contraception and acc eptance of terminal method of family planning 2. In spite of the development that has taken place in th is Tehsil due to urbanization, especially around the Expressway; the area still represent s a rural set up of Western Maharashtra dominated by a kinship-oriented, Maratha cas te 3, agrarian community. Most of the families are either joint or extended. It is a patriarchal society, where families 1 In India, the government runs pre-schools called ' Anganwadi ' in all the villages through Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) under the Department of Health and Social Welfare. These pre-school teachers along with respons ibility of teaching in the school are also responsible for assisting the PHC staff to provide anti natal and post natal services. The Tehsil has more than 200 such pre-schools having an equal or more number of pre-school staff 2 Terminal method of family planning mainly refers to f emale sterilization, which is the most preferred method in rural Indian society. 3 Caste- It is a group of individuals socially stratified on the basis of occupation, enodogamy, social culture and political power. 'Maratha' is the p redominant caste in rural set ups of Western Maharashtra.

However, issues related to reproductive health are exclusiv ely under women's domain. 2.2. Sample selection and recruitment of respondent s The study was a community-based, qualitative exploration among young married couples from rural set up which aimed at understandin g the process of couple communication in reproductive health. It was conducted i n the area of three (out of six) Primary Health Centres (PHC), selected randomly. The study involved a preparatory phase where key informan ts from the community (n=10) were interviewed to understand traditions, norm s and practices about couple communication and behavior in reproductive health. The y included the Traditional Birth Attendant, a female medical practitioner in the study area, an old woman in the community, a leader of the local Self Help Group, a male medical practitioner at the private hospital in the study area, a mother of a loca l administrator and an Anganwadi teacher. This was a purposive sample from the communit y. This phase helped in designing the tool for interviewing selected couples in the study. Also some of the key informants were later interviewed to contextualize the data collected from the couples. The main phase involved in-depth interviews of married couples. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 18 Sampling of married couples- To cover the entire spectrum of reproductive health-rela ted issues- pregnancy, delivery, family planning, sexual relations and reproductive hea lth problems; the present study focused on married couples that have at least one child and have used a terminal method of contraception (female sterilization 4). To minimize the recall bias of the respondents, it was decided to select couples that have un dergone sterilization, not beyond a period of one year at the time of the study. Village Health Functionaries (VHF) 5 from the selected area, assisted the researcher in recru itment of couples, based on the records of female sterilization maintained by them. Coup les fulfilling the sample selection criteria regarding time of female sterilization were r andomly selected from the list available with them. The VHFs then contacted these coupl es; briefly oriented them about the study and sought verbal consent from them to parti cipate in the study. The couples who gave consent to participate, were then approached b y the researcher for conducting the interview. In all, forty-one couples were identifi ed for interviews during the study period. Purposive sample typically relies on the concept of 'sat uration'. In this study, couples fulfilling the inclusion criterion were purposively selec ted, in order to cover data on various events on the reproductive life span. We attempt ed to analyze data at frequent intervals and checked the degree of data saturation and also the pattern of variability. As (Guest, Bunce and Johnson, 2006) mentioned, though the idea of saturation is helpful at the conceptual level, it provides little practical guidance for estimating sample sizes, prior to data collection, necessary for conducting qualitative research. We covered almost 10% sample of the study universe (which means the total number of couples from the three PHC areas, who have undergone family planning o peration not more than one year before the date of interview, during the study per iod). In all, thirty-five married couples were interviewed in-depth in the study. The response rate of respondents was more than 80%. Ou t of forty-one couples short- listed, there were six couples who did not participate in the study. In case of four couples, the husband and wife could not manage to spar e time together for being 4 Female sterilization is the commonly accepted terminal m ethod of contraception and village health functionaries maintain the record of each woman who undergoes sterilization, irrespective of the place of sterilization, i.e. public or private hospital. 5 Village health functionaries- Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and Anganwadi worker Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 19 interviewed. In case of two couples, there was denial fr om one of the partners for giving the interview and we could not find any convincing reaso n for the same. 2.3. Study tools- For interviewing the key informants, an interview guide was prepared. With the given background of the study sample, various options were th ought of to elicit the desired information from husbands and wives. In the initial pha se of preparing the study tools, various other tools such as a simple interview guide, a '3 X3 matrix' were prepared and tested at field level. The researcher experienced challe nges in administering these tools such as, women felt shy about discussing their sexual relati onship; there were difficulties in generating willingness among men to talk about thei r personal life or keeping them engaged throughout the interview etc. Moreover, to el icit information from husband and wife over sensitive issues such as that of their sexual relatio nship, in one session, was equally challenging. The study subject being sensitive an d the nature of the study being exploratory and qualitative, importance of having an in -depth interview guide was never underestimated. However, the researcher felt a need to have a more interactive tool and thus thought about having visual assistance to an interview guide. Visuals methods coupled with participant narratives provide strategies to empower participants to define the problem of interest, encoura ge participants to reveal what might be uncomfortable or unknown, and identify and d evelop resources (Hurwoth et al 2005). Researchers have used various forms of visuals such as photographs or movie clips (Petchesky 1987; Prosser, 1998; Radley and Taylor, 20 03). In this study as well, photographs or movie clips were considered as an option. H owever, for rural community, Figure 2.4. - A woman on her way to the river for wa shing clothes Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 20 it was thought not be a user friendly and easy to compre hend tool. There was a concern that respondents would get more involved in the persona lities shown in the photographs or cinema clips, rather than thinking about the subject s depicted. Also the apprehension was that the respondent might not relate with the per sonalities who are considered to be 'heroes of reel life' and not real life. Cartoons, a creative way of depicting a subject, were another option. However, considering the seriousness of the topic and perceptions of local people towards 'cartoon' as a visual form, the resea rcher thought it would be an inappropriate idea. There was a need to have a simple , respondent-friendly and adequately flexible tool. The researcher felt that the most appropriate and effective tool would be combining the use of words and drawings - in the form of sketches- close to respondents' lifestyle depicting their day-to-day life scen es. Hand drawn pictures, sketches or images by the respondent are widely used in rep roductive health but mainly as a research method (Jaswal, 1997; Apte, 2000). The ant hropological research of Victora and Knauth (2001), examined graphic and verb al images of the reproductive system of men and women living in Brazil. Guillemin (200 4) asked women attending menopausal clinics to draw how they understood menopause following an individual interview and she mentions that drawings offer a rich a nd insightful research method to explore how people make sense of their world. Hence the researcher decided to prepare an interview guide which is supported by visuals for interviewing the couples. This tool is labeled as Visually Assisted Interview Guide (VAIG). The tool involved picture cards having han d-drawn illustration of day-to- day life scenarios (some examples are shown in Figure 2. 5) and an in-depth interview guide around each scenario. The researcher's husband, who is an artist and has experience of working in the subject of reproductive heal th as well as rural community, helped in constructing the visuals. Each subject of reprodu ctive health under study, such as pregnancy and sexual relationship had a set of hand-d rawn pictures depicting the subject. Also there were some pictures helping to elicit data around general communication of the couple and their lifestyle. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 21 The operational definition of reproductive health gu ided the broad areas of enquiry in the tool. It also included sections on personal data of the couples, socio-demographic details, information about family, general communicati on including time, duration, content of communication, determinants etc. The tool was simultaneously administered to husband and w ife (in absence of each other, separately) by male and female researchers resp ectively. The study tool VAIG is enclosed at the end as an annex. 2.4. Pilot testing of tools for interviewing marrie d couples For interviewing the married couples, an interview gui de without any visuals was initially prepared and pilot tested with men and women. Also i t was discussed at field level with key informants to get their inputs. Some additional issu es were suggested during these discussions which were later incorporated in the intervie w guide such as 'privacy available for the couple'. Also inputs from interviews with experts from the study subject- a counselor working at infertility and male sexual and reproductive health clinic, and an experienced researcher in reproductive health in India, helped in revision of the interview guide and conception of the visuals. Based on these initi al discussions, subjects of visuals were identified and thus a Visually Assisted Intervi ew Guide was prepared. This tool was once again pilot tested at field level with m en as well as women (with eight respondents). Appropriate changes were made in the tex tual part of the guide i.e. the questions or probes as well as in the pictures. For example - earlier there was no picture card around sexual abstinence, but during the pilot testi ng, it was experienced that adding a separate card on this subject was necessary to e licit the details on this subject. Figure 2.5 -Examples of picture cards used as a part of VAIG Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 22 Pilot testing of this tool helped in understanding th e appropriateness, comfort level, comprehension of questions as well as pictures, by male and female respondents. An analysis based on the eight in-depth interviews during p ilot testing ensured that no further revisions of the tool were necessary. (Chapter 3 of this thesis is based on construction and val idation of this tool.) 2.5. Data collection- Data were collected between 2006 and 2008. As the rese archer was not affiliated or associated with any research institute in Pune, India for conducting this research, most of the research work was handled by her individually. She had previously worked in the study area and had rapport with the health and develo pment functionaries. During the initial phase of the study, her male assistant and she mad e several visits to the study sites and had informal discussions with village health funct ionaries and villagers about the study. This phase lasted for about six months, durin g which they also interviewed some of the key informants. Though interviewing key infor mants continued, the data from this phase helped not only in designing the VAIG for interviewing the couples in the initial stage of the study, but also for contextualizat ion of data from couples around existing practices of couple communication, at a later sta ge. The next phase was interviewing couples, which lasted for about one and a half years. This phase included preparation of the tools for intervi ewing couples, pilot-testing the tools in the field and revisions of the tools before star ting to collect data from the study sample. The male assistant conducted interviews of the me n (husbands) in the study. This helped in taking care of gender issues at field level about a woman interviewing a man regarding his reproductive and sexual life issues. A lso husband and wife had to be interviewed simultaneously so that there was no sharing of information between them and hence it was required to have the assistance of ano ther interviewer. All the interviews were conducted in the local language i.e. Marathi . Each interview was generally completed in one session, due to difficulties in arranging a schedule for re- interview. On an average during one field visit, one cou ple was interviewed. The interviews were either recorded (if consent was given by respondent) or field notes were taken during the interview. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 23 2.6. Sharing field experiences - rapport establishment and interviews of couples We hired a vehicle and left for the field generally in the evening i.e. at about five o'clock. The villages were at a distance of 25- 70 km from the main city and it took us from 40 minute s to one and a half hours to reach the field village, dep ending on the traffic on the Expressway, the conditions of the approach road to the village and th e rains. In the rainy seasons, heavy rains, disruption of electricity, poor condition of the appr oach road and respondents having workload on the farm, further interrupted the field work. Vil lagers, especially men were free to discuss things usually in the evenings, after work hours. It w as very difficult to find husband and wife both available for interview at the same time due t o their busy schedule. We contacted the VHF and, received a list of probable samples from th eir work area. They contacted the sampled couples and fixed up an appoint ment for us. Most of the times, the VHF himself or herself guided us to the house of the respondent, i ntroduced us to them and then left. My assistant and I introduced ourselves in details to th e couple, and if necessary to the whole family. We then sought an informed verbal consent from the couple for the i nterview. Sometimes we even had to discuss the same, with othe r family members. Generally there was an informal discussion about their on -going activities. We then separated the couple for conducting interviews. It was always a challenge to take the woman out from t he family, and find privacy to discuss her personal issues. Sometimes, there were supporti ve women in the family, who volunteered to substitute her for cooking, looking after her child ren and other household chores for that evening. All these women had their youngest child not older than two years (on an average) because of our selection criteria of interviewing wome n who had their sterilization not more than a year before the time of interview . But sometimes, there were difficulties in arrangin g her interview and many times, I conducted the intervie w in the kitchen, while the woman was cooking. Most of the interviews were conducted sitting on the floor along with the respondent. It helped in cr eating an informal environment for the interview an d also made it easy to spread the picture cards in front of the respondent and discu ss various issues. This made the respondent comfortable while giving responses. This approach helped in finding private t ime with her for the necessary duration as it did not hamp er her work and thus other family members did not mind either. Each interview lasted f or approximately an hour and twenty minutes. Even if the interviews were previously plan ned, we always had to wa it for the couple to get ready for the interview for reasons such as th e man was busy with work, he was not available at home, the woman was busy cooking, the chi ldren did not let the mother speak, or some other family members were present, denying us ha ve the privacy required for conducting the interview. Some times, we had to revis it the couple to find the appropriate time and place for the interview. In each visit, we planne d the interview for the next visit. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 24 2.7. Data management and analysis- Field notes taken in Marathi were expanded and the entire interview was transcribed and translated in English. The interviews were coded and m anaged in the software Atlas ti. Broad areas of inquiry in the interview tool formed th e broad codes, which were then sub-coded. Couple communication was then thematically ana lyzed around themes such as- methodological issues, Indian traditions regarding ch ildbirth, male involvement in reproductive health, gender stereotypes related to sexu ality and the concept of planning parenthood. Also process of communication was analyzed in terms of place, type and form, duration, content and barriers for communication . The study mainly involved learning about actual practices in relation to couple communication and there were very few questions around knowledge, perceptions, opinions or intentions, where husbands and wives would have differed in their responses. Also considering the qualitative nature of the study, the size of the sample and the objective o f the study which was to learn the process of couple communication, it was not appropriate to match their responses for all the questions to understand agreement or disagreement. Hence, it was attempted to analyze and match male-female responses for limited subj ects. 2.8 - Timeline of the research project (October 2005 - March 2009) Months 1-3: Initial visits in the field- informal discussions with community mem bers, observations, discussion with staff from PHC, i nterviews of key informants, literature review Month 4-6: Interviews of key informants, identification of PHC st aff for supporting the study, literature review Month 7-8: Preparation of study tool to in terview couples, identification of couples, literature review Month 9-10: Pilot testing and revision of tools, identification of couples, literature review Month 11-13: Construction of final study tool VAIG, identification of couples, first level consent seeking by PHC staff, literature review Month 14-24: Data collection (including analysis during data collect ion), data management, literature review Month 25-36: Data management, data analysis, paper w riting, literature review Month 37-42: Data analysis, paper writing, thesis wr iting, literature review Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 25 Figure 2.6 Husband meeting his wife during post partum 2.9. Ethical considerations Since the study is on couple communication on the sensit ive and personal subject of reproductive health issues, informed verbal consent from t he respondents was obtained at two levels: firstly by the VHF before recruiting them in the study and then by the researcher before starting the interview. Also verbal co nsent was sought for recording the interview. More than half of the sample gave con sent to record their interviews. They were assured freedom to participate or withdraw from t he study at any point (even after giving first level consent to the VHF) without giving an y explanation to the researcher or to the VHF. The time and place for conducting the inte rview was decided by the couples and the researcher occasionally had to make multiple visits to respect their decision. The researcher ensured that the respondents were interviewe d in complete privacy and no information was revealed to any of the family members, f riends or even the spouse. Of course, using the information collected through this stud y only for academic purpose, and not discussing it with or disclosing it to anyone else for any other purpose, would ensure the important aspect about protection from har m to the respondent. There was no possibility of seeking ethical clearance from a ny Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) at local level. The University of Pune d id not have an IEC at the time of my project work. Recently they have formed an IEC; how ever, it is still not functional. I conducted the research at individual level and was not asso ciated with any organization for my research. Hence, the research does not have any ethi cal clearances/ agreements sought from a formal research ethics body. 2.10 Advantages of study tool- VAIG- VAIG helped the researcher in conceptualizing the entir e process of husband and wife communication in reproductive health within local cultu ral context. The respondents were able to visualize their day-to- day life at home, on the farm or outside the house an d could think about when, what, how and where they talked to each other about reproductive health issues- for example 'talking about personal issues only at night', 'not talking about sexual relations when outsid e the house', etc. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 26 Figure 2.7 Husband and wife working on the farm The tool also helped in reducing 'recall bias' and missin g out minute details around communication. For example, to the visual and question around husband's role in post- natal period of his wife (as shown in Figure 2.6), on e husband replied, 'I went to meet her on the 12 th day of her delivery. Met her and came back on the same day. There were many people around, so how cou ld I talk or discuss anything with her! I could not go there often due to my job. She was there for one and a half months. That is the custom. So decisions were taken at 'higher level' in the family. I did not say anything in that ma tter.' Essential flexibility was offered to respondent because ro le of visuals was to navigate the respondent's thoughts in a particular direction a nd not to restrict him to think only about what is depicted in the visual. Appropriate questions and probes were crucial to achieve this necessary flexibility. For example, there is a pictur e of husband and wife working on their farm and talking to each other (as shown in the figure 2.7). Some of the respon dents answered, ' We do not have a farm', or 'I don't work on the farm' . It was important to lead them towards various other possible situations where they could have privacy. If visuals are used to elicit information in isolation without h aving the necessary questions/ probes, it can limit the scope of eliciting information. These visuals involved concrete leads and helped me in de sensitization of respondents for sensitive subjects such as sexual expectations and sexual negotiations. The respondents gave details regarding the process of commun ication about their sexual relationship, without any reservations. To quote a young woman living in an extended family- 'Is there anything wrong in having it (sex) 'the other way round', means woman on the top? I like it that way and he also does not hav e any problem (Feeling guilty). We don't do it that way, everyday but once in 3 -4 months. I am sometimes worried, is it that if one does it this way, th ey will have AIDS? I cannot talk about this to anyone. My husband anyway laughs at me because I always keep worrying about something or the other.' It was felt that bridging the gap between the respon dent and the researcher and building trust in the respondent's mind was very crucial. Without using visuals this process could Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 27 Figure 2.8 Husband wanting to have sex not have been so effective. Deacon and Boulle (2007) h ad a similar finding about using case vignettes as an appropriate mechanism to elicit of pa tterns of stigma. Specific situations such as 'Husband has gone to meet his wif e after her delivery' helped the wives in the study to remember their entire experie nce and answer in depth about the communication process. The wives spontaneously narrated a bout communication with other family members especially with their mother a nd the mother-in-law. Though it was known that these family members have an important rol e in the decision-making at family level, we have avoided including them in the pic ture. We worried that their inclusion in the picture could give a wrong message that they are or should be involved in the decision-making. However, the respondents could t hink beyond the subjects and objects portrayed in the visuals and their narration di d not limit necessarily to the communication between spouses. The advantages of visuals were also experienced for interviewing couples on highly sensitive subjects such as their sexual relationship. These situations illustrated, for example (as shown in the figure 2.8), 'Husband wanting to have sex and wife not willing for the same' could be 'r ead' by the respondents and they could comprehend the situation without many explanations from the interviewer . These visuals had 'leads' but there was no harm done to the respondent's right of denying the situation depicted in this visual. There wer e responses such as ' Yes, it happens when I go close to her, she is tired or does n ot have the mood, but then I 'prepare ' her for it because I cannot sleep without having it' ; and also there were responses such as ' No, this never happens. We have it only when she wants it .' In other words, even these leading visuals could help to elicit real istic responses without having to ask any subjective or judgmental questions. Lastly, the study has overcome potential obstacles in appro aching couples for reproductive health studies. Stan (1996) in the review of couple studies in reproductive health mentioned about potential obstacles due to compl exities arising in data collection- lower response rate than for individuals and potential contamination of responses unless interviews are conducted separately and simultaneously. Pre sent study findings are based on the narrations of husbands and wives and the re sponse rate from both of them Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 28 was more than 80%. Also there is a possibility that beca use most of the interviews were conducted in one session, the researchers received most sponta neous responses from husbands and wives, as they had no opportunity to discuss or decide or plan the responses. 2.11. Limitations of the methodology There is always a self-selection bias from participants whi ch is beyond the control of a researcher. For example, people who have strong opini ons or knowledge are more willing to participate in a survey. Similarly in this ca se, one cannot overrule the possibility that, couples who are comfortable in talking about r eproductive health or about communication had more participation in the study. The study subject was sensitive and intimate for the respondents and supposedly to be discussed only 'behind close doors'. Hence, in spite of the efforts to establish rapport wit h the respondent, we do not deny the possibility that the respondents did not disclose all the details about their reproductive health related communication with their partner, espe cially on sensitive issues such as sex-related communication. Although more than one visit was paid to one couple (fo r planning and conducting the interview), the actual interview was (in most cases) conduct ed in one session, as it was not feasible to arrange the time and place to meet t he couple repeatedly. 'In-depth' interviews are expected to run over more than one session. Though the researcher used visuals to elicit maximum information in a relatively shor t period, the 'depth' of the data needs to be appreciated against the feasibility. The study sample with due consideration given towards d egree of saturation and proportion with the study universe, truly represents th e rural community under study in terms of their background characters such as age, education , occupation, type of family and caste. However, the study being qualitative in natur e with small sample size, all the findings cannot be generalized or extrapolated to the larger population of rural communities all over India but surely suggests concepts an d strategies that can be generalizable.

Tool construction primarily considered adding value to the int erview guide and to offer ease/ comfort to the respondents and researchers for eliciting p ersonal information. Results show that hand-drawn pictures subtract the respondent an d replace him with the individual illustrated and thus give realistic, imperso nal responses around sensitive issues.

Introduction The importance of couple communication to enhance shar ing thoughts and feelings between husband and wife, to improve mutual decision-m aking and thus to help in achieving better reproductive health outcome, is known. K eller (1996) has reported that sexual partners who communicate about reproductive health issues reduce their risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or of unin tended pregnancy but few couples feel comfortable talking openly about sex. Coupl es who talk to each other about family planning and reproductive health can reach bette r, healthier decisions (Population Reports, 1998). Bloom, Singh and Suchindran (2005) ha ve studied couple communication as a protective factor against the risk of HI V in Northern India. Learning more about the process of couple communication, in term s of the place, the content, the style, the barriers, the form etc. is crucial before develo ping strategies to improve couple communication, especially among rural couples. However, such learning poses challenges related to the sensitivity of the subject, the cultural setting, the gender dynamics in the family and practical difficulties of reachi ng both husband and wife in a rural set up for eliciting in-depth information. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 33 Couple communication in relation to reproductive heal th has been widely studied using various quantitative and qualitative tools of data coll ection. Kimuna (2001) studied fertility and family-planning decision-making through Na tional Demographic Health Survey on a sample of 1257 matched couples. Traditional ly, family planning surveys relied on responses only from women but in this survey Kim una matched the data from both men and women sampled in the survey. However, su rvey as a tool of data collection answers 'what', 'how' and 'why' about a resear ch issue in a limited way. Hence for learning more about sensitive issues in reproductive h ealth, researchers have preferred using qualitative tools of data collection. O rtayli et al (2005) conducted in-depth interviews among 62 male factory workers in Turkey to un derstand men's perspective on withdrawal. In India, Ravindran (2004) interviewed 66 women and 44 of their husbands to elicit information about women's preferences to have induced abortions rather than use contraception in the context of gender relations be tween couples. Santhya (2002) studied spousal communication on reproductive illness among rural women and its influence on preventive and curative behaviors by using q uantitative as well as qualitative methods. George (2000) in her study around first sexual experiences of newly married adolescent women in Mumbai used narratives of w omen from two data sets gathered from focus group discussions and in-depth inter views. Although tools such as interview guides and narrative tech niques are useful in eliciting qualitative and in-depth information from the respon dents, they may have their own limitations in offering the respondent the comfort a nd ease (at which they can respond regarding) required to respond freely on many aspects o f marital life including reproductive health issues because these are intimatel y personal issues. To learn about sensitive subjects such as reproductive hea lth, visual methods are viewed as established methods having a qualitative persp ective and approach of data generation. Keller (2008, 428) pointed out that mea sures that are not culturally relevant or sensitive to the experiences, and traditions or belief s of local people may result in obtaining unreliable or non-interpretable data and used visual methods to measure physical activity and dietary intake among Hispanic women. Visuals are used in various forms as photographs, movie clips or hand drawn pictures in different settings. As is described by Donaldson (2001), data in the form of pho tographs can be used to improve understanding in several areas including reproductive hea lth. In visual anthropology, photos are used to achieve a multi-dimensional approac h in studying culture and specific Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 34 subjects such as rituals or home-life (Collier and Colli er 1986). Frith and Harcourt (2002) used the photo-elicitation method to capture women's e xperiences of chemotherapy treatment. To collect data around perceptions of quali ty of prenatal care among immigrant Latina women, Bender, Harbour, Thorp and Morris (2001) designed a qualitative interview tool with photographs represent ing components of quality. Several other studies explain use of movie clips or photographs to have a detailed documentation of the research activities (Petchesky 1987; P rosser, 1998; Radley and Taylor, 2003). In health research, especially in African countries, p ictures in the form of vignettes have been widely used in health research, more related to H IV/AIDS (Deacon and Boulle, 2007). Also there have been studies around visual image ries and how people construct these imageries (Rose, 2001). Haaland (2000, 9) has e xtensively used pictorial forms with the community and mentions use of pictorial form s for various purposes e.g. by community health workers for record keeping of distribu tion of a commodity such as drugs, and for describing and quantifying problems by com munity members. In addition to using visuals either to impart a message or educate or to document various processes, visuals can be creatively used to elicit informat ion on a range of subjects from a group of participants or from an individual. Based on reviewing various research methods used in und erstanding sensitive reproductive health related issues, I decided to use an i nnovative approach in eliciting information from couples in the study. The aim of this current study was to understand the process of couple communication in reproductive heal th in terms of its style, place, duration, period, frequency and content. For the study , reproductive health was operationally defined as all the issues related to pregn ancy, delivery, family planning, reproductive health problems and sexual relationship. I used hand-drawn pictures as an integral part of an interview guide and labeled this tool as Visually Assisted Interview Guide (VAIG). Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 35 3.3. Context / background Pune is one of the fastest growing cities of Maharashtra, a state in western India. The study site, Maval Tehsil 6 is located on the Northwest of Pune city and Pune-Mumb ai Express way cuts through the Tehsil. It is surrounded by t he Sahyadri mountain ranges and is a region of heavy rainfall growing paddy as the m ain crop. Around three hundred thousand people reside in this Tehsil. Though it is one of the fastest developing tehsils of Pune district with many upcoming industries, educational institutes, plant nurseries and floriculture, it still represents a typical rural site do minated by the kinship-oriented Maratha caste 7, a largely agrarian community. Most of the families are either joint or extended. There are two main towns, where most of the private medical practitioners, private multi-specialty hospitals, markets and shops are clu stered. All the couples were Hindu and most of them (27/35) live in either a joint or an extended family. Out of 35 couples, 26 men and 33 women had stud ied up to 10 th standard or less than that. Families were mostly agriculturists wherein, 20 men had agriculture as their main occupation and 6 men had agriculture as their seco ndary occupation, as they were involved in service on contract basis at the time of inter view, but had agriculture as the main source of income for their families. All the women were housewives. As the youngest child of all the women was less than three year s old, most of these women were not able to work in the farm or acquire addition al jobs and hence only 9 of the 35 women had some secondary occupation such as farming, pet ty business or service. Majority of the couples had completed their family with either two (25/35) or three children (9/35). One couple had six children, five daugh ters before having their son. This profile of the couples is extremely congruent with a typi cal rural Maharashtrian community. It was decided to conduct the study in the rural set up be cause the aim was to learn about couple communication in a setting where there is more influence of traditions, more kinship oriented families, comparatively less expos ure to media and less access to health services. I was exposed to the study area through previous research projects and 6 Tehsil-It is an administrative unit of a District consisting of a group of villages. As an entity of local government, it exercises certain fiscal and admi nistrative power over the villages and municipalities within its jurisdiction. 7 Caste- It is a group of individuals socially stratified on t he basis of occupation, enodogamy, social culture and poiticial power. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 36 hence had rapport with local health functionaries 8 who helped in recruiting the study respondents. Some of the cases were recruited through sn owball technique (one respondent interviewed suggested the name of the othe r respondent who was either her friend or her relative). In a patriarchal society like Indian society, the life o f an individual mostly revolves around his family and marriage. Sex is 'sanctioned' only within marriage (Kanbargi and Kanbargi, 1996), which is formally arranged by elderly m embers of the kinship and most of the times, the concerned individuals have no freedom in partner selection. Contrary to the occidental cultures where relationships culminate into sexual relations, in India the entire relationship between husband and wife 'begin s' with sex (Sawant, 1996-81). Married couples are worried, especially in the beginnin g of their relationship, about rejection in sexual life and hence may avoid discussing wi th each other, topics such as family planning, sexual problems, gynecological morbidit ies and reproductive health in general. This is the crucial period of their married li fe, where open communication about such issues will actually help them in understanding each other's attitudes and behavior in relation to reproductive health and will give more strength to their relationship. With this background, married couples were included as respond ents in the study. Further, considering the operational definition of re productive health for the study, it was decided to include couples having at least one child (as i nfertility was not included in the operational definition of reproductive health related issues) and those who have undergone family planning operation. In this way, we co uld cover a range of events from conception, pregnancy, delivery, family planning up to com pletion of family. To minimize the recall bias of the respondent, it was decided to sele ct couples that have undergone the family planning operation not more than one year before the time of involving them in the study. Within this context of the study setting and the study pop ulation, the broader study aimed at exploring the details of the process of couple communication in reproductive health in rural India using a qualitative approach. T he current paper focuses on the 8 PHC staff- Auxiliary Nurse Midwife and Multi Purpos e Worker. Anganwadi workers- In India, the government runs pre-schools in all the villages under Integrated Child Development Scheme. Anganwadi workers are teachers in these pre-school who are also responsible for assisting the PHC staff to provide anti natal and post natal serv ices Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 37 process of construction and validation of the study tool - VAIG I, with the help of another male researcher who administered this tool to 35 marr ied couples. Other tools of data collection With the given background of the study sample, I though t about various options to elicit the desired information from husbands and wives. In the initial phase of preparing the study tools, various other tools such as a simple interview g uide, a '3X3 matrix' were prepared and tested at field level. I experienced chal lenges in administering these tools e.g. women felt shy to discuss their sexual relationship; men were reluctant or disinterested in talking about their personal lives etc. M oreover, to elicit information from husband and wife on sensitive issues such as their sexual r elationship, in a single session, was challenging for me. For qualitative, explor atory and sensitive research, the importance of having an in-depth interview guide was ne ver underestimated. However, I felt a need to have visual assistance to an interview gui de. Visuals methods coupled with participant narratives provide strategies to empower part icipants to define the problem of interest, encourage participants to reveal what might be uncomfortable or unknown, and identify and develop resources (Hurwoth et al 2005). Researchers have used various forms of visuals such as photogr aphs or movie clips (Petchesky 1987; Prosser, 1998; Radley and Taylor, 2003). However, use of any of these tools, for example, electronic medium with rural community, was not considered user-friendly or easy to comprehend. The option of using real life photographs or clips from local cinema involved concern about the respondents getting more involved in the personalities shown rather than thinking about the subje cts depicted and thus not being able to relate with the personalities who are considere d to be 'heroes of reel life' and not real life. Considering the seriousness of the topic and p erceptions of local people towards 'cartoon' as a form of visual, I thought it wou ld be an inappropriate idea. There was a need to have a simple, respondent-friendly and a dequately flexible tool. I felt that the most appropriate and effective tool would be combi ning use of words and drawings - in the form of sketches- close to respondents' life style de picting their day-to-day life scenes. Hand drawn pictures, sketches or images by responde nt are widely used in reproductive Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 38 Fig. 3.1 Husband-wife on the farm It would be worth understanding the process of construct ion as well as validation of this tool -VAIG at field level. 3.4 Process of construction on VAIG- Process of construction of VAIG included construction of in terview guide and visuals. The interview guide was already constructed and pilot-te sted at field level. However, having visual assistance to this interview guide and making necessary adaptations in the guide according to the visuals, involved various steps. Step 1: Choosing the form of visual I decided to use visuals in the form of hand drawn sketche s, which would reflect the respondent's day-to-day life, as closely as possible. I had pr eviously used such drawings as a resource for imparting health education in various other research projects and have always received a fruitful response from the rural commun ity. Step 2: Selecting an artist To quote Schwartz (1989- cited by Harrison 2002, 859) - 'viewing and producing of photographic imagery is a patterned social activity' and th e author emphasizes on having an understanding of everyday contexts and practices (Harrison 2002, 859). Hence the process of construction o f such a tool requires an altogether different set of skill s and expertise. In this study, the artist had experience of mo re than a decade of working with rural setting for community ba sed reproductive health related issues. He had worked extensi vely on developing visual health education material for the rural community and hence had thorough knowledge about local setting, local people, local life-style etc. For example , typical structure of the house in a village, clothing style of young people while working o n the farm, etc. Selecting an artist having such detailed knowledge about the study setting w as the first crucial step. Step 3: Same visuals for husband and wife We decided to use the same visuals for husbands and wives in order to have comparative data on various subjects. They had to be easy t o understand and interpret by men as well as women. However, considering the gender based stereotypes in Indian Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 39 Fig. 3.2. Husband-wife traveling together Fig. 3.3. Husband and wife society, it was expected that men and women would respond to these visuals differently, based on their own frame of reference, their own cu ltural background and their gender. Step 4: Taking hints from local community and exper ts During the preparatory stage of the study, local field experts hinted and suggested that 'privacy' for the couple was one of the major key determi nants for couple communication and in the rural set up, 'privacy' had various dimensio ns. From field experiences, it was observed that the number of rooms, structure of the h ouse, family size, privacy within the house, privacy on the farm, privacy outside the house, mobility of the couple, number of children, age of children, role of the mother-in-law, decision making in the household, etc. were related in 'offering privacy' to the young couple. If privacy is to be explored as a 'determinant' to study couple communication, all these dimensions of privacy should be studied. It was decided to have a series of pi ctures to depict most of these dimensions of privacy while eliciting information from th e couple. There were three different pictures- couple at home, couple on the farm and couple traveling together. Step 5: Sequencing of visuals from 'simple' to 'com plex' The next step was to decide upon whether to have sketches of individuals or scenario. A lot of discussion went into this decision, and finally we decided to follow the logic of going from 'simple' to 'complex'. The initial sections of VAIG included simple sketches of a typical rural man and woman (as shown in Fig. 3) to elicit information abou t the personality of husband and wife. In the remaining sections, the sketches depicted situations/scenarios. For example- privacy, arguments/fights between husband and wi fe, etc. We have used thought-provoking and day-to-day life scenarios. The idea was to have self-explanatory as well as easy to understand visuals to which the responden ts would be able to relate easily. Step 6: Themes of sketches The study objective was to understand details of the proce ss of couple communication in reproductive health. Obviously, this objective was a guid ing point for all the visuals. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 40 Fig 3.4. Pregnant woman Fig. 3.5. Husband-wife: Post natal period However, it was crucial to look at how these words - 'pro cess' 'communication' and 'reproductive health' - were operationally defined fo r the study purpose. a. 'Process' involved when, where, what, how, etc. abou t communication b. 'Communication' itself had various dimensions such as d irect/indirect, passive, verbal/non-verbal, and various forms such as agreement, in struction, argument, decision, etc. c. 'Reproductive health' included five issues - pregnancy, delivery, family planning, sexual relations and reproductive health related problem s. Thus sketches had to be thematically drawn considering op erational definitions of all the above terms. I had series of discussions with the artist on these themes. Step 7: Capturing cultural norms, practices and pro gram related issues through visuals However, the next step was to decide 'Under these theme s, which key issues should be depicted?' 'Pregnancy, which traditionally, is exclusively the woman's domain was one of the considerations while for constructing the visuals. Based on literature review and policy around reproductive health outcomes related to pregnancy (Razzaque, 1999; Turan, Nalbant, Bulut & Sahip, 2001); it is expected that t here should be husband-wife communication around availing anti-n atal care services, general care and support at home including her diet, rest, workload, etc. Also, there would be communi cation around practices related to fulfilling her cravings, cel ebrating her pregnancy, sending her to her natal home for 'bett er care', sexual relations during pregnancy, etc. It was important to understand whether c ouples talk to each other around events, practices and cultural norms during preg nancy, which will influence health of the mother and the child. Hence these sub-t hemes were depicted in the visuals to learn more about communication around pregnancy. One of the visuals on this subject (as shown in Fig. 4) depicted a pregnant woman- her diet, medicines, immunization, etc. To capture norms and practices during the intra and postnatal periods and consequent communication between husband and wife, we prepared a visual as shown in Fig. 5 A man and his wife with their newborn baby ( that is how new- Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 41 Fig. 3.6. Abstinence born babies are generally wrapped in a cloth in the ru ral setting ). As per the tradition, most women are sent to their natal homes for delivery an d they are expected to stay there for a period of at least five weeks after childbi rth. This period is supposed to be a period of ritual pollution 9. The husband may make brief visits to his in-laws' house to meet his wife and baby. The purpose of this visual was to understand the husband's interactions with his wife during her post-natal perio d. Step 8: Depicting sensitive subjects in a subtle wa y Preparing sketches around sensitive subjects as sexual relati ons was a challenge in itself and required a series of trials before finalizi ng the visual. For example- I gave a brief to the artist about showing 'abstinence' in th e picture. The Fig. 6 shows how we portrayed 'abstinence'. The artist sketched abstinence in many other ways-some of them were too bold to be used for the rural commu nity whereas some sketches were too abstract for comprehension. It was crucial to respect the sensitivity of the subject as well as convey a clear message so that the r espondents would be led to think about this situation. Depicting sensitive subjects in a subtle way was a time- consuming process. Moreover, I anticipated that such a vi sual may not be self- explanatory for all the respondents and hence the que stions around this visual had to take care of guiding the respondent to the desired subj ect through a series of questions such as- What do you see in this picture? Why are husband and wi fe sitting like this? (Probe) May be they have decided not to have sex for some reasons? Do es that happen in your case? Can you tell me more about it? When does it hap pen? Why does it happen? How do you decide about it? Etc. Step 9: 'Leading' scenario Some of the visuals depicted a 'leading' scenario. Ther e was a clear purpose behind having such leading sketches. It is known that 'leads' can be positively used to elicit the desired information in qualitative research. These lea ds were based on the data from community experts and my previous experience. For example - one of the places, where 9 Post-natal period of five weeks is considered to be o f 'ritual pollution'. Woman is supposed to remain in seclusion for this period of time due to t he polluting effects of childbirth. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 42 Fig. 3.7. Husband-wife having leisure husband and wife can have privacy was 'the kitchen'; an other was 'when they both travel together on a two-wheeler'. These ideas were drawn fr om common experiences of villagers and thus portrayed a leading situation for th e respondents. The visual (Fig. 7) around 'husband and w ife at leisure' may lead a respondent to think about 'is such privacy available for them', 'what happens when both of them have privacy', 'whether they spend that time in the kitchen, etc'. before they can respond about what they t alk in privacy. Hence, it was crucial to design the questions to he lp the respondent not only to react to what was depicted in the visual and but also relate it to his or her personal experience. The questions around this visual were- What do you see in this picture? Does such a situation h appen in your life? Do you have relaxed time for both of you? What do you do at such time? If not in the kitchen, are you both together at any time of the day o r night? Then what do you talk about at such times? Etc. Step 10: Ensuring connectivity and value addition b etween visuals and words As the name of the tool suggests, the visuals were expect ed to assist the in-depth interview guide and hence these sketches and the questions/ points were expected to be connected to, and have a value addition to, each other. Hence, developing visuals and questions around each of these visuals was a simultaneous pro cess and involved pre- testing in the field at each stage. The key point was to ensure that the respondents were able to have association/relation between the scenario ske tched and the questions asked, before the tool was ready for administration. Step 11: Introducing each theme in the VAIG The VAIG had different sections such as- personal and fa mily information, personality of husband and wife, general communication, pregnancy, del ivery, family planning, sexual relations, reproductive health related problems and re productive health communication with others. Each of these sub-sections except the first o ne, included a set of visuals. The information regarding the background of the respo ndents was collected with the help of structured questions, incorporated in the first section of the interview guide. A clear and brief introduction to each sub-section was an integral part of VAIG. This aimed Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 43 to navigate the respondents to the desired subject and re duce further explanations around each separate visual. Ethical considerations Since the study is about a sensitive and personal subject such as communication between husband and wife on their reproductive healt h issues, informed oral consent was sought from all the respondents. They were assured fr eedom to participate or withdraw from the study at any point without giving an y explanation to us. We ensured that the respondents were interviewed in complete priva cy and no information was revealed to any family member, friend or even the spous e. Of course, using the information collected through this study only for academi c purpose and not discussing it with and disclosing it to anyone else for any other pur pose would ensure the third important aspect- protection from harm to the responden t. 3.5 Validation of VAIG at field level An effort was made to validate the tool at field level during the process of construction and after the process of construction. The main purpose of validation was to judge whether the respondents were comfortable in understand ing and responding to the visuals. However, analysis of data collected using these visual s is beyond the scope of this paper. VAIG is an interview guide assisted by visuals and hence disc ussion around each visual started with a question- 'What do you see in this pictur e? What do you think they are talking about? Does that happen in your case? Do you expe rience this in your life? ...and so on.' In other words the visuals gave a chance to sta rt the discussion about the desired issue, firstly with the persons depicted in the vi sual and then about personal experiences of the respondent. The purpose was to elicit impersonal but realistic responses to various subjects including sensitive ones such as s exual relationship. A quote- 'If we are traveling on the vehicle, till we reach our house, our mouth is never closed. We keep talking some or the other thing, b ut not much about ...about sexual life and all. I mean [feeling shy] yes, w e do talk all these but we talk it even at home, because we have a big house.' - A farmer living in a joint family Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 44 Interpretation of visuals at field level- VAIG involved interpretation of images shown in the vis uals by the respondents and hence it was about 'making sense of meanings assigned' (Har rison 2002, 864) by the respondents. Overall responses from the couples were that they found the visuals 'easy' and that they could help them visualize the scenario, take them 'throug h' the situation and help them to remember what actually happened during that perio d in their own life. A 22-year-old housewife, living in an extended family, expressed, ' You have shown what happens in my life and it is so easy to understand what questions you are asking me '. In this case, it required very little probing. However, in some cases, questions/ probes asked around each visual, played a role in the interpretation of vi suals by the respondents. Another experience was that the respondents felt comfortable whe n they saw something that happens in their life, shown in the pictures. It was t o assure them that these things were common, especially for issues such as couples having poor commun ication, difficulties in communication on sexual issues or both of them fighti ng over some issues. The respondent's first reaction was, ' Yes, it does happen with us ,' It is possible that visuals could make certain issues/probes impersonal and less threate ning for the respondent and yet provide realistic responses. Barthes (1981) investigates the effects of photographs on the spectator and derives two concepts: studium, relating to cultural, linguistic and political inter pretation of a photograph and punctum, establishing a direct relationship with the object or person within the photograph. In the present research, some visuals were simple and respondents could establish a direct relationship easily. For example, a visual depicting contraceptive devices. On the other hand, some visuals requi red to be interpreted by the respondents within the existing cultural context. For example, Figure 6 depicting abstinence. Another example was that of a man who said after seein g the visual of husband and wife shouting/fighting with each other, ' We do fight but not so loudly as shown, or not so seriously '. Visuals acting as icebreakers for certain sensitive issues as that of sexual negotiation, violence, etc. helped to probe these issue s in depth without being offensive. It was observed that none of the variables such as the r espondent's educational background, and type of family had any relation with t he ease at which the respondent Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 45 could interpret these visuals. Men and women with less ed ucation or from a joint or extended family could interpret the visuals as comfortably a s the ones with higher education or from a nuclear type of family. It was the subject depicted or the simplicity with which the subject was depicted, which determined the level of interpretation by the respondent. For example, all types of respondents could co mfortably interpret simple visuals such as the one depicting pregnancy related care, w hereas most of them needed leads to interpret the visuals related to privacy and sexu al relations. Responses across five different main themes of RH In general depicting an abstract concept as that of com munication in a visual form was a challenge. However, the thorough introduction about t he study subject helped the respondent to understand and interpret couple communicat ion in relation to each of the five different reproductive health themes. Visuals aro und pregnancy, delivery, and to some extent family planning, were obviously less threaten ing and easy to comprehend by men as well as women. Comparatively, visuals on sensitive subjects as sexual relations, abstinence, and reproductive health related problems and communication on these matters, definitely needed more directions and p robes. However, the visuals definitely helped the respondent as well as us as resear chers to be comfortable about the subject and have detailed discussion around it. Issues related to administration of the tool The introduction before showing any visuals was crucial. I t was necessary to explain to the respondents, 'The visuals are some examples, to hel p them think about these issues. Sometimes they may see themselves in the picture and sometimes they may not'. At times, due to non-availability of adequate light, space (as some of the interviews were conducted in late evenings, in a small hut, in the fiel d etc.) we faced difficulties in showing the visuals. They either had to wait to have some alternative source of light available or had to change the venue of the interview. But it was always worth taking efforts to show them the visuals and probe further abo ut the issue. Some times, there was interference of children during t he interview and they were curious about the pictures. I would show them simple pi ctures used in the initial sub- sections of VAIG. I had to take precaution of not makin g all the visuals available to them. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 46 All the respondents expressed comfort and ease with th e visuals. To most of the respondents, we could make only one visit to complete the interview. In one session, making a couple comfortable to talk about a sensitive subje ct, to retain their interest in the subject and keep them engaged for almost an hour wa s definitely a challenge. Without having visuals it would have been difficult to face this challenge. Some of the visuals were self explanatory, such as the visua l around 'Anti-natal care for a pregnant woman' and thus required minimum probing on the part of the interviewer. This was thought to be an added advantage to elicit qu alitative information, especially from a male respondent by a male interviewer over issue s that are known to be 'women's topics'. The person, who assisted me in interviewi ng the husbands in the study, experienced a great ease in establishing rappor t with them with the help of these visuals. To quote his experience, '.... without these sketches...it would not have been so easy to talk to a man about his sexual relations and c ommunications, sitting in his bed room. These visuals really acted as ice-breakers a nd I was more comfortable to ask questions after showing the visuals .' Advantages of VAIG- Perspectives and understandings shared using visual methods p oint the way for the investigators to reconceptualize existing measures (data) w ithin a meaningful context (Keller 2008, 430). VAIG helped me in conceptualizing the entire process of husband and wife communication in reproductive health within l ocal cultural context. The respondents were able to visualize their day-to-day life at home, on the farm or outside the house and could think about when, what, ho w and where they talked to each other about reproductive health issues. Also these pict ures helped to elicit the information on process of communication in terms of time, frequency and duration and the associated norms followed by them, without much questi ons or probing- for example 'talking about personal issues only at night', 'not talkin g about sexual relations when outside the house', etc. A housewife living in a joint family reacted to the p ictures around privacy, 'This is our room. So in the night, we do get time to talk. But nothing in the daytime. How can we? People will say, \"Look at this woman. They a re married for four Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 47 years now and still......she..\". So in the daytime we talk abou t other things at home. During night, after children are fast asleep, we get privacy; we talk about all personal things at night. We have to wait. That way there is no problem of privacy.' The respondents were able to narrate their experience a nd the entire process of communication in their family around various reproducti ve health issues depicted in the visual. This in turn, helped in reducing 'recall bias' an d missing out minute details around that issue. For example, to the visual and question aro und husband's role in post-natal period of his wife, one husband replied, 'I went to meet her on the 12 th day of her delivery. Met her and came back on the same day. There were many people around, so how cou ld I talk or discuss anything with her! I could not go there often due to my job. She was there for one and a half months. That is the custom. So decisions were taken at 'higher level' in the family. I did not say anything in that ma tter.' Essential flexibility was offered to the respondent because the role of visuals was to navigate the respondent's thoughts in a particular dire ction and not to restrict his thinking to only what is depicted in the visual. Appropriate quest ions and probes were crucial to achieve this necessary flexibility. For example, there is a picture of husband and wife working on their farm and talking to each other. Some of the respondents answered, ' We do not have a farm', or 'I don't work on the farm' . It was important to lead them towards various other possible situations where they could have pri vacy. If visuals are used to elicit information in isolation, without having the ne cessary questions/ probes, it can limit the scope of eliciting information. These visuals involved concrete leads and helped me in de sensitization of respondents in sensitive subjects as sexual expectations and sexual negotia tions. The respondents gave details around the process of communication aroun d their sexual relationship, without any reservations. To quote a young woman living in an extended family- 'Is there anything wrong in having it [sex] 'the other w ay round', means woman on the top? I like it that way and he also does not hav e any problem [Feeling guilty]. We don't do it that way, everyday but once in 3- 4 months. I am sometimes worried, is it that if one does it this way, they wil l have AIDS? I cannot talk about Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 48 Fig. 3. 8 Husband wants to have sex and wife not willing for the same this to anyone. My husband anyway laughs at me because I a lways keep worrying about some or the other thing.' I felt, that bridging the gap between the responden t and myself, and building trust in the respondent's mind was very crucial. Without using visuals, th is process could not have been so effective. Deacon and Boulle (2007) had a simi lar finding about using case vignettes as an appropriate mechanism to elicit of patte rns of stigma. Specific situations such as 'Husband has gone to meet his wif e after her delivery' helped the wives in the study to remember their own experience and answer in depth about the communication process. The wives spontaneously narrated a bout communication with other family members especially with their mother and t he mother-in-law. Though it was known that these family members have an important role in the decision-making at family level, we have avoided including them in the pic ture. We worried that their inclusion in the picture could give a wrong message that they are or should be involved in the decision-making. However, the respondents could t hink beyond the subjects and objects portrayed in the visuals and their narration was not limited necessarily to the communication between spouses. The advantages of visuals were experienced also for inte rviewing couples over the most sensitive subjects such as their sexual relationship. These situations illustrated, for example, ' Husband wanting to have sex and wife not willing for the sam e' could be 'read' by the respondents and they could comprehend the situation without many explanations from the interviewer. These visuals had 'leads' but there was no harm done to the respondent's right of denying the situation depicted in this visual. There wer e responses such as ' Yes, it happens when I go close to her, she is tired or does n ot have the mood, but then I 'prepare ' her for it because I cannot sleep without having it' ; and also there were responses such as ' No, this never happens. We have it only when she wants it .' In other words, even these leading visuals could help to elicit real istic responses without having to ask any subjective or judgmental questions. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 49 3.6 Conclusion Traditional methods of data collection -both quantitat ive and qualitative- have their own strengths and weaknesses. However, both have certain limita tions in eliciting detailed information from respondents, in a less time-consuming a nd more comfortable way for the respondent as well as the researcher. Men generally do not like to talk about sensitive subjects such as marital relations in front of ot hers and hence Ortayli et al (2005) preferred conducting in-depth interviews with th em rather than conducting a focus group discussion. For studying traditional concepts and cu stoms on pregnancy, birth and post-partum in Rural Korea, Sich (1981) designed an ethnographic study involving multiple tools such as use of existing information about the family from various sources, behavioral observations and interviews which required hi m/her to visit each household between 2-8 times. Considering the scope of my study, I preferred a method that would be innovative in terms of establishing rapport with th e respondents- both men and women, within the limited time that was available, m aking them comfortable to discuss sensitive subjects such as couple communication in reprodu ctive health - and provide reliable and interpretable data. The potential of visuals as a method of data collection is widely mentioned in many disciplines since more than a decade, such as Anthropology (Collier and Collier, 1986), Pediatrics (Hanna and Jacob, 1993), Child Development ( Fury, Carlson and Sroufe, 1997), Sociology (Hughes, 1998), Reproductive Health (Do naldson, 2001) and Tourism (Garrod, 2008). Visuals not only elicit and produce lif e experiences and perceptions; but also provide tangible and very rich data that 'speaks to th e truth' in research (Keller, 2008). It is important to choose a suitable form of visual consid ering the available resources, the community under study, the subjects to be studied and t he capacity of the investigator to use this tool. As the study shows, there we re many reasons behind choosing visuals in the form of hand-drawn illustrations a s against photos or movie-clips, in a rural, less educated community. Guillemin (2004, 274) has reviewed that use of drawings as therapeutic tools and in social science research has largely been limited to children and she further suggests that the use of drawin gs as research methodology offers a potentially valuable resource for social researche rs. Drawings in the form of vignettes are extensively used in health research (Hughes, 1998; Deacon H and Boulle Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 50 A, 2007). But current study has shown that drawings used for assisting an in-depth interview for eliciting information from an individual around sensitive subject is equally useful. However, the process of construction of drawings and the interview guide needs to be considered and studied. As compared to photo-elicitation, where photographs are assembled by the investigator or produced by the particip ants and used to stimulate interview dialogue (Keller, 2008); construction of VA IG using hand-drawn illustrations is a multifaceted and multi-stepped process. Starting fro m selection of the form of visual, artist, themes and sub-themes, it expects a detailed th inking from the methodologist around the study subject- objectives, research questions and expected outcome of the study, the social and cultural context within which the study is to be conducted and programme and policy related information about the stu dy subject. Of paramount importance is to ensure that the visuals add a value to t he conventional qualitative data collection tool. Validation of VAIG at field level pointed that male as well as female respondents, irrespective of their educational and family background , could interpret the visuals and narrate their experiences around couple communication. For example, a young woman said, VAIG helped me in conceptualizing the entire proce ss of husband and wife communication in reproductive health within local cultu ral context. The respondents were offered essential flexibility while responding to sensit ive subjects like sexual communication. They were able to associate themselves with the drawings and could share life experiences with minimal reservations. The re spondents were helped to 'visualize' events around situations depicted in the draw ings and detail out the entire process of communication around that event. To conclude use of VAIG has shown that hand-drawn pic tures can subtract the respondent and replace him with the individual illustr ated and thus give impersonal yet realistic responses. Visuals sometimes replace a series of que stions and are explicit enough, whereas sometimes they play a supportive role to the questions in the interview guide. Ultimately, the data do depend on the responde nt's reactivity towards visual methodology but our experience of using a visually assisted i nterview guide with the rural couples was definitely encouraging in terms of esta blishing rapport, eliciting the necessary information and making the respondents feel c omfortable, even about sensitive topics like their sexual relationship. In this stud y, there has been one refusal Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 51 from a husband and a wife (not the same couple). Of course, the credit is due to many factors but certainly one of very important factors would be the 'visuals'. Acknowledgement I am grateful to my husband for supporting me as an artist for preparing this study tool. I appreciate the funding assistance from Swiss Tropical Insti tute for conducting this research. I would like to thank Mr. Rajendra Kale for assisting me in interviewing all the husbands in the study. Lastly, I would like to express my g ratitude towards Dr. Axel Hoffmann for his valuable contribution and inputs for this entire study. 3.7. References 1. Apte H.

Little is known about communication and fertility behavior during repr oductive span and hence this paper focuses on understanding these issues among rural mar ried couples. Methods: Qualitative exploratory research was conducted in Maharashtra. Thirty-five couples were interviewed in-depth using a Visually Assisted Interview Guide. Results: Couples talked about fertility but none of them talked about 'planning', before first child and wanted to have it at the earliest. Th ough one fourth of the husbands desired one child, the wife or the mother influenced them to alter this intention. None of the couples desired more than two children. One fourth had a third child due to family pressure and the rest took an informed and shared decisi on regarding sterilization after two children. Eight couples talked of abortion as famil y planning method, but could not do so without consulting husband's mother. Desire for more children was found to be elderly women's preference in the family. Couples discussed using contraceptive method but the husbands mainly decided its use. Conclusion: Couples' mutually sharing their fertility int entions and taking informed decisions with men's preference for small family size indica tes the process of social change, which should be considered from programmatic per spective. Key words: couple communication, behavior, fertility, rur al 4.2. Introduction Since the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD, 1994), there has been a clear emphasis on empowering couples to decide about their own reproductive health related issues, including fertility. However, studies (Ayaga 2002, Sharma 2002) have shown that couples can be empowered to take such decisions, in a more planned and responsive way only if they are encourag ed to interact and communicate these issues with each other. Total Fertili ty Rate (TFR) and Contraceptive Prevalence have been short-listed as indicators for monito ring reproductive health in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG-2000). Numerous stra tegies and efforts are put towards involving men in having a shared decision about f ertility. There have been numerous studies of couples around fert ility and parenthood and various other issues such as preference for sterilization, ( Rutenberg and Landry, 1993); Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 59 gender equality, fatalism and couple communication on spousal agreement about pregnancy wantedness (Digest, IFPP, 2004) and men's atti tude and behavior and couples' fertility (Bankole, 1998). However, it is well kn own that socio-cultural context and gender-based norms influence husband-wife intera ctions and their fertility decision making (Gipson and Hindin, 2007). In India, various st udies are conducted around couples' fertility behavior. Zavier and Padmadas (2000), based on the NFHS-1 data, mentioned about characteristics of couples from Kerala, wh o used a spacing method before sterilization. Another study by Padmadas, Hutte r and Willekens (2004) based on NFHS-2 data showed that a lack of interspousal communi cation about family planning is associated with a shorter reproductive span explaining t he low level of use of modern contraceptives to space births. A survey in Uttar Pradesh (Ste phenson, Koenig & Ahmed, 2006) pointed towards the association of domesti c violence and contraceptive adoption focusing on gender-role attitudes and communi ty norms around domestic violence. Summarizing, studies have mainly highlighted d eterminants of fertility behavior such as male involvement, gender equality, and domestic violence, desire to have sterilization; however, very little is known about how ma rried couples in a rural set up of India, discuss and decide about fertility at various point s on the life span of reproduction. Current paper focuses on understanding of married coup les' communication and behavior related to fertility in rural Maharashtra. 4.3. Methodology Maharashtra is India's second largest state in terms of i ts population (more than 96 millions). More than 50% of the population lives in ru ral areas and the state has a Hindu majority (72%). Pune is one of six divisions of Maharashtr a state having a population of more than 19 millions. The current study was conducted in one of the tehsils of Pune district, Maval with a population of around 300 thousan d, spread among 184 villages. The Tehsil is surrounded by Western Ghats and the Mumbai -Pune Express Way cuts through the Tehsil. It is one of the fastest developing Tehsils of Pune district, with many upcoming industries, educational institutes, plant nur series and floriculture. Most of the villages have geographical access by road. There are two ma in towns in the Tehsil, where most of the private medical practitioners, privat e multi-specialty hospitals, markets and shops are clustered. As is common for the rest of the state, the study site demonstrates a strong presence of public health system th rough Primary Health Centres (PHC) and Rural Hospital (RH). Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and Multi Purpose Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 60 Worker (MPW) and Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) workers are the grass root level health providers for provision of Ante Natal and Post Natal Services. In spite of the development that has taken place in th is Tehsil due to urbanization, the area still represents a rural site dominated by kinship o riented Maratha caste agrarian community of Western Maharashtra. Most of the families ar e either joint or extended. It is a patriarchal society, where families are mostly heade d by men, who play a significant role in decision-making in the family. Married couples a re worried, especially in the beginning of their relationship, about rejection in sexual life and hence may avoid discussing with each other, topics such as fertility, sexual problems, gynecological morbidities and reproductive health in general. The broader study aimed at understanding the process of co uple communication in reproductive health. It was a community-based study and i nvolved in-depth interviews of 35 married couples. Data was collected between 2006 and 2008. Current paper is drawn from this broader study with a focus on couple commun ication and behavior regarding fertility. Sample selection Fertility decision-making involves decisions about when to h ave the first child, spacing between two children, number of children, sex composit ion of children, using spacing methods of contraception, using terminal method of co ntraception. To cover this entire spectrum of fertility related issues, the current study has focused on 35 married couples that have at least one child and have used a terminal method of contraception (female sterilization). To minimize the recall bias of the respon dent, it was decided to select couples that have undergone sterilization not beyond one year at the time of involving them in the study. The researcher was exposed to the study a rea through previous research projects and hence had rapport with local hea lth and development functionaries 10 who helped in recruiting the study respondents. The sam ple represents the rural community of the study area, in terms of caste, occupation, educational background of men and women and type of family. 10 Staff at the Primary Health Centre- The Auxiliary Nurs e Midwife and the Multipurpose Worker and workers at the Anganwadi run by Integrated Child Development Scheme, together maintain the record of sterilization of couples in their work ar ea. Based on these records, they helped the researcher to recruit the necessary sample. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 61 Study tools The broader study involved a preparatory phase where key i nformants from the community were interviewed in-depth in order to learn about norms and patterns of couples communication and behavior regarding reproducti ve health. This phase helped in designing the tool for interviewing selected couples i n the study. Married couples were interviewed with the help of a Visually Assisted Intervi ew Guide (VAIG). The tool was simultaneously administered to husband and wife (in absen ce of each other, separately) by male and female researchers respectively. The tool involv ed picture cards having hand-drawn illustration of day-to-day life scenario and an in-depth interview guide around the scenario. It covered various aspects of reprod uctive health, fertility being one of those. The tool also included questions on personal data of the couples, socio- demographic details, information about family and a se ries of questions around general process of inter spouse communication including time, dura tion, content of communication, determinants etc. Ethical considerations Since the study is about a sensitive and personal subject such as communication between husband and wife about their reproductive hea lth issues, informed verbal consent was sought from all the respondents. They were ass ured freedom to participate or withdraw from the study at any given point if they we re willing to do so without giving any explanation to the researcher. The researcher ensured that the respondents were interviewed in complete privacy and no information was revealed to any of the family member, friends or even the spouse. Of course, using the information collected through this study only for academic purpose and not discussing it w ith and disclosing it to anyone else for any other purpose would ensure the thi rd important aspect about protection from harm to the respondent. 4.4. Results The results are presented around profile of the coupl es and progression of fertility related communication and behavior on the life span of reproduction. Profile of the couples Following the sample selection criterion, all the coup les were married and had undergone sterilization (female sterilization) not more than a year ago at the time of the interview. All the couples were Hindu and most of them lived in either a joint (7/35) or an Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 62 extended family (20/35). Families were mostly agrarian (26/35) and some (6/35) had business of dairy or plat nursery. Few men were also worki ng in the nearby industries on a contract basis. Out of 35 men, 26 had studied up to 10th standard or less than that. All the women were housewives and some of them were addit ionally involved in agriculture. Majority of the couples had completed their family with two children (26/35) 11 . Men were in the age group of 25-46 and women were in the age group of 20-36. This profile of the couples is extremely congruent with a typical rural Maha rashtrian community, as stated in the NFHS-III. 1. Before the birth of the first child- In the traditional Indian society, a woman is expected to be a 'mother' after marriage, at the earliest and thus has to 'prove' her fertility. Wi th this notion, most of the couples in the study wanted to have their first child as early as possib le. They rarely discussed about 'waiting' before having their first child, or ' planning' about having the first baby. At this stage, most of the communication between the coupl es evolved around waiting for the wife to conceive. A 32-year-old woman living in an extended agrarian fa mily said, \" In our house, we normally follow the pollution period and I sit asid e during my periods. During those days, we keep a vessel upside down in one corner o f the house. Every time, I would keep that vessel, my husband would ask, \"O h, you again had it?\" An important family member who was involved in communic ation at this stage was the mother-in-law of the woman. Most of the women (26/35 ) mentioned about missing periods first to the mother-in-law along with her hus band. The mother-in-law instructed the husband to take his wife to a doctor to confirm pr egnancy; except in case of nuclear family where the communication took place only between t he husband and the wife. We enquired about communication between husband and w ife over the disclosure of pregnancy. Most of the husbands were 'happy' to hear abou t wife's pregnancy. When asked the wives, most of them mentioned that their husba nds were naturally happy about it however, it was something expected by them. As a 26-year-old housewife living in a joint family sa id, \" He felt good because anyways we never wanted to wait before having our first baby.\" 11 National Family Health Survey III- Total Fertility R ate for Rural Maharashtra is 2.31. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 63 To summarize, none of the spouses in the study, talked to each other around 'planning', before having their first child and all of them wante d to have their first child as early as possible after getting married. Mother-in-law in the family was a crucial individual in guiding the couple to go for pregnancy confirmation. 2. After the first child It was evident that mostly husband and wife started tal king about spacing or planning about children, only after they had their first child, irrespective of whether it was a boy or a girl. In case of half of the couples, communication a bout spacing was initiated by a health provider-either the doctor where the wife had her first delivery, or the village nurse, who came home for advice on contraception. Furthe r, between the husband and the wife, the wife initiated communication with her h usband by conveying the message of health provider to him. As one of the wives, a 24-year-old farm laborer living in an extended family mentioned, \" The nurse who comes home for immunization had told me. So I wanted to insert a Cu-T [IUD]. Husband said, \"Why to go for all these things? We should reduce our 'relations' [sex] . That is it. Why Cu-T and all. Woman's health declines due to that (tambine zizte baai).\" So I did not use it, but we followed 'that' [sexual abstinence].\" The remaining couples spontaneously discussed contraception after their first childbirth. A 27-year-old housewife living in a joint family said, \"We both said, \"Let Karan [their first son] be big enough.\" Also he would frequently have fever. So we said, \"Let his health improve\". Both of us decided that till he becomes big we would not have a second one. I decided to use Cu-T with the advice from the doctor who came to our village. Husband said, \"Okay, do t hat.\" A husband- 30-year-old farmer living in an extended fam ily- said, \" After our first child, she got her periods after 10-11 months. See first time, after marriage she conceived after two and a half years. So we did not th ink it necessary to wait before having the second child though she did talk to m e about using a Cu-t. [Pause] We did not use anything and she got pregnant again i n that same month [of having her periods].\" Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 64 Communication between husband and wife about using a spacing method was initiated either by a health provider or the couple themselves, b ut the decision about whether to use a contraceptive method or not was dominated by husb ands. However, there were eleven couples in the study, who discu ssed about going for sterilization at this stage, i.e. after having one child , irrespective of the sex of the first child. It is important to note that out of these eleve n couples, in case of nine couples, it was the husband who was keen to have only one child but either his wife or his parents insisted for having another one. These couples had commun ication regarding family size and sterilization but for one or the other reason, deci ded to have more children. A 26-year-old illiterate housewife living in a nuclear family said, \" I had high blood pressure and convulsions during my first delivery and had to have a caesarian. My husband decided that I should have operat ion [sterilization] after having one daughter, but I insisted for having a second one. We had our second daughter .\" A 30-year-old driver studied up to 10 th standard living in an extended family, told his wife after having their first son, \" I think you should have operation [sterilization]. I am not sure about my job. We should give good educat ion to one child, \" but his mother convinced the couple to have the second child and they had one more son. In other words, though one fourth of the husbands (9/3 5) talked to their wives about limiting their family to one child, the wife or the m other influenced them to alter their decision and they had more than one child. 3. During second pregnancy- Abortion as a method of planning family The second point of communication about spacing was when the wife already conceived second time. There were five couples who talked about ab ortion in second pregnancy as a means to adhere to their desire of spacing or limitin g family. Three couples had discussion about going for abortion for spacing. A 23-year-old housewife studied up to 9 th standard living in an extended family mentioned, \" My husband took me to a private doctor and asked me to ta ke an injection. I did so. We talked to each other about th is and did not tell my mother-in-law because my husband said that she would no t let us do this [abort the child]. It did not 'drop'. Later my mother-in-law came to kn ow about it and Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 65 got angry with my husband and me. \" This woman had her second child when the first one was less than two years old. The remaining two couples talked about going for ab ortion to limit the family. A 27-year-old housewife living in an extended family n arrated, \" That time, my husband even said about going for curetting. But then every one at home said, \"It is like a murder (hatya), isn't it when it is five months!\" So nobody at home was willing for that and so he also did not say much a nd I continued .\" Though these five couples talked to each other about ha ving an abortion as a method of family planning, they could not decide about it withou t talking with other family member, especially the mother-in-law. Ultimately, the mother-in -law did not let the couple have abortion and thus none of the couples actually had one. 4. After the birth of the second child All the 35 couples had communication after the birth of their second child regarding whether the wife should go for sterilization or have a third child. In all, 26 couples talked to each other about going for sterilization at diffe rent points of time and for different reasons and then opted for sterilization. Following are some quotes to explain this further- A 25-year-old housewife who studied up to 7 th standard, living in a joint family said, \" My husband was standing outside the room when I had my second delivery. I asked him to help me. I was shouting. He did not realize that I had delivered. Then he came in. He saw all that. Then he told me, \"You have had enough of pain. No more children now.\" I had operati on a year after that.\" A 24-year-old factory worker studied up to 9 th standard living in an extended family said , \"We had already done the mistake during second time [they had an unsuccessful attempt of aborting the child and the wife continued her second pregnancy]. So even before the second child was born, my mother h ad told us, \"Have this one and then go for operation\". After my wi fe's delivery, my mother started talking about it at home. My wife had her oper ation after 4-5 months of her delivery. My mother decided everything about that .\" A 25-year-old housewife who studied up to 7 th standard, living in a joint family said, \" Though we decided to have only two children, I had my operation when our second child-daughter was two and a half years old. We both had decided that. We did not have relations almost for one and a half years .\" In other words, 26 couples shared with each other, thei r views, reasons and intensions regarding having sterilization. They discussed about the sa me at various points, either Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 66 during second pregnancy, during second delivery or later and took an informed and shared decision regarding limiting their family size. The remaining 9 out of 35 couples talked about having a third child and hence discussed about spacing after the birth of their second child. A 26-year-old farmer studied up to 5 th standard living in a joint family said , \"After having a son and a daughter, I wanted to have operation, so did my husband. But other family members did not want it. He listened to them. They asked us to have one more and we did so. What to do...but after the third one, I insisted for it. That time my mother-in-law also agr eed for it.\" A 31-year-old Anganwadi worker living in an extended family said, \" After two daughters, my mother-in-law wanted me to have at least one son. That time, my husband and I had a fight. Other family members scol ded me for not listening to them. Finally I told my husband, \"I will go for the third. If it is a boy, no problem; but even if not, I will still go for oper ation.\" Then everyone agreed. I had a son .\" In case of these nine couples, the wives wanted to limit the family and they communicated their intention to the husband as well a s the mother-in-law but were convinced by them for having one more child. All the 35 couples had communication regarding limit ing their family size after two children. However, in case of eleven couples in spite of having communication about this issue between the spouses, elder family members overruled t he decision-making and convinced the couple to have their third child. 5. During third pregnancy- Abortion as a method of planning family Out of the nine couples that had more than two childr en, three couples talked about going for abortion during third pregnancy. A 26-year-old housewife studied up to 10 th standard (wife of the former political leader in the village) said , \" My mother-in-law wanted me to have a son. When I conceived the third time, after having two daughters, I wanted to go for abortion after checking the sex of the baby. Husband did not want it. We argued over it for quite a long time. Finally it was my fifth month, when we went to the doctor. The doctor was not ready for aborting it and I had thi rd daughter. Then I went for operation .\" Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 67 A 23-year-old illiterate housewife living in an extend ed family said, \" My husband and me talked about it when I had already conc eived. My brother-in- law told me, \"You can take those pills [oral pills for abortion]\" but my husband said, \"No, why to kill the baby? We will have it, whate ver it may be!\" I wanted to go for operation after having two daughters; even my h usband was willing for that. But my mother-in-law did not allow us. My husba nd generally does not disobey her. So I had a third child, a son. \" A 28-year-old housewife studied up to 9 th standard living in a joint family said, \"After having two daughters, when I conceived for the th ird time, I told my husband, \"Now we have had two daughters, so we should check what is the sex of the baby. Even if it is an infanticide, we have to think about our future, so we should go for check-up.\" I decided everything on my ow n and he agreed for it .\" She had two abortions because it was a female fetu s12 . Thus, during the third pregnancy, three out of the nin e couples talked about abortion after checking the sex of the child and the remaining six couples, did not had any communication regarding sterilization or limiting thei r family size or going for abortion during this pregnancy. 4.5. Discussion Talking about fertility, involved number and sex compositi on of children and spacing between two children. Husband and wife communicated ab out fertility at various stages during reproductive life span. Couples did not really di scuss about fertility before having their first child. As Chaudhury (1983) mentioned, all o f them wanted to have their first child as early as possible and shared this intention with each other. They discussed with each other mainly about expectations and concerns aroun d wife's conception and proving fertility to the family and society. In this sens e, this first point was considered to be crucial on the life span of reproduction, since in I ndian context, status of the couples, especially the married woman, is associated with her abili ty to prove fertility at the earliest. Obviously, couples were not expected to discuss about spacing before proving 12 In India, as per the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994, section 6, determination of sex is prohibited and Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MT P Act 1971) does not permit female infanticide. However, due to strong son preference, small family norm, practices like tradition of giving dowry (gifts by father of bride in cash or prop erty to the groom), laws that govern property inheritance and the cultural perception about the fami lial name through the male line, female infanticide still exists, though it is illegal. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 68 their motherhood and fatherhood to the society. This ma y justify husbands in the study reacting casually over disclosure of wife's conception. It was evident that mostly husband and wife started tal king about spacing or planning about children, only after they had their first child, irrespective of whether it was a boy or a girl. A health provider, either the doctor where t he wife had her delivery, or the village nurse who came home for advice on contraception, was crucial in initiating communication between husband and wife. However, some co uples spontaneously discussed using a contraceptive method and the husbands w ere not much in favor of it. It is known that women often are not the sole decision-m akers about the use of contraception (Network, 1998). Varkey et al (APHA 2002) have mentioned that while services concentrate on women with female only methods, studies show that decision making still remains in the hands of male partners or f amily elders. This study points out that men should be equally informed and counseled abo ut use of contraception, if its acceptance has to increase. Husbands were not necessarily the ones who preferred to h ave more children. Couple communication after first childbirth points towards the fact that one fourth of the husbands who participated in the study were satisfied with having one child, irrespective of the sex of the child 13 and talked about it with their wives. However, they w ere convinced by the wives or mothers and decided to have more than one child. It shows that despite the secondary status of the women in the so ciety, fertility being women's domain, they rule the decision-making (which was supporte d by key informants' interviews conducted in the preparatory phase of the br oad study). Similar was the finding in a study carried out among rural Mali women (Madhavan, Adams & Simon, 2003) where older women as gatekeepers were found to encourage high fertility. Communication about abortion as a method of family pl anning, during second or third pregnancy showed that husband's mother had a crucial role as a decision maker. Ravindran and Balasubramanian (2004) in their study a mong rural women in Tamil Nadu, India found that decision of abortion for spacin g was mainly taken by the woman who sought support for the same from her mother-in- law. In present study as well, though husband and wife discussed with each other rega rding abortion, none of them had it because of not being supported for the same b y husband's mother. High fertility is found to be a preference of women, especially the elde r women in the family and the study emphasizes on importance of involving elder family women in the family planning 13 National Family Health Survey-III- Total wanted fertility rate for rural Maharashtra is 1.79. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 69 initiatives. Similar was the recommendation by Madhavan , Adams and Simon (2003) who suggested that reproductive health programmes shoul d consider woman's larger social networks including the social gatekeepers such as the mother-in-law. Reproductive health program considers 'percentage of wo men with two children wanting not more children' as one of the key indicators of measu ring success (NFHS-III). Further, men's and women's desire to limit childbearing is also con sidered as the indicators. More than 20% of men and women in the age group of 15-49 from rural Maharashtra desire to limit childbearing after one child (NFHS-I II). Similar to this finding, present study shows that men do intend to have less children (even one child of any sex) and do communicate the same to their wives, however they are no t able to translate this into reality due to family pressure. However, men influence decision in terms of adoption of temporary method of contraception having their own rat ionale behind the same and discuss these issues with their wife. Hence, couple communicat ion about adoption of contraception, fertility intentions and decision-making pr ocess in the family, should also be given due consideration by programme. 4.6. Conclusion Fertility communication among couples and shared decision -making indicates the beginning of the process of social change. This finding ne ed to be appreciated in the context of the exploratory nature of the study and the st udy sample, which represents a rural kinship oriented agrarian society of Maharashtr a, where elderly women continue to dominate fertility related decisions. Hence, it is import ant to promote couple communication about fertility, but equally important is to create an enabling environment for them to take informed decisions in a mutually shared manner. As ICPD defines- 'Reproductive health implies that people ......have the cap ability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. ' 4.7. References 1. Ayaga, B. 2002.

Abstract Introduction- In societies, where explicitly discussing sex is considered a taboo, couples fail to express about sex to their partners and women ta ke a passive role. In the context of importance of communication in sexual relationship a nd prevailing gender norms in the society of India, this paper aims to understand rura l married couples' responses about their sexual communication and behavior. Methods- It was a qualitative exploration conducted in r ural community of Maharashtra near Pune. Couples (n=35) were interviewed in-depth w ith the help of a Visually Assisted Interview Guide with hand-drawn pictures. Results- Couples' responses about taking initiative and d ecision-making in sex, initiation and reasons for sexual abstinence were studied. One fou rth of the women expressed their desires to have sex to their husbands and more tha n two third of the men and women narrated having mutually consented sex. Non-consens ual sex was differentiated from 'forced sex' and men and women had different per spectives of narrating these types of sexual experience. Men and women had differen t reasons to initiate sexual abstinence. Conclusion- Despite all the values and stereotypes, women' s sexual desire becoming vocal, heard and to an extent, respected by partners is po sitive. Sexual communication surely has cascading effect on issues such as domestic violence and gender power relations. Health programmes should build upon the cha nging trend and promote young married couples to discuss sex, not only in the context of r educing 'risk' but also as a 'healthy' foundation for marital relationship. Key words - couples, rural, India, sex, stereotypes, sexuality, ge nder, communication 5.2. Introduction Worldwide, since many years, importance of communication about sexual relationship between spouses has been studied in relation to variou s factors such as sexual satisfaction (Cupach and Comstock, 1990) and emotional w ell being of women (Ferroni and Taffe, 1997). However, women's capacity to discuss repr oductive health matters is found to be associated with equality of women with men (Becker and Robinson, 1998; King Robert G., 1979) and frequent spousal communicatio n is likely to promote gender equality in control over sexuality between married par tners. (Onipede and Uche, 2007). Traditionally, men have a stronger cultural prerogat ive than women in initiating and negotiating sexual relationship (Mason, 1994; Balmer et al 1995) and also they are more Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 75 likely to report having sex with their spouses (Ghuman, 20 05). In India, where 'explicitly discussing sex is considered a taboo', couples fail to expre ss their sexual desires, expectations and problems freely to their partners. Becau se emotional ties between spouses are considered a potential threat to the solidar ity of the patrilineal group, there is a tendency to limit communication between spouses (World Bank, 1996-46). Because of family pressure, peer pressure, cultural values and nor ms; couples most often do not understand the importance of communication throughout their life and especially at the beginning of their married life. Moreover, gender no rms have always dictated women to take a passive role in sex and not express about sexual desire s openly. In the context of importance of communication in sexual relationship and prevailing gender norms in the society of India, this paper aims to understand rural ma rried women's responses about their sexual communication and behavior with husband. The paper focuses on two issues -initiation and decision making in sex and sexual abs tinence-'when to have sex or when not to have sex.' In India, sex is sanctioned within marriage which is a fo rmal alliance arranged by family members. Relationship between husband and wife \"begins\" with sex consequent to marriage. Both spouses are worried about rejection in sexual life and its consequences and hence may avoid discussing sex. Goyal (2001) has mention ed about ambivalence and inhibition in the mind of even educated people and further expresses the need for 'dialogue' for enabling environment in this regard. C oncepts of masculinity and femininity are constructed since childhood and greatly influence mar ital relationships. Gender norms often dictate that women and girls should be igno rant and passive about sex, which greatly constrains their ability to negotiate saf er sex or access appropriate services (Garg & Sharma, 2006). While men are expected t o, by and large, remain within the confines of a monogamous marriage, there is social indifference to their indulging in extra-marital sex, whereas female sexuality is defined as something threatening to society and requiring male control (Rama subban 1995-217,18 & 35). Traditional rural society is hierarchical and dominated by men and its patrilineal and patrilocal structures have important implications for wom en such as on their autonomy to decide about their reproductive careers. Men generally b elieve that sex within marriage is their right. Women are supposed to play a passive role and not assert about their rights related to sexual behavior and sexual health or even discuss sex openly. Ravindran and Balasubramanian (2004) in Tamil Nadu, I ndia, have studied about rural married women's sexual rights and ability or inability t o refuse sex. A study conducted in Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 76 rural Thane district of Maharashtra (Balaiah, Ghule et al, 2001) points out towards poor communication between husband and wife around family planning and men taking their own decisions in this regard. This study though not directl y involving sexual behavior issues indicates towards need to learn about women's ex periences in reproductive health area. Evidence extrapolated primarily from qua litative studies suggests that patriarchal norms, power imbalances and women's inabil ity to negotiate sexual matters may increase young women's risk of nonconsensual sexual exp eriences (Jeejebhoy and Bott, 2006). Another study of married women's sexual r elations in Indian context, conducted in Gujarat and West Bengal (Santhya et al 20 07) focuses upon coerced sex within marriage. Gender stereotypes in sexuality, ab out submissive females and powerful males, may restrict access to health information , hinder communication and encourage risky behavior among women and men in differe nt but equally dangerous way (Verma and Mahendra 2004- 74). The issues related t o sexual negotiations within marriage were studied in urban settings of Mumbai by Ge orge (1998), who found that women felt that it was not appropriate for them to express their sexual needs. Despite the heterogeneity in terms of cultural practices and traditions, gender stereotypes seem to overrule the sexual behavior and com munication of young married men and women, across India. Very few studies are based on qualitative explorations among rural married couples around the issues of sexu al communication and behavior. The review of studies across India and in other developing countries thus generates the need to explore what and how rural married couples re spond about their sexual life experiences- in terms of initiation, negotiation and d ecision-making. 5.3. Methodology Study site Maharashtra is India's second largest state in terms of i ts population (more than 96 millions). More than 50% of the population is rural a nd the state has a Hindu majority (72%). Pune is one of six divisions of Maharashtra state h aving a population of more than 19 millions. Present study was conducted in Maval- on e of the tehsils of Pune district covering a population of around 300 thousand, sp read among 184 villages. The Tehsil is surrounded by Western Ghats and the Mumbai-Pu ne Express Way cuts through the Tehsil. It is one of the fastest developing Tehsils of Pune district, with many upcoming industries, educational institutes, plant nur series and floriculture. Most of the Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 77 villages have geographical access by road. There are two ma in towns in the Tehsil, where most of the private medical practitioners, privat e multi-specialty hospitals, markets and shops are clustered. In spite of the development that has taken place in th is Tehsil due to urbanization; the area still represents a typical rural site dominated by kinship oriented Maratha caste 14 agrarian community. Most of the families are either j oint or extended. It is a typical patriarchal society, where families are mostly headed by m en, who play a significant role in decision-making in the family. Contrary to the occident al cultures where relationships culminate into sexual relations, in a typical rural so ciety in India, the relationship between husband and wife \"begins\" with sex. Study tools Present paper is drawn from a broader study that aimed at understanding the process of couple communication in reproductive health. It was a co mmunity-based study and involved a preparatory phase where key informants from t he community (n=10) were interviewed in-depth in order to learn about pattern s of couples communication and behavior regarding reproductive health. This phase help ed in designing the tool for interviewing selected couples in the study. In all, 35 m arried couples were interviewed in-depth. Because couple communication and sexual rela tionship are issues \"behind close doors\", researcher used an innovative tool labele d as Visually Assisted Interview Guide (VAIG). The tool involved picture cards having han d-drawn illustration of day-to- day life scenario and an in-depth interview guide arou nd the scenario. It covered various aspects of reproductive health, sexual relationship bei ng one of those. The tool also included personal data of the couples, socio-demographic d etails, information about family and a series of questions around general process of inter spouse communication including time, duration, content of communication, det erminants etc. The tool was simultaneously administered to husband and wife (in absen ce of each other, separately) by male and female researchers respectively. Sample selection and recruitment of couples To cover the entire spectrum of reproductive health rela ted issues- pregnancy, delivery, family planning, sexual relations and reproductive heal th problems; present study 14 Caste- It is a group of individuals socially stratifi ed on the basis of occupation, enodogamy, social culture and political power. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 78 focused on married couples that have at least one child and have used a terminal method of contraception (female sterilization 15 ). To minimize the recall bias of the respondent, it was decided to select couples that have u ndergone sterilization, not beyond a period of one year at the time of involving t hem in the study. The study was conducted in the area of three (out of six) Primary Heal th Centres (PHC) selected randomly. The PHC staff requested Village Health Funct ionaries (VHF) 16 to assist the researcher in recruitment of couples, based on the reco rds of female sterilization maintained by them. Couples following the sample selecti on criteria regarding the time of female sterilization were short listed and then contact ed by the VHF. Couples, who verbally gave consent to the VHF participate in the study, were then approached by the researcher for conducting interview. In all forty-one c ouples were identified for interviews, but four of them were not available (husb and and wife to be available at the same time for interview) for interview. There were two respondents (one male and one female, not husband and wife), who refused to parti cipate in the interview at this stage without giving any convincing reason for the same. Ethical considerations Since the study is about a sensitive and personal subject of communication between husband and wife about their reproductive health issue s, informed verbal consent from the respondent was obtained at two levels, firstly by t he VHF before recruiting them in the study and then by the researcher before starting th e interview. They were assured freedom to participate or withdraw from the study at any given point. The time and place for conducting the interview was decided by the couples a nd the researcher occasionally had to make multiple visits to respect their decision. The researcher ensured that the respondents were interviewed in complete privacy and no information was revealed to any of the family member, friends or even the spouse. O f course, using the information collected through this study only for academic purpose and not discussing it with and disclosing it to anyone else for any other purpose would ensure the protection from harm to the respondent. 15 Female sterilization is the commonly accepted terminal m ethod of contraception and village health functionaries maintain the record of each woman who undergoes sterilization, irrespective of the place of sterilization, i.e. whether she had i t in a public hospital or a private provider. 16 Village health functionaries- Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and Anganwadi worker- Government run preschools present in every village .

Out of 35 couples, 26 men and 33 women had st udied up to 10 th standard or less than that. Families were mostly agriculturists wherein , 20 men had agriculture as their main occupation and 6 men had agriculture as the ir secondary occupation. These six men were involved in service on contract basis at the ti me of interview, but had agriculture as the main source of income for their fam ilies. All the women were housewives. As their youngest child was less than three year s old, most of these women were not able to work in the farm or acquire additio nal job and hence only 9 of the 35 17 Nuclear family- Husband-wife and their unmarried child ren Joint family- Husband-wife, husband's parents and chil dren Extended family- Husband-wife, husband's parents and children, unmarried or married sibling/s and / or other relatives Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 80 Fig. 5.1 Husband is willing to have sex.. women had some secondary occupation as farming, petty busi ness or service. Majority of the couples had completed their family with either t wo (25/35) or three children (9/35). One couple had six children, five daughters before having their son. This profile of the couples is extremely congruent with a rural Western Mahar ashtrian community. There are some additional characters of these couples important from the point of view of learning about their sexual communication and beha vior. Women were asked about the nature of their husband and about themselves. The re were 21 out of 35 women whom perceived that they were more talkative than their husbands, whereas almost half of the women (17/35) felt that they had 'free' commu nication with their husband about sexual relations. Sex being a very intimate and sensitive issue, even talking about it assumes 'privacy for the partners' as a pre requisite. Henc e women were further asked a series of questions to learn about privacy available for t he couple. There were six women who perceived lack of privacy as a problem for commu nication with spouse, for reasons such as presence and dominance of mother-in-law, long work hours of the husband, or lack of private space. However, their husban ds did not perceive any problem related to having privacy. 5.4.2. Communication about sex Married couples' responses regarding their sexual commun ication and behavior are presented here around two issues- A. Initiative and decisi on making in sexual relationship and B. sexual abstinence i.e. about ' when to have or not have sex and why' . The most common place and time of the day to have sex or even discuss about it, was 'inside the house' (not on the farm) and 'only during night'. Hence, couples' responses need to be considered in this context of the most comm on practice of sexual behavior and communication. 5.4.2.1. Initiation and decision making in sexual r elationship In a traditional rural Indian society, husband-wife relationship is a patterned behavior and woman, especially in her married sexual relationship, is expected to take a passive role and agree to her husband's desires and instructions. Stereotypes around masculinity and femininity prevalent in the society, even today, demand this passive role from Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 81 the married woman. In this context, the study focused on understanding responses from men and women about initiation and decision-making in sexual relationship. For eliciting this information, as shown in Figure 5. 1.- a picture card portrayed a scenario- \" Husband is willing to have 'sex' whereas wife does not want it... then \"- With a series of probe questions around this picture, women were led to respond regarding their personal experience in such situation. This was definitely a lead ing scenario, however, women responded about not necessarily only in congruence with what was depicted, but explained the process of initiation of sex, negotiation between two of them and decision- making. Initiating sex In the case of almost 3/4 th of the couples, it was always the husband who initiat ed sex either because he preferred it that way or because t he woman did not like to take initiative. \" I never take the lead, never. I don't like it. I don't wish to have sex. It is both, I don't have the wish and also I don't know how to say it. Generally I myself never have the wish to start it. I don't like to have it. Bu t when he wants....I like it \"- An illiterate woman from a joint family, whose husband is a farmer \"Generally I take the lead. She [wife] sleeps on the floor with the children and my mother. I sleep on the bed. When I want it, I whisper and call her on the bed... late night when the children and the mother are fast asleep. So she comes on the bed...we do the 'practical' and get rid of it. Then she goes back and sleeps with the children. \" A 30-year-old farmer and a seasonal worker in sugar factory studied up to 9 th standard living with his wife, mother and children in a one-room house. In rest of the couples, wives occasionally took initiative in sex; however the husbands decided about agreeing to or refusing it. \"I say 'it' to him sometimes. But if he is not tired, he agrees and if he is tired, he tells me, \"I am feeling very tired today. Let us sleep .\" So we talk to each other about it .\"- A housewife from a joint family studied up to 9 th standard, whose husband is a farmer and has a business of fodder. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 82 When probed for reasons for not taking initiative, men mentioned about 'shyness' or in general 'less desire on her part to have sex' as the rea sons for not taking initiative in sex. Women in addition to these reasons responded abo ut fear about denial for sex from husband and feeling of ' awkwardness ' about ' woman asking for sex from husband'. However, no clear explanation or reason was found from the coupl es about what motivates women for at least initiating sex though occasi onally. None of the women, who occasionally took initiative in sex, perceived any problem i n having privacy for sexuality related communication. Decision about whether to have sex or not- The detailed narration of couples showed that there were three different dimensions of decision-making in sex, consensual sex, forced sex and non-c onsensual sex. Non- consensual sex was differentiated from forced sex. There were almost 1/3 rd couples, where wives who mentioned about having sex only upon mutual agreement and never having a forced sex. \"If I am tired and want to sleep, he never forces me. I don't need to say anything. He reads my face and say, \"Okay, go to sleep now.\" Since be ginning, he had understood me about these things. Yes, sometimes he tease s me, \"You don't have much \"interest\"; but does not get angry about it. He never fights with me over that. In fact he is like...when I am tired and I go to serve him food, he looks at me and says, \"You go and sleep, I will take the food myself.\"- A housewife studied up to 9 th standard, from an extended family, whose husband works i n a private company. Importantly there was not much discrepancy in the respons es from husbands of these women around having mutually agreed sex. In case of a small number of couples, women responded abo ut being \"forced\" by husbands for having sex, however their husbands had a d ifferent perception about their sexuality related communication and experience. \"Once I had bleeding for almost fifteen days. He knew it but he does not follow any such thing [whispered] even if I am having bleeding and if he wants it, he wants it, he does not listen. I tried saying \"No\", but he go t angry. He gets very angry, does not talk. Then I take a step back, or he fig hts over that, in the middle Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 83 of the night. So instead of all that...let it go. \"- A housewife studied up to 5 th standard, from a joint family, whose husband is a farme r. This woman perceived lack of privacy as a problem. In case of all these women, their husbands presented with an 'atypical' character related to sexuality or masculinity, such as problem of premature ejaculation, excessive masturbation, night blindness or being alcoholic. Narra tion from one husband, whose wife responded about frequently being forced for sex. \"I talk to her, I use different methods. Even if I hav e the mood, I avoid \"pressurizing\" her for having relations. May be I put m y hands around her, leg on leg and all....then only if I get some response...then th e further actions, otherwise I leave it. I \"control\" it. But both of us need \"this\" because there is no other addiction. Because I cannot do without it, til l my body is not relaxed, I cannot sleep. Because she also thinks in that way. Even if sh e does not have that mood, she knows about my body stress and so her \"involve ment\" is also there. She has that understanding.\"- A 32-year-old gra duate and former political leader of the village living in an extended family. Importantly, in the third category of little more th an half of the couples, women talked about generally having mutually shared decision making abo ut sex but occasionally having non-consensual sex for various reasons. They submitted to the demand of sex from husband either because of the perceived fear about consequences from husband; or out of sense of duty of being a 'wife', or not ex pressing 'strong' refusal for the same. An illiterate woman from an extended family felt shy a nd laughed. She said, \" Yes, it happens, that I don't want. I say, \"No\" but even t hen he does it. He demands it. If I refuse him then he goes to sleep, if I really [emphasizing on the word] refuse. Then he does not get angry. But generally it depends on his mood, nothing of mine (mazhe kaahi naste)\" The husbands in these case, mostly narrated having sex upo n mutual agreement from their wives. \"I talk to her sweetly, then she also feels it, then she a lso talks to me sweetly. Only if I talk sweetly to her, it will happen, otherwi se my work will get spoilt (aaple kaam phaphalnaar). So I ask her and she does not say no. Sometimes she is tired, then I don't force her. Of course, I become rest less then (tevdhyapurte Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 84 Fig. 5.2 Husband and wife sitting on the bed...abstinence walwal karnaar) but if she insists for not doing it, the n I don't force her. Only once we had fight over it, but then I talked sweetly to her and we could resolve it the same night.\" - A 31-year-old farmer studied up to 9 th standard. 5.4.2.2. Sexual abstinence- When to have or not have sex ? One of the key issues while discussing about husband- wife communication in sexual relationship, is around following abstinence or in simpler words, communicatio n around 'when to have or not have sex'. It is important to understand not only about when the couples follow abstinence but also for what all reasons/ situations they decide not to have sex. In other words, couples have their own perceptions about 'when' and 'when not' t o have sex for various reasons. In the present study, as shown in Figure 5.2 - a picture card showing 'Husband and wife are sitting on the bed, not facing each other'; was used to portray sexual abstinence in a symbolic subtle way. Women were asked to describe, ' What they see in the picture? Why the couples are sitting like this? ' If necessary, the respondents were given a hint about abstinence 18 . They were asked to narrate their personal experience i n this regard. Women mentioned about following abstinence for vario us reasons. All women talked about following abstinence during pr egnancy and post-partum . Abstinence during pregnancy was either a result of advice from a medical provider or after discussion and mutual agreement between husband an d wife. It was observed that the initiation of period of abstinence and its durat ion depended on the risk involved in pregnancy or risk perceived by the couple. \"We stopped it after three months in the pregnancy. I ha d some stomachache and then I told him about that. He said, \"Okay, then we will not have it, why to take a risk? This is our first baby.\" and so we stopped it . During second pregnancy, there was no problem so we continued it up t o 7-8 months \"- a housewife, studied up to 9 th standard, from an extended family. 18 There is no single word in local Marathi language fo r abstinence, so the term was explained to the respondents. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 85 As women mostly had their first and sometimes even the co nsequent deliveries at their mother's place, post- natal abstinence 19 was strictly followed by all the couples. When the wife returned to her husband's place, generally she was asked to sleep 'next to her mother-in-law' for a period of few months in order t o maintain 'good health' of the baby and the mother. Though this was a forced abstinence ins tigated by elder women and husbands not always being happy about this decision, women mentioned that husbands respected the decision with some exceptions as this- \"Our bedroom was leaking, it was monsoon. My mother-in -law wanted me to sleep next to her for few more days. My son was two mont hs old. [Feeling shy] but, my husband got the roofing work done immediatel y and asked me to sleep in the bedroom .\"- A 22-year-old farmer, studied up to 9 th standard from an extended family. Husbands did not express any problems in following abstine nce during this period. One of them said- \"She [wife] was at her parents after delivery. My mother said that l et her be there for some more days, till she feels comfortable. It did not matter much to me, whether she was there or not, because I have the hab it of masturbation, so...nothing about other woman or anything . So there was no issue, no 'tension'. After she back, I used condom for some time. T ill then I would just 'hit it' and be 'free' [have masturbation]. I have openly talked about it with her .\"- A 31-year-old farmer and factory worker studied up to 10 th standard and living in a joint family. Women also initiated the decision about following absti nence for religious reasons- such as religious fast 20 , ritual, worship, religious ceremony in the family or d epending on the 19 Post-natal period of one month and a week is considere d to be of 'ritual pollution'. Women generally go to their natal homes for having deliver ies. Husbands make sporadic visits to inquire about the health of the baby and the mother but rare ly have privacy to discuss about their personal issues 20 Religious fast- Families usually worship their famil y deity. Different family deities are worshiped on different days in the week. Family members, especial ly women, observe fast on these days. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 86 phases of moon 21 . Husbands of these women mostly respected their desire an d abstained on these days. \" Generally I never say \"No\" for having sex to my husband. He fasts on every Saturday and Monday. I asked him whether we should follo w abstinence on those days and he said, \"Ok, it is manageable.\" Otherwi se I never say, \"No\" to him .\" - a 25-year-old woman who looks after poultry business of family, studied up to 7 th standard, from an extended family. Husband works as an e lectrician. \"I always tell my husband about full moon and no moon night, but he does not believe in all these. I told my husband that it is the matter of faith. He asks for it, but then I say, \"No\" and he never forces me for relatio ns, never.\"- a 28-year-old housewife studied up to 9 th standard, living in an extended family, husband is a farmer. Some women also mentioned about being 'tired' (5) or were unwell (2) as the reasons to refuse sex. However, whether they actually followed abs tinence for these reasons depended on woman's wish against her physical condition a nd husband being of 'understanding' nature. \"Sometimes I say 'no' to him, not because I don't want it , but because I am too tired. But then 'it' [sex] happens \"- a 22-year-old farmer studied up to 9 th standard living in an extended family. \"Sometimes I go to sleep and then he says, \"You anyways l ike to sleep.\" It happens that I get tired and then go to sleep. But th en, he understands because she [her five months' old daughter] gets up 2-3 times during night so I get tired. So he does not force me .\"- A 24-year-old housewife studied up to 10 th standard living in a joint family All the six women who perceived lack of privacy as a problem to have sex, mentioned about \"reduced frequency and/or desire for sex\". A 23-year-old housewife studied up to 7 th standard, from a joint family, staying in a one-room household, said, \" We have it when mother-in-law goes out. But 21 People sometimes follow sexual abstinence on full mo on or no-moon days due to fear of ill- effects of lunar cycle. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 87 rarely once or twice in a month, if he is willing the n he calls me on the bed. I should check whether she is fast asleep and then we qu ietly have it.\" Their husbands did not have similar perception about sex, but generally responded that they did not 'discuss' much about sex. As one of them said- \"I anyways don't like 'sexy' talks. I am not much interest ed in talking, what is there to talk about. Just do 'it' and that is it . \"A 28-year-old farmer and contract worker in a company living in a joint family who had stu died up to 10 th standard. There were four couples in the study, where the wome n discussed about using a contraceptive method for having spacing between two childr en, but the husbands preferred to follow abstinence. They perceived that th ere was more risk associated with using an artificial contraceptive method rather than avoiding having sex. Following abstinence as a natural method of contraception was a sole decision of the husbands. \"The doctor said that she could even have a cu-t. But b oth of us did not think about that. I said, \"Why to have problem, better would be if we don't keep relations too often. That is how we followed it. Yes, one has to have that control on his mind. Both of us never had any fight, irritatio n over this issue \"- a 26- year-old man working in the plant nursery living in an e xtended family who had two children with a gap of two years. Abstinence for one or the other reasons was a common exper ience mentioned by all the respondents. Women decided about when not to have sex, e specially for religious reasons and pregnancy or post-natal period. However, absti nence as a natural way of contraception was a sole decision of husband. There were situational reasons such as lack of privacy, death of family member, fights in the fa mily or presence of guests , which forced the couples to abstain from sex. 5.5. Discussion and conclusions The study findings represent couples living on the rur al outskirts of Pune city. The study site shows certain signs of urbanization and modernizati on yet retains its rural features in terms of mostly being agrarian and kinship oriented. Change in behavior and communication is a slow process. Especially in societies wher e women are expected to be a passive partner in sex, this process will be further sl owed down. There is hesitance to change not only from men but also from women as ca n be interpreted from this study. Similar was a finding from Goyal's (2002) study from Raj asthan, India, who found that Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 88 women agreed to the belief that within married unio ns, sex is a male prerogative and women should not express desire for sex. In Vietnam, Gh uman (2005), studied 800 men and women from rural and urban communes and pointed t owards women reporting lower levels of marital sex suggesting that expression of s exuality is seen as more legitimate and natural for men than for women. Khan (2001) based on research in Bangladesh, has mentioned that women's sexual roles are meant to be private and controlled, rather than public and expressive. Contrary t o these studies, it is important to note that despite all the values and stereotypes atta ched to women taking a lead or active role in sex or even being expressive about sex in In dian society, almost one fourth of women from present study expressed their desires to have sex to their husbands and more than two third of the couples- men as well as wome n narrated their experience of having mutually consented sex. The study finding regarding women's narration about co nsensual or non-consensual sex needs further discussion in Indian context as well on the canvas of studies conducted in other developing countries. There are many studies which have discussed about women's experience of non-consensual sex in India and else where (Khan, 2001; Goyal, 2002; Ravindran and Balasubramanian, 2004 and Santhya et al, 2007). Ravindran and Balasubramanian (2004) found in their qualitative st udy among rural women from Tamil Nadu found that almost sixty percent of the women experi enced non-consensual sex and the present study shows a similar pattern in this reg ard. However, in the present study non-consensual sex is differentiated from 'forced sex' because, these terms may have different nuances in individual life, as the presen t study shows. Though women have talked about having sex without their wish, they hav e not communicated their unwillingness to their partners for various reasons. A s Goyal (2002) stated that, women's belief that their sexuality should be controlled by men, may result in not communicating the unwillingness to male partners by them. Santhya et al (2007) based on a survey research conducted in two states of India- Gujarat and West Bengal, have elaborated upon range of behaviors included in 'non consensual sex'. A lso, Jeejebhoy and Bott (2006) in their review collated about non-consensual sex ual experience of young people from developing countries, have mentioned about young people submitting under pressure to partner's demands for sex as an expression of co mmitment. Khan (2001) has mentioned in a similar study conducted among 54 wo men from rural and urban Bangladesh that forced sex was identified as a regular phenomenon within married life. Rather, some women mentioned about 'enjoying forced s ex'. Though, women in the Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 89 present study have not expressed 'enjoyment' in having force d sex, their narration points towards the subtle difference in 'forced sex' and 'non- consensual sex'. Additionally, husbands of these women who experienced 'forced sex', have presented different and atypical characters regarding their masculinity and have d iscrepancy in their narration of sexual experience with their wives. Hence, the present stu dy confirms to the need of carefully categorizing or labeling sex as 'non-consensual' o r 'forced sex' and having detailed analysis of sexuality and sexual experiences of men as well as women. Couples have reported of following sexual abstinence, in itiated by husband or wife or forced abstinence for various reasons. Women have initi ated sexual abstinence on religious grounds which suggest their adherence to the traditional practices, however, husbands respecting this initiation from wives hints t owards the change. For reasons, other than religious, such as postnatal or during preg nancy, elder women in the family have continued to hold the decisions, whereas for rest o f the reasons of abstinence, men are the decision makers. Not many published studies were found in the rural married population in India, around sexual abstinence and furt her investigation is necessary to understand range of reasons for following abstinence a nd decision-making by men or women. Couple's dependence on abstinence initiated by husband, should be studied in the light of its preference over contraception for spaci ng as is also mentioned by Ravindran (2004) in study from Rural Tamilnadu; as well as probability of high risk sexual behavior during post natal abstinence period as poi nted out by Ali and Cleland (2001) in their study in Cote d'Ivoire. Privacy being the pre-requisite for having sex and sexual com munication, women seem to perceive lack of privacy as an obvious obstacle for husban d-wife communication as was also found by Goyal (2002) among married couples in R ajasthan, India. However, men do not necessarily talk about privacy. Possibly, this cou ld be explained against the differential perspectives of men and women towards sex a s were also seen by George (1998) in the couples from Mumbai. Other factors such as type of family, husband's or wife's education and their occupation do not show dire ct association with husband-wife communication about sexual relations. In other words, there needs to be more investigation to learn about motivating or enabling fa ctors to improve sexuality related communication among rural couples. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 90 Certainly, present research shows that women from rura l society have started discussing and deciding about their sexual life in terms of occasio nal initiation in sex and having sex upon mutual agreement with their husband. Also men a re being supportive towards their wives in this regard. Rural married couples challenging the stereotypes of power relations favoring men, and attempting to openly express about their sexuality, is promising and is a positive sign of approaching towards r eproductive health. As Khan (2002) points out, attempts should be built on this pr ocess of change towards having open communication between husband and wife, so as to make their sexual life enjoyable and to address their reproductive health nee ds. Definitely one should carefully avoid over-generalization from the present study conduct ed with a relatively small sample of rural part of India and focusing on reprodu ctive health in general with sexual relations as one of its areas of enquiry. A large scale r esearch is needed to capture the depth and richness of men's and women's sexual life expe riences in the context of social change in developing rural societies. Additionally, wom en's ability to express and negotiate sex is commonly considered as an indicator of a utonomy having implications on her reproductive health; hence, further research can focus on relationship between sexual communication and other reproductive health out comes such as, gynecological morbidity, unwanted pregnancies and high-risk sexual behavi or as well as with other indicators of women's status. Considering the cascading eff ect sexual communication has on health and marital relationship of couple, he alth programmes should definitely create opportunities for promoting young married couple s to discuss sex. These can be through organizing community based interactive progamme s for newly married couples or one-to-one counseling session. However, considering t he stereotypes attached to sexuality and discussing sex, it is important to design strate gies in a subtle way, respecting the local culture.

However, programmati c efforts, exposure, impact of media and access to resources contribute to change in men' s involvement in this subject and motivate couples to have joint-decision making. Prese nt paper focuses on understanding continuity and change in behavior and co mmunication between spouses around childbearing against the backdrop of traditions, in rural India. Methodology- Key informants (n=10) from formal and inf ormal sectors were interviewed using in-depth interview guide, for learning traditio nal practices. Married couples (n=35) narrated about present practices related to childbeari ng and were interviewed using a Visually Assisted Interview Guide consisting of hand-drawn sketches depicting life- scenarios. Results- Women contrary to the traditional notions went for medical confirmation of pregnancy and sought antenatal care. Couples showed depa rture from traditional practices and communicated about certain subjects of childbe aring such as antenatal care; whereas there was limited communication in other subjects as place of delivery and issues around birth of the child. Traditions and inf luence of family network seemed to play differential roles in affecting couple communica tion and behavior around various issues of childbearing. However, generally, men's non-far m or non-traditional occupation was more associated with couples' departure from tradit ional practices of communication and behavior. Conclusion- Couples shuffle between following traditio ns and adapting change in relation to various issue of childbearing. Reproductive health p rogramme should design strategies depending on the differential role family a nd traditions play in different areas of childbearing and appreciate and encourage the exist ing involvement of men. Key words - couples, rural, India, childbearing, traditions, com munication, behavior 6.2 Introduction In India, traditions and values guide couples' reproduct ive health behavior in such a way that most of the related issues are assigned to women's do main. Couples are rarely encouraged to have open discussion around childbearing a nd men seldom perform the role of active and supportive partners of women during ch ildbearing. On the other side, reproductive health programme aims at involving men to a greater extent. Also factors such as exposure to outside world on account of mobility, impact of media and access to Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 97 resources largely contribute to process of change. In milie u of these contrasting ideas, current paper focuses on understanding continuity and ch ange of behavior and communication between spouses about childbearing again st the backdrop of traditions, in rural India. With demarcated areas of continuity a nd change; the paper helps to learn differential pattern of couple communication and men i nvolvement in childbearing. 6.3 Background For more than two decades researchers from developing countries have studied role of traditions, cultures and family network affecting child bearing and involvement of men in this subject. Sich (1985) has mentioned about stereotypi cal assumption of Western clientele that a pregnant woman is entitled to much a ttention by her husband, family and other public and further states that this assumption in n ot true in rural Korea except for the early period of first pregnancy. Chowdhury (2003) st udied about sociology of first birth in rural Bangladesh, and found that food inta ke and workload does not change with pregnancy; and objection from in-laws and financial conc erns are barriers to seeking health care. Waszak, Thapa and Davey (2003) in their study conducted in Nepal, about influence of gender norms on reproductive health, ment ioned about traditional beliefs regarding motherhood in terms of woman's diet and wor k, affecting their health. In South Africa, traditionally, men did not accompany their partn ers for antenatal or postnatal care services and are not expected to attend the birth of thei r child (Kuene et al, 2004). In Kenya, cultural barriers and peer pressures acted as barr iers to men's participation in reproductive health care (Muja et al, 2000). In other words, traditions, family network and cultural practices seem to influence couples' behavior rega rding childbearing. In India, as elsewhere, children are extremely important as propagators of family name and hence women are valued as wives and more as a mother . Conceiving with a child is synonymous with proving status in the family. Within the general context of beliefs related to health and illness, those concerning pregnancy and childbirth are of particular relevance to women's health (World Bank Report, 1996). Traditional notion was that childbearing is not an event worthy of medical attentio n (Kanitkar and Sinha, 1989). The concept of special care during the antenatal period wa s traditionally not known in India (Jeejebhoy and Roy, 1995). Contrary to the occidental cul tures where relationships culminate into sexual relations, in a typical rural socie ty of India, the entire relationship between husband and wife \"begins\" with sex consequent to marriage. Married couples are worried, especially in the beginning of their rel ationship, about rejection in sexual life Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 98 and hence may avoid discussing with each other, topics such as sex, childbearing or reproductive health in general. However, the elder fa mily members especially the mother-in-law plays a crucial role in decision making rela ted to these important events of a young woman's life. Men are generally kept away from a ctively discussing these issues with their wives or taking any decisions about help see king. Men were found to play almost no role in antenatal and postnatal care wh ich was considered exclusively a women's domain (Apte, 2000). However, though cultural biases and traditions exist aga inst allowing men to be involved in discussion and decision-making in childbearing, this is cha nging with the increasing efforts of male involvement. Men seem to be more inte rested reproductive health than before, as was stated by Kuene et al (2004) about Zu lu men in South Africa. There are many efforts to include men in antenatal care programme s - Kenya (Muja et al, 2000), Turkey-by Diemer (1997) and Turan et al (2001) and Ind ia being no exception in this regard (Varkey, 2001 and Barua 2006). Increasing male involvement assumes improved couple communication and change in behavior. India, since 1994 has considered about involving men in their national policy (Khan and Panda, 2004). Reproductive health programme intends to welcome men in maternity care an d suggests more interactions between the health provider and the men during anten atal and delivery visits, as is shown in the National Family Health Survey-III report ( NFHS-III 2005-06, Maharashtra Report). In this context, the paper aims to learn about continui ty and change of rural married couples' behavior and communication during childbearing against the backdrop of traditions. 6.4 Methodology Maharashtra is India's second largest state in terms of i ts population (more than 96 millions). More than 50% of the population is rural a nd the state has a Hindu majority (72%). Pune is one of six divisions of Maharashtra state h aving a population of more than 19 millions. Current study was conducted one of th e Tehsils of Pune district-Maval Tehsil- covering a population of around 300 thousand sp read among 184 villages. The Tehsil is surrounded by Western Ghats and the Mumbai-Pu ne Express Way cuts through the Tehsil. It is one of the fastest developing Tehsils of Pune district, with many upcoming industries, educational institutes, plant nur series and floriculture. Most of the Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 99 villages have geographical access by road. There are two ma in towns in the Tehsil, where most of the private medical practitioners, privat e multi-specialty hospitals, markets and shops are clustered. Reproductive health services are delivered to community th rough public health system with 6 Primary Health Centres and its sub-centres (one ea ch catering to a population of 5000), 2 Rural Hospital (RH). Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and Multi Purpose Worker (MPW) are the grass root level health providers of thi s health system. The ANMs and Anganwadi staff 22 are mainly responsible for providing Ante Natal Care ( ANC), promoting use of contraception and acceptance of termi nal method of contraception 23 . In spite of the development that has taken place in th is Tehsil due to urbanization; the area still represents a rural site dominated by kinship o riented Maratha caste agrarian community. Most of the families are either joint or ext ended. It is a patriarchal society, where families are mostly headed by men, who play a sig nificant role in decision-making in the family. However, issues related to childbearing a re exclusively under women's domain. The broader study was a qualitative exploration among yo ung married couples from rural set up which aimed at understanding the process of couple communication in reproductive health. It was a community-based study and i nvolved in-depth interviews of 35 married couples. It involved a preparatory phase wh ere key informants from the community (n=10) were interviewed to understand practice s about couples communication and behavior in reproductive health. Thi s phase helped in designing the tool for interviewing selected couples in the study. To co ver the entire spectrum of the reproductive health, married couples that have at least one child and have used a terminal method of contraception (female sterilization ) were selected. To minimize the recall bias of the respondent, it was decided to select co uples that have undergone sterilization not beyond a period of one year at the t ime of involving them in the study. 22 In India, the government runs pre-schools in all th e villages through Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) under the Department of He alth and Social Welfare. These pre- school teachers along with responsibility of teaching in the school are also responsible for assisting the PHC staff to provide anti natal and po st natal services. The Tehsil has more than 200 such pre-schools having an equal or more number o f pre-school staff 23 Terminal method of contraception mainly refers to fem ale sterilization, which is the most preferred method in India. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 100 Local staff from health and development sectors (ANMs an d Anganwadi workers) helped in recruitment of the couples (n=35) in the study. Curre nt paper is drawn from this broader study with a focus around inter-spouse communicatio n regarding childbearing in the context of existing traditions. Married couples were interviewed with the help of a V isually Assisted Interview Guide (VAIG). The tool was simultaneously administered to husb and and wife (in absence of each other, separately) by male and female researchers r espectively. The tool involved picture cards having hand-drawn illustration of day-to-d ay life scenario and an in-depth interview guide around the scenario. It covered various a spects of reproductive health, childbearing being one of those. The tool also include d personal data of the couples, socio-demographic details, information about family and a series of questions around general process of inter spouse communication including t ime, duration, content of communication, determinants etc. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 101 6.5.

Families were mostly agriculturists (26/35) whe rein, 20 men had agriculture as their main occupation and 10 men were recently involved in service on contract basis but had agriculture as the main source of income for their families. There were five men who either were involved in some business or worked as a labo rer. Out of 35 couples, 26 men and 33 women had studied up to 10 th standard or less than that. All the women Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 102 were housewives. As the youngest child of all the women was less than three years old, most of these women were not able to work in the farm or acquire additional job and hence only 9 of the 35 women had some secondary occupation - either farming (5/9) or petty business or service (4/9). Majority of the couples h ad completed their family with either two (25/35) or three children (9/35). One co uple had six children, five daughters before having their son. This profile of the couples is extremely congruent with a typical rural community in Western Maharashtra. Characteristics of couples related to childbearing, showed that half of the women had one or two deliveries at home 24 . The total number of home deliveries was 25 (out of t otal number of 85 deliveries including live and still births) . There were two women who had a still birth each and one of them had the delivery at ho me. Out of 35, 10 women went to their natal home for first delivery before 9 th month and 17 went during 9 th month of pregnancy. Twenty-five out of these 27 women stayed at na tal home for a period of minimum of a months and a week. There is an obviously re duced contact between husband and wife during intra and post natal period due to this traditional practice. 6.5.2. Traditions and present practices of communic ation and behavior Existing literature in India and elsewhere points towa rds influence of traditions on childbirth related practices of women. Results of this pa per focus on two major areas- a. Traditions related to communication and behavior regard ing childbirth - based on data elicited from key informants and b. Present practices of co uple communication and behavior regarding childbirth- data elicited from young couples in the study based on their own experience. 6.5.2.1. Traditions related to communication and be havior Key informants in the study narrated about traditions re lated to childbirth based on their knowledge about the community and also based on their own personal experience (in some cases). 24 NFHS-III data for rural Maharashtra- Percent distrib ution of women giving birth in home deliveries-Own home-29.7%, Woman's mother's home-20.6%, 50.5% Deliveries at health facility Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 103 Key informants' interviews- In the present study in all ten key informants were inte rviewed. The selection of key informants was purposive based on the researcher's previous e xperience and rapport in the field area and recommendations received during ini tial informal visits in the field area. The objectives of conducting key informants' inte rview for this research were- to learn about changing patterns of couple communication existing at present, to understand traditional practices regarding couple comm unication and behavior, to know about marital relationship of young couples in general in rural areas and to get directions for approaching the couples and constructing the appropr iate tool for interviewing them. To cover the wide spectrum of information that was nece ssary from interviews of key informants, individuals from various areas and sectors such p ublic health staff, private medical practitioners, Traditional Birth Attendants (TB A), old and young women and other influential personalities in the field area, w ere interviewed. Following table presents the detailed profile of the key informants- Table 6.2 Profile of the key informants Sr No Age Sex Occupation Education 1 35 Female Private female Homeopath working in the nearby area B.H.M.S. 2 40 Male Director of the only private tertiary hospital (multi-specialty hospital) in the field area.

To understand the childbirth related trad itions in the study population, traditions are grouped under three categories- the one s related to conception, to pregnancy and lastly to delivery. Conception A woman is expected to conceive as early as possible after m arriage. She experiences ill-treatment from community if she does not conceive wit hin a year of her marriage. Women follow pollution period during menstruation an d sit aside during that period. Also in families, the woman a pot upside down in one corner of the house, during her menstruation period. Hence, if a married woman missed her periods, the family, especially the mother-in-law comes to know about it. Most of the communication related to 'women's subject' happens between the young woman an d her mother-in-law. Once a woman misses her periods and there is communication about the same with her mother- in-law, she asks her to wait for some more time. There is no communication about missing periods, immediately with the husband. The moth er-in-law discloses this to him once she is sure about it. As a 59-year-old lady studied up to 5 th standard said, \" The husband says 'Okay' and goes back to plough...that is it.\" Traditionally, there is no concept about medical confirmation of pregnancy. Pregnancy During pregnancy, the woman does not need any special at tention. She lives her routine life, in terms of diet, work, and taking rest as well a s her sexual relations with husband; except that her family members offer help to her for he avy physical work. Rarely, she is asked for her cravings. Husband fulfilling his wife's craving s or helping her in household chores, is rarely seen. There is no communication betwee n them about her diet, workload or taking rest. As 59-year-old woman studied up to 6 th standard and mother of a local political leader narrated her own experience of pregnancy- \"Only once it happened that I was serving lunch to my hus band, in the farm and I asked for a piece of bread (bhakri) from his share. He g ave it to me, but in the evening, after going home, he told his mother, \"I am very hungry. She ate some of my bread..that is how I did not eat much.\" Then my m other-in-law was so angry with me saying, \"I should not eat like a man.\" Tha t is how men used to be, not caring about wife.\" Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 105 There is no planning for delivery in terms of decision ab out place of delivery or arranging logistics, during early months of pregnancy. Elderly women in the family, the mother-in- law takes all the decision, sometimes in consultation wi th the woman's parents. Registration for Ante Natal Care check-up is not found t o be necessary as childbearing is not something worthy of medical attention. The woma n is expected to work throughout her pregnancy as taking rest may hamper normal delivery. In general there is minimal communication between husband and wife during pregna ncy, as it is mainly women's domain, so elderly women in the family, especially the mo ther-in-law dominates the decisions. As the senior TBA from the community said, \" The mother-in-law used to follow the daughter-in-law the whole day, asking her t o complete the work. So what and how can the young woman talk to her husband or with anyone? \" Delivery Though there is a tradition of sending the woman to h er natal home for first delivery, she is sent there in the 9 th month, so that she keeps working till the last month. There is a fear that if the woman is sent to her natal before 9 th month, she will take rest and not work enough, thus will have problem in having normal de livery. Deliveries are conducted at home by untrained TBA known as Suin , or elderly women in the family. Sometimes, the woman delivers without anybody to supervise or assist. As one the Key informants narrated the experience of her second delivery- \"I was collecting firewood and started having pain in my stomach. My mother-in- law was around me. Then I worked in the farm, with c ontinuous pain for the whole day. Finally, in the evening, my mother-in-law aske d to me stop working and go home. I went home and was about to cook but th en I delivered. By the time she came home, I had already delivered. I don't re member where my husband was, somewhere in the village. Then I took rest for twelve days and started working from then on. That is it. That was the practice.\" - A 46-year-old Anganwadi worker studied up to 9 th standard. If any complication arises, the mother-in-law or other elderly women in the family, decide about where to take woman. There is no communication be tween husband and wife over this subject. Duration of woman's stay at her natal hom e is decided by her mother-in-law and varies from 5 days to one month and a week. Traditi onally, various worships are performed on the 5 th or 12 th day of childbirth in the interest of the well-being of the baby. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 106 The period of one month and one week, locally referr ed as ' savva mahina ' is considered to be of ritual pollution, during which mobility of t he woman is restricted. A woman going to natal home for her delivery, further reduces the e xisting opportunities for couple communication during this period. Men in the family ha rdly play any role during or after delivery of the woman. It is mainly the mother-in-law, if the woman had her delivery at husband's home or her mother in case if she had her d elivery at natal home, who discusses and decides about it. The young husband, who fol lows the path of his father, has never seen men being involved in these matters and h ence keeps himself away from the same. \"He is considered to be like a hollow man with no substa nce (dham dhokla an aatun polka)\" as said by an informal key informant from the communit y- a 46- year-old Anganwadi worker studied up to 9 th standard. In other words, there were various traditions and custo ms around childbirth and traditionally, couples were hardly encouraged to discuss ab out the same. The family, especially the mother-in-law ruled most of the decision s in this subject and medical care was scarcely sought, except in case of some complications. Fo llowing quote aptly connotes the traditional couple communication practices- \"We all know that 'love is blind' but husbands never unde rstood that 'one can give it a voice'. They never made an attempt to talk 'few sweet wo rds to their wives.', 'enquire about her health', or 'sit next to her to have a cas ual chat' - a 59-year-old woman studied up to 6 th standard and mother of a local political leader 6.5.2.2. Present practices of communication and beh avior regarding childbearing In-depth interviews of couples (n=35) have provided data on present practices of communication and behavior regarding seven issues of chil dbearing starting from disclosure of pregnancy to communication during post-nat al period. Narrations from women as well as their husbands are considered for pres enting this data. Almost one-third of the women, talked about missing pe riod first to their mother-in-law, following the tradition and there was no immediate co mmunication or action taken about confirmation of pregnancy. In case of little less than ha lf of the women, the mother-in-law immediately asked her son to take his wife to doctor for confirmation of pregnancy. The husband did not have much to say about it, but expressed happiness. Only when the mother-in-law asked him to take his wife for pregnancy confirmation, he did so. However in case of 1/4 th couples, the wives directly spoke to husband about it. Later, it was Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 107 disclosed to the mother-in-law. Husbands voluntarily init iated taking wives doctor for pregnancy confirmation. \"I started vomiting and feeling giddy. Obviously, I told my husband. There was no chance to talk to my mother-in-law. We had such a big f amily that time. I could not talk to her. So I just told him. Even he did not tell anybody. He immediately took me to doctor. The doctor checked my urine and told me that I am pregnant (divas gelet). I told my husband. Obviously he was happy .\" A 24-year-old farmer living in an extended family talking about her experie nce of first pregnancy All the women went for medical confirmation of pregna ncy and sought antenatal care thereafter. Women sought routine antenatal care from government clinic in the village and went to private provider in the nearby town for ha ving an ultra sound examination for confirming about health of the baby 25 . This was a new trend either advised by the provider or suggested by family member, especially during the first pregnancy just to confirm that \"everything was normal\". For seeking routin e antenatal care in the village, women went alone, as generally husband and wife do no t travel together within the village. But, when the antenatal clinic was far off, an d for all the ultra sound examinations (which are generally conducted in the poly-cl inics or private hospitals located in the nearby towns), men accompanied their wive s. The data showed that almost half of the couples discussed about fixing up an ap pointment with the health provider for ANC, reminding wife about ANC visit date and about taking the tablets and even forcing her to complete all the prescribed doses and injections during ANC, taking wife for ANC visit, and talking to health provider abou t her health. \"I always had to remind her about going to doctor. I u sed to call the doctor and take appointment and keep reminding her about that. I always went with her to doctor at Dehu road [a nearby town]\"- A 30-year-old farmer studied up to 9th standard living in an extended family. His wife sought a nte natal care from a private doctor from the nearby town. 25 The National Family Health Survey III for Rural Maha rashtra reports 33.7 % of pregnancies with an ultrasound test and the percentage being hig hest for first pregnancy. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 108 \"Whenever it is something serious, like going for sonogra phy 26 or admitting her for delivery, I am always there. I give personal attenti on and go with her and talk to the doctor. For 'doses' [routine immunization during ANC] in the village, she can go alone. I don't have to look into that.\"- A 32-year-old graduate managing his plant nursery and the former political leader in t he village Narrations from wives of these men supported about thei r husbands being actively involved in seeking antenatal care. Care at home during pregnancy involved diet, workload, taking rest and keeping a vehicle ready for commuting in case if emergency arises. Al most 1/4 th of the men had no or minimal discussion with their wives on these issues and s howed no change in behavior in terms of taking care of wife, as per the nar rations of the women. Data from the men mostly matched the responses of wives, with some e xception such as- A woman mentioned that- \"Mouth of my bag [uterus] was small and the doctor asked me to take rest, sleeping on left side, every afternoon. My husband did no t say anything there. After coming home he told me, \"Not possible. Work at ho me and in the field, how can mother manage these things? Take rest only whenever possible.\" I did not take rest and continued working till eight months.\" This woman 22-year-old housewife living in an extended family did not have any problem during her delivery. Her husband when asked about his wife's pregnancy said, \"Sometimes her legs would hurt, or she would have some other pain, then I would give her tablet and water. Or in the evenings, sh e would ask for milk and then I used to give it to her. I have done all that. B ut she did not have any other problem .\"- A 30-year-old farmer studied up to 9 th standard A little less than half of the men either communicated with wives around care during pregnancy but were not actually involved in providing car e; or offered care in one or the other aspect but did not have discussion about it. They o ffered help in terms of making logistic arrangement or looked after wives' medication a nd started 'adoring them more'. However, there were some couples who had discussion about care during pregnancy 26 Sonography is the word commonly used by the community f or referring to an ultrasound. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 109 and also the husbands were actually involved in provision o f care during wife's pregnancy. \"He used to get fruits for me from Pune. I asked him t o get whatever I felt like eating. Also he told me, \"You can sit at one place an d do cooking. I will help you for other things.\" He helped me to fetch water and f or washing clothes. There was nobody else at home. My mother-in-law had to manage the work on the farm and monitor the work of other laborers.\"- A 28-year-ol d housewife studied up to 7th standard living with husband, two children and widowe d mother-in-law. There were some differences in the narrations of wome n and their husbands around details of communication and provision of care. For examp le, the husband of this woman only mentioned about helping wife for fetching water and lifting heavy things at home. But, the supportive role of husband during pregnancy was consistently reported by men as well as women. It was observed that husband was involved more in commu nication as well as actual care of wife during her pregnancy, in case of either nu clear family and also in joint family where manpower to manage the household chores and wo rk on the farm was a difficulty. In case of extended family, as narrated by men and confirm ed by their wives, the questions of men being directly involved in care did not a rise due to help offered by other young women in the family. Sending the woman to her natal home for delivery was d iscussed in the context of amount of workload and availability of manpower in he r conjugal family as well as in her natal family. There was also discussion about place of deli very-home or a health facility and type of health facility-public or private. In case of few couples there was hardly any discussion between husband and wife over this issue and h usband's mother was an important decision maker. A little less than half of cou ples though discussed over this issue, followed the instructions of the mother of the husband. \"I went to 'Maher' [mother's home] in the 9 th month. My in-laws said that they would not send me there in the seventh month. My mot her, I and even my husband felt that I should go there in 7 th month because there was not much work here. But my in-laws, especially mother-in-law said , \"If you go there earlier, you will take rest and not work. That is not good.\" So I went there in the 9 th month.\"- A 26-year-old farmer living in an extended family. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 110 Husbands of these women mostly talked mother or parents, being the important decision-maker in this regard, as one of them said- \"We both, husband and wife first talked about it, then we told my father and mother, when I should send her. I said, \"In seventh month\", but they said, \"In eighth month\". We had this opinion and parents had di fferent opinion. Finally, she was sent there in the 8 th month .\" A 32-year-old factory worker and farmer, studied up to 9 th standard living in an extended family. However, almost one-third of the couples shared their o pinions about sending wife to natal home and took an informed decision. \"We will go to hospital [he had registered her name with a private hospital in the nearby town] from here. At your father's place who will do the r unning around in case of emergency? Here, I am available. We have a vehicl e, so it is better if you are here.\"- A 33-year-old farmer studied up to 7 th standard living in an extended family. His wife narrated, \"Husband had decided upon that. Wha t he said about problem in commuting from my mother's home was true. So he decid ed everything. Of course, my mother wanted me to go there earlier, but I did not go.\"- A 24-year-old housewife studied up to 10 th standard living with her husband, two children and mother-in-law. The duration of wife's stay at natal home after her de livery was considered to be an important issue because it has implications on woman's wo rkload, diet and rest after delivery; as well as the opportunities available for coupl es to have discussion during this period. Almost for half of the women, their mother-i n-law made this decision and there was no communication with the woman's husband about t his. \"I stayed at my mother for 'Savva mahina' [one month and one week]. My mother-in-law said, \"If the baby is okay, you stay there for a month and then come back. But if the baby starts crying a lot, if you cannot manage, then may be you should stay back for more time.\" A 27-year-old housew ife living with her husband, two sons and widowed mother-in-law. There were some couples who discussed about this issue but pr eferred to follow the tradition. As one of the husbands said- Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 111 \"All these things were decided by my mother. My wife was t here [at her natal home] for savva month because she had 'normal' delivery, so th ere was no point in her waiting there for more time. There are some r ituals. I decided about that. I told them for whatever time they want, she can be th ere. My mother had told them about savva month. So she came back after savva mon th \"- A 32-year-old graduate managing his plant nursery and the former pol itical leader in the village There were few couples who discussed about this and to ok their own decisions. \"My husband said, \"It will be better if I stay there at least for three months. Once I come here, I will have to work hard...bring firewood and all. There will be no time to take rest. So he insisted that every time after my de livery, I stay at my mother's place for at least three months.\"- A 28-year-o ld illiterate laborer living with her husband and three children. It was mostly parents of the wife or husband who decid ed about whether the woman should deliver at home or in a hospital and about choosi ng the hospital for her delivery. Men had little say in this matter, especially because th e deliveries took place at wife's natal home. \"My mother decided everything. She and my wife talked ab out it. Women talked about it. I was not involved. They all decided on thei r own, my mother, father and her family members. She had both her deliveries at home . Her grandmother is a TBA (Suin).\"- A 25-year-old man studied up to 9 th standard, worker in a private company on contract basis living in an extended family. However, in case of half of the couples, the men were part of this discussion and decision. \"We all decided about that. I also decided it. I told her [wife] to deliver in a hospital and she had her delivery in hospital. I was th ere with her.\"- A 30-year-old contract worker studied up to 10 th standard. Wives of these men also mentioned about decision being taken at family level, depending on the discussions between the two families. There were few couples who discussed about this subject an d also took an informed decision, themselves. \"Her father's financial condition was not that good. Also there are no commuting facilities available at their village. So I told her t hat she should stay here for delivery. I used to take her to hospital for her delive ry, I decided about the Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 112 hospital. She [wife] also said, 'Okay' for that.\"- A 33-year-old farmer wh o has studied up to 7 th standard living in an extended family. Responses from wives of these men showed that it was eith er the wife or the husband who suggested for a particular place of delivery and t he other partner agreed to it. There were varying responses for the question- ' When did husband go to meet his wife after her delivery? '- ranging from ' husband took the wife for delivery and was present in the hospital ', ' husband came to meet me only after the 5 th day worship of Goddess of Fortune ' to ' He never came to see me, I came here when the baby was three months ' old '. There were different factors affecting this pattern- such as influence of family and tradition, distance of woman's natal home, relationship of the husband with the woman's natal family and husband's work schedule. Hence, though t here were some women who experienced complications during delivery such as convulsions and high blood pressure, or tear of vagina, these women being at the natal hom e; their husbands did not necessarily discuss about complications or treatment with them. As one woman narrated- \"I was always scared of hospital. He knew it. I was at mot her's place and had started getting pains, but I never told her. Then I d elivered at home. But there was a tear and I had to be taken to hospital. There were no stitches. It got cured. I did not inform him. I told him only on the next da y. He was very angry. He always wanted me to deliver in hospital. He came to see me on the 6 th day after the worship on the 5 th day. So during my second delivery, he insisted that I should deliver in hospital and should not wait at home. I did that.\"- A 24-year-old woman working as a housewife and as a farmer studied up to 5 th standard and living in an extended family. She was at her mother's ho use for having both her deliveries. In her family, they followed the custom about husband not coming to visit his wife, till the 5th day worship of the Goddess of Fortune and hence he visi ted her only on the 6 th day of her delivery. During his interview, he did not talk a bout any problems that his wife had during her delivery. All women had some interaction with their husband duri ng post natal period. The amount of interaction changed depending upon the place of de livery (husband's or natal home), frequency of husband's visit to her natal home and the pr ivacy available for them to have communication. Little more than half of the men atte mpted to visit wife occasionally or at least talk to her over telephone (in case of a very small n umber of couples). The Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 113 remaining couples had frequent interactions with the ir wives. However, both men and women mentioned that their interaction during this pe riod, whether telephonic or in person, had limitations in terms of having detailed disc ussion due to constant presence of other family members, especially elderly women, arou nd the young woman. Subjects discussed during these interactions involved woman's healt h, immunization of the child, use of contraception and duration of woman's stay in he r natal home. However, not necessarily all the couples talked about all these issues. In case of wife having her delivery at her natal home, husband felt 'awkward' to d iscuss anything at wife's natal home in presence of her family members. \"He [husband] used to come there once in eight days. He did not tal k much because of the big family. He used to phone me on my brother's mobile phone, every day so we used to talk every thing on the phone but not much when he would come there. There are parents, one sister and on e brother. The brother is elder to me, so how can I talk anything in front of m y brother. In the house, it used to be difficult.\"- A 24-year-old housewife studie d up to 10 th standard, husband has studied up to 12 th standard and is a landowner. They live with two children and his widowed mother. \"I used to frequently call her up. Also I used visit her once in 2-3 days. I used to talk to her about my work and matters at home. I used to tell her, \"Love the baby. Take care of him. Take him to hospital for doses [immunization] .\"- A 38-year-old worker in sugar factory, studied up to 9 th standard living in an extended family. The present practices of couples regarding communication a nd behavior about childbearing showed that in certain areas such as seeking antenatal care, care at home during pregnancy and decision about sending the wom an to her natal home, men were more involved in the discussion and decision maki ng with their wives and other family members. Although, there were some couples who relatively showed more communication during post-natal period, it was sti ll only a 'brief' discussion. 6.6. Discussion 6.6.1. Changing trend regarding seeking formal care Traditionally, as Kanitkar and Sinha (1989) and Jeeje bhoy and Rao (1995) mentioned and the key informants in this study narrated, there was no practice or preference for Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 114 seeking medical help during pregnancy or childbearing. H owever, the study reports that women sought antenatal care and little less than of hal f of them had home deliveries. National Family Health Survey-III data for rural Maha rashtra (NFHS-3, 2008) in which percent distribution of women giving birth in the last five years shows that there are still 11.2 women who do not seek any antenatal care and ther e are 50.8% home deliveries. These indicators show improvement as compared to the pr evious survey data. Hence, present study confirms the rising positive trend in these indicators. Changing behavior in terms of seeking access to health care, suggests towards increa sed chances of communication between spouses on these issues. 6.6.2. Couples' communication and behavior against the backdrop of traditions Following diagrammatic representation captures the pa ttern of couples' communication and behavior against the backdrop of traditions. Figure 6.1: Diagrammatic representation of traditio ns and present practices of communication and behavior regarding childbearing Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 115 The centre of the circle is the nucleus of traditions reg arding childbearing which were narrated by the key informants. There are seven differen t segments of the circle, representing seven major issues of childbearing. The di agram represents the trend reported in the study and the number of couples plot ted does not match with the exact number of respondents. There are some couples who large ly follow traditions (plotted close to the nucleus), whereas some couples show marked depa rture from the traditions (plotted close the circumference). There are four issues o f childbearing namely-seeking antenatal care, care at home during pregnancy, sending wife to natal home for delivery and postnatal communication, where couples show maximu m departure from traditions. In the remaining three subjects namely- disclosure of pr egnancy, duration of woman's stay at her natal home and choosing place of delivery, co uples seemed to follow traditions and have limited communication. 6.6.2.1. Departure from traditions Almost one-third of the couples departed from traditio ns in more than four subjects of childbearing (out of the seven presented in the diagra m). Traditionally, as mentioned by the key informants men had followed their fathers, in terms of not discussing or involving in issues of pregnancy and delivery that are women's domain These couples showed departure from traditions in terms of seeking medical ca re and husbands generally being more involved in discussion and decision-making during ante natal care, delivery and post-partum. In Turkey, (Turan et al, 2001) men simila rly described about their own father being physically and emotionally distant but idea s about fatherhood seem to be undergoing change and now young men want to be helpf ul towards wife. Researchers have attempted to analyze factors affecting couple comm unication and behavior with increased male involvement related to childbearing. I n Indonesia, education of couples, showed influence on their power to use prenatal and d elivery care (Beegle, Frankenberg and Thomas, 2001); whereas Barua (2006) in her study in Rural Maharashtra found that men involved in non-farm occupations were more supporti ve towards their wives. Mullick et al (2003) mentioned about Zulu men in Africa, tha t men may be more interested in their partners' well-being during antenatal and postn atal period, than is usually the case because of their shared role in producing a healthy chi ld. The present study confirms the findings of Barua (2006) from rural Maharashtra that men with non-farm or non- traditional occupation and increased work related mobil ity; seem to be more communicative with their wives around childbearing. Pr obably, increased access to resources and economic opportunities has effects on men's co mmunication and Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 116 behavior regarding reproductive health, but it needs t o be further studied. As well, effects of programmatic efforts to interact with men around an tenatal and postnatal care, may have resulted in changing communication and behavior of couples around these subjects of childbearing. However, the extent of involv ement of men is not the optimum and there is still scope to improve the same. Though furt her validation is necessary, men accompanying wives during antenatal care and their inter est in having communication with wife during postpartum should be viewed as possibl e opportunities for strengthening couple communication in reproductive health. 6.6.2.2. Continuing traditions On the other hand, the present study points towards sp ecific areas of childbearing where, couples still follow the traditional practice of restricted communication; and family network and traditional norms seem to influence them r elatively more. As Zondi et al (2003) have stated that though men themselves, as well as their partners, would prefer more active role during pregnancy, delivery and infant c are, the societal and health system norms often mitigate against this. In some subjects of childbearing such as disclosure of pregnancy, duration of woman's stay at natal home and decision about choosing place of delivery, couples in the present study ha d limited communication. There can be some possible explanations behind this dif ferential pattern, which are supported by various studies. Disclosure of pregnancy is pro bably the first time when there is discussion about any reproductive health related issues because couple hardly talk about planning their family, or discuss sex when new ly married. This should explain adherence of women to traditional practice of discussing about conception initially with the women in the family. Secondly, women in the study population practiced the norm of going to natal home for childbirth. This norm reduce s opportunities of couple communication during this period, though some of them had sporadic communication over telephone. The subjects such as duration of her stay at natal home, choosing the place of delivery and dealing with complications around delivery, if any, continued to be discussed and decided among elder family members and husba nds had no substantial role in this regard. This is yet another similar findin g from Barua's (2006) study in rural Maharashtra. The researcher pointed towards reasons of me n's absence from routine care- such as wife going to natal home for delivery and existing perception that this issue is women's domain. As was seen in Zulu community in South Africa (Mullick et al, 2003), even in India, traditionally men are not encouraged t o be involved during the childbirth and hence, some of the men in the present study seemed to follow the traditions of not Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 117 visiting wife immediately after delivery. Role of family and traditions is more active and influential for young couples during this period. As Ch owdhury (2003) found in her study in Bangladesh that most women were expected to deliver a t their marital home and mother-in-law made this decision. In present study, howe ver, it is not always the mother- in-law but even the woman's parents are involved in the process of this decision-making. To summarize, in spite of men's desire and efforts to be involved in communication and behavior related to childbearing, traditions and famil y network play an active role in certain areas of childbearing. Hence, research and inter ventions attempting to achieve reproductive health outcomes such as increased institutio nal deliveries, Emergency Obstetric Care, improved postnatal care as well as postn atal counseling for contraception, should give due consideration towards cont inuing traditional influence. Issue of male involvement has been discussed with several con cerns from researchers and activists all over the world. There has been perceive d risk in brining men into domains where women have traditionally been in charge, as reviewed by Helzner (1996) about gender implications of male involvement in reprod uctive health programme. Based on studies among adolescents in South Asia, Singh (200 3) mentioned about involving men to become a double-edged sword substituting women 's empowerment. On the other hand, Mullany, Hindin and Becker (2005) in thei r research in Nepal, showed that increased couple communication and joint decision-makin g may achieve women's empowerment as well as their health goals. Thus, the changing tradition of men getting more involved in discussion and participation in childbea ring, invites broader understanding of its linkage with women's status, reprodu ctive health outcome and implications for programme in rural set up. However, wi thout male involvement, couples cannot achieve their goals of having mutually shared and r espected decisions around childbearing. 6.7. Conclusion Present research should be viewed as an attempt to lear n married couples' struggle between following traditions and adapting change in relation to childbearing, especially in a patriarchal society, where reproductive health i s still women's domain. These findings based on a qualitative piece of exploration in one of the rural parts of India cannot be potentially generalized to entire society in the developing world, or even to the rural parts of India. However, there are two clear imp lications for the health programme in the local set up- firstly, opportunities to build upo n existing couple communication and Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 118 behavior such as men's interest and practices of accompanyi ng wives during antenatal visits and secondly, to create platforms for improving coupl e communication during delivery and postnatal period, with due consideration t o the influence of culture, traditions and family network. Certainly, in absence of favorable and supportive environments in the family, couple communication may no t get translated into behavior change. Hence, understanding the complexity of changing b ehavior and communication of couples against the backdrop of continuing tradition s in any given society should be a pre-requisite before designing reproductive programme strategies targeting couples.

Hence, it is crucial to lea rn about reproductive health problems in women from perspective of husband and wife, especially in a society, where open communication between married partners around r eproductive health is limited. Methods- Married couples (n=35) from a rural set up in Pune, India were interviewed in- depth with the help of a visually assisted interview guide having hand-drawn pictures. The interviews of husband and wife were conducted simult aneously and separately. Results- Almost half of the women experienced reproducti ve health problems such as complications during pregnancy or delivery, side effects or infections due to contraceptive usage or symptoms suggestive of Reproductive Tr act Infections (RTI). Husbands and wives narrated discrepantly about wives' proble m during pregnancy and men hardly talked about the delivery complications that their wives had. There was also discrepancy in the narration about side effects due to use of contraceptive methods and almost none of the men mentioned about any symptoms sug gestive of Reproductive Tract Infections, experienced by their wives. Conclusion- Discrepancy in the narrations of husband and wife about wife's reproductive problem may be a result of malfunctioning communication between spouses or even between the spouse and the researcher, because of vario us individual and collective norms. Synthesis of differential narrations is essential f or arriving at strategies to improve couple communication or partner notification. Key words - couple, rural, India, communication, reproductive h ealth, differential, narration 7.2. Introduction In relation to sexual and reproductive health, studies h ave revealed the importance of couple communication in different dimensions. Couple comm unication is crucial for implementing partner notification programmes, as pati ent referral is the recommended starting point for partner notification programs (WHO , 1989) and is considered the most feasible for developing countries (Mathews, Coetzee et al., 2002). Couple communication helps in reducing risk of acquiring Sexuall y Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and unintended pregnancies (Keller, 1996) and i n influencing curative behavior Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 125 in case of reproductive illnesses (Santhya and Dasvarma, 20 02). It is crucial to learn about reproductive health problems in women from persp ective of husband and wife, especially in a society, where open communication betwee n married partners around reproductive health is limited. The present paper foc uses on understanding couple communication about wife's reproductive health problem s analyzing narrations of husbands' and wives' on this subject. 7.3. Background Blanc (2001) reviewed gender power relations with sexu al health and stated that verbal communication between partners about reproductive heal th is low in many developing countries and that gender-based power inequities contr ibute to a lack of communication. Globally, women's social and economic status in relation to their male sexual partners have conferred an increased vulnerability to Sexually Tr ansmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV (Heise & Elias, 1995), and gender is increasingly rec ognized as an important determinant in reproductive health and health-seeking behavior (Currie & Wiesenberg, 2003; WHO, 2002). Gender stereotypes in sexuality possibl y restrict access to health information, hinder communication and encourage risky beh avior among women and men in different but equally dangerous way among India n couples (Verma and Mahendra, 2004). Male involvement in discussion and decision-making about rep roductive health problems of women is extremely crucial for various reasons. As Cor inne, Shefner and Sood (2004) studied in Indonesia, husbands' participation in pregnan cy was thought to reduce non- medical and indirect causes of maternal deaths, such as the delay in recognizing pregnancy-related complications and the delay in reachin g a healthcare facility promptly. In India (Raju and Leonard, 2000), as well in some o ther countries such as Ghana (Bawah et al, 1999), Egypt (El-Zanaty et al. 1999) an d Tanzania (Maman et al. 2001), men control financial resources and women's mobility whi ch, in turn, affects women's access to and use of reproductive health services. Also, it i s important to have men's involvement in this subject, because they may also be seen as the principal vectors of their partner's sexual health regarding STIs (Kuene et al, 2004). Not uncommonly, women who perceive themselves to be in a monogamous rel ationship are at risk of infection because of their partners' sexual behaviours (Da llabetta, Lag and Lamptey, 1997). Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 126 It is further important to learn couple communication a bout reproductive health problems in India, where couples are rarely encouraged to have op en discussion around issues such as sexual and reproductive health problems and there is a tendency to limit communication between spouses (World Bank, 1996-46). Th ere is limited spousal communication in issues such as RTIs as was found among r ural South Indian women by Santhya and Dasverma (2002). Since more than two decades, researchers have looked at d ifferential narrations from husband and wife either in terms of their perspective s, agreement or reporting on various reproductive health issues, such as fertility in rural India by Vlassoff and Vlassoff (1978), contraceptive use among Swiss couples (Hopflinger and Kuhne, 1983) and Turkish couples (Kulczycki, 2008), sexual experience among urb an couples in Mumbai, India (George, 1998) and fertility or childbearing pr eferences among Bangladeshi couples (Razzaque, 1999; Gipson and Hindin, 2007). Responses from husband and wife about wife's reproducti ve health problems reflect the extent of couple communication. Studies in India, have r eported contrasting findings in this regard. Women seem not to inform their husbands a bout their gynaecological symptoms (Bang and Bang 1994, Ramasubban and Rishyasring a 2000) and are often, as noted by Ramasubban (1995) `too afraid and confused to bring this [symptoms] to the notice of the family . . . both because they are not s upposed to have such problems in the first place and also because they are socially deemed to be polluters, the originators of sexual problems'. By contrast, Patel (1994) and Oomma n (2000) both reported that women discussed their symptoms with their husbands. In this context, present paper explores the responses of h usband and wife about wife's reproductive health problem with an attempt to analyze the differential pattern. 7.4. Study site The study was conducted in the rural outskirts of Pune city in the state of Maharashtra. More than 50% of the population of the state is rural and the state has a Hindu majority (72%). The study location Maval Tehsil covers a populatio n of around 300 thousand, spread among 184 villages. The tehsil is surrounded by Wes tern Ghats and the Mumbai- Pune Express Way cuts through the Tehsil. It is one of the fastest developing tehsils of Pune district, with many upcoming industries, educational institutes, plant nurseries and Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 127 floriculture. Most of the villages have geographical acc ess by road. There are two main towns in the Tehsil, where most of the private medical practitioners, private multi- specialty hospitals, markets and shops are clustered. In spite of the development that has taken place in this tehsil due to urbanization; the area still represents rural site dominated by kinship oriented Maratha caste 27 agrarian community. Most of the families are either joint or extended. It is a patriarchal societ y, where families are mostly headed by men, who play a significant role in decision-making i n the family. 7.5. Methods Present paper is drawn from a broader study that aimed at understanding the process of couple communication in reproductive health. It was a co mmunity-based study and involved a preparatory phase where key informants from t he community (n=10) were interviewed in-depth in order to learn about pattern s of couples communication and behavior regarding reproductive health and the tradit ions related to this subject. This phase helped in designing the tool for interviewing sel ected couples in the study. In the next phase, 35 married couples were interviewed in-depth . Researcher used a tool labeled as Visually Assisted Interview Guide (VAIG). The t ool involved picture cards having hand-drawn illustration of day-to-day life scenar io and an in-depth interview guide around the scenario. It covered various aspects of reprod uctive health, reproductive health problems being one of those. The tool also in cluded personal data of the couples, socio-demographic details, information about family and a series of questions around general process of inter spouse communication including t ime, duration, content of communication, determinants etc. The tool was simultaneo usly administered to husband and wife (in absence of each other, separately) by ma le and female researchers respectively. Present paper draws findings from the inte rviews of these 35 married couples. There were sets of questions to know about reproductive health problems among women. Even men were asked to narrate the experience of their wives. As the interviews of men and women were conducted simultaneously and separately, there was no chance that the male interviewer interviewing a husb and would know about his wife's health problem. Hence, all the responses from men and women are spontaneous 27 Caste- It is a group of individuals socially stratif ied on the basis of occupation, enodogamy, social culture and political power Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 128 responses and not probed for cross-checking information rec eived from the other partner. Sample selection and recruitment of couples To cover the entire spectrum of reproductive health rela ted issues- pregnancy, delivery, family planning, sexual relations and reproductive heal th problems; present study focused on married couples that have at least one child and have used a terminal method of contraception (female sterilization 28 ). To minimize the recall bias of the respondent, it was decided to select couples that have u ndergone sterilization, not beyond a period of one year at the time of involving t hem in the study. The study was conducted in villages under the jurisdiction of three (ou t of six) Primary Health Centers (PHC) selected randomly. The PHC staff requested Village Health Functionaries (VHF) 29 to assist the researcher in recruitment of couples, based on the records of female sterilization maintained by them. Couples following the inclusion criteria regarding the time of female sterilization were short listed and then contacted by the VHF. Couples, who verbally gave consent to the VHF to participate in the study, were then approached by the researcher for conducting interview. In all for ty-one couples were identified for interviews, but four of them were not available (husb and and wife to be available at the same time for interview) for interview. There were two respondents-one male and one female (not the same couple), who refused to participat e in the interview without giving any convincing reason for the same. Ethical considerations Since the study was about a sensitive and personal subject of couple communication in reproductive health issues, informed verbal consent from the respondent was obtained at two levels, firstly by the VHF before recruiting them in the study and then by the researcher before starting the interview. They were assu red freedom to participate or withdraw from the study at any given point. The time and place for conducting the interview was decided by the couples and the researcher o ccasionally had to make multiple visits to respect their decision. The researcher e nsured that the respondents were interviewed in complete privacy and no information was revealed to any of the family member, friends or even the spouse. Of course, u sing the information collected 28 Female sterilization is the commonly accepted terminal method of contraception and village health functionaries maintain the record of each woman who undergoes sterilization, irrespective of the place of sterilization, i.e. whether she had i t in a public hospital or a private provider. 29 Village health functionaries- Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and Anganwadi worker- Government run preschools present in every village . Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 129 through this study only for academic purpose and not discu ssing it with and disclosing it to anyone else for any other purpose would ensure the l ast important aspect about protection from harm to the respondent. 7.6. Results 7.6.1. Socio demographic profile of the couples All the couples were Hindu and most of them (27/35) l ived in either a joint or an extended family. Out of 35 couples, 26 men and 33 wom en had studied up to 10 th standard or less than that. Families were mostly agricul turists wherein, 20 and 6 men had agriculture as their main and secondary occupation respectively. These six men were involved in service on contract basis at the time of interview, but had agriculture as the main source of income for their families. All the women were housewives. As the youngest child of all the women was less than three year s old, most of these women were not able to work in the farm or acquire additio nal job and hence only 9 of the 35 women had some secondary occupation as farming, petty busi ness or service. Majority of the couples had completed their family with either t wo (25/35) or three children (9/35). One couple had six children, five daughters before having their son. This profile of the couples is extremely congruent with a rural Maharashtrian community. 7.6.2 Narrations about reproductive health problems experienced by women Almost half of the women in the study had ever experien ced reproductive health related problems. These were complications during pregnancy or del ivery, side effects or infections due to contraceptive usage or symptoms suggestive o f Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI). Men were asked set of questions to resp ond on these issues. However, most of the times, they just mentioned about wife not having any problem or complication. As the interviews of husband and wife were conducted simultaneously and separately, the male interviewer while interviewing the husband of the woman did not know about his wife's health status. Hence, probing men was based on the commonly reported reproductive health problems among women. Little less than 1/4 th of the women had symptoms such as bleeding or pain in th e stomach during pregnancy and were advised to have bed-res t. All these women sought formal care from private practitioner and their husband s accompanied them for seeking care. Most of them mentioned about discussing about the symptoms with their husbands. However, in some cases, husbands' narrations di d not confirm the same. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 130 Moreover, decision about whether the young woman shoul d follow doctor's advice about bed-rest, always depended on the consent from the mothe r-in-law, availability of manpower to manage household chores and possibility of se nding the woman to her natal home for taking rest. \"Mouth of my bag [uterus] was small and the doctor asked me to take rest, sleeping on left side, every afternoon. My husband did no t say anything there. After coming home he told me, \"Not possible. Work at ho me and in the field, how can mother manage these things? Take rest only whenever possible.\" I did not take rest and continued working till the eighth months. \" This woman, 22-year-old housewife living in an extended family, did not have a ny problem during her delivery. Her husband when asked about wife's pregnancy said , \"Sometimes her legs would hurt, or she would have some other pain, then I would give her tablet and water. Or in the evenings, sh e would ask for milk and then I used to give it to her. I have done all that. B ut she did not have any other problem .\"- A 30-year-old farmer studied up to 9 th standard. There were very few women who narrated the experience of miscarriage during pregnancy. These wives when probed mentioned that they ta lked about this event with their husbands and were advised to seek medical care, wi thout having much discussion about the same. However, husbands of none of these women mentioned about any health problem that their wives had during pregnancy. \"I had bleedings, big clots and all. That time, my moth er-in-law and I had some fights, so I did not tell her anything. It dropped d own [miscarriage] and then I went for 'curetting'...whether I talked to husband....Yes...but he w ould not know anything. Why I had stomach ache, why I would have clots an d all? How would a man understand! It was just one and a half months. So he did not really know much. I just told him. Then I went to hospital. My mot her was with me. He also came. \"- A 27-year-old housewife studied up to 11 th standard, recently living in a nuclear family with husband and two children. Her husband mentioned, \"During her pregnancy, she went for check-up to the Gen eral Hospital with my mother. I was not home, most of the times. Later, my pa rents decided to send her to her mother's place because she having weakness. She could not lift heavy things, I would go for work, then how would she manag e? My parents....means Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 131 generally we give them respect when they are in presen t there, otherwise they don't say anything about such issues. So I sent her there, during the sixth month [of her pregnancy] .\"- A 30-year-old man working in a private company as contra ct laborer studied up to 7 th standard. There were a few women who had problem during delive ry such as prolonged labour, tear of vagina, convulsions due to high blood pressure and breach. None of their husbands spontaneously talked about any such problem experi enced by their wives, though their wives talked about discussing these issues wi th their husbands at a later stage. In all these cases, except one the wives were at their natal home for having delivery. \"I was always scared of hospital. He knew it. I was at mo ther's place and had started getting pains, but I never told her. Then I d elivered at home. But there was a tear and I had to be taken to hospital. There w ere no stitches.. it got cured. I did not inform him. I told him only on the n ext day. He was very angry. He always wanted me to deliver in hospital. He came to see me on the 6 th day after the worship on the 5 th day. So during my second delivery, he insisted that I should deliver in hospital and should not wait at h ome. I did that.\"- A 24-year- old woman working as a housewife and as a farmer stud ied up to 5 th standard and living in an extended family. She was at her mother 's house for having both her deliveries. In some families, the couples followed the custom about husband not coming to visit his wife, till the 5 th day worship of the Goddess of Fortune. Her husband did not talk about any problems that his wife had during her delivery. Her husband when asked to narrate about the delivery de tails of his wife said- \"She delivered at home, actually she was on her way to th e hospital, but she delivered there in a tempo. So they brought her back home. Her grandmother was with her. I came know within 1-2 hours and mother w as there. I went there immediately in the evening.\" When asked about what discussion he had with his wife, h e said, \"I asked her about, \"When did your stomach start paining ? At what time?\" It started since previous night. Which vehicle was arranged, w ho all were there? Where was the delivery conducted? She said on the way she delivered.\" Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 132 Everything was normal..she and the baby, it was a baby gi rl .\"- A 32-year-old farmer studied up to 9 th standard and additionally working in a private company. There were little less than \u00bc th of the women who experienced side effects or problems such as having abdominal pain or vaginal discharge after using an Intra Uterine Device (IUD) or condom (by husband). In one case the woman na rrated having conception due to misplaced IUD. There was discrepancy in the responses fr om men about their wives' experience of contraceptive devices. A man narrated about his wife having problem with use of an IUD- \"I used condom..may be for a month. But then I stopped it...just. Then she went and got a Cu-T [IUD] inserted. She had it almost for two years. But then it had gone 'inside' and 'damaged' her so she went and re moved it. Then she conceived within few months .\"- A 32-year-old graduated man looking after his farm and plant nursery, also a former political leader of the village. However, his wife narrated about her husband having pro blem of premature ejaculation. \"Earlier he tried using condom. I was okay with that. There was no problem for me. But he had problem with that. He had \"heat\" in his body. So while putting it on, \"it\" [penis] would become \"small\". So he stopped using it and ther e was no problem with \"heat\". Then I put Cu-T and there was n o problem. I had it almost for two years and then removed it. I did not have an y problem with it.\" A 26- year-old housewife studied up to 10 th standard from an extended family. Lastly little less than \u00bc th of the women narrated about symptoms suggestive of Reproductive Tract Infections- such as irregular menses, va ginal discharge, burning micturation and vaginal prolapse. But these data are o nly based on the narratives from the women and there is no clinical verification availabl e for the same. Except one woman, who had vaginal prolapse, the others mentioned about talking about this with their husbands. However, in most of these couples, t here was discrepancy in the responses from women and their husbands. In some cases the husbands did not mention at all about wives' health problems, whereas so me husbands responded differently about description of symptoms and / or treatm ent seeking of their wives. Following is the narration from the woman who had vag inal prolapse- \"During my first delivery, I had stitches. But they were wrongly put. That place was left out open and the stitches were put in a wrong place. Since then I am having this, it comes out [pointed towards vagina-prolapse].

I will tell him sometimes. He has not yet understood...it is not much. So..............\"- A 24-year-old housewife studied up to 7 th standard living in a nuclear family with her husband a nd two sons. Her husband's narration about his wife's delivery- \"She went to her natal home in the 6 th month [of her pregnancy]. She had her delivery at home. I went to see her on the third day. What to do! People at home, went there turn by turn, so I went on the third day. First my father went, then my brother and then me. Somebody had to be home to look after the farm and the house. I went there, asked whether everything was fine. People at home, means her parents and all said that there was no problem, so I left from there. [Interviewer-Did you talk to her?] No, her house was small. And there were other elder people at home, so even if I wanted to talk to her, it would not be possible. Later, my father decided to bring her back after a mont h and a week and he went to bring her back.\" During the discussion about sexual relationship he said , \"We have it only when she has the 'mood'. If she says, 'No' , I don't force her.\"- A 30-year-old man working in a private company studied up to 7 th standard. 7.7. Discussion The data clearly points out towards discrepancy in the n arrations of men as well as women about experience of reproductive or sexual health problems. Blanc (1996) reviewed couple studied related to reproductive heath a nd stated that concordance between partners on subjective matters is in the range of 60 to 70 percent. There are various possible reasons that could explain the discrepancy. Of course, one cannot overrule the possibility of recall bias on part of one of the partners or unfelt need to disclose about partner's health problem by the respondent s. But more importantly, it is essential to look at these discrepancies in the context of the knowledge, cultural norms about communication and behavior and gender based ste reotypes. The present study population represents a patriarchal male dominated soci ety, where couples are rarely Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 134 encouraged to have open discussion about their reproduct ive or sexual health matters. Researchers have pointed towards gender stereotypes in sexua lity affecting reproductive and sexual health in various ways in India and elsewhere (Verma and Mahendra, 2004; Currie & Wiesenberg, 2003; WHO, 2002 ). As Becker (1996) mentioned possible reasons for incorrect responses between husband and wife on issues such as spontaneous abortions may be that husband was not inform ed about all such events. Hence, the discrepancy in the narrations may be an outco me of lack of communication between married partners because in this study the research ers had no opportunity to verify from the husbands about whether their wives had com municated about their health problems to them. Lack of communication about su ch issues can be due to individual and collective perceptions about the symptom s of possible RTIs, cultural norms about acceptable behaviors of men and women, and gender- and non-gender- based inequalities as was studied among rural couples fr om Tamil Nadu (Santhya and Dasverma, 2002). However, there is a possibility that there was malfunction ing in the communication between the respondent and the researcher, resulting in the discrepancy in the data from husband and wife. In the present study, we try to synthesize possible reasons behind differential narrations with the help of the following diagram. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 135 The diagram 7.1 attempts to present two different pat hways which could result in having differential narrations from husband and wife about an event, in this case reproductive health problem experienced by wife. The Pathway-1 is that wife does not communicate about h er problem to husband and hence obviously, husband does not narrate anything abou t it. There can be various reasons grounded in her individual characters such as percei ved fear about husband's reaction, or biased analysis about husband's nature, ina dequate knowledge about the problem and its seriousness; and about the need to comm unicate it to her husband; or it could be driven by social norms or gender-based stereotypes for example, as one of the women in the study said- \" How would a man understand anything about bleeding an d clots !\" Based on the qualitative data from rural women in South India, Santhya and Dasverma (2002) similarly construed that lack of communicati on between husband and wife may be consequence of individual or collective per ceptions about the causes of symptoms of RTIs, cultural norms about acceptable behaviors of men and women, and gender and non-gender based inequalities. Hence, th is pathway, may be an outcome of the prevailing 'culture of silence' or differential gen der norms for men and women as stated by Ramasubban (1995), operating unfavorably for women. The Pathway-2 is based on the response of the wife tha t she has discussed her reproductive health problem with her husband. Studies have reported that women do discuss about their symptoms with their husbands (Patel, 19 94 and Oomman, 2000). However, the husband communicated or narrated about it to the researcher differently. In this case as well, there can be some individual relate d factors such as inadequate knowledge about the health problem or differential p erceived severity of the problem and hence the unfelt need to communicate the same to the r esearcher. Differential response from husband may be out of recall bias on his part; or the social construct that influences men, generally for not getting involved in reproductive health related discussions, because in India male involvement in reproductive hea lth is still a nascent phenomenon (Apte, 2000; Khan and Panda, 2004). This diagram needs to be further discussed in the context of 'communication' as a process, between the spouses or between one of the spo uses and the researcher. This diagram can be compared with the 'Communication Square ' by psychologist and communication expert, Schulz (1981). He describes four com ponents of communication- Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 136 matter, relationship, self-revealing and appeal. Hen ce in this case, in either of the pathways, there could be differential understanding ab out the matter, context, appeal made by the sender to the receiver while receiving the m essage or the underlying relationship between the sender and receiver (wife to husband, or husband to researcher). Schulz further describes that such differenti al understanding between sender and receiver can malfunction the interpersonal communication. Applying this model to some of differential narrations in the present study, probably explains ' Why a woman was apprehensive about discussing her vaginal pr olapse with her husband?' Santhya and Dasverma (2002) found that rural South Indian women had various perceptions about their husbands' reactions on discl osure of symptoms, as was this woman. As Friedemann says, communication of these w omen with their husbands may have been affected by their understanding of self-re vealing and the consequence of appeal they make through the communication. In another case, the young man was not supposed to mee t his wife for five days after her delivery. This man stated that his wife had no prob lem during her delivery; whereas she narrated experience of tear of vagina. This diffe rence in his narration can be out of recall bias, or lack of knowledge about the symptom or it s seriousness 30 or as a consequence of the traditional practice of men being ab sent during birth of the child as wife goes to natal home for delivery, as was also found by Barua (2006) in rural Maharashtra. A similar approach is explained by Klisch et al (2007) wh o conducted a study in Bolivia which is geographically and culturally the most diverse coun tries in Latin America. The researchers synthesized the experience of partner notifica tion among Bolivian women having Syphilis. Based on Zimmerman (1995) framework, t he researchers stated that there are various components such as intrapersonal, int eractional and behavioral which may affect the notification. Similar to the present stu dy, Klisch et al (2007) stated that interactional component of this framework, focused on two reasons affecting notification, 30 The men's report for Maharashtra, based on the Nati onal Family Health Survey-III in 2005-06, states that , to about 46% of men from rural area h ealth providers had ever told about ' what to do if the mother had any pregnancy complication' . However, this percentage was as low as 24% and 27% in case of telling men specifically about convulsion and vaginal bleeding as signs of pregnancy complications, respectively. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 137 first being the woman's analysis about her partner and se cond being the social constructs. 7.8. Conclusion Husband-wife communication about wife's reproductive h ealth problems is a key strategy to fostering shared decision-making and responsibi lities on reproductive health matters (Santhya and Dasverma, 2002). Differential n arrations of husband and wife about wife's reproductive health problems can be on va rious grounds of individual and collective or societal norms. Analysis and synthesis of such di fferential narrations should be the foremost step before arriving at strategies to i mprove couple communication or partner notification. The diagrammatic representation of two pathways in the present study is just an attempt in this direction and large scale population based research may help in converting it into a model for describing mal functioning communication. However, it prompts us while analyzing differential narrations in couples' study to ensure that malfunctioning of communication between the responden t and the researcher is not misinterpreted as lack of spousal communication. Acknowledgement I appreciate the funding assistance from Swiss Tropical I nstitute for conducting this research. I would like to thank Mr. Rajendra Kale for assisting me in interviewing all the husbands in the study. I am grateful to my husband for d esigning the visuals used in the study tool. 7.9.

This study pointed out that construction of Visually Assisted Interview Guide usin g hand-drawn illustrations was a multifaceted and multi-stepped process. Starting fro m selection of form of visual, artist, themes and sub-themes, it expected a detailed thinking f rom the methodologist around the study subject- objectives, research questions and expect ed outcome of the study, the social and cultural context within which the study is to be conducted and programme and policy related information about the study subject. There were of course, some issues during administration of the tool in the field, such as importance of appropriate introduction and ensuring appropriate place of intervi ew, before showing the visuals to the respondent, and making essential probing around th e visuals based on the responses and reactions of the respondent. Hence, an exper ienced researcher and interviewer becomes the prerequisite before applying such methodology in any given setting for any research. Validation of VAIG at field l evel pointed out that, male as well as female respondents, irrespective of their educational a nd family background , could interpret the visuals and narrated their experiences ar ound couple communication. It helped in conceptualizing the entire process of couple communication in reproductive health within a local cultural context. The respondents were offered essential flexibility while responding to sensitive subjects like sex. The visual s subtracted the respondent and replaced him/her with the individual illustrated and thus provided impersonal yet realistic responses with minimal reservations. Ultimatel y, respondent's reactivity towards visual methodology was important, but the researcher's exp erience of using a visually assisted interview guide with the rural couples was defini tely encouraging in terms of establishing rapport, eliciting the necessary information and making the respondents feel comfortable. In this study husbands and wives were interviewed using th e same tool. In a society, which is otherwise patrilocal and male-dominated, there is a great deal of gender segregation in terms of thoughts and actions. Tradition ally, reproductive health issues are almost exclusively a woman's domain. Hence it was crucia l to elicit responses in this subject from men as well as women. Also, there are not m any published qualitative studies related to understanding process of couple commun ication in reproductive health. Of course, there are studies focusing on couple s and reproductive health related Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 144 issues such as fertility in rural India by Vlassoff and Vlass off, as early as in 1978 and contraception in Switzerland by Hopflinger and Kuhne in 1983 and studies focusing on differential reporting, narrations, perceptions or expe riences of husband and wife in various reproductive health issues (George, 1998; Douthw aite, 1998; Razzaque, 1999). Hence, one of the purposes of interviewing husband and wife was also, to learn about such differentials in the narrations. Also, getting dat a from both the genders on the study subject was important as the views (and experiences) of bot h spouses matter and contribute to a fuller understanding of how couples deci de on their contraceptive practice (Kulczycki, 2008) or reproductive health in general. Addit ionally, this approach had implications during fieldwork and data collection; beca use men and women felt equally important as respondents for giving an interview about their reproductive health communication and experiences. 8.2 Overview of findings Communication of couples, in reproductive health rela ted subjects is discussed in four chapters written as research papers- fertility and plannin g parenthood, sexual relations, childbearing and reproductive health problems. Followi ng is an overview of findings across the four research papers- Chapter 3 focuses on couple communication about fertility and pl anning parenthood at various stages of reproductive life span. Couples do not really discuss about fertility before having their first child and want to have their first child as early as possible which is lin ked to the fact that status of the couples, especially the married woman, is associated with h er ability to prove fertility at the earliest. Obviously, couples are not expected to discuss spacing before proving their motherhood and fatherhood to the society and start tal king about it only after they have their first child, irrespective of whether it is a boy o r a girl. Secondly, husbands are not necessarily the ones who prefe r to have more children and at times, are convinced by wife or mother to have more children 31 . Also, the mother-in- law seems to play a crucial role in a couple's life, deci ding about induced abortion as a 31 National Family Health Survey-III- Total wanted ferti lity rate for rural Maharashtra is 1.79 Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 145 method of family planning. It shows that despite the s econdary status of women in the society, fertility being a women's domain, women rule t he decision-making 32 which was supported by key informants' interviews conducted in the preparatory phase of the study and also reported in other settings such as rural Tamil Nadu, India (Ravindran and Balasubramanian, 2004) and rural Mali (Madhavan, Ad ams & Simon, 2003). High fertility is found to be a preference of women, especially the el der women in the family and though couples communicate about their intentions of ha ving small family they are not able to translate it into reality without consent from them. The study thus emphasizes the importance of involving elder family women in the famil y planning initiatives which primarily promote small family norm. Chapter 4 highlights couple communication and behavior about se xual relationships in relation to existing gender stereotypes. The study shows that married women hesitate to take ini tiative in sex, though few of them have occasionally attempted this and are supported by their husband. There are various reasons behind this, such as stereotypes around ma le and female sexual behavior and the belief that within married unions, se x is a male prerogative and women should not express desire for sex (Goyal, 2002). Women ar e expected to be a passive partner in sex (Isiugo-Abanihe, 2000; Khan, 2001; Ghu man, 2005; Garg and Sharma, 2006) and this study shows that they are not the sole decisi on maker in this regard. However, it is important to note that despite all the values and stereotypes attached to women taking a lead or active role in sex or even being expressive about sex, almost one-fourth of the women in the present study express the ir desires to have sex to their husbands, and more than two-third of the couples exper ience mutually consented sex. Secondly, women talk about having sex against their wish as different from having forced sex. Having sex against their wish arises out of no n-communication about unwillingness on women's part which results out of their perception that sexuality should be controlled by men as was also found by Goyal (2002) or out of submission under pressure to demand for sex from husbands as discussed by Je jeebhoy and Bott (2006). 32 Generally in the kinship oriented family, women's st atus follows a trajectory of having no status to high status, with various milestones indicating r ise in the status. The first milestone is when she proves her fertility. Her status is further elevate d when she gives birth to a male child. Lastly, when her son gets married and she becomes the 'mothe r-in-law', she almost acquires the status as that of the father-in-law or the head of the hou sehold Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 146 Whereas, there are few women in the study, who narrat e experience about forced sex in spite of communicating to their husbands about unwill ingness for the same. In this case, their husbands have presented different and atypical ch aracters regarding their masculinity and have discrepancy in their narration of se xual experience with their wives. The study thus confirms the need for carefully categorizi ng or labeling sex as 'non- consensual' or 'forced sex' and having detailed analysis of sexuality and sexual experiences of men as well as women. The third important finding in this paper details out various reasons initiated and communicated by men or women about following sexual ab stinence. Women have suggested sexual abstinence on religious grounds, which in dicates their adherence to the traditional practices. However, it is important th at men have shown respect towards this desire and suggestion from their wives hinting towar ds the change. On the other hand, men have initiated abstinence for reasons such as family planning and have preferred the same over modern contraceptive method (Ravi ndran and Balasubramanian, 2004). Abstinence for other reasons such as during pregnancy or postpartum is mainly decided by elder women in the famil y. Not many published studies are found on sexual abstinence in the rural married po pulation in India and further investigation is necessary to understand various reasons for following abstinence, the decision-making and its consequences such as probability of high-risk sexual behavior during postnatal abstinence period as is pointed out by Ali and Cleland (2001) In conclusion, women mostly do not act as lead or active p artner in sex within marriage; but they take occasional lead in initiating sex and most o f the times, have sex upon mutual agreement with their husbands. This is a process o f sharing power in sexual relations that has begun recently. In other words, rur al married women challenging the tradition of power relations favoring men, and attemp ting to express their sexuality, is a promising and positive sign of approaching positive repr oductive health. Attempts should be made to build on this process of change, towards havi ng open communication between husband and wife, so as to make their sexual lif e enjoyable and to address their reproductive health needs. Chapter 5 is about learning couple communication and behavior re garding childbearing against the backdrop of traditions. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 147 The first important finding against the backdrop of tr adition of 'not seeking any medical help during pregnancy or childbirth' is that all women in the study sought antenatal care and almost half of them had institutional deliveries. This changed behavior suggests increased possibilities of communication between spouses o n these issues. Secondly, couples present differential patterns in te rms of following traditions or departing from the same, in different areas of childb earing. In issues such as seeking antenatal care, taking care of wife during pregnancy, d ecision about sending wife to her natal home for having delivery and post-natal communicat ion with wife, couples tend to depart more from the traditional practice of restricte d communication. Similar to other studies (Turan et al, 2001; Mullick et al, 2003; Barua, 2006), men were supportive and interested in their wives' well being during antenat al and postnatal period and actively discussed about care with them, though the extent of th eir involvement is not the optimum and there is still scope to improve the same. The study hints towards the fact that, men engaged in non-farm (which is the tradition al occupation) show relatively more departure from traditions and are more communicative with their wives around these subjects. Probably, there are other reasons such as increa sed access to resources, economic opportunities, or programmatic efforts that co ntribute to increased couple communication and change in their behavior regarding reproductive health, but needs to be studied further. However, this changing pattern, fo r example, men accompanying wives during antenatal care, should be viewed as a possibl e opportunity for strengthening couple communication in reproductive health . On the other hand, the third important finding is th at in other specific areas of childbearing, couples still follow the traditional pra ctice of restricted communication; and family network and traditional norms influence the same. These issues are disclosure of pregnancy, duration of woman's stay at natal home and de cision about choosing place of delivery. Traditional norm of discussing reproductive h ealth only among women and restrictions on newly married couples for having open com munication, seemed to affect woman's communication about disclosure of pregnancy. Wome n have mostly discussed it with the mother-in-law and husbands are less involved in this matter. Other areas, where couples have followed traditions are, when the w oman visits her natal home for having delivery. This traditional norm reduces opportuni ties of couple communication during this period, though some of them had sporadic co mmunication over telephone. The issues such as duration of her stay at natal home, ch oosing the place of her delivery Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 148 and dealing with complications around delivery, if any , continue to be discussed and decided among elder family members and husband has no su bstantial role in this regard. Reasons of men's absence from routine care can thu s be 'wife going to natal home for delivery' and existing perception that this issue is in women's domain (Barua, 2006). Also, men though interested, are not encourage d to be involved during childbirth, as was also seen in Zulu community in South Africa (Mul lick et al, 2003). Role of mother-in-law (Chowdhury, 2003) and the woman's paren ts; and the traditions is more influential for young couples during this period. In conclusion, the paper highlights that married couples struggle between following traditions and adapting change in relation to childbe aring, especially in a patriarchal society, where reproductive health is still a women's do main. In spite of men's desire and efforts to be involved in communication and behavio r related to childbearing, traditions and family network play an active role in some areas of childbearing. Hence, research and interventions attempting to achieve reprodu ctive health outcomes such as increased institutional deliveries, Emergency Obstetric Ca re, improved postnatal care as well as postnatal counseling for contraception, should give due consideration towards the continuing influence of family network and traditio ns on young couples. Chapter 6 is a working paper which focuses on the differential re sponses of husband and wife about wife's reproductive health problems. The data clearly reveals a discrepancy in the narrations of men and women about reproductive or sexual health problems in women. There are various reasons that can explain the discrepancy and the paper attempts to analyze the same on two different pathways. First one relates to the possibility of lack of communication between the woman having reproductive health problem and her husb and. This can be a result of individual and collective perceptions about the symptom s of possible RTIs, cultural norms about acceptable behaviors for men and women, and gender- and non-gender- based inequalities (Santhya and Dasverma, 2002). Some women in the study have communicated their reprod uctive health problems to their husbands and the second pathway describes reasons beh ind discrepancy in the narration of husband and wife, despite the issue bein g communicated between them. There can be reasons such as inadequate knowledge abou t the health problem, Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 149 differential perceived severity of the problem and hen ce the unfelt need to communicate the same to the researcher or just a recall bias. Howe ver, it can also be the social construct that influences men, generally for not getting involved in reproductive health related discussions, because in India male involvement in r eproductive health is still a nascent phenomenon (Apte, 2000; Khan and Panda, 2004 ). These findings are then compared with Schulz (1981) Fo ur Square Model of Communication, which describes that such differential u nderstanding between sender and receiver can malfunction the interpersonal communi cation. In conclusion, differential narrations of husband and w ife about wife's reproductive health problems can be on various grounds of individual and collective or societal norms. Analysis and synthesis of such differential narrations shoul d be the foremost step before arriving at strategies to improve couple communication o r partner notification and this paper with two pathways of communication and comparis on with Schulz's (1981) model, prompts us to ensure that malfunctioning of communicati on between the respondent and the researcher is not misinterpreted as lack of couple com munication. 8.3. Study findings in the national and internation al context The present study was conducted in a rural set up of P une District and the study sample represents a patriarchal, kinship-oriented, agrarian community of Western Maharashtra. Even today almost 72% of the Indian population is rura l (Census of India, 2001) and most of the rural communities in India are patriarchal , kinship-oriented, and agrarian, in spite of the religion and caste differences across various r egions and states. C ompared to earlier generations, young people in India are hea lthier, more urbanized and better educated than ever before (Santhya and Jejeebhoy, 2007 ) and the study shows that young couples are engaging themselves more and more in the shared decision-making about their reproductive life. Involvement of men in discussion and decision-making about reproductive health, as the study shows, (also Varkey, 2002; Barua, 2006), should be appreciated in the existing p atriarchal system all over India, which is known to have important implications for the reproductive health beh avior of the males (Koenig and Foo, 1985) and consequently of the couples. For a long time, studies in India have mentioned the subordinate role of women, control of men, constraints and inability to negotiate their reproductive and sex life and access repr oductive health services (Raju Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 150 and Leonard, 2000; Present study challenges these commonly studied fi ndings, favoring one particular gender and it confirms that young couples a re changing in terms of being more supportive and concerned about each other's health desir es and goals. However, it should only lead to interpret that it is the beginnin g of a process of change and there is still a long way ahead to go, because family network, g ender-based stereotypes, traditions and culture, continue to influence young couples, though to varied extent. Further, the pace of this process of change will differ in various rural communities of India having diversities in terms of health services, heal th programmes, presence of NGOs and women's empowerment movements. Consequently, yo ung couples` health behavior and communication is expected to have variations across various settings. Hence, projections based on one such research may not be applicable for the entire rural population of India. But one can expect positive change in couples' reproductive health behavior and communication in most of the youn g population (Santhya and Jejeebhoy, 2007), though with different pace. Researchers, especially in reproductive health, have alwa ys stated the importance of understanding socio-economic and cultural antecedents in different settings (Jejeebhoy, 1995) and context (Cleland, 2006) for successful impleme ntation of programmes and evolving policies. Hence, in a diverse population as that of India, there is always a need for community-based in-depth studies such as this, to capt ure local realities to design feasible and sustainable reproductive health strategies. The changing trend about couples communicating about r eproductive health and taking joint decisions about the same, is seen also in other setti ngs in the world, such as Japan (Ogawa and Hodge, 1999), Sri Lanka (De-Silva, 2000) and Turkey (Kulczcki, 2008). With the positive trends in the study in terms of male in volvement and couple communication, the control of the family network on t he young couples should not be underestimated. Though to lesser extent, than was docu mented in 1996 (World Bank), there is still a tendency to limit communication between spouses, which is asserted through the type of residence and family network or in- laws. In many other kinship and family-oriented societies, spousal discussion is discouraged. In-laws, mostly act as conduits through which partners can exchange ideas (Ezeh, 1993; Blanc, 1996 and Castle et al, 1999), act as gatekeepers in fertility de cisions (Madhavan, Adams & Simon, Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 151 2003) and object young women for seeking health care du ring pregnancy (Chowdhury, 2003). Women in the present study have attempted to e xpress and communicate their sexuality to their husbands. Such communication is likely to promote gender equality in control over sexuality between married partners (Wusu an d Isiugo-Abanihe, 2007) and hence these findings should be valued against existing gen der power relations. 8.4. Conclusion This exploratory qualitative study represents a rural, ki nship-oriented, agrarian society of Western Maharashtra, where family and traditions play a crucial role in couples' married life, from arranging marriage to decision-making in al l the life events. Though the couples in the study communicate about reproductive health issues and men attempt to get involved in it, they are not always able to translat e communication into behavior change, in their compulsion to respect family, traditio ns and culture. The study projects that for young rural married couples it may be challen ging to follow traditions and yet adapt to change. It therefore becomes important to und erstand the entire process of social change, particularly in the area of reproductive health. Couple communication may have a cascading effect on larger health and social iss ues like family health, sexual and domestic violence and healthy marital relationship an d thus should be understood in any given society, in its totality. It is definitely impo rtant to promote couple communication about reproductive health, but equally i mportant is to create an enabling environment for them to do so and take informed decisi ons in a mutually shared manner. As ICPD defines- ' Reproductive health implies that people ......have the capa bility to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so.' However, unless the existing couple communication is studied as a 'process', efforts to improve the same may not be constructive enough. 8.5. Further areas for research The study aimed to understand the process of couple commun ication in reproductive health in its totality and has created platform for fur ther research in this area on the following issues- A study designed to understand the perspective of the h ealth care providers about couple communication and behavior, will be useful to sugg est improvement at Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 152 programme level- for example, experiences of grass-root h ealth worker regarding couple communication around contraceptive use, experiences of health providers about partner notification in case of reproductive health illness and interactions with men during antenatal or post natal visits. Present study has limitations in drawing conclusive stateme nts about determinants of couple communication, though it hints towards factors such as husband's occupation, and influence of family. Hence, large-scale and multi- centric studies are invited to derive models to measure couple communication in reproductive he alth and arrive at determinants that will help to improve the same. Couple communication does not always get translated into behavior change, as present study has shown. But, further research can help in testi ng this hypothesis with justifications, for identifying the barriers in this tra nslation. 8.6. Implications for the public health and reprodu ctive health in local setting There is absence of documentation that describes the ini tiatives to build egalitarian relationships among young couples or measures that would clearly have implications for sexual and reproductive health in India (Santhya and Je jeebhoy, 2007). However, at Maharashtra state level, there is a planned activity ment ioned about conducting rallies (melava ) for mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law, sisters-in-law a nd the newly married couple to improve the homely environment so that the be neficiaries can utilize the Reproductive and Child Health services (State PIP, 2008 -09). The present study findings can provide some leads in designing concrete initiatives and strategies for young married couples- for example, preparing counseling mat erial around sexual abstinence method for various reasons, providing knowledge about r eproductive health problems and illustrating importance of sharing sexual desires, needs and expectations. The study recommends that existing involvement of men in r eproductive health, for example men accompanying wives during antenatal care, sho uld not only be welcomed by the programme and but further utilized as opportun ities to build their skills in communication and motivate them to be more supportive towards their wife to have a share in decision-making. Process of couple communication in reproductive health am ong rural married couples in India 153 Also the study reconfirms that a couple-targeted approach to achieve the desired reproductive health outcome, may not always work, consider ing the impact of family network on young married couples in issues such as fertilit y. Hence, it recommends that tailoring locally suitable strategies focusing on the you ng couples, without ignoring their family, may work better to achieve their 'targets'. F or example- having interactive sessions with the mother-in-law at an individual level an d conducting community-level campaigns for motivating mothers-in-law to be supporti ve towards the young couples.
