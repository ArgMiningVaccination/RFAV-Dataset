Duration of immunity 7.5 / 15 years by studies. Probably lifetime. Longer studies pending. Can have numerous side effects if given too young (< 8 weeks). Parvovirus (MLV) (e.g. Intervet Progard Puppy) 9 weeks 12 weeks 16 - 20 weeks At 1 year MLV Distemper/ Parvovirus only None needed. Duration of immunity 7.5 years by studies. Probably lifetime. Longer studies pending. At 6 weeks of age, only 30% of puppies are protected but 100% are exposed to the virus at the vet clinic. Rabies (killed) 24 weeks or older At 1 year (give 3-4 weeks apart from Dist/Parvo booster) Killed 3 year rabies vaccine 3 yr. vaccine given as required by law in California (follow your stat e/provincial requirements) rabid animals may infect dogs. Vaccines Not Recommended For Dogs Distemper & Parvo @ 6 weeks or younger Not recommended. At this age, maternal antibodies form the mothers milk (colostrum) will neutralize the vaccine and only 30% for puppies will be protected. 100% will be exposed to the virus at the vet clinic. Corona Not recommended. 1.) Disease only affects dogs <6 weeks of age. 2.) Rare disease: TAMU has seen only one case in seven years. 3.) Mild self-limiting disease. 4.) Efficacy of the vaccine is questionable. Leptospirosis Not recommended 1) There are an average of 12 cases reported annually in California. 2) Side effects common. 3) Most commonly used vaccine contains the wrong serovars. (There is no cross-protection of serovars) There is a new vaccine with 2 new serovars. Two vaccina tions twice per year would be required for protection.). 4) Risk outweighs benefits. Lyme Not recommended 1) Low risk in California. 2) 85% of cases are in 9 New England states and Wisconsin. 3) Possible side effect of polyarthritis from whole cell bacterin. Boretella (Intranasal) (killed) Only recommended 3 days prior to boarding when required . Protects against 2 of the possible 8 causes of kennel cough. Duration of immunity 6 months. Giardia Not recommended Efficacy of vaccine unsubstan tiated by independent studies Dr. W. Jean Dodd's vaccination protocol is now being adopted by ALL 27 North American veterinary schools. I highly recommend that you read this. VACCINATION NEWS FLASH I would like to make you aware that all 27 veterinary schools in North America are in the process of changing their protocols for vaccinating dogs and cats. Some of this information will present an ethical & economic challenge to vets, and there will be skeptics. Some organizations have come up with a political compromise suggesting vaccinations every 3 years to appease those who fear loss of income vs. those concerned about potential side effects. Politics, traditions, or the doctor's economic well being should not be a factor in medical decision. NEW PRINCIPLES OF IMMUNOLOGY \"Dogs and cats immune systems mature fully at 6 months. If a modified live virus vaccine is given after 6 months of age, it produces an immunity which is good for the life of the pet (ie: canine distemper,parvo, feline distemper). If another MLV vaccine is given a year later, the antibodies from the first vaccine neutralize the antigens of the second vaccine and there is little or no effect. The titer is not \"boosted\" nor are more memory cells induced.\" Not only are annual boosters for parvo and distemper unnecessary, they subject the pet to potential risks of allergic reactions and immunemediated hemolytic anemia. \"There is no scientific documentation to back up label claims for annual administration of MLV vaccines.\" Puppies receive antibodies through their mother's milk. This natural protection can last 814weeks. Puppies & kittens should NOT be vaccinated at LESS than 8 weeks. Maternal immunity will neutralize the vaccine and little protection (038%) will be produced. Vaccination at 6 weeks will, however, delay the timing of the first highly effective vaccine. Vaccinations given 2 weeks apart suppress rather than stimulate the immune system. A series of vaccinations is given starting at 8 weeks and given 34 weeks apart up to 16 weeks of age. Another vaccination given sometime after 6 months of age (usually at 1 year 4mo) will provide lifetime immunity. There are two types of vaccines currently available to veterinarians: modifiedlive vaccines and inactivated (\"killed\") vaccines. Immunization Schedules There is a great deal of controversy and confusion surrounding the appropriate immunization schedule, especially with the availability of modifiedlive vaccines and breeders who have experienced postvaccinal problems when using some of these vaccines. It is also important to not begin a vaccination program while maternal antibodies are still active and present in the puppy from the mother's colostrum. The maternal antibodies identify the vaccines as infectious organisms and destroy them before they can stimulate an immune response. Many breeders and owners have sought a safer immunization program. Modified Live Vaccines (MLV) Modifiedlive vaccines contain a weakened strain of the disease causing agent. Weakening of the agent is typically accomplished by chemical means or by genetic engineering. These vaccines replicate within the host, thus increasing the amount of material available for provoking an immune response without inducing clinical illness. This provocation primes the immune system to mount a vigorous response if the disease causing agent is ever introduced to the animal. Further, the immunity provided by a modified live vaccine develops rather swiftly and since they mimic infection with the actual disease agent, it provides the best immune response. Inactivated Vaccines (Killed) Inactivated vaccines contain killed disease causing agents. Since the agent is killed, it is much more stable and has a longer shelf life, there is no possibility that they will revert to a virulent form, and they never spread from the vaccinated host to other animals. They are also safe for use in pregnant animals (a developing fetus may be susceptible to damage by some of the disease agents, even though attenuated, present in modifiedlive vaccines ). Although more than a single dose of vaccine is always required and the duration of immunity is generally shorter, inactivated vaccines are regaining importance in this age of retrovirus and herpesvirus infections and concern about the safety of genetically modified microorganisms. Inactivated vaccines available for use in dogs include rabies, canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, etc. W. Jean Dodds, DVM HEMOPET fax: 310/ 8288251 Note: This schedule is the one I recommend and should not be interpreted to mean that other protocols recommended by a veterinarian would be less satisfactory. It's a matter of professional judgment and choice. For breeds or families of dogs susceptible to or affected with immune dysfunction, immune mediated disease, immunereactions associated with vaccinations, or autoimmune endocrine disease (e.g., thyroiditis, Addison's or Cushing's disease, diabetes, etc.) the above protocol is recommended. After 1 year, annually measure serum antibody titers against specific canine infectious agents such as distemper and parvovirus. This is especially recommended for animals previously experiencing adverse vaccine reactions or breeds at higher risk for such reactions (e.g., Weimaraner, Akita, American Eskimo, Great Dane). Another alternative to booster vaccinations is homeopathic nosodes. This option is considered an unconventional treatment that has not been scientifically proven to be efficacious. One controlled parvovirus nosode study did not adequately protect puppies under challenged conditions. However, data from Europe and clinical experience in North America support its use. If veterinarians choose to use homeopathic nosodes, their clients should be provided with an appropriate disclaimer and written informed consent should be obtained. I use only killed 3 year rabies vaccine for adults and give it separated from other vaccines by 34 weeks. In some states, they may be able to give titer test result in lieu of booster. I do NOT use Bordetella, corona virus, leptospirosis or Lyme vaccines unless these diseases are endemic in the local area pr specific kennel. Furthermore, the currently licensed leptospira bacterins do not contain the serovars causing the majority of clinical leptospirosis today. I do NOT recommend vaccinating bitches during "}
