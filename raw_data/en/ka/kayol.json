What is often the case in these scenarios is that a healthcare professional may reduce the dose or discontinue the use of Rhodiola. However, an alternative theory exists. This theory suggests that those individuals experiencing paradoxical effects of Rhodiola at clinically-studied doses may benefit from slightly higher doses (within the accepted safe range) rather than lower doses. How could this be? Practice is an art and, as with any art, there are variances to each artist's preferences based on what they observe in their media. Oftentimes, science influences preferences in the artist, but never does it fully replace the art. Rhodiola is partially metabolized via CYP3A4 and monoamine oxidase (MAO),5,6 and this thoroughfare of metabolism has a myriad of roles. Its window of activity can influence how much of the active constituents of a botanical remain in the system or are further excreted.6 This alone may explain why one person has one experience with Rhodiola and another has a very different experience. Affecting the MAO system can regulate and affect metabolism of neurotransmitters and this too may contribute to variances in experiences.6 Rhodiola Mechanisms of Action Several mechanisms of action are responsible for the effects of Rhodiola including interactions with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, effects on nitric oxide production, and defense mechanism proteins*.3 Salidroside affects normally occurring intracellular products.* Rhodiola beta-endorphins according to preclinical studies*.4 Rhodiola Dosing Most practitioners are familiar with dose dependency. Increasing the dose of any given supplement increases its effect. However, one herbal theory is that Rhodiola can be \"stimulating\" at low doses and have a \"toning\" effect at higher doses. These terms are loosely defined in herbalism. From a basic science opinion, this may mean affecting availability of neurologically important amines.7 Rhodiola may also affect catecholaminergic transmission, through GABA-ergic, serotoninergic, and noradrenergic receptors.* Finally, the herb, or active constituents may also have an effect on corticotrophin-releasing factor.*7 Given the complexity of the herb and its potential pleiotropic effects in the central nervous system, as well as the manner in which it is metabolized, it is no wonder that a diverse species such as homo sapiens may have a broad spectrum of experiences. Given this information, most practitioners begin with a known, studied dose in humans and titrate up or down to reach the desired effect. Seems like a lot can be learned from the practical use of this little herb. REFERENCES - Peschel W, Kump A, Horvath A, Csupor D.
