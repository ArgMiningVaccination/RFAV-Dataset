I am solicitous that~ Journal should lose none of its :intrinsic interest, from its being supposed that in preparing it fur the press, I have drawn from the imagination, either in regard to the incidents or their coloring. For, in the literal troth of the facts, incredible as some of them may appear, my grounds of conviction are my acquaintance with the Author, the impossibility of inventing a narrative like the fullowing, the respectability ofhis re1ations, the standing which his :lather sustained, the confidence reposed in him by fue Hon. J. S. Johnston, fue very respectable senator in congress from Louisiana, who introduced him to me, the concurrent testimony of persons now in~ city, who saw him at different points inN ew Mexico, and the reports, which reached the United States, during the expedition of many of the incidents here recorded. When my finnily first arrived at St Charles' in 1816, the finne ofthe exploits ofhis fu.ther, as officer ofthe rangers, was fresh in the narratives ofhis associates and rellow soldiers. I have been on the ground, at Cap au Oris, where he was besieged by the Indians. I am not unacquainted with the scenery through which he passed on the Missouri, and I, too, fur many years was a sojourner in the prairies. These circumstances, along with a conviction of the truth of the narrative, tended to give me an interest in it, and to qualey me in some degree to judge of the internal evidences contained in the journal itseH; of its entire authenticity. It will be perceived at once, that Mr. Pattie, with Mr. McDuffie, thinks more of action than 1iteratw.\"e, and is more competent to perfurm exploits, than blazon them in eloquent periods. My influence upon the narrative regards orthography, and pliDCtuation [iv] and the occasional interposition of a topographical illustration, which :n:zy acquaintance with 1he accmmts of travellers in New Mexico, and published views of the country have enabled me to furnish. The reader will award me the confidence of acting in good fuith, in regard to drawing nothing from :n:zy own thoughts. I have ful.md more call to suppress, 1han to add, to soften, tban to show in stronger relief many of the incidents. Circumstances of suf.furing, which in many similar narratives have been given in downright plainness of detail, I have been impelled to leave to the reader's imagination, as too revolting to be recorded. The very texture of the narrative precludes ornament and amplification. The simple record of events as they transpired, painted by the hungry, toil-worn hunter, in the midst of the desert, surrounded by sterility, espying the foot print of the savage, or discerning him couched behind the tree or hillock, or bearing the distant howl ofwM beasts, will naturally bear characteristics of stern rusregard of embelliWrent. To alter it, to attetq)t to embellish it, to divest it offue peculiar impress of the narrator and his circumstances, would be to take from it its keeping, the charm of its sirqllicity, and its internal marks of truth In these respects I have been anxious to leave fue narrative as I fumd it. The journalist seems in these pages a legitimate descendant of those western pioneers, fue hunters of Kentucky, a race passing lmfecorded from history. The pencil ofbiograpby could seize upon no subjects of higher interest With hearts keenly alive to the impulses ofhonor and patriotism, and fue charities of kindred and friends; fuey possessed spirits impassible to rear, that no furm of suflering or death could daunt; and ~s fur strength and endurance, as if ribbed with brass and sinewed with steel For them to traverse wide deserts, climb mountains, swim rivers, grapple with the grizzly bear, and encmmter the savage, in a sojourn in the wilderness of years, fur from the abodes of civilized men, was but a spirit-stirring and holiday tmde ofli:fu. [v] To me, there is a kind ofmoral sublimity in the contemplation ofthe adventures and daring of such men. They read a Jesson to shrinking and ei:leminate spirits, the men of soft hands and fushionab1e lifu, whose frames the winds ofheaven are not allowed to visit too roughly. They tend to re-mspire sotmthing of that simplicity ofmmners, manly hardiliood, and Spartan energy and furce of character, which furrred so conspicuous a part of the nature of the user.lfl'ission.comHtudy'mtmanlhlml/patfielpatfie.hlrrll 2/122 5119/13 Pattie's PersCll\\!ll Narralhe, 1824---1830 settlers of the western wilderness. Every one knows with what intense interest the community perused the adventures of Captain Riley, and other intrepid mariners shipwrecked and enslaved upon distant and barbarous shores. It is fur from my thoughts to detract from the intrepidity of American mariners, which is known, wherever the winds bJow, or the waves roll; or to depreciate the interest of the recorded narratives of their su:ffurings. A picture more calculated to arouse American sympathies carmot be presented, than that of a ship's crew, driven by the fierce winds and the mountain waves upon a rock bound shore, and escaping death in 1he sea, only to encmm.ter captivity from the barbarians on the land. Yet rrruch of the courage, required to encmmter these emergencies is passive, counselling on1y the necessity of submission to events, from which there is no escape, and to which all resistance would be unavailing. \u00b7The courage reqrusite to be put furth in an expedition such as that :in which Mr. Pattie and his associates were cast, lmSt be both active and passive, energetic and ever vigilant, and never permitted to shrink, or intermit a moment fur years. At one time it is assailed by hordes of yelling savages, and at another, menaced with the honibJe death oi hunger and thirst in interminabJe furests, or arid sands. Either position ofrers perils and sufle~ sufficiently appalling. But fewer spirits, I apprehend, are funred to brave those of the field, 'Where wilds immeasurably spread, Seem lengthening as they go.' than of the ocean, where the mariner either soon finds rest beneath its tumiltuous bosom, or joyfully spreads his sails again to the bree~. INTRODUCTION THE grandfather of the author of this Journa~ was born in Caroline county, Virginia, in 1750. Soon after he was turned of twenty-one, he moved to Kentucky, and became an associate with those rearJess sp:irits who iirst settled in the western furests. To qualifY him to meet the dangers and encmmter the toils ofhis new position, he had served in the revolutiomry war, and had been brought in hostile contact with the British in their attempt to ascend the river Potomac. He arrived in Kentucky, in company with twenty emigrant fumilies, in 1781, and settled on the south side of the Kentucky river. The new settlers were beginning to build houses with internal finishing. His pursuit, which was that of a house carpenter, procured him constant employment, but he so:rnetimes diversified it by teaching school Soon after his arriva~ the co~ncing settlement experienced the severest and most destructive assaults from the Indians. In August, 1782, he was one of the party who marched to the assistance ofBryant's station, and shared in the glory ofre:Jieving that place by the memorable defeat of the savages. Not long afterwards he was called upon by Col Logan to join a party Jed by him against the Indians, who bad gained a bloody victory over the Kentuckians at the Bhre Licks. He was present on the spot, where the bodies oi the slain Jay unburied, and assisted :in their intenrent. During his absence on this expedition, Sylvester Pattie, father ofthe author, was born, August25, 1782. In November of the same year, his grand-:lather was summoned to join a party co:mrnanded by Col Logan, in an expedition against the Indians at the Shawnee towns, in the limits of the present state of Ohio. They crossed the 31122 5119113 Pal:tie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 Ohio just below [vfu] the rmuth ofthe Licking, opposite the site of what is now Cincinnati, which was at that time an unbroken furest, without the appearance of a human habitation. They were here joined by Gen C1ark with his troops :from the fulls of the Ohio, or what is now Louisville. The united furce marched to the Indian towns, which they burnt and destroyed. Returning from this expedition, he resu:rred his fui\"I\"OOr occupations, witnessing the rapid advance of the country from immigration. When the district, in which he resided, was constituted Bracken county, he was appointed one of the judges of the court of quarter sessions, which office he filled sixteen years, until his place was vacated by an act of the legislature reducing the court to a single judge. Sylvester Pattie, the mther of the author, as was connnon at that period in Kentucky, ImiT:ied early, having only reached nineteen. He settled near his futher's house, and there remained until there began to be a prevalent disposition among the people to move to Missouri March 14, 1812, he removed to that country, the author being then eight years old. Born and reared amidst the horrors of Indian assauhs and incursions, and having Jived to see Kentucky entirely free from these dangers, it may seem strange, that he should have chosen to remove a young fumily to that remote country, then enduring the same horrors of Indian warfilre, as Kentucky bad experienced twenty-five years befure. It was in the midst ofthe late war with England, which, it is well known, operated to bring the fiercest assauhs of savage incursion upon the remote frontiers oflllinois and Missouri To repel these incursions, these then territories, called out so~ companies of rangers, who nmched against the Sac and Fox Indians, between the Mississippi and the lakes, who were at that time active in murdering women and children, and burning their habitations during the absence of the male heads of fumilies. When Pattie was appointed lieutenant in one of these companies, he ]eft his :fumily at St. Charles' where he was then residing. It may be itmgined, that the condition of his wire was sufficiently lonely, as this village contained but one .Alnerican [ix] fiuni1y besides her own, and she was unable to converse with its French inhabitants. His company bad several skirmishes with the Indians, in each of which it came off successful The rangers left him in command of a detachment, in possession of the furt at Cap au Gris. Soon after the main body of the rangers had marched away, the furt was besieged by a body of English and Indians. The besiegers made several attempts to storm the furt, but were repeJled by the garrison.- The fue continued the siege fur a week, continuaiiy firing upon the garrison, who sormtil:res, though not often, fur want of ammu.nition, returned the fire. Lieutenant Pattie, perceiving no disposition in the enemy to withdraw, and discovering that his arrnmmition was ahnost entirely exhausted, deetred it necessary to send a despatch to BellefOntaine, near the point of the junction of the Missouri and MissEsipp~ where was stationed a considerable American furce. He proposed to his command, that a couple of men should make their way through the enemy, cross the Mississipp~ and apprize the commander ofBellefuntaine of their condition. No one was fumd willing to risk the attempt, as the besiegers were encamped entirely around them Leaving Thomas MeN air in command in his place, and putting on the unifOrm of one of the English soldiers, whom they had killed during one of the attempts to storm the furt, he passed by night safu]y through the camp of the enemy, and arrived at the point of his destination, a distance of over furty miles: 500 soldiers were immediately dispatched ftom Bellefuntaine to the relief of the besieged at Cap au Oris. As soon as this furce reached the furt, the British and Indians decamped, not, however, without leaving rmny of their lifeless companions behind them Lieutenant Pattie remained in command of Cap au Oris, being essentiaJJy instrumental in repressing the incursions of the Sacs and Foxes, and disposing them to a treaty of peace, until the close of the war. In 1813 he received his discharge, and returned to his fumily, with whom he enjoyed domestic happiness in privacy and repose fur some 41122 511Q/13 Patlie's PersOil!ll Narratiw, 1824---1830 years. St. Louis and Charles [x] were beginning rapidly to improve; American fumilies were constantly immigrating to these towns. The timber in their vicinity is not of the best kind fur building. Pine couki no where be obtained in abundance, nearer than on the Gasconade, a stream that enters on the south side of the Missomi, about one hundred and fifty miles up that river. Mr. Pattie, possessing a wandering and adventurous spirit, meditated the idea of removing to this frontier and unpeopled river, to erect Mills upon it, and send down pine lumber in rafts to St. Louis, and the adjoining country. He carried his plan into operation, and erected a Saw and Grist Mill upon the Gasconade. It proved a very furtunate speculation, as there was an immediate demand at St. Louis and St. Charles fur all the plank the mill couki supply. In this remote wilderness, Mr. Pattie lived in happiness and prosperity, until the mother of the author was attacked by consmnption. Ahhough her husband was, as has been said, strongly endowed with the wandering propensity, he was no less profoundly attached to his :family; and in this wild region, the loss of a beloved wife was irreparable. She soon sunk mder the disorder, leaving nine young children. Not long after, the youngest died, and was deposited by her side in this fur land. The house, which had been the scene of domestic quiet, cheerfulness and joy, and the hospitable home of the stranger, sojourning in these furests, beca:rre dreary and desolate. Mr. Pattie, who had been noted fur the buoyancy of his gay spirit, was now silent, dejected, and even inattentive to his business; which, requiring great activity and constant attention, soon ran into disorder. About this time, remote trapping and trading expeditions up the Missouri, and in the interior ofN ew Mexico began to be much talked of Mr. Pattie seemed to be interested in these expeditions, which offered much to stir the spirit and excite enterprize. To arouse him from his :indolent me:lancholy, his friends advised him to sell his property, convert it into merchandize and equipments for trapping and hunting, and to join in such an mdertaking. To a 1nan born and reared mder the circumstances [XI] of his early 1ifu -one to whom furests, and long rivers, adventures, and distant mom.rtains, presented pictures of :familiar and birth day scenes -one, who confided in his rifle, as a sure fi.iend, and who witba~ connected dejection and bereavement with his present desolate residence; Jitt]e was necessary to tempt him to such an enterprise. In a word, he adopted the project with that mdoubting and l.mSb:rinking purpose, with which to will is to accomplish. Arrangements were soon made. The Children were provided ibr atllJng his relations. The Author was at schoo~ but inheriting the Jove of a rifle through so many generations, and nursed amid such scenes, he begged so earnestly of his father that he might be allowed to accompany the eJq:~edition, that he prevailed. The sad task rermined for him to record the incidents of the expedition, and the sufferings and death ofhis futher. C MMENCEMENT OF THE EXPEDITION I PASS by, as urrimportant in tl:ris Journal, all the circumstances of om arrangements fur setting out on our expedition; together with my :father's sorrow and mine, at 1eaving the spot where his wire and my mother was buried, the place, which had once been so cheerfuJ, and was now so gloo:rny to us. We made Ol..U' pl..U'chases at St Louis. Om company consisted of five persons. We had ten horses packed with traps, trapping utensils, guns, ammunition, knives, tomahawks, provisions, blankets, and some surplus arms, as we anticipated that we should be able to gam some additions to our number by way of recruits, as we proceeded onward. But when the trial came, so furmidable seemed 1he danger, :fatigue, distance, and tm.certainty of the expedition, that not an individual could be persuaded to 51122 5/19/13 Pattie's Personal Narrati-..e, 1824--1830 share our enterprize. Jme 20, 1824, we crossed the Missouri at a small town called Newport, and meandered the river as fur as Pilcher's furt, without any incident worthy of record, except that one of our associates, who had become too unweD to travel, was left at Charaton, the remotest village on this frontier of any size. We arrived at Pilcher's furt, on the 13th day of July. There we remained, mti1 the 28th, waiting the arrival of a keel boat from below, that was partly freighted with rrerchandize fur us, with which we :intended to trade with the Indians. On the 28th, our number diminished to fuur, we set off fur a trading establishment eight miles above us on the MEsouri, belonging to Pratte, Choteau and Company. In this place centres most of the trade with the Indians on the upper Missouri Here we met with Sylvester, son of Gen. Pratte, who was on his way [14] to New Mexico, with purposes s:imilar to ours. His company had preceded him, and was on the river Platte waiting fur him We left this trading establishment fur the Council BbrflS, six miles above. When we arrived there, the commanding officer demanded to see our license fur trading with the Indians. We infu~d hin:J, that we neither had any, nor were aware that any was necessary. We were :iniDrmed, that we could be allowed to ascend the river no higher without one. This dilemrm brought our onward progress to a dead stand. We were prompt, however, in making new arrangements. We concJuded to sell our surplus a.rrm in exchange fur merchandize, and change our direction from the upper Missouri, to New Mexico. One of our number was so much discouraged with our apparent ill success, and so little satisfied with this new project, that he came to the determination to leave our ranks. The remainder, though dispirited by the reduction of our number, determined not to abandon the undertaking. Our invalid having rejoined us, we still numbered fuur. We remained some time at this beautiful position, the Council BJuflS. I have seen much that is beautiful, interesting and commanding in the wild scenery of nature, but no prospect above, around, and behw more so than from this spot Our object and destination being the same as Mr. Pratte's, we concluded to join his company on the Platte. We left the BluffS, July 30th, and encamped the night after our departure on a small stream, called the Elkhom We reached it at a point thirty miles S. W. :from the BlufiS. The Pawnee Indians sometimes resort upon the banks of this stream The cotmtty is so open and bare of timber, that it was with difficulty we could find sufficient wood to cook with, even on the banks of the river, where wood is fuund, if at all, in the prairie country. Early the next morning we co:rnrrenced our march up the botto:rr.5 of the stream, which we continued to ascend, mti1 alroost night ful1, when we concluded to cross it to a small grove of tin:ber that we descried on the opposite shore, where we encamped [ 15] fur the night, securing our horses with great care, through rear that they would be stolen by the Indians. In the morning, as we were maklng arrangements to co:mrn:;,nce our march, we discovered a iarge body of Indians, :runnirlg full speed towards us. When they had arrived within a hundred yards of us, we made signs, that they n:rust halt, or that we should fire upon them They halted, and we inquired of them, as one of our number spoke their language, to what nation they belonged? They answered the Pawnee. Considering them :friendly, we permitted them to approach us. It was on our way, to pass through their town, and we fullowed them thither. As soon as we arrived at their town, they conducted us to the hdge of their chief; who posted a number of his warriors at the door, and called the rest of his chiefS, accompanied by an :interpreter. They funred a circle in the centre of the lodge. The elder chief then lighting a pipe, commenced smoking; the next chief holding the bowl of his pipe. This mode of smoking differed from that of any Indians we had yet seen He filled his mouth with the smoke, then putred it in our bosoms, then on his own, and then upward, as he sa:id, toward the Great Spirit, that he wouki bestow upon us plenty of fut bu:ffitloes, and an necessary aid on our way. He infOrmed us, that he had two war parties abroad. user.>mssion.com'-ct~mtmanlhiml/patlie/patlla.html 6/122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narrati~oe, 1824--1830 He gave us a stick curiously painted with characters, I suppose son::;ething like hieroglyphics, bidding us, should we see any ofhis warriors, to give them that stick; in which case they woukl treat us kindly. The pipe was then passed round, and we each of us gave it two or three light whillS. We were then treated with fat buffidoe meat, and after we had eaten, he gave us counsel in regard to our future course, particularly not to let our horses loose at night. His treatment was altogether paternal Next morning we left the village of this hospitable old chief; accompanied by a pilot, dispatched to conduct us to Mr. Pratte's company on the Platte. This is one of the three villages of the Republican Pawnees. It is situated on the little Platte River, in 1he centre of an extensive prairie plain; having near [16] it a small strip ofwood extending from fue village 1o the river. The houses are coneshaped, like a sugar loaf The number of lodges may amount to six hundred The night after we left this village, we encamped on the banks of a small creek called the Mad Buflhloe. Here we could find no wood fur cooking, and made our first experiment of the common resort in these wide prairies; that is, we were obliged to collect the dung of the bu.ffilloe fur that purpose. Having taken our supper, some of us stood guard through. the night, while the others slept, according to the advice of the friendly chief Next morning we comn::;enced our march at early dawn, and by dint ofhard travelling through the prairies, we arrived about sunset, on the main Platte, where we joined Mr. Pratte and his company. We felt, and expressed gratitude to the pilot, who, by his knowledge of the comrtry, had conducted us by the shortest and easiest route. We did not furget the substantial expression of our good will, in paying him He started fur his own village the same evenmg, accompanying us here, and returning, on fuot, although he could have had a horse fur the journey. At fuis encampment, on the banks of the Platte, we remained fuur days, during which t:irre we killed some antelopes and deer, and dressed their skins to make us moccasins. Among our ~nts with Mr. Pratte, one was, that my futber should take the cormnand of this company, to which propos:ition my futher and our associates consented. The honor of this confidence was probably bestowed upon him, in consequence of most of the company having served under him, as rangers, during the late war. Those who had not, had been acqmtinted with his services by general report. In confurmity with the general wish, my mther :immediately entered upon his command, by making out a list of the names of the whole company, and dividing it into fuur messes; each mess having to furnish two men, to stand guard by reliefS, during the night. The roll was called, and the company was fuund to be a hundred and sixteen. We had three hundred mules, and some [17] horses. A hundred of them were packed with goods and baggage. The guard was posted as spies, and all the rest were ordered to commence the arrangements of packing fur departure. The guard was detached, 1o keep at some distance :from the camp, reconnoitre, and discover :if any Indians were lurking in the vicinity. When on the march, the guards were ordered to move on within sjgbt of our flank, and parallel to our line of march. If any Indians were descried, they were to make a signal by raising their hats; or if not in sight of us, to alarm us by a pistol shot. These ~ gave us a chance always to have some little time to make ready fur action It may be imagined, 1hat such a caravan made no mean figure, or inconsiderable dust, in moving along the prairies. We started on the morning of1he 61h of August, travelling up the main Platte, which at this point is more than a hundred yards wide, very shallow, with a clean sand bottom, and very high banks. It is skirted with a thin belt o1 cotton-wood and willow trees, :from which beautiful prairie plains stretch out indefinitely on either side. We arrived in the evening at a village of the Pawnee Loups. It is larger than the village of the Republican Pawnees, which we had left behind us. The head chief of fuis village received us in the most atrectionate and hospitable manner, user.>mssion.ccmt-IT!X\u00a5m1manlhlml/patlielpatlia.html 7/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrati'IA':l, 1824--1830 supplying us with such provisions as we wanted. He had been an the way from these remote prairies, on a visit to the city of Washington. He infu11:1Xd us, that befure he had taken the journey, he had supposed that the white people were a small tribe, like his own. and that he had round them as numberless as the spires of grass on his prairies. The spectacle, however, that had struck him with DDst astonishment, was bu11ets as large as his head, and guns of the size of a log of wood. His people cultivate com, beans, pumpkins and wate11:1Xlons. Here we remained five days, during which time Mr. Pratte purchased six hundred Bufiitlo skins, and sorre horses. A Pawnee war party came in from an expedition against a hostile tribe of whom they bad killed and scalped four, and taken twenty horses. We were affucted at the sight of a little chiki, taken [ 18] captive, whose mother they had killed and scalped. They could not account fur bringing in this child, as their warfare is an indiscriminate slaughter, of :men, worren and children. A day or two after their arrival, they painted thel\"'lSelves fur a celebration of their victo:ry, with great labor and care. The chiefS were dressed in skins of wild animals, with the hair on.-These skins were principally those of the bear, wolf; panther and spotted or ring tailed panther. They wore necklaces ofbear's and panther's claws. The braves, as a certain class of the warriors are called, in addition to the dress of the other chiefS, surmounted their heads with a particular feather from a species of eagle, that they call the war eagle. This feather is considered worth the price of ten ordinary horses. None but a brave is permitted to wear it as a badge. A brave, gains his natre and reputation as much by cunning and dexterity in stealing and robbing, as by courage and success in murdering. When by long labor of the toilette, they had painted and dressed themselves to their liking, they marched furth in the array of their guns, bows, arrows and war chlbs, with all the other appendages of their warfu.re. They then raised a tall pore, on the top of which were attached the scalps of the fues they had killed. It must be admitted, that they rnarrlfusted no smal1 degree of genius and inventiveness, in making thel\"'lSelves frightful and horrible. When they began their triw:npha] yelling, shouting, singing and cutting antic capers, it seemed to us, that a recruit of fiends from the infernal regions could hardly have transcended them in genuine diabolical display. They kept up this infumal din three days. During all this time, the poor little captive child, barely red to sustain lire, lay in sight, bound band and fuot When their rage at length seemed sated, and exhausted, they took down the pole, and gave the scalps to the women. We now witnessed a new scene ofye.lls and screams, and infuriated gestures; the actors kicking the scalps about, and throwing them from one to the other with strong expressions of rage and contempt When they a.Jso ceased, in the apparent satismction of gratified revenge, the men directed their attention [19] to the little captive. It was removed to the mec.licine lodge, where the tredicine men perfOrm their incantations, and make their o:flirilgs to the Great Spirit. We perceived that they were making preparations to btm the child. Alike affucted with pity and horror, our party appealed, as one man, to the presiding chie~ to spare the child. Our first proposition was to purchase it. It was received by the chief with manifest displeasure. In reply to our strong reDDnstrances, he gravely asked us, if we, seeing a young rattlesna.lce in our path, would aTiow it to move off uninjured, merely because it was too small and feeble to bite? We undertook to point out the want of resemblance in the circumstances of the compari;on, observing that the child, reared among them, would know no other people, and would :imbibe their habits and enmities, and becmre as one of them The chief replied, that he bad made the exper.irnent, and iliat the captive children, thus spared and raised, had only been instru:rrenta~ as soon as they were grown, of bringing them into difficulties. 'It is' said he, 'like taking the eggjj of partridges and hatching them; you may raiqe them ever so carefully in a cage; but once tum them loose, and they show their nature, not only by fiying away, but by bringing the wild partridges into your com fields: eat the eggjj, and you have not only the fuod, but save yourself future trouble.' We again urged that the child was too small to nyure them, and of too little consequence to give them the pleasure of revenge in its destruction. To enfurce our arguments, we showed him a roll of red broad cloth, the :favorite color with the Indians. This dazzled and deligbted him, and he eagerly asked us, how much we would give 13/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824--11330 him. We insisted upon seeing the child, befOre we made him an offur. He led us to the hdge, where 1ay the poor 1itt1e captive, bound so tight with thongs of raw hide, that the flesh had so swelled over the hard and dried leather, that the strings could no hnger be perceived. It was ahnost furnished, having scarcely tasted rood fur four days, and seemed rather dead than alive. With much difficuhy we disengaged its limbs from the thongs, and perceiving that it seemed to revive, we offured him [20] ten yards, of the red cloth. Expatiating upon the trouble and danger of his warriors in the 1ate expedition, he insisted, that the price was too little. Having the child in our possession, and beginning to be incUgnant at this mrion of avarice and cruehy, our company exchanged glances of intelligence. A deep flush su:fi.Used the countenance of my father. 'My boys,' said he, 'will you allow these unnatural deviJs to bum this poor child, or practice extortion upon us, as the price of its ransom?' The vehemence and energy, with which these questions were proposed, had an effuct, that may be easily imagined, in kindling the spirits of the rest of us. We carried it by acc:Jamation, to take the child, and let them seek their own redress. My :father again o:ffured the chief ten yards of cloth, which was refused as befOre. Our remark then was, that we would carry off the child, with, or without ransom, at his choice.- Meanwhile the child was sent to our encampment, and our men ordered to have their at11l') in readiness, as we had reason to rear that the chief would let loose his warriors upon us, and take the child by force. The old chief looked my futher full in the fuce, with an expression of apparent astonishment 'Do you think' said he, 'you are strong enough to keep the child by furce?' 'We will do it,' answered my father, 'or every man of us die in the attempt, in which case our country:men will come, and gather up our bones, and avenge our death, by destroying your nation' The chief replied with well dissembled calmness, that he did not wish to incur the enmity of our people, as he well knew that we were more powerful than they; alledging, beside, that he had made a vow never to kill any more white men; and he added, that if we would give the cloth, and add to it a paper of vermillion, the child should be ours. To this we consented, and the contract was settled. We :immediately started fur our encampment, where we were aware our men had been making arnmgements fur a battle. We had hardly expected, under these circl.D't!itances that the chief would have fuDowed us alone into a camp, where every thing appeared hostile. But he went on with us unhesitatingly, [21] until he came to the very edge of it. Observing that our men had made a breast work of the baggage, and stood with their arms ]earring against it ready fur action, he paused a :rm:ment, as if faltering in his purpose to advance. With the peculiar Indian exc1amation, he eagerly asked my futher, if he had thought that he would fight his friends, the white people, fur that 1itt1e child? The reply was, that we only meant to be ready fur them, if they had thought to do so. With a smiling countenance the chief advanced, and took my futher's hand exc:Jaiming, that they were good friends. 'Save your powder and 1ead,' he added, 'to kill bu:ffilhes and your enemies.' So saying he ]eft us fur his own hdge. This tribe is on terms of hostility with two or three of the tribes nearest their hunting grounds. They :rmke their incursions on horseback, and often extend them to the d:ista11Ce of six o:r seven hundred miles. They chiefly engage on horseback, and their weapons, fur the most part, consist of a bow and arrows, a :lance and shield, though many of them at present have :fire arms. Their commander stations himself in the rear ofbis warriors, seldom taking a part in the battle, unless he should be himself attacked, which is not often the case. They show no inconsiderab]e military stratagem in their marches, keeping spies befure and behind, and on each flank, at the distance of a fuw days trave~ so that in their open country, it is a1rnost impossible to come upon them by surprise. The object of their expeditions is quite as often to phmder and steal horses, as to destroy their enemies. Each one is provided with the Spanish noose, to catch horses. They often extend these plundering expeditions as fur as the interior ofN ew Mexico. When they have reached the settled country, they lurk about in covert p1aces, until an opportunity presents to sere on their prey. They full upon the owner of a large establishment of cattle and horses, kill him during the night, or so alarm him as to cause him to fly, and leave his herds and fiuni1y unprotected; in which case Pattie's PersOI'IBII Narratiw, them in the mountains. In these :fustnesses of nature they consider them safu; [22] aware that the Mexicans, partly through timidity, and partly through indolence, will not pursue them to any great distance. We left this village on the 11th of August, taking with us two of its inhabitants, each having a trap to catch, and a hoe to dig the beavers from their burrows. During this day's march we traversed a wide plain, on which we saw no gmre but antelopes and white wolves. At five in the evening, our front guard gave the preconcerted a1ann by firing their pistols, and fulling back a rew moments afterwards, upon the main body.-We shortly afterwards discovered a large body of Indians on horseback, approaching us at full speed. When they were within hailing distance, we made them a signal to halt: they immediately halted. Surveying us a mnnent, and discovering us to be whites, one of them ca:me towards us. We showed him the painted stick given us by the Pawnee Republican chief He seemed at once to comprehend an that it conveyed, and we were infurmed, that this was a band of the Republican Pawnee warriors. He carried the stick among them. It passed from hand to hand, and appeared at once to satisfY them in regard to our peaceable intentions, fur they continued their march without disturbing us. But our two associate Indians, bearing their yells, as they rode off; took them to be their enemies, :from whom they had taken the child. They iml.nediately disappeared, and rejoined us no more. We travelled a fuw miles further, and encamped fur the night on a small stream, called Smoking river. It is a tributary stream of the main Platte. On this stream a fumous treaty had been made between the Pawnees and Shienne; and from the friendly smoking of the calumet on this occasion it received its name. Next morning we made an early start, and marched rapidly an day, in order to reach water at night We halted at sunset to repose ourselves, and furmd water fur our own drinking, but none fur om rrrules and horses. As soon as the moon arose, we started again, travelling hard an night, and until ten the next morning. At this time we reached a most singular spring fuuntain, funning a basin fuur hundred yards in diameter, in the centre [23] of which the water boiled up five or six fuet higher, than it was near the circu.:mf.ereru::e. We encamped here, to rest, and reed our mules and horses, the rem:tinder of the day, during which we k:iDed some antehpes, that came here to drink. Near this p1ace was a high mound, from which the eye swept the whole horiwn, as fur as it could reach, and on this mound we stationed our guard. Next morning we commenced the toil of om daily march, pursuing a S. W. course, over the naked plains, reaching a small and, as fur as I know, a nameless stream at night, on the borders of which were a fuw sparse trees, and high grass. Here we encamped fur the night. At twelve next day we halted in consequence of a pouring rain, and encamped fur the remainder of the day. This was the first point, where we had the long and anxiously expected pleasure of seeing buflhloes. We killed one, after a most animating sport in shooting at it. Next day we made an early start, as usua], and travelled hard an day over a wide plain, meeting with no other incidents, than the sight ofbuffuloes, which we did not molest We saw, in this day's march, neither tree nor rising ground. The plains are covered with a short, fine grass, about fuur inches high, of such a kind, as to be very iqjurious to the hoofS of animals, that travel over it. It seems to me, that ours would not have received more iqjury from travelling over a naked srice of rock. In the evening we reached a small collection of water, beside which we encamped. We had to collect our customary inconvenient substitute fur fue~ not only this evening, but the whole distance hence to the mmmtains. On the morning of the 17th, we cormneru::ed, as usua~ our early march, giving orders to our advance guard to la.ll a bu:fihloe bull, and make moccasins fur some of our horses, from the skin, their reet having become so tender from the irritation of the sharp grass, as to make them travel with difficulty. This was soon accomplished, furnishing the only incident of this day's travel We continued the next day to make our way over the same wearying plain, without user.lfl1ission.comHrudy'l'l'llnlanlhlml/pattielpattie.h1ml 10/122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 water or timber, having been obliged [24] to provide more of our horses with bu:tfuloe sldn moccasins. 'This day we saw numerous herds ofbu:tfuloe bulls. It is a singular met, in the habits of these animals, that during one part of the year, the bulls all range in ~nse flocks without a cow ammg them, and an the cows equally without the buDs. The herd, which we now saw, showed an evident disposition to break into our caravan. They seemed to consider our horses and mules, as a herd of their cows. We prevented their doing it, by firing on them, and killing several This evening we arrived on one of the furks of the Osage, and encamped. Here we caught a beaver, the first I bad ever seen. On the 20th, we started Jate, and made a short day's trave~ encamping by water. Next morning we discovered vast numbers of bufihloes, an running in one direction, as though they were flying from some sort oi pursuit. We il:m:rediately detached men to reconnoitre and ascertain, whether they were not flying from the Indians. They soon discovered a large body of them in full chase of these animals, and shooting at them with arrows. As their course was directly towards our camp, they were soon distinctly :in sight. At this moment one of our tren rode towards them, and discharged his gun. 'This il:m:rediately turned their attention from the pursuit of the ~. to us. The Indians halted a moment, as if in deliberation, and rode off in another direction with great speed. We regretted that we had taken no treasures to ascertain, whether they were friendly or not. In the latter case we bad sufficient grmmd to apprehend, that they woukl pursue us at a distance, and attack us in the night. We made our arrangements, and resumed our march in haste, travelling with great caution, and posting a strong guard at rrlgbt. The next day, in company with another, I kept guard on the right flank. We were both s1rictly enjoined not to fire on the buffuloes, while discharging this duty. Just befure we encamped, which was at fuur in the afternoon, we discovered a herd ofbuffuloe cows, the first we had seen, and gave notice on our arrival at the camp. Mr. Pratte :insisted, that we had mistaken, and said, that we were not yet :tar enough advanced into the country, [25] to see cows, they generally herding in the most retired depths of the prairies. We were not disposed to contest the point with him, but proposed a bet of a suit of the finest cloth, and to settle the point by killing one of the herd, if the commander woukl permit us to fire upon it. The bet was accepted, and the permission given. My companion was armed with a musket, and I with a rifle. When we came in sight of the herd, it was approaching a little pond to drink. We concealed ourselves, as they approache~, and my companion requested ln': to take the iirst fire, as the ritle was surer and closer than the musket. When they were within shooting distance, I levelled one; as soon as it :rea the herd, which consisted of a thousand or more, gathered in crowds aromd the :fullen one. Between us we :k_i&d eleven, an proving, according to our word, to be cows. We put our miles in reqlrisition to bring in our ample supply of meat. Mr. Pmtte admitted, that the bet was k>st, though we declined accepting it. About ten at night it co:rnmenced raining; the rain probably caused us to intermit our caution; fur shortly after it began, the Indians attacked our encampment, firing a shower of arrows upon us. We returned their fire at random, as they retreated: they killed two of our horses, and slightly wounded one of our men; we fuund fuur Indians :k_i&d by our fire, a.\"'ld one wounded. The wmmded Indian infOrmed our interpreter, th::!t the Lnd:ians, who attacked us, were Arrickarees. We remained encamped here fuur days, attending our wounded man, and the wounded Indian, who died, however, the second day, and here we buried him. We left this encampment on the 26th, and through the day met with continued herds ofbufihloes and wild horses, which, however, we did not distln\"b. In the evening we reached a furk ofthe Platte, called Hyde Park. This stream, furrnerly noted fur beavers, still sustains a rew. Here we encamped, set our traps, and caught fuur beavers. In the morning we began to ascend this stream, and during our progress, we were obliged to keep men in advance, to a:ffiigbten the bu:ffilk>es and w.i1d horses [26] from our path. They are here in such prodigious numbers, as literally to have eaten down the grass of the prairies. user.>mission.com'-ctuc\u00a5l'lllmanJh1ml/patlie/patlia.hlml 11/122 5/19!13 Pattie's Personal Narraliw, 1824--1830 Here we prairie dogs. They have large village establis:brrents of burrows, where they live in society. They are sprightly, boki and self important animaJs, of the size of a Norwegian rat. On the morning of the 28th, our wmmded companion was again unable to traveL in consequence of which we were detained at our encampment three days. Not wholly to lose the ~. we killed during these three days 110 bu.ffilloes, of which we saved only the tongues and hump ribs. On the morning of the 31st, our wounded associate being somewhat recovered, we resumed our march. Ascending the stream, in the course of the day we came upon the dead bodies of two men, so much mangled, and disfigured by the wild beasts, that we could onJy discover that they were white men. They bad been shot by the Indians with arrows, the ground near them being stuck full of arrows. They had been scalped. Our feelings may be imagined, at seeing the mangled bodies of people of our own race in these remote and unpeopled prairies. We consoled ourselves with believing that they died like brave men. We bad soon afterwards clear evidence of this met, fur, on surveying the vicinity at the distance of a rew hundred yards, we round the bodies of :five dead Indians. The ground all around was tom and trampled by horse and fuotrnen. We collected the remains of the two white men, and buried them We then ascended the stream a rew miles, and encamped. Finding signs of Indians, who could have left the spot but a rew hours befure, we made no fire fur rear of being discovered, and attacked in the night. Smmtime after dark, ten of us started up the creek in search of their fires. About fuur miles from our encampmmt, we saw them a few hundred yards in advance. Twenty fires were distinctly visible. We counse11ed with each other, whether to fire on them or not Our conclusion was, that the most prudent plan was to return, and apprize our companions of what we had seen. In consequence of our in:furmation, on our return, sixty men were chosen, headed by my father, who set off in order [27] to surround their camp befure daytigbt. I was one of the number, as I should have little liked to have my :father go into battle without me, when it was in my power to accompany him. The remainder were left in charge of our camp, horses, and mules. We bad examined our arms and fm.md them in good order. About midnight we came in sight of their fires, and befure three o'clock were posted all around them, without having betrayed ourselves. We were commanded not to fire a gun, until the word was given. As it was still sometime befure daylight, we became almost impatient fur the command. As an Indian occasionally arose and stood fur a :moment befure the fire, I invo 1untarily took aim at him with the thought, how easily I could destroy him, but my orders withbeki me. Twilight at length came, and the Indians began to arise. They soon discovered two of our men, and instantly raising the war shout, came upon us with great fury. Our 1t1fm stood :firm, until they received the order which was soon given. A well directed and destructive fire now opened on them, which they received, and retmned with some firmness. But when we closed in upon them they fled in confusion and dismay. The action 1asted fifteen minutes. Thirty of their dead were left on the fieki, and we took ten prisoners, whom we compelled to bury the dead. One of our men was wounded, and died the next day. We took our prisoners to our encampment, where we questioned them with regard to the two white men, we had round, and buried the preceding day. They acknowledged, that their party killed them, and assigned as a reason fur so doing, that when the white mm were asked by the chief to divide their powder and balls with him, they refused. It was then determined by the chie~ that they should be killed, and the who:le taken. In carrying this purpose into e:frect, the Indians lost fuur of their best young men, and obtained but little powder and lead, as a compensation. We then asked them to what nation they belonged? They answered the Crow. This nation is distinguished fur bravery and skill in war. Their bows and arrows were then given 1hem, and they were toki, that we never killed defenceless prisoners, but [28] that they must tell their brothers of us, and that we should not have killed any of their nation, had not they killed our white brothers; and if they did so in future, we should kill all we round of them, as we did not rear any number, they could bring against us. They were then a11owed to go free, which delighted them, as they probably expected that we should kill them, it being their custom to put all their prisoners to death by the roost shocking and cruel tortures. That they may not lose this diabolical pleasure by the escape of their prisoners, they user .lrnissioo.coml-ctuc\u00a5mtmanlhlml/patlielpaltia.hlml 121122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 guard them closely day and night. One of them, upon being released, gave my father an eagle's feather, saying, you are a good and brave man, I will never kill another white man We pursued our journey on the 1st of September. Our advance was :made with great caution, as bu:fihloes were now seen :in :immense herds, and the danger from Indians was constant. Wandering tnbes of these people subsist on the buffitloes, which traverse the interior of these plains, keeping them constantly in sight On the mmling of the 2d, we started early. About ten o'clock we saw a large herd ofbu:ffuloes approaching us with great speed. We endeavored to prevent their nmn:ing among our pack miles, but it was :in vain. They scattered \"them :in every direction over the p:Jain; and although we rode in among the herd, firing on them, we were obliged to follow them an hour, befure we could separate them sufficiently to regain our mules. After much labor we collected all, with the exception of one packed with dry goods, which the crowd drove befOre them The remainder ofthe day, half our company were employed as a guard, to prevent a similar occurrence. When we encamped fur the night, sorre tirre was spent :in driving the bufihloes a considerable distance from our camp. But fur this precaution, we should have been in danger oflosing our horses and mules entirely. The fOllowing rooming, we took aS. S. W. course, which led us from the stream, during this day's journey. Nothing occurred worthy of rrention, except that we saw a great mnnber of [29] wolves, which had surrounded a s:mall herd ofbu:ffuloe cows and calves, and killed and eaten several We dispersed them by firing on 'them We judged, that there were at least a thousand. They were large and as white as sheep. Near this point we fuund water, and encamped fur the night. On the morning of the 4th, a party was sent out to kill sorre bu:ffiiloe bulls, and get their skins to make moccasins fur our horses, which detained us until ten o'clock. We then packed up and travelled six miles. Finding a lake, we encamped fur the night From this spot, we saw one of the roost beautiful1andscapes, that ever spread out to the eye. As fur as the p:Jain was visible in all directions, innumerable herds of wild. horses, buflhloes, antelopes, deer, elk, and wolves, red in their wild and fierce :freedom. Here the sun rose, and set, as unobscured :from the sight, as on the wastes of ocean. Here we used the last of our salt, and as fur bread, we had seen none, since we had left fue Pawnee village.

Looking in, we saw the Indians all laying prostrate with their fuces to the ground. We rema:ined observing them, until the :fu111igbt of day came upon them-They then arose, and placed themselves aromd the fire. The next rrnvet.mnt was to light a pipe, and begin to smoke. Seeing them blow the srrnke first towards the point where the sm arose, and then towards heaven, our curiosity was aroused, to know the meaning of what we had seen. The old chief told us by signs, that they had been thanking the Great Spirit fur allowing them to see another day. We then purchased a fuw beaver [31] skins ofthern, and left them Our encampment fur the evening of this day, was near a small spring, at the head of which we fuund a great natural curiosity. A rock sixteen yards :in circUll.lfurence, rises from eighty to ninety feet :in height, according to our best judgment, from a surfuce upon which, in all directions, not the smallest particle of rock, not even a pebble can be fuund. We were unable to reach the top of it, although it was full of holes, in which 1he hawks and ravens built their nests. We gave the spring the naJ.re ofRock Castle spring. On the morning offue 9th, we left this spot, and at night reached the fuot of a large dividing ridge, which separates the waters of the Platte from those of the Arkansas. After completing our arrangements fur the night, sot.m of us ascended to the top of the ridge, to look out fur Indians; but we saw none. The succeeding morning we crossed 1he ridge, and cat.m to water in the evening, where we encamped. Here we killed a white bear, which occupied several ofus at least an hour. It was constantly in chase of one or another of us, thus withholding us from shooting at it, 1hrough rear of wounding each oilier. This was the first, I had ever seen His claws were fuur inches long, and very sharp. He had killed a bu:tmloe bull, eaten a part of it, and buried the remainder. When we came upon bim, he was watching the spot, where he had buried it, to keep off 1he wolves, which literally surrounded him. On the 11th, we travelled over sot.m hilly ground. In the course of1he day, we killed 1hree white bears, the claws of which I saved, fuey being of considerable value among the Indians, who wear them around the neck, as the distinguishing mark of a brave. Those Indians, who wear this ornament, view those, who do not, as their inferiors. We cat.m to water, and encamped early. I was one ofthe guard fur 1he night, which was rather cloudy. About the middle of my guard, our horses became measy, and :in a rew rroments more, a bear had gotten :in among them, and sprung upon one of fuem, The others were so much alarmed, that they burst their fustenings, and darted off at ful] speed. Our camp was soon aroused, and [32] in anns, fur defence, ahhough ImJCh confused, from not knowing what the enemy was, nor from what direction to expect the attack. So~, however, irmmdiately set off in pursuit of our horses. I still stood at my post, in no little alarm, as I did not know with the rest, if the Indians were armmd us or not An around was again stillness, the noise of those in pursuit of the horses being lost in the distance. Suddenly my attention was arrested, as I gazed in the direction, from which 1he alarm cat.m, by a noise like that of a struggle at no great distance from J.re. I espied a hulk, at which I immediately fired. It was the bear devouring a horse, still alive. My shot wounded him The report of my gun, together with the noise made by the enraged bear, brought om men from the camp, where fuey awaited a second attack from tbe unknown enemy in perrect stillness.\u00ad Detennined to avenge themselves, they now salOOd furth, although it was so dar~ that an object ten steps in advance could not be seen. The growls of the bear, as he tore up the ground around him with his claws, attracted all in his direction. Some of the men came so near, that the animal saw them, and made towards them They all fired at him, but did not touch him All now fled from the furious anilm~ as he seet.md intent on destroying them In this general flight one of the men was caught. As he scre~d out in his agony, I, happening to have reloaded my gun, ran up to relieve him Reaching 1he spot in an instant, I placed the muzzle of my gun against the bear, and discharging it, killed him Our companion was Jiterally tom in pieces. The flesh on his hip was tom off: leaving the sinews bare, by the teeth of1he bear. His side was so wounded in three places, that his brea1h came 1hrough the openings; his head was dreadfully bruised, and his jaw broken. His breath came out :from both sides of his windpipe, the animal in his fury having placed his teeth and claws in every part of his body. No one could have supposed, that there was 1he slightest possibility of his recovery, through any b:w:mn means. days, attending upon him, without seeing any change fur the worse or better in his situation. [3 3] He had desired us from the :first to leave him, as he considered his case as hope:less as ourselves did. We then concluded to rmve from om encampment, :leaving two men with him, to each of whom we gave one dollar a day, fur remalning to take care ofhirn, until he should die, and to bury him decently. On 1he 14th we set o:O; taking, as we believed, a :final :leave of our poor companion. Our feelings may be imagined, as we :left this su.frering man to die in this savage region, unfr:iended and unpitied. We travelled but a few miles befOre we came to a fine stream and some timber. Concluding \"that this would be a better place fur om unfOrtunate companion, than the one where he was, we encamped with 1he intention of sending back fur him We despatched men fur bim, and began to prepare a shelter fur bim, should he arrive. This is a fbrk ofSrmke Hill river, which empties into the Platte. We set traps, and caught eight beavers, during the night. Our companions with the wounded man on a litter, reached us about eight o'clock at night. In the rmming we bad our painful task of leave taking to go through again. We promised to wait fur the two we :left behind at the Arkansas river. We travelled aD day up this stream-! cmmted, in the course of the day, two hundred and twenty white bears. We killed eight, that made an attack upon us; the claws of which I saved. Leaving the stream in the evening we encamped on the plain. A guard of twenty was relieved through the night, to prevent the bears from coming in upon us. Two tried to do it and were killed. In the rmming we began our march as usual returning to the stream, we trave11ed until we came to its head. The fuuntain, which is its source, boils up :from the plain, funning a basin two hundred yards in circumfurence, as clear as crystal, about five feet in depth. Here we killed some wild geese and ducks. After advancing some distance further we encamped fur the night. Buffidoes were not so numerous, during this day's journey, as they had been some time previous, owing, we judged, to the great numbers of white bears. [34] On the 171h we trave11ed until sunset, and encamped near water. On the 18th we fbl.Dld no water, but saw great numbers of wild horses and elk. The succeeding morning we set o:ffbefbre light, and encamped at 4 o'clock in the afternoon by a pond, the water of which was too brackish to drink. On the 20th we fuund water to encamp by. In the course of the day I killed two fut bl.lffilloe cows. One of them had a calf: which I thought I would try to catch alive. In order to do so, I concluded it would be well to be free :from any mmecessary incumbrances, and accordingly :laid aside my shot-pouch, gun and pistols. I expected it would nm, but instead of that, when I came within six or eight reet of it, it turned around, and ran upon me, butting me like a ram, until I was knocked flat upon my back. Every time I attempted to rise, it laid me down again. At 1ast I caught by one of its legs, and stabbed it with my butcher knife, or I believe it wouki have butted me to death. I made up my ~ that I would never attempt to catch another bu:ffidoe calf alive, and also, that I would not tell my companions what a capsizing I had had, n 1though my side did not reel any better fur the butting it had received. I packed on my horse as much meat as he could carry, and set out fur the camp, which I reached a little after dark. My futher was going in search of me, believing me either lost, or killed. He had fired several guns, to let me know the direction of the camp. We travelled steadily on the 21st, and encamped at night on a small branch of the Arkansas. During the day, we had seen large droves of buffuloes running in the same direction, in which we travelled, as though they were pursued. We could, however, see nothing in pursuit. They appeared in the same confusion all night. On the 22d, we :rmrched fust all day, the bu:ffitloes still nmning befOre us. In the evening we reached the main Arkansas, and encamped. The sky indicating rain, we exerted ourselves, and succeeded in pitching our tents and kindling fires, befOre the rain began to full. Om meat was beginning to roast, when we saw some Indians about half a mile distant, looking at us :from a bill. We immediately tied our [35] mules and horses. A few minutes after, ten Inilians user.mllssion.ccm'-ct~mtmanlhlml/patlielpallia.hlrnl 161122 5119113 Pa!lie's Personal Narraliw, 1824--1830 approached us with their guns on their shoulders. This open, undisguised approach made us less suspicious of them, than we should otherwise have been. When they were within a proper distance, they stopped, and called out Amigo, Amigo. One of our number understood them, and answered Amigo, which is friend, when they came up to us. They were Comma.nches, and one of them was a chief Our interpreter understood and spoke their Janguage quite well The chief seemed bold, and asked who was our captain? My mther was pointed out to him. He then asked us to go and encamp with him, saying that his people and the whites were good friends. My :father answered, that we had encamped befure we knew where they were, and that if we moved now, we reared that the goods would be wet. The chief said, this was very good; but that, as we now knew where his camp was, we must move to it To this my :father returned, that if it did not rain next morning, we would; but as befure, that we did not wish to get the goods wet to night. The chief then said, in a surly manner, 'you don't intend then to move to my camp to night?' My :father answered, 'No!' The chief said he should, or he would come upon us with his men, kill us, and take every thing we had. Upon this my :father pushed the chief out of the tent, telling him to send his men as soon as he pleased; that we would kill them, as :fast as they came. In reply the chief pointed his finger to the spot, where the sun would be at eight o'clock the next morning, and said, 'If you do not corre to my camp, when the sun is there, I will set all my warriors upon you.' He then ran off through the rain to his own camp. We began, il:nrrediately, a kind of breastwork, made by chopping offlogs, and putting them together. Confidently expecting an attack in the night, we tied our horses and mules in a sink hole between us and the river. It was now dark. I do not think an eye was closed in our camp that night; but the morning fuund us umnolested; nor did we see any Indians, befure the sun. was at the point spoken of When it had reached it, an army of between six and eight hundred mounted [36] Indians, with their :fitces painted as black as though they had come from the infumal regions, armed with fuzees and spears and shields appeared befure us. Every thing had been done by the Indians to render thl; show as intimidating as possible. We discharged a couple of guns at them to show that we were not afraid, and were ready to receive them A part advanced towards us; but one alone, approaching at :fuD. speed, threw down his bow and arrows, and sprang in among us, saying in broken English 'Commanches no good, me Iotan, good man.' He gave us to understand, that the Iotan nation was close at hand, and would not let the Commanches hurt us, and then started back. The Cmmnanches fired sorre shots at us, but from such a distance, that we did not return them In less than half an hour, we heard a noise like distant thunder. It becaJ.l'le more and more distinct, until a band of armed Indians, whom we cm\"Yectured to be lotans, became visible in the distance. When they had drawn near, they reined up their horses fur a morrent, and then rushed in between us and Connnanches, who charged upon the Iotans. The latter sustained the charge with firmness. The discharge of their fire arms and the clashing of their difl.erent weapons, together with their war-yell, and the shrieks of the wounded and dying were fit accompanirrents to the savage actors and scene. I do not pretend to describe this deadly combat between two Indian nations; but, as fur as I could judge, the contest lasted fifteen minutes. I was too deeply interested in watching the event, to note it particularly. We wished to assist the Iotans, but could not distinguish them from the mass, so closely were the parties engaged. We withheld our fire through rear of irguring the Iotans, whom we considered our friends. It was not long befure we saw, to our great satismction, the Corrnnanches dismounted, which was the signal of their entire dereat. The Iotans then left the Commanches, and returned to their women and children, whom they had left some distance behind. They brought them to our camp, and pitched their own tents all around us, except that of the chie~ which was placed in the centre with ours. A guard of warriors was then posted aromd [3 7] the encamprrent, and an order given fur the wounded Iotans to be brought into the tent of the chief There were ten, two of whom died befure night. A message was now sent to the chief of the Commanches, in obedience to which he came to the Iotan chief A council then seemed to be held, and a peace was made, the terms of which were, that the Iotan chief should pay the Commanche chief two horses fur every, warrior, he had lost in the batt1e, over the number oflotans killed. We gave the Iotan chief goods to the amomrt of one hundred doDars, which pleased him exceedingly. He expressed himself perfectly satisfied with this recompense fur the warriors he had lost in our defunce. The 17/122 5/1QI13 Pattie's Personal Narraliw, 1824--1830 knowledge, that a party as large as ours was traversing the country, bad soon spread in all directions from the reports oflndians, who had met with us, and we became to these savage tribes a rmtter of interest, as a source oi gain to be drawn :from us by robbing, kindness or trade.-Our movements were observed. The Co11'1'1.1llit1Ches determined to possess themselves of their object by furce; and the Iot:ans :interfured :in our de:funce, that they might thus gain their point by extortion :from friends. Not a single Commnche was allowed to enter our camp, as arrangements were making fur the Iot:ans to trade with us. AD, who bad any beaver skins, or dressed deer skins, were sent fur. A guard was p:laced around in a circle, inside of which the skins were thrown down. Each Indian then inquired fur the article he wanted. In this way we exchanged with them butcher knives, paint, and powder and ball, fur beaver and deer skins, to the amount of :fifteen hundred dollars, aDowing them what we considered the value of the skins. The old Commnche chief came to the Iotan chief to ask permission to talk with us, but was furbidden; and we were told not to have any dealings with him We did not The Iotan chief then gave us the character of the Commanche chief He seemed to be thinking some time befure he began. 'I know,' said he, 'you must think it strange that I should :fight with the Commanches, and then pay them fur their warriors killed, over [38] our own number lost, and make peace with them I will give you my reasons fur doing so. Four years ago, this Commanche chief with his fullowers, went in company with my father, who was a chief; and a :fuw of his fu11owers, in search of buffaloes. After they bad killed what they wanted, they divided the meat The Commnche took all the best of it, leaving the remains fur my father. The old man put up with it, and said nothing. On their return, close to this place they met a band of N abahoes, a nation that had long been at war with ours, and killed a great number of our people. My father wanted to kill them, and began to fire upon them The Commanches joined the Nabahoes, and together they killed my mtber and most ofhis men. He then paid fur the lives he had taken, in horses, giving twenty fur my futher, and fuur fur each warrior. I only give two horses fur a warrior. I am now happy. I have killed three times as rmny of them, as they did of us, and paid less for it. I know they can never get the upper hand ofrre again. This Commnche chief is a mean man, fur whenever he has power, he makes others do as he pleases, or he kills them, and takes all they have. He wanted to act in this way with you; but I do not think he could, fur you know bow to shoot better than he does; and you would not give up, as long as you had powder and ball and one man a1ive.' My :tather as com:nander, said, 'hi; :n::en were all good soldiers, and knew bow to get the advantage in fighting; and that we had plenty of ammunition and good guns, and were not in the least afraid ofbeing beaten by them' 'I think so,' replied the chief; 'But I thank the Great Spirit, that it happened as it did. I have taken revenge fur the death of my :futher, and his people, and gained, I hope, at the same time the love of a good and brave people by de:funding them' We assured him that he had, expressing our thanks fur his aid, and regret fur those who had been killed in our defunce. 'Yes,' said the chief; 'they were brave :n::en; but they loved my futher, whom they have now gone to see, where they will have plenty to eat, and drink, without having to fight fur it.' These were 1m thoughts, as near as I can express them The Commanche chief made a second application fur permission to talk with us, which was now granted. His object in conversing [39] with us, was, as he said, to make friends with us, and induce us to give him soJ::De powder and ball. We told him that we would willingly make peace with him; but not give him any thing, as we did not break the peace. He had 1hreatened to kill us, and take our property without any provocation from us, and certain]y, if any present was necessary, it must corm from him We did not, however, wish any present :from him, and woukl make peace with him, provided he promised never to kill, or try to ldll a white man. He answered, that he bad neither done it, or intended to do it; that with regard to us, he only sought to ftigbten us, so that we should corre to his camp, befure the Iotans ca:n::e up, whom he knew to be not fur distant, in order that he might precede them in tradlng with us, adding that as he had been so disappointed, he thought we ought to give him a :little powder and user .missi on.coml-ctl!d)itTJimanlhtml/pattielpattie.html 18/122 5119113 Patlie's Personal Narralh.e, 1824--1830 ban. Om answer was, that we bad no more ammunition to spare; and that we could not depart from om resolution of not purchasing a treaty from him; but we would give him a Jetter of recommendation to the next company that came in this direction, by means of which he might trade with them, and obtain what he wanted of these articles. He consented to a treaty on these conditions, and lighting his pipes we smoked friends. He then asked us ffwe came through the Pawnee village? We answered in the affirmative. His next question was, had they plenty of amrrnmition? Our reply was again, yes. We were then given to understand, that he was then at war with them, and bad been fur a nurriber of years, and that he shouki soon either make peace with them, or have a general engag-errent. He would prefur peace, as they were at war with the Spaniards, as wen as himself By uniting furces, they could beat the Spaniards, though in case of a 1reaty or not, he intended to go against the Spaniards, as soon as he should retm:n from the coUIJtly of the Pawnees. He added, 'I suppose you are friends with the Spaniards, and are now going to trade with them.' Our corrnmnder replied, that we were going to trade with them, but not to fight fur them. That, said the chie~ is [40] what I wanted to know. I do not want war with yom people, and should we accidentally kill any of them, you IWSt not declare war against us, as we will pay you fur them in horses or beaver skins. We did not express om natmal fueling, that the lire of one man was worth more than all the horses or beaver skins, his nation could bring furtb; but tokl him, that we would not ~ure his people, unless they did ours, on purpose. He returned, apparently satisfied, to his camp. We were detained here until the fuurth o1 November by our promise of awaiting the arrival of the two men, we bad left with our wounded companion. They came, and brought with them his gtm and ammunition. He died the fifth day, after we had left him, and was buried as decently, as the circlltll)tances would a11ow. On the 5th of November we again set off in company with a party of Iotans. The Arkansas is here wide and shallow, like the Platte; and has wide but thin1y timbered botto11l'S on both sides. Extending from the bottom ten or twelve miles on the south side, are low hills composed principally of sand. We :futmd 1rave11ing upon them very futiguing, particuJarly as we met with no water. Late in the evening we reached water, and encamped. The next morning we resumed om journey. We were exceedingly diverted, during the day, to see the Iotan Indians in company with us, chase the bu:ffuloes on horseback. They killed them with their arrows. The :furce, with which they shoot these arrows, is astonishing. I saw one of them shoot an arrow through a buflhloe bu11, that had been driven close to our camp. We were again upon level plains, stretching off in an directions beyond the reach of the eye. The few high motmds scattered over them could not but powerful1y arrest the curiosity. From the surrn:nit of one I again looked down upon innulmrable droves of wild animals, dotting the surface, as they seemed to furget their savage natures, and fud, or reposed in peace. I indu]ged the thoughts natural to such a position and scene. The remembrance of horne, with its duties and pleasmes, came upon my mind in strong contrast with my actual circumstances. [ 41] I was interrupted by the discharge of gtm.S, and the screa11l'S and yeiJs of Indians. The Iotans had :fuund six N abahoes a half a mile from us, and were killing them Three were killed. The others, being well mounted, made their escape. TI1e IotarJS carrJe to our camp with their scalps, leaving their bodies to be eaten by wild animals. My futher sent men to bury them. The Iotans danced around these scalps an night, and in the m:mring took up the bodies, we had buried, and cut them in pieces. They then covered themselves with the skins of bears and panthers, and, taking the hearts of the dead men, cut them into pieces of the s~ of a rnouthfu], and laid them upon the ground, and kneeling put their hands on the ground, and crawled arotmd the pieces ofhearts, growling as though they were enraged bears, or panthers, ready to spring upon them, and eat them This is their mode of showing hatred to their enemies. Not relishing such detestable conduct, we so manifested our fuelings, that these Indians went to their own CaJll)S. We encamped the evening ofthe next day near water. Nothing worthy of record occurred during the journey of the fuur succeeding days, except that we came to a small creek called Simaronee. Here we encamped, and killed horses. We travelled up t:m; stream some distance, and left it on the 15th. On ilie 16111 we encamped on a creek, where we round fuur gentle mules, which we caught. I could not account fur th.eir being there. Noihing of importance occurred in the two :last days. From the 17th to the 20th, we journeyed without interruption. The latter day we came in view of a mountain covered with snow, called Taos mountain. 11ris object awakened in our minds singular but pleasant feelings. On the 23d we reached its foot. Here Mr. Pratte concealed a part oflm goods by burying them in the ground. We were three days crossing this mountain. On ilie evening of the 26th, we arrived at a small town in Taos, called St. Ferdinanda, situated just at the fuot ofthe mountain on ilie west side. The alcalde asked us fur the invoice [ 4 2] of our goods, which we showed him, and paid ilie customrry duties on them This was a man of a swarthy complexion having the appearance of pride and haughtiness. The door-way ofilie room, we were in, was crowded with men, women and children, who stared at us, as 1hougb 1hey had never seen white men befure, there being in met, n:mch to my surprize and disappointment, not one white person among them I had expected to find no difrerence between these people and our own, but their language. I was never so mistaken. The men and women were not clothed in our fushion, the fut.mer having short pantaloons fastened below ilie waist with a red belt and buck skin leggins put on 1hree or four times double. A Spanish knife is stuck in by the side of the leg, and a small sword worn by the side. A long jacket or blanket is thrown over, and worn upon the shoulders. They have few fire an:ns, genemlly using upon occasions which require them, a bow and spear, and never wear a hat, except when they ride. When on horse back, iliey fuce towards the right side of the animal The saddle, which they use, looks as ours would, with something like an ann chair :fastened upon it. The women wear upon the upper part of the person a ~nt resembling a shirt, and a short petticoat fustened around the waist with a red or blue be]t, and something of the scarfkind wound around their shoulders. Although appearing as poorly, as I have described, they are not destitute ofhospitality; fur they brought us rood, and invited us into their houses to eat, as we walked t:In-ough the streets. The first time my futher and myse1f walked through the town together, we were accosted by a woman standing in her own door-way. She made signs fur us to come in. When we had entered, she conducted us up a flight of steps into a room neatly whitewashed, and adorned with images of saints, and a crucifix of brass nailed to a wooden cross. Sbe gave us wine, and set befure us a dish composed of red pepper, ground and mixed with com mea], stewed in fut and water. We could not eat it. She then brought furward some tortillas and milk. Tortillas [43] are a thin cake made of com and wheat ground between two fiat stones by the women. This cake is called in Spanish, met ate. We remained with her until late in the evening, when the bells began to ring. She and her children knelt down to pray. We left her, and returned. On our way we met a bier with a man upon it, who bad been stabbed to death, as he was drinking whiskey. This town stands on a beauti:ful plain, surrounded on one side by the Rio del Norte, and on the other by the mountain, of which I have spoken, the summit being covered with perpetual snow. We set o:fffur Santa Fe on ilie 1st of November. Our course fur the first day led us over broken ground. We passed the night in a small town, called Callacia, built on a small stream, that empties into the del Norte. The country around 1his place presents but a small portion oflevel surface. 201122 5/1&'13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 The next day our path lay over a point of the mountain. We were the whole day crossing. We killed a grey bear, that was exceedingly fut It bad fattened on a nut of the shape and size of a bean, which grows on a tree resen:bling the pine, called by the Spanish, pinion. We took a great part of the meat with us. We passed the night again in a town called Albukerque. The fOllowing day we passed St Thomas, a town situated on the bank of the del Norte, which is here a deep and rrruddy stream, with bottoms from five to six miles wide on both sides. These bottoms sustain 1lUJ:reTOUS herds of cattle. The small huts of the shepherds, who attend to them, were visible here and there. We reached another town called E]gidonis, and stopped fur the night We kept guard around our horses all night, but in the morning fuur of our mules were gone. We hunted fur them until ten o'clock, when two Spaniards came, and asked us, what we would give them, if they would find our mules? We told them to bring the mules, and we would pay them a doJlar. They set oft; two of our men fOllowing them without their knowledge and went into a thicket, where they bad tied the :mules, and returned with them to us. As may be supposed, we gave them both a good whipping. It seemed at first, that the whole [ 44] town would rise against us in consequence. But when we related the circumstances fuirly to the people, the officer corresponding to our justice of the peace, said, we bad done perfectly right, and had the men put in the stocks. We reco:rnrnenced our journey, and passed a mission of Indians under the control of an old. priest After crossing a point of the mountain, we reached Santa Fe, on the 5tlJ.. This town contains between fuur and five thousand inhabitants. It is situated on a large plain. A handsome stream runs through it, adding life and beauty to a scene striking and agreeable from the union of am:mity and cultivation around, with the distant view of the snow clad mountains. It is pleasant to walk on the flat room of the houses in the evening, and look on the town and plain spread below. The houses are low, with flat roofS as I have mentioned. The churches are diffurent1y constructed from the other buildings and make a beautiful show. They have a great nurmer of large beDs, which, when disturbed, make a noise, that would almost seem sufficient to awaken the dead. We asked the governor fur permission to trap beaver in the river Helay. His reply was that, he did not know if he was allowed by the law to do so; but if upon examination it lay in his power, he would infurm us on the morrow, if we would come to his office at 9 o'clock in the morning. According to this request, we went to the place appointed, the succeeding day, which was the 9th of November. We were to:Jd by the governor, that he had fuund nothing, that would justifY him, in giving us the legal pennission, we desired. We then proposed to him to give us liberty to trap, upon the condition, that we paid him five per cent on the beaver we might catch. He said, he would consider this proposition, and give us an answer the next day at the same hour. The thoughts of our hearts were not at a11 :favorable to this person, as we left him About ten o'clock at night an express came from the river Pacus, on which the nobles have their country seats and large :fu.rming establis:hrrents, stating, that a :large body of Indians bad come upon several :fumilies, whom they bad either robbed, or [45] murdered. Aroong th.e number two Americans had been killed, and the wife of one taken prisoner, in company with four Spanish women, one of whom was daughter of the ful'l\"ref governor, displaced because he was an European. The dnnn and :fifu and French horn began to smmd in a manner, that soon awakened, and a.Jar.tred the whole town. The frightened women, and the still more fear-stricken men, joining in a full chorus of screams and cries, ran some to where the drum was beating in the public square, and others to our quarters. Upon the first sound of alarm we bad prepared to repel the enemy, whatever it might be, provided it troubled us. When this group came rushing towards us, the light of the moon enabled us to discern them with sufficient clearness to prevent our doing them any iqjury. We did not sleep any more that night, fur the women, having got the wrong story, as most women do in a case of the kind, told us that the Commanches were in town, user .Jmission.com'-ctl.K\u00a5mlmanlhlml/patlielpaltie.hlni 21/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824--1830 killing the people. We awaited an attack, without, however, hearing any sound of :fire a.rn:E. Our conclusion was, that they were sku1king around, dealing out death in darkness and silence with their arrows; and in the feelings, which were its natural result, the remainder of the night passed. The first light of morning showed us a body offuur hundred men ready to mount their horses. At sunrise the governor came to us to ask, if we would aid in the attempt to recapture the prisoners taken by the Commanches, re1ating to us the real cause of the alarm of the preceding night. We complied readily with ms request, as we were desirous of gaining the good will of the people. Our arra.ngerrents were soon made, and we set off in company with the troops I have mentioned. The 12th was spent in travelling. We stopped fur the night ar&t John's, a small town. On the 13th we reached the spot, where the murders and robbery were comnitted. Here we took the course the Indians bad marked in their retreat, stopping only fur refreshments. We pressed on an night, as we :li:nmd their fires still. smoking. At eight on the morning of the 15th, the trail being fresh, we :increased our speed, and at twelve came in sight of them, as they advanced toward a low gap in [ 46] the mountains. We now halted, and counselled together with regard to the next movements. The commander of the Spaniards proposed, that my father should direct the whole proceedings, promising obedience on ms own part and that ofhis troops. The gap in the mountains, of which I spoke, was made by a stream The Indians were now entering it. My father funned a p1an irnrrediately, and submitted it to the Spanish commander, who promised to aid in carrying it into eflect. In confunnity to it, the Spaniards were directed to keep in rear of the Indians, without being seen by them. We took a circuitous route, screened from sight by the higbJand, that Jay between us and the Indians, in order to gain mobserved a hollow in advance of them, in which we might remain concealed, until they approached within gunshot of us. Our main object was to surprize them, and not allow them time to kill their captives, should they be still alive. The party in the rear were to close in, upon hearing the report of our guns, and not allow them to return to the p1ain. Our plan seetred to assure us success. We succeeded in reaching the hollow, in which we placed ourselves in the form of a half circle, extending :from one side of it to the other, our horses being tied behind us. Every man was then ordered to prime, and pick his gun afresh. The right :flank was to fire first, the left reserving theirs to give a running fire, that shou1d emble the right to re-load. The Indians, surrounding the prisoners, were to be taken as the first aim, to prevent the :immediate nrurder of them by their captors. My post was in the centre of the line. We waited an hour and a half behind our screens of rocks and trees, befOre our enemies made their appearance. The first object, that came in sight, were women without any cbtbing, driving a :large drove of sheep and horses. These were immediately fOllowed by Indians. When the latter were within 1hirty or furty yards of us, the order to fire was given The wotren ran towards us the n::x:nnent they heard the report of our guns. In doing this they encountered the Indians behind them, and three full pierced by the spears of these savages. The cry among us now was, 'save the women!' Another young man and [ 4 7] myself sprang fOrward, to rescue the remaining two. My companion full in the attempt. An Indian bad raised his spear, to :in:llict death upon another of these unfOrtunate captives, when he received a shot :from one of our men, tJ:-..at rendered him incapable of another act of cruelty. The captives, one of whom was a beautiful young Jady, the daughter of the governor befOre spoken o4 both reached me. The gratitude of such captives, so delivered, may be imagined. Fears, thanks and exclamations in Spanish were the natural expression of feeling in such a position My companions aided me in wrapping b.lank:ets around them, fur it was quite cold; and making the best arrangements in our power fur their comfurt and safety. This was all done in less time, than is required to reJate it, and we returned to our post. The Indians stood the second fire, and then retreated. We pursued keeping up a quick fire, expecting every moment to hear the Spaniards in the rear fullowing our exaiilJle to check them in their retreat; but we could discover the entrance upon the plain, befure we heard any thing from our Spamsh muskets. The Indians then began to yell; but the Spaniards, after one discharge from their fire arms, fled. Being mounted on good horses the Indians 22/122 511Q/13 Pattie's PersClfl!l! Narrative, 1824--1830 did not pursue them, but satisfied as to our numbers, now that we were upon the plain, they rallied, and rushed upon us. Our commander now ordered us to retreat into the woods, and to find shelter behind trees, and take aim 'that every shot might tell, as it was of the utm:lst inportance, not to waste anmmition, saying, 'stand resolute, my boys, and we l.lJake them repent, if they fullow us, although those ** Spaniards have deserted us, when we came to fight fur them We are enough fur these \"'\"' devils alone.' As they came near us, we gave them a scattering thougb destructive fire, which they retwned bravely, still pressing towards us. It was a serious contest fur about ten minutes, after they approached within pistol shot of us. From their yeDs, one would have thought that the infurnal regions were open befOre them, and that they were about to be phmged in headlong. They fually began to retreat again, and we soon [ 48] put them completely to :flight. The Spaniards, though keeping a sare distance, while this was going furward, saw the state of affuirs, and joined us in the pursuit, still taking especial care not to come near enough to the Indians, to hurt them, or receive any iqjury t:b.ermlelves. After the Indians rallied, we lost ten men, and my futher received a slight wmmd in the shoulder. We rerroved our horses and the rescued captives into the plain, and encamped. The Spaniards had killed an Indian already wounded, and were riding over the dead bodies of those on the ground, spearing them and killing any, who still breathed. My futher commanded them to desist, or he would fire upon them, and the Spanish officer added his order to the same e:f:Iect The Jatter then demanded of us, the two wo~n, whom we had rescued, with as much assurance, as though bi!:nselfbad been the cause of their deliverance. My :father replied, by asking what authority or right he had, to make such a request, when his cowardice withheld him from aiding in their release? The officer became enraged, and said, that he was unable to raJly his men, and that he did not consider the captives any safur in our hands than in those of the Indians, as we were not christians. This insult, coupled with such a lame apology, only made my futher Jaugb, and reply, that if cowardice constituted a claim to christianity, himself and his men were prirre and undoubted christians. He added further, that if the rescued women prefurred to accompany him, rather than remain, mtil he should have buried his brave comrades, who full in their defunce, and accept his protection, he bad nothing to say. The subjects of our discussion, being present while it took place, decided the point befure they were appealed to. The youngest sa:id, that nothing would induce her to leave her deliverers, and that when they were ready to go, she would accompany them, adding, that she should pray homly fur the salvation of those, who bad resigned their lives in the preservation of hers. The other expressed herself willing to remain with her, and ma:nif.ested the same confidence and gratitude. The enraged officer and lris men set off on their return to Santa Fe. [49] The sm was yet an hour from its setting. We availed ourselves ofthe remaining light to make a breastwork with the timber, that bad drifted down the stream, that we might be prepared fur the Indians, in case they should return. We finished it, and posted our sentinels by sunset. lbe governor's daughter now inquired fur the indiv:idua~ who first met her in her :ffight from the I.ndians, and so humanely and bravely conducted her out of danger, and provided fur her corrrlbrt. I cannot describe the gratitude and loveliness, that appeared in her countenance, as she looked on tm, when I was pointed ou.i to her. Not attaching any :merit to the act, I had perfu11'red, and considering it merely as a duty, I did not know bow to rreet her acknowledgments, and was embarrassed. On the morning ofthe 16th we buried our dead. My futber's shoulder was a little s~ and somewhat swollen. We saddled our horses, and began our return journey. I gave up my horse to one of the ladies, and made my way on fuot. We drove the sheep, which escaped the balls, befure us. Our last look at the ground of our late contest gave a view sufficiently painful to any one, who bad a heart; horses and their riders lay s:ide by side. The bodies of robbers smromded by the objects of their phmder would probably remain, scattered as they were, unburied and exposed to the wiki beasts. We halted in the evening fur the refreshment of ourselves and horses. This done, we again set off travelling all night. 23/122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narrati~, 1824--1830 The sheep giving out, we were obliged to leave them At twelve next day we reached Pacus. Here we met 1he futher of1he youngest oftbe two ladies accompanied by a great mnnber of Spaniards. The old man was transported ahnost to frenzy, when he saw his daughter. We remained here fur the day. On the morning of the 18th we all set off together, the old governor :insisting, fuat my fu1her and myself n:rust ride in the carriage with him; but we excused ourselves, and rode by the side of it with 1he interpreter. The fu1her caressed us exceeding]y, and said a great many things about :rre in particular, which I did not think, I deserved. [50] The next day at two in 1he afternoon, we arrived at Santa Fe. We were received with a salute, which we returned with our small arms. The governor carne in the evening, and invited my futber and the inteipreter to sup with him He ordered so:rre fut beeves to be killed fur 1he rest of us. The fu1her ofJacova, fur that was the name of 1m young lady, I bad rescued, came, and invited us all to go, and drink co:lfue at his son-in-law's, who kept a cofree-bouse. We went, and when we had finished our cofree, 1he father ca:rre, and took me by 1he hand, and led :rre up a :ffigbt of steps, and into a room, where were his two daughters. As soon as I entered 1he room, Jacova and her sister both came, and embraced me, this being the universal fushlon of interchanging saJutations between :rren and women am:mg 1hese people, even when there is nothing more, than a simple introduction between strangers. After I had been seated an hour, looking at them, as they made signs, and listening to their conversation, of which I did not mderstand a syllable, I arose with the intention of returning to my companions fur the night. But Jacova, showing me a bed, prepared fur me, placed herselfbetween me and the door. I showed her that my clothes were not clean. She immediately brought me others be1onging to her brother-in-law. I wished to be excused from making use of them, but she seeJ:red so much hurt, 1hat I final1y took them, and reseated myself She 1hen brought me my leather hunting shirt, which I had taken off to aid in protecting her :from the cold, and begged the interpreter who was now present, to tell me, that she intended to keep it, as 1ong as she lived. She 1hen put it on, to prove to me fuat she was not ashamed of it. I went to bed early, and arose, and returned to my companions, befure any of1he fumily were visible. At eight the governor and my father came to our quarters, and invited us all to dine with him at two in 1he afternoon. According]y we all dressed in our best, and went at 1he appointed time. A band of musicians played during dinner. After it was finished, and the table removed, a fimdango was begun The ladies flocked in, in great mnnbers. The instruments, to which the dancers' moved, were [51] a guitar and vio:Jin. Six men and six women also added their voices. Their mode of dancing was a curiosity to me. The women stood erect, moving their reet slowly, without any spring or motion of the body, and the men half bent, moved their fuet like drum sticks. This dance is called ahavave. I admired another so much, 1hat I attempted to go through it. It was a waltz, danced to a slow and charming air. It produces a fine effect, when twenty or thirty perfunn it toge1her. The dancing continued, untl1 near morning, when we retired to rest. At eight the fullowing morning we received a li~ense, allowing 11s to trap in ~rent parts of the country. We were now divided into small parties. Mr. Pratte added three to our original number, they making the company, to which my futher and myselfbe1onged, seven. On the 22d, we set off Our course lay down the del Norte to 1he HeJay, a river never before exp1ored by white people. We left our goods with a merchant, until we should return in the spring. Our whole day's journey Jay over a handsome plain covered with herds oftbe dif:furent domestic animals. We reached Picacheh a small town in 1he evening. Jacova and her fu1her overtook us here, on their way home, which was eighty miles distant from Santa Fe. In the morning we began our journey, together. During the day we passed several small villages and stopped fur the night in one called St Philip, situated on 1he banks of the del Norte, surrounded by large vineyards. Jacova's father insisted upon our drinking plentifully of the wine made at this place. 24/122 5119'13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 The morning of the 24th saw us again on our journey. Om companion, the old governor, was much amused at seeing us kill wild geese and prairie wolves with om rifles, the Jatter being abundant in this country. In the evening we reached another small town, cailed St. Louis. All these inconsiderable villages contain a church. The succeeding day we traversed the sam: beautiful plain country, which had made our journey so :far, delightful The same nm.ltitude of domestic an:imaJs still grazed around our path. [52] On the 27th, we arrived at the residence ofJacova and her :fu.ther. It was a large and even magnificent building. We remained here mrtil the 30th, receiving the utmost attention and kindness. At om departure, the kind old governor pressed a great many presents upon us; but we refused all, except a horse fur each one oftlS, some :flour and dried meat. Seven hunters coming up with l.lS, who were going in our direction, we concluded to travel with them, as our united strength would better enable us to contend with the hostile Indians, through whose country our course Jay. We made our way slowly, descending the river bank, until we reached the Jast town or settlement in this part of the province, called Socoro. The popuJation of the part of the country, through which we trave1led was entirely confined to a cbainofsettlements along the bottoms ofthe del Norte, and those of some ofthe rivers, whichelJllty into it. I did not see, during the whole ofthls journey, an enclosed :field, and not even a garden. After remaining one day here, in order to recruit our horses, we reslliD9d our course down the river, Dec. 3d. The bottoms, through which we now passed, were thinly timbered, and the only growth was cotton-wood and willow. We saw great numbers of bears, deer and twkeys. A bear having chased one of our men into the carrq:>, we killed it. On the 7th we left the del Norte, and took a direct course fur the Copper mines. We next trave1led from the river over a very mountainous country fuur days, at the expiration of which tirre we reached this point of our destination. We were here but one night, and I had not leisure to examine the tmde, in which the copper was manufuctwed. In the rooming we hired two Spani<;h servants to accompany us; and taldng a north-west course pursued om journey, until we reached the Helay on the 14th. We round the col.m.try the greater part of the two last days billy and so11.1ewhat barren with a growth of pine, live oak, pinion, cedar and some small trees, of which I did not know the name. We caught thirty beavers, the first night we encamped on this river. The next :rooming, accompanied by another :rna.n, [53] I began to ascend the bank of the stream to expbre, and ascertain ifbeaver were to be fuund still higher, leaving the remainder of the party to trap slowly up, until they shouki meet \\lS on our return. We threw a pack over our shoulders, containing a part of the beavers, we bad killed, as we made our way on fuot. The first day we were futigued by the d:ifficuhy of getting through the high grass, which covered the heavily timbered bottom In the evening we arrived at the fuot of :roountains, that shut in the river on both sides, and encamped. We saw during the day several bears, but did not disturb them, as they showed no ill fueling towards us. On the morning of the 13th we started early, and crossed the river, here a beautiful clear stream about thirty yards in width, running over a rocky bottom, and filled with fish. We made but little advance this day, as bJufiS c~ in so close to the river, as to compel us to cross it thirty-six times. We were obliged to scramble along under the cl.iffS, so11.1etilres upon our hands and knees, through a thick tangle of grape-vines and under-brush. Added to the unpleasanmess of this mode of getting along in itself; we did not know, but the next moment would bring us :fu.ce to :fu.ce with a bear, which might accost us suddenly. We were rejoiced, when this rough ground gave pJace again to the level bottom At night we reached a point, where the river furked, and encamped on the point between the furks. We round here a boiling spring so near the main stream, that the fish caught in the one might be thrown into the other without leaving the spot, where it was taken. In six minutes it would be thoroughly cooked. 25'122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narraliw, 1824--1830 The fullowing morning my companion and myself separated, agreeing to meet after fuur days at this spring. We were each to ascend a furk of the river. The banks of that which fell to my ht, were very brushy, and frequented by numbers of bears, ofwhom I relt rearfu], as I had never befure travelled ahne in the woods. I walked on with caution until night, and encamped near a pile of drift wood, which I set on fire, thinking thus to :frighten any anima1s that might approach during the night. [54] I p1aced a spit, with a turkey I had killed upon it, befure the fire to roast. After I had eaten my supper I 1aid down by the side of a hg with my gun by my side. I did not full asleep fur some time. I was aroused from shmiber by a noise in the leaves, and raising my head saw a panther stretched on the hg by which I was lying, within six :teet of me. I raised my gun gently to my fuce, and shot it in the head. Then springing to my feet, I ran about ten steps, and stopped to rehad my gun, not knowing if I had killed the panther or not. Befure I bad finished hading my gun, I heard the discharge of one on the other furk, as I concluded, the two nmning parallel with each other, separated only by a narrow ridge. A second discharge quickly fullowed the first, which Jed me to suppose, that my comrade was attacked by Indians. I immediately set out and reached the hot spring by day break, where I round my associate also. The report of my gun bad awakened him, when he saw a bear standing upon its hind reet within a rew yards ofbim growling. He fired his gun, then his pisto~ and retreated, thinking, with regard to :me, as I had with regard to him, that I was attacked by Indians. Our conclusion now was, to ascend one of the furks :in company, and then cross over, and descend the other. In consequence we resumed the course, I bad taken the preceding day. We made two day's joUI'Iley, without beaver enough to recompense us fur our trouble, and then crossed to the east furk, trapping as we went, until we again reached the main stream. Some distance behw this, we met those of our party we bad ]eft behind, with the exception of the seven, who joined us on the del Norte. They had deserted the expedition, and set off upon their retmn down the river. We now all hastened on to overtake them, but it was to no purpose. They still kept in advance, trapping clean as they went, so that we even round it difficult to catch enough to eat Finding it impossible to co:rne up with them, we ceased to urge om poor horses, as they were much jaded, and tender rooted beside, and travelled slowly, catching what beaver we [55] could, and killing some deer, although the latter were scarce, owing, probably to the season of the year. The river here was beautiful, running between banks covered with tall cotton-woods and willows. This bottom extended back a mile on each side. Beyond rose high and rather barren hills. On the 20th we came to a point, where the river entered a cavern between two mmmtams. We were compeiled to return upon om steps, tmti1 we found a hw gap :in the mountains. We were three day's crossing, and the travelling was both fatiguing and difficult. We round nothing to kill. On the 23d we came upon the river, where it emptied into a beautiful plain. We set our traps, but to no purpose, for the beavers were all caught, or alarmed. The river here pmsues a west comse. We travelled sbwly, using every effurt to kill something to eat, but wilhout success. On the morning of the 26th we concJuded, that we must kill a horse, as we had eaten nothing fur fuur day's and a hal4 except the small portion of a bare caught by my dogs, which full to the lot of each of a party of seven. Berore we obtained this, we had become weak in body and mind, comp1aining, and desponding of om success in search of beaver. Desirous of returning to some settlement, my futher encomaged om party to eat some ofthe horses, and pursue om journey. We were all reluctant to begin to partake of the horse-flesh; and the actual thing without bread or salt was as bad as the anticipation of it. We were so:rnewhat strengthened, however, and hastened on, while our supply lasted, in the hope of either overtaking those in advance of us, or finding another stream yet undiscovered by trappers. user .>mission.comt-lt'udy'mtmanlhlml/pattielpallia.htJ'n 26/122 5/19113 Paf:lie's Personal Narratiw, 1824---1830 The latter desire was gratified the first of January, 1825. The stream, we dmcovered, carried as much water as the H~lay, heading north. We called it the river St Francisco. After travelling up :its banks about fuur miles, we encamped, and set all our traps, and killed a couple of fat turkies. In the morning we examined our traps, and round in them 37 beavers! T.his success restored our spirits instantaneously. Exhilarating [56] prospects now opened befure us, and we pushed on with animation. The banks of tbjg river are fur the most part incapable of cultivation being in 1m11y places funned of high and rugged mountains. Upon these we saw multitudes of mountain sheep. These animals are not fuund on :level ground, being there slow of root, but on these c1iffS and rocks they are so nimble and expert in jumping from point to point, that no dog or wolf can overtake them One of them that we killed had the largest horns, that I ever saw on animals of any description One of them woukl hold a gallon of water. Their rreat tastes like om mutton. Their hair is short like a deer's, though fine. The French can them the gros comes , from the size of their horns which curl around their ears, like our domestic sheep. These animals are about the size of a large deer. We traced this river to its head, but not without great difficulty, as the clifiS :in many places carre so near the water's edge, that we were compelled to cross po:in:ts of the mountain, which fatigued both omselves and our horses exceedingly. The right hand fbrk of tbjg river, and the left of the\u00b7 Helay head in the same mountain, which is covered with snow, and divides its waters from those of Red river. We :finished our trapping on this river, on the 14~ We had caught the very considerable number of250 beavers, and bad used and preserved most ofthe meat, we had killed. On the 19th we arrived on the river He lay, encamped, and buried our furs in a secure position, as we intended to return home by this route. On the 20th we began to descend the Relay, hoping to :find in our descent another beaver stream emptying into it. We had abandoned the hope of rejoining the hunters, that had left us, and been the occasion of our being compelled to reed upon horse flesh. No better was to be expected of us, than that we should take leave to :imprecate many a curse upon their heads; and that they might experience no better :tate, than to fi:ill :into the hands oi the savages, or be tom in pieces by the white bears. At the same time, so ready are the hearts of mountain hunters to relent, that I have not a doubt that each man of us would [57] have risqued his li:fu to save any one of them from the very fute, we :imprecated upon them In fact, on the night of the 22d, fuur of them, actually half starved, arrived at our camp, declaring, that they had eaten nothing fur five days. Notwithstanding our recent curses bestowed upon them, we received them as brothers. They related that the Indians bad assaulted and defeated them, robbing them of all their horses, and killing one of their number. Next day the remaining two came in, one of them severely wounded in the head by an Indian arrow. They remained with us two days, during which we attempted to induce them to lead us against the Ind:ians, who bad robbed them, that we might assist them to recover what had been robbed from them No persuasion would :induce them to this course. They :in_sisted at the sa:me time, that if we attempted to go on by ourselves, we should share the same fate, which had befallen them On the morning of the 25th, we gave them three horses, and as much dried meat as would last them to the mines, distant about 150 miles. Fully impressed, that the Indians would massacre us, they took such a furewellofus, as if never expecting to see us again. In the evening of the same day, although the weather threatened a storm, we packed up, and began to descend the river. We encamped tbjg night :in a huge cavern in the midst of the rocks. About night it began to blow a tempest, and to snow fust Om horses became impatient under the pelting of the storm, broke their ropes, and dmappeared. In the morning, the earth was covered with snow, fuur or five inches deep. One of our companions accompanied 27/122 5/1Q'13 Pattie's Personal Narrati\\e, 1824--1830 me to search fur our horses. We soon came upon their trail, and fOllowed it, until it crossed the river. We round it on the opposite side, and pursued it up a creek, that empties into \u00b7fue He:lay on the north shore. We passed a cave at the root of the cliffS. At its mouth I remarked, that the bushes were beaten down, as though some animal bad been browsing upon them I was aware, that a bear bad entered the cave. We collected some pine knots, split them with our toma-hawks, and kindled torches, with which I proposed to [58] my companion, that we should enter the cave together, and shoot the bear. He gave me a decided refusal, notwithstanding I reminded him, that I had, more than once, stood by him in a similar adventure; and notwithstanding I made him sensible, that a bear in a den is by no means so fOrmidable, as when ranging freely :in the woods. Finding it impossible to prevail on him to accompany me, I Jashed my torch to a stick, and placed it parallel with the gun barre~ so as that I could see the sights on it, and entered the cave. I advanced cautiously onward about twenty yards, seeing nothing. On a sudden the bear reared himself erect within seven fuet of me, and began to grow~ and gnash his teeth. I levelled my gun and shot him between the eyes, and began to retreat Whatever light it may throw upon my courage, I admit, that I was in such a hurry, as to stumble, and ext:il:lgtmh my Hght. The growling and struggling of the bear did not at all contribute to allay my apprehensions. On the contrary, I was in such haste to get out of the dark place, thinking the bear just at my heels, that I full several times on the rocks, by which I cut my limbs, and lost my gun. When I reached the light, my companion dec :Jared, and I can believe it, that I was as pale as a corpse. It was some ~. befOre I could summon sufficient comage to re-enter the cavern fur my gLID. But having re-kindled my light, and borrowed my companion's gun, I entered the cavern again, advanced and listened. All was silent, and I advanced still further, and round my gun, near where I had shot the bear. Here again I paused and listened. I then advanced onward a rew strides, where to my great joy I round the animal dead. I returned, and brought my companion in with me. We attempted to drag the carcass from the den, but so great was the sfz.e, that we fm.md ourselves wholly unable. We went out, round our horses, and returned to camp fur assistance. My :father severely reprimanded me fur venturing to attack such a dangerous animal in its den, when the :failure to kill it outright by the :first shot, would have been sure to be followed by my death. Four of us were detached to the den. We were soon enabled [59] to drag the bear to the light, and by the aid oi our beast to take it to camp. It was both the :largest and whitest bear I ever saw. The best proo~ I can give, of the size and fatness is, that we extracted ten gallons of oil from it. The rreat we dried, and put the oil in a trough, which we secured in a deep crevice of a em beyond the reach of a.rrimaB of prey. We were sensible that it would prove a treasure to us on our return. On the 28th we resmned our journey, and pushed down the stream to reach a point on the river, where trapping had not been practised. On the 30th, we reached this point, and round the man, that the Indians bad killed. They had cut him in quarters, after the :fashion of butchers. His head, with the hat on, was stuck on a stake. It was :full oi the arrows, which they had probably discharged into it, as they had danced around it. We gathered up the parts of 1he body, arJ.Cl buried them At this point we commenced setting our traps. We fumd the river skirted with very wide bottoms, thick-set with the musquito trees, which bear a pod in the shape of a bean, which is exceedingly sweet. It constitutes one of the chief articles of Indian subsistence; and they contrive to prepare from it a very palatable kind ofbread, of which we all became very fund. The wild anima1s also reed upon this pod. On the 31st we moved our camp ten miles. On the way we noted many :fresh traces of Indians, and killed a bear, that attacked us. The river pursues a west course amidst high mountains on each side. We trapped sbwly onward, still descending the river, and ummlested by the Indians. On the 8th ofF ebruary, we reached the mouth of a small river entering the He1ay on the north shore. Here we mexpectedly came upon a small party of Indians, that fled at user .Jmission.coml-clrud}dmlmanlhtml/patlielpatlia.hlml 28/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrathe, 1824--1830 the sight of us, in such consternation and lnmy, as to leave all their e:flects, which consisted of a quantity of the bread mentioned above, and some robes made of rabbit skins. Still more; they left a small child. The child was old enough to distinguhll us :from its own people, fur it opened its little throat, and screamed so lustily, that we reared it would have fits. The poor thing meanwhile made its [ 60] best effurts to fly :from us. We neither ph:mdered nor molested their little store. We bmmd the child in such a manner, that it could not stray away, and get lost, aware, that after they deemed us sufficiently fur o~ the parents would return, and take the child away. We thence ascended the small river about fuur miles, and encamped. For rear of surprize, and apprehending the return of the savages, that bad fled from us, and perhaps in greater furce, we secured our camp with a small breast~ work. We discovered very little encourageJ.Dent in regard to our trapping pursuit, fur we noted fuw signs of beavers on this stream The night passed without bringing us any disturbance. In the morning two of us returned to the Indian camp. The Indians bad re-visited it, and removed every thing of value, and what gave us great satisfaction, their child In proo~ that the fuelings of human nature are the same every where, and that the language of kindness is a universa] one; in token of their gratitude, as we wderstood it, they bad suspended a package on a kind of stick, which they had stuck erect. Availing ourselves of their otrer, we examined the present, and fuund it to contain a Jarge dressed buck skin, an article, which we greatly needed fur moccasins, of which some of us were in pressing want. On the same stick we tied a red bandkerchiefby way of some return. We thence continued to travel up this stream fuur days in succession, with very little incident to diversifY our march. We fuund the banks of this river pJentifullytimbered with trees ofvarious species, and the land fine fur cultivation. On the morning of the 13th, we returned to the He1ay, and fuund on our way, that the Indians bad taken the handkerchief; we bad left, though none of them bad shown any disposition, as we bad hoped, to visit us. We named the stream we bad left, the deserted furk, on account ofbaving fuund it destitute ofbeavers. We thence resmned our course down the He1ay, which continues to flow through a most beautiful country. W amed by the frequent traces of fresh Indian root-prints, we every night adopted [61] the expedient of enclosing our horses in a pen, reeding them with cotton-wood bark, which we fuund mLlCh better fur them than grass. On the 16th, we advanced to a point, where the river runs between high mountains, in a ravine so narrow, as barely to affurd it space to pass. We commenced exploring them to search fur a gap, through which we might be able to pass. We continued our expedition, travelling north, until we discovered a branch, that made its way out of the mountains. Up its ravine we ascended to the head of the branch Its fuuntains were supplied by an immense snow bank, on the summit of the rmmtain. With great Jabor and fatigue we reached this summit, but coukl descry no plains within the limits of vision. On every side the peaks of ragged and :frowning mountains rose above the clouds, affurding a prospect of dreariness and desohtion, to chill the heart. While we could hear the thunder burst, and see the lightning glare befure us, we fuund an att:n::lsphere so cold, that we were obliged to keep up severe and unremitting exercise, to escape :freezing. We commenced descending the western declivity of the rmuntains, amidst thick mists and dark clouds, with which they were enveloped. We pitied our horses and r:rrules, that were continually sliding and fulling, by which their limbs were strained, and their bodies bruised. To our great joy, we were not long, befure we came upon the ravine of a branch, that wound its way through the vast masses of crags and mountains. We were disappointed, however, in our purpose to fu1low it to the He Jay. Before it mingled with that stream, it ingulfud itself so deep between the cliffS, that though we heard the dash of the waters in their narrow bed, we could bard]y see them We were obliged to thread our way, as we might, along the precipice, that constituted the banks of the creek. We were often obliged to unpack our mules and horses, and transport their loads by band :from one precipice to another. We continued wandering among the mountains in this way, until the 23 d. Our provisions were at tim; time exhausted, and our horses and [62]mules so worn out, that they were utter]y unable to proceed :further. Thus we were absolutely 291122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 obliged to lie by two days. During~ time, Allen and myself commenced climbing towards the highest peak of the mountains in our vicinity. It was night-fuD, befure we gained it. But from it we could distinctly trace the winding path of the river :in several places; and what was still more cheering, could see smokes arising from several Indian camps. To rreet even enemies, was more tolerable, than thus rr.riserably to perish with hunger and cold in the momrtains. Our report on our return arrirr:w.ted the despair of our companions. On the morning of the 25th we resumed our pa:inful e:ffurts to reach the river. On the 2~th, to our great joy, we once more fuund ourselves on its banks. A party of Indians, encamped there, fled at our approach. But fOrtunately they left a little mush prepared from the seeds of grass. Without scruple we devoured it with appetites truly ravenous. In the morning we took ten beavers :in our traps, and Allen was detached with me to clear away a path, through which the pack horses might pass. We were obliged to cross the river twelve times in the course of a single day. We sttll discovered the fresh foo1prints o:f Indians, who had deserted their camps, and fled befure us. We were continually apprehensive, that they would fire their arrows upon us, or overwhelm us with rocks, let loose upon us from the summits of the high cliffS, directly under which we were obliged to pass. The third day, after we had left our company, I shot a wild goose in the river. The report of my gtm raised the screams of worren and children. Too rrruch alanned to stop fur my game, I mounted my horse, and rode toward them, with a view to convince them, or in some way, to show them, that we intended them no harm We discovered them ahead of us, climbing the mountains, the men in advance of the women, and all fleeing at the top of their speed. As soon as they saw us, they tu:rned, and let fly a rew arrows at us, one of which would have despatched my companion, had he not been infinitely dextrous in dodging. Hungry and futigued and by no means in the best humor, my companion returned [63] them abundance of curses fur their arrows. From words he was proceeding to deeds, and would undoubtedly have shot one of them, had I not caught his gun, and made him sensible of the madness of such a deed. It was clearly our wisdom to convince them, that we had no inclination to iqjure them Some ofthem were c1ad in robes of rabbit skins, part of which they shed, in their huny to damber over the rocks. Finding ourselves unable to overtake them, we returned to their camp, to discover if they had left any thing that we could eat. At no great distance from their camp, we observed a mound of fresh earth, in appearance like one of our coal kilns. Considering it improbable, that the Indians would be engaged in burning coal, we opened the mound, and fuund it to contain a sort of vegetable that had the appearance of herbage, which seemed to be baking in the ground, to prepare it fur eating. I afterwards ascertained, that it was a vegetable, caned by the Spanish, mascal, (probably maguey.) The Indians prepare it in this way, so as to make a kind of whiskey of it, tasting like crab-apple cider. The vegetable grows in great abmdance on these mountains. Next day we came to the point, where the river discharges its from the mountains on plains. We thence returned, and rejoined our company, that bad been making their way onward behind us. March 3d, we trapped along down a small that empties into the Relay on the south side, having its head :in a south west direction. It being v-ery rellial.\"'kab1e the rrul\"\"\"uber of its beavers, we gave it the nru:ne ofBeaver river. At this place we 200 skins; and on the 1Oth continued to descend the Relay, until the 20th, when we turned back with as much :fur, as our beasts couki pack. As yet we had experienced no molestation from the Indians, although they were frequently descried skulking after us, and gathering up the pieces of meat, we bad thrown away. On the Irorning of the 20th we were all prepared fur an early start, and my :father, by way of precaution, bade us all discharge our guns at the word of command, and then re-load them afresh, [64] that we might, in case of emergency, be sure of our fire. We were directed to furm in a line, take aim, and at the word, fire at a tree. We gave sufficient proofS, that we were no strangers to the rifle, fur every ball had lodged close to the centre of our mark. But the report of our guns was answered by the yell of more than an hundred savages, above us on the mountains. We itmnediately marched out from mder the mountains on to the plains, and beckoned them to come down, by every demonstration of friendship in our power. Nothing seemed to o:trer stronger enticement, than to 30/122 5/1Q/13 Pattie's Personal Narraliw, 1824--1830 hold out to them our red cloth. This we did, but without effuct, fur they either understood us not, or were reluctant to try our friendship. Leaving one of our number to watch their deportment, and to note if they fullowed us, we resumed our march. It would have been a great object to us to have been able to banish their suspicions, and make a treaty with them But we could draw from them no demonstrations, but those of rear and surprize. On the 25th we: returned to Beaver river, and dug up the furs that we had 1:nuied, or cashed, as the phrase is, and concluded to ascend it, traPPing towards :its h,ead, whence we purposed to cross over to the Helay above the mountains, where we bad suflered so much in crossing. About six miles up the stream, we stOpped to set our traPS, three being selected to remain behind in the camp to dry the skins, my :father to tmk.e a pen fur the horses, and I to guard the:tn, wbiJ\u20ac! they were turned !Qpse to fued in the grass. We bad pitched our camp near the bank of the river, in a tl::rick grove of timber, extending about a hundred yards in width. Behind the timber was a narrow plain of about the same width, and still further on was a high hill, to which I repaired, to watch my horses, and descry whatever might pass :in the distance. Immedlately back of the hill I discovered a s:rnall Jalle, by the noise made by the ducks and geese in it. Looking more attentively, I remarked what gave me much more satisfaction, that is to say, three beaver lodges. I returned, and made my father acquainted with my discovery. The party despatched to set traps had returned. My father infurmed [65] them of my discovery, and told fuem to set traps in the little lake. As we passed towards the lake, we observed the horses and n:mles all crowded together. At first we concluded that they coJlected togefuer in this way, because they bad ted enough. We soon discovered, that it was owing to another cause. I bad put down my gun, and stepped into fue water, to pre;pare a bed fur my trap, while the others were busy in pre;paring theirs. Instantly the Indians raEed a yell, and the quick report of guns ensued. Th:is noise was ab:rost drowned in the fierce shouts that fullowed, succeeded by a shower of arrows fulling among us like hail As we ran fur the camp leaving aD fue horses :in their power, we saw six Indians stealfhily fullowing our trail, as though they were tracking a deer. They occasionally stopped, raised themselves, and surveyed every thing around them. We concealed ourselves behind a large cotton-wood tree, and waited tmtil they came within a hundred yards of us. Each of us selected a separate Indian fur a mark, and our signal to fire together was to be a whistle. The sign was given, and we fired together. My mark full dead, and my companions' severely wounded. The other Indians seized their dead and wounded companions, and fled. We now rejoined our company, who were busily occupied in dodging the arrows, that came :in a shower from the swnmit of the hill, where I bad stationed myself to watch our horses. Discovering that they were too far from us, to be reached by our bu1lets, we retreated to the timber, in hopes to draw them down to the plain. But they had bad too ample proofS of our being marksmen, to think of retmning down to our level, and were satisfied to remain yelling, and letting :fly their arrows at random We fuund cause both fur regret and joy, regret, that our horses were in their power, and joy, that their unprovoked attack had been defeated with kiss to themselves, and none to us. At length they ceased yelling, and disappeared. We, on our part, set ourselves busily to work to furtny our camp fur the nigh-t. Meanwr.rile our sava!&v ern;;:my :my fu:ther, would have enabled [66] fuem to destroy us. They divided themselves into two parties, the one partyimunted on horses, stolen from us, and so arranged as to induce the belief, that they constituted the whole party. They expected that we would pursue them, to recover our horses. As soon as we should be drawn out from behind our fortification, they had a reserve party, on fuot, who were to rush in, between us and our camp, and tlrus, between two fires, cut us all off together. It so happened, that I had retired a little distance from the camp, in the direction of the ambush party on fuot I met them, and they raised a general yen. My father, supposing me surrounded, ran in the direction of the yeD, to aid me. He, too, came in direct contact with the fuot party, who let fly a shower of arrows at him, from which nothing but good providence preserved him He returned the fire with his gun and p:istoJs, by which he killed two of them, and the re:port of which immediately brought his companions to his side. The contest was a warm one fur a few minutes, when the Indians fled. This aflirir commenced about three in the afternoon; and the Indians made 31/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrali~.e, 1824--1830 their final retreat at five; and the succeeding night passed without :further molestation from them In the morning of the 26th, we despatched two of our men to bring our traps and furs. We had no longer any way of conveying them with us, fur the Indians had taken an our horses. We, however, in the late contest, had taken fuur of their's, left behind in the baste of their retreat. As our companions were returning to camp with the traps, which they had taken up to bury, they discovered the Indians, sliding along insidiously towards our camp. We were aD engaged :in eating our brea.k.fu.st :in entire confidence. Our 1'!Xm cried out to us, that the enemy was chse upon us. We sprang to our arn:m. The Indians instantly :fled to the top of the hill, which we had named battlehilL In a rew minutes they were all paraded on the horses and mules stolen from us. They instantly began to banter us in Spanish to come up to them One of our number who could speak Spanish, asked them to what nation they behnged? They answered, Eiotaro. In return, they asked us, who we were? We answered Americans. Hearing this, they stood in apparent [67] surprise and astonishment fur some moments. They then replied, that they had thought us too brave and too good marksmen, to be Spaniards; that they were sorry fur what they bad done, tmder the mistake of supposing us Spaniards. They declared themselves ready to make a treaty with us, provided that we would return the fhm horses, we bad taken from them, and bring them up the hill, where they promised us they would restore us our own horses :in exchange. We were at once impressed, that the proposal was a mere trick, to induce us to place ourselves :in their power. We therefure answered their proposal by another, which was, that they should bring down our horses, and leave them by the pen, where they bad taken them, and we in return would let their horses loose, and make :friendship with them They treated our proposal with laughter, which would have convinced us, bad we doubted it befure, that their onJy purpose bad been to ensnare us. We accordingly meed them, and fired upon them, which induced them to clear themselves most expeditiously. We proceeded to bury our furs; and having packed our fuur horses with provisions and two traps, we commenced our march. Having travened, abput ten miles, we encamped :in a thicket without kindling a fire, and kept a strict guard all night. Next morning we made an early march, stilll:\"!long t1le banks qf the river. Its banks are still plentifully timbered with cotton-wood and willow. The bottoms on each side affurd a fine soil fur cultivation. From these bottoms the hills rise to an enormous height, and their summits are covered with perpetual snow. In these bottoms are great numbers ofwiW: hogs, of a species entirely d.i:frerent from our domestic swine. They are fux-colored, with their navel on their back, towards the back part of their bodies. The hoof of their hind reet bas but one dew-claw, and they yield an odor not Jess ofrensive than our polecat Their figure and head are not unlike our swine, except that their tail resembles that of a bear. We measured one of their tusks, of a s:ize so enormous, that I am afraid to cormnit my credibility, by giving the dimensions. They rermin tmdistmbed [68] by man and other animals, whether through rear or on account of their offunsive odor, I am unable to say. That they have no rear oftmn, and that they are exceedingly ferocious, I can bear testimony myself I have many times been obliged to climb trees to escape their tusks. We killed a great many, but could never bring ourselves to eat them The country presents the aspect oi having been once settled at so~ rerr.vte period oftl-Ie past Great quantities ofbroken pottery are scattered over the ground, and there are traces of ditches and stone some of them as blgh as a man's breast, with very broad fOundations. A species of tree, which I bad never seen befure, here arrested my attention It grows to the height offurty or fifty reet. The top is cone shaped, and ahmst without fuliage. The bark resemb:les that of the prickly pear; and the body is covered with thorns. I bave seen some three fuet in diatreter at the root, and throwing up twelve distinct shafts. On the 29th, we made our last encampment on this river, intending to return to it no 1t10re, except fur our furs. We set our two traps for the last time, and caught a beaver in each.-We skinned the animals, and prepared the skins to hold water, through :fear, that we might find none on our l.Dlknown route through the mountains to the He lay, from which we judged ourselves distant two lnmdred miles. Our provisions were an spoiled. We bad nothing to carry user.lrrission.coml-17ud}drn1marl/l'llm/patlielpatlia.hlml 321122 5119/13 Pattie's Personal Narra!he, 1824--1830 with us to satisfY hunger, but the bodies of the two beavers which we bad caught, the night befure. We bad nothing to sustain us in this disconsolate :march, but our trust in providence; fur we could not but furesee hunger, futigue and pair\\ as the inevitable attendants upon our journey. To increase the depression of om sp:irits, our moccasins were worn out, our fuet sore and tender, and the route full of sharp rocks. On the 31st, we reached the top of the mountain, and red upon the last meat of our beavers. We met with no traces of game. What distressed :me most of all was, to perceive my futher, who bad already passed the :meridian of his days, sinking with futigue and weakness. On the morning of the first of April, [69] we commenced descending the mountain, from the side of which we could discern a plain befure us, which, however, it required two severe days travel to reach. During these two days we bad nothing either to eat or drink. In descending from these icy motmtains, we were surprised to find how warm it was on the plains. On reaching fuem I killed an antelope, of which we drank the warm blood; and however revolting the recital may be, to us it was refreshing, tasting like fresh milk. The :meat we put upon our horses, and travelled on urrt.il twelve o'clock, befure we fuund water. Here we encamped the remainder of the day, to rest, and refresh omselves. The signs of antelopes were abmdant, and the appearances were, that they carne to the water to drink; from which we infurred, that there was no other drinking place in the vicinity. Some of our hunters went out in pursuit of the antelopes. From the numbers of these animals, we called the pJace Antelope Plain. The land lies very handsomely, and is a rich, biack soil, with heavily timbered groves in the vicinity. On the morning of the 3d, though exceedingly sti:lfand sore, we resumed our :march, and reaching the opposite side of the plain, encamped. at~ spring, that ran from the mountain. Next day we ascended this mountain to its summit, which we fuund covered with iron ore. At a distance we saw a smoke on our course. We were aware that it was the smoke of an Indian camp, and we pushed on towards it. In the evening we reached the smoke, but fuund it deserted of Indians. A11 this day's march was along a comrtry abundant in minera1s. In several pJaces we saw lead and copper ore. I picked up a small parcel of ore, which I put in my shot-pouch, which was proved afterward to be an ore of silver. The misfurtune of~ region ~' that there is no water near these miheral hillS. We co!Ilirenced om morning march half dead with thirst, and pushed on with the eagerness inspired by that tormenting appetite. Late in the evening we fuund a little water, fur our own drinking, in the bottom of a rock. Not a drop remained fur our fuur horses, that evidently showed a thirst no less devouring than ours. [70] Their fuet were all bleeding, and the moment we paused to rest ourselves, the weary companions of our journey :instantly laid down. It went still more to my heart, to see my two fuitb:ful dogs, which bad followed :me all the way from my futher's house, where there was always bread enough and to spare , looking to me with an expression, which a hunter in the desert only can understand, as though begging food and water. Full g]adly would I have expJa:ined to them, that the sterile wilderness gave me no means of supplying their wants. We had scarcely commenced the next morning's march, when, at a little distance from our course, we saw a smoke. Supposing it an Indian camp, we immediately concluded to attack it. Adopting their own policy, we slipped onward in silence and conceaJment, urrt.il we were close by it. We fuund the persons women and chiJdren. Having no disposition to harm them, we fired a gun over fueir heads, which caused them instantly to fly at the extent of their speed. H1mger knows no Jaws; and we availed ourselves of their provision, which proved to be rnasca~ and grass seed, of which we made mush. Scanty as this nutriment was, it was sufficient to sustain lifu. We commenced an early march on the 6th, and were obliged to move slowly, as we were bare-fuoted, and the mountains rough and steep. We fuund them either wholly barren, or only covered with a stinted growth of pine and cedar, live oak and barbary bushes. On the 8th, our provisions were entirely exhausted, and so having nothing to 331122 5/19113 Pattie's F'ersOI\"'BBI Narrali~~e, 1824--1830 eat, we relt the need of water. Our destitute and furlom condition goaded us on, so that we reached the Helay on the 12th. We :immediately began to search fur traces ofbeavers, where to set our traps, but round none. On the :morning ofthe 13th, we killed a raven, which we cooked fur seven men. It was unsavory flesh in itse~ and would hardly have a:ffurded a treal fur one hungry :man. The miserable condition of our company may be imagined, when seven hungry men, who bad not eaten a full treal fur ten days, were all obliged to breal.cfust on this nauseous bird. We were an weak and emaciated. But I was young [71] and able to bear hardships. My heart only ached fur my poor :father who was reduced to a trere skeleton. We moved on slowly and pain:fully, until evening, when we \u00b7encamped. On my return :from setting our two traps, I killed a buzzard, which, disagreeable as it was, we cooked for supper. In the :morning ofthe 18th, I round one of the traps had caught anqtter. This served fur breakfust and supper. It seemed the means of our present salvation, fur my mthe.r had become so weak, that he could no longer travel We tberefure encamped early, and tmee of us went out to hunt deer among the hills. But in this sad emergency we coUld find none. When we returned, my :father had prepared lots, that we should draw, to determine who of us should kill one of the dogs. I refused through rear that the lot would full to me. These faithful companions of our suffurings were so dear to me, that I relt as though I could not allow them to be killed to save my own life; though to save my father, I was aware that it was a duty to allow it to be done. We Jay here until the 18th, my mther finding the flesh of the dog both sweet, nutritive and s1rengthening. On the 18th, he was again able to trave~ and on the 20th, we arrived at Bear creek, where we hid the bears oil, which we fuund lD.lliDlested. We lay here two days, during which time we killed :fbur deer and some turkies. The venison we dried, and cased the skin of one of the deer, :in which to carry our oiL We commenced an early march on the 23d, and on the 25th reached the river San Fra:ncisco, where we fuund our buried furs all safe. I suffured exceedingly :from the soreness of my fuet, giving me great pain and rever at night. We made from our raw deer skins a very tolerable substitute fur shoes. The adoption of this important expedient enabled us to push on, so that we reached 1he Copper mines on the 29th. The Spaniards seemed exceedingly rejoiced, and welcomed us home, as though we were of their own nation, religion and kindred. They assured us, that they had no expectation ever to see us again. The superintendent of the mines, especially, who appeared to Ire a gentleman of1he highest order, received [72] us with particu1ar kindness, and supplied all our pressing wants. Here we remained, to rest and recruit ourselves, until the 2d ofMay. My futher then advised me to travel to Santa Fe, to get some of om goods, and purchase a new supply ofhorses, with which to return, and bring in our furs. I had a horse, which we had taken from the Indians, shod with copper shoes, and in company with :fbur of my companions, and the superintendent of the mines, I started fur Santa Fe. The superintendent assured us, that he would gladly have :furnished us horses; but the Appache Indians bad recently made an :incursion upon his establishment, stealing all his horses, and killing three :men, that were herding them This circumstance had suspended the working of the mines. Besides he was w.able to procure the necessary coaJ, with which to work them, because the Appaches way-laid the colliers, and killed them, as often as they attempted to make coal We arrived at the house of the governor on the 12th. Jacova, his daughter, received us with the utmost a:lfuction; and shed tears on observing me so :ill; as I was in fuct reduced by starvation and fatigue, to skin and bone. Beings in a more wretched plight she could not often have an opportunity to see. My hair hlmg matted and wcombed. My head was surmounted with an old straw hat My legs were fitted with leather leggins, and my body arrayed in a leather hunting shirt, and no want of dirt about any part of the whole. My companions did not shame me, in compa.:rEon, by being better clad. But all these repulsive circumstances notwithstanding, we were welcotred by the governor and Jacova, as kindly, as if we bad been clad in a manner worthy of their estab1ishment. user.Jmission.com'-crudy'mtmanlhlml/patlia/patlia.hlml 34/122 5/19/13 Pattie's Personal Narra!i~, 1824--1830 We here 1hree days. I bad left my roore decent apparel in the care of Jacova, when we started from 1he house into the wilderness on our trapping expedition. She bad had my clothes prepared in perfuct order. I once :trore dressed myself decently, and spared to my companions an my clothes that fitted them We all had our hair trin:nred. All this had much improved our appearance. When we started [73] on the 15th, the okl gentleman gave each of us a good horse, enabling us to travel at our ease. On the 18th we arrived at Santa Fe, where we immediately met some of our furmer companion(). It hardly need be added, that the joy of this recognition was great and mutual We fuund Mr. Pratte ill in bed. He expressed himself delighted to see me, and was still roore desirou..r.; to see my mther. He infurmed me, that fuur of the company that he had detached to trap, had been defuated by the Indians, and the majority of them killed. He bad, ako, despaired of ever seeing us again. I took a part of my goods, and started back to 1he mines on the 21st. None of my companions were willing to accompany me on accmmt of the great apprehended danger from the Indians between this place and 1he mines. In consequence, I hired a man to go with me, and having purchased what horses I wanted, we two travelled on in company. I would have prefurred to have purchased my horses of the old governor. But I knew that his noble nature would impel him to give them to me, and relt reluctant to incur such an ob]igation. When I left his house, he insisted on my receiving a gold chain, in token of the perpetual remembrance of his daughter. I saw no pretext fur refusing it, and as I received it, she assured me that she should always make mention of my :father and me in her prayers. I left this hospitable place on the 24th, taking all my clothes with me, except the hunting shirt, which I had worn in the battle with the Commanches. This she desired to retain, insisting, that she wished to preserve this memorial to the day of her death. We arrived at the mines the first day of June, having experienced no roolestation from the Indians. We continued here, making arrangements fur our expedition to bring in the furs, until the 6th. The good natured commander gave us provisions to last us to the point where our furs were buried, and back again. Still more, he armed ten of his laborers, and detached them to accompany us. The company consisted of fuur Americans, the mm hired at Santa Fe, and the commander's ten men, fifteen in all [74] We left the mines on the 7th, and reached Battle-hill on Beaver river on the 22d. I need not attempt to describe my fuelings, fur no description could paint them, when I fuund the furs all gone, and perceived that the Indians had discovered them and taken them away. All that, fur which we had hazarded ourselves, and sufrered every thing but death, was gone. The whole fruit of our long, toilsome and dangerous expedition was lost, and all my goklen hopes of prosperity and comfOrt vanished like a dream I tried to convince myselC that repining was of no use, and we started fur the river San Francmco on the 29th Here we fuund the small quantity buried there, our whole compensation fur a year's toil, misery and danger. We met no Indians either going or returning. We arrived at the mines the 8th of July, and after having rested two days proposed to start fur Santa Fe. The commander, don Juan Unis, requested us to remain with him 1:\\vo or three mo:nths, to guard his workmen from the Indians, while pursuing their employment in the woods. He o:ffured, as a compensation, a dollar a day. We consented to stay, though without accepting the wages. We shoukl have considered ourselves ungratefu1, after all the kindness, he had rendered us at the hour of our greatest need, either to have refused the request, or to have accepted a compensation. Consequently we made our arrangements to stay. We passed our ~ roost pleasantly in hunting deer and bears, of which there were great nun:Ders in the vicinity. We had no other duties to perfOrm, than to walk round in the vicinity of the workmen, or sit by and see them work. Most of my t:iJ:re was spent with don Juan, who kindly undertook to teach me to speak Spanish. Ofhirn, having no other person with whom to converse, I learned the language easily, and rapidly. One roonth of our engagement user .mission.com'-c.tud}dml:manlhlml/patlie/paltia.hlm! 351122 5/19113 1824--1830 passed ofl\" without any molestation :from the Indians. But on the first day of August, while three of us were lnmting deer, we discovered the trail of six Indians approaching the mines. We fullowed the trail, and within about a mile from the mines, we came up with them [75] They fled, and we pursued close at their hee~. Gaining upon them, one of them dodged us, into the head of a hoJlow. We surrounded him As soon as he saw that we bad discovered him, and that escape was impossible, he spnmg on his reet, threw away his bow and arrows, and begged us most submmsively not to shoot him One of our 11:1e11 made up to him, while the other man and myself stood with our guns cocked, and raised to our mces, ready to shoot him, if he made the least motion towards his bow. But he remained perfectly stil1, crossing his bands, that we might tie them Having done it, we drove him on befure us. We bad advanced about a hundred yards from the point where we took him, when he pointed out to us a hollow tree, intimating that there was another Indian concealed there. We bade him instruct his companion to make no resistance, and to surrender himse]4 or we would kill him He explained our words to his companion in the tree. He immediately ca.nx furth :from his concealment with his bow, and we tied his bands in the sarre way as the other's. We marched them before us to the mines, where we put them in prison. The Spaniards, exasperated with their recent cruelties and m:trders, would have k:iDed them We insisted that they should be spared, and they rem:Uned in prison until the next morning. We then brought them out of prison, conversed with them, and showed them how closely we could fire. We instructed one of them to ten his chief to co~ in, accompanied by an his warriors, to make peace. We retained one of the prisoners as a hostage, assuring the other, that if his chief did not come in to make peace, we would put the hostage to death. fu regard to the mode of :making it, we engaged, that only fuur of our men should meet them at a hoDow, half a mile from the mine. We etYoined it on him to bring them there within the term of fuur days. We readily discovered by the tranquil countenance of our hostage, that he bad no apprehensions that they would not come in. Afterwards, by way of precaution, my futher put in requisition an the anns he could find in the vicinity of the mines, with [76] which he a:rtred thirty Spaniards. He then ordered a trench dug, at a hundred yard's distance from the point designated fur the Indians to occupy. This trench was to be occupied by our armed men, during the time of the treaty, in case, that if the Indians should be insolent or menacing, these men might be at band to overawe them, or aid us, according to circumstances. On the 5th, we repaired to the place designated, and in a short tirre, the Indians to the number of80, came in sight We had prepared a pipe, tobacco, and a council :fire, and had spread a blanket, on which the chief might sit down. As soon as they came near us, they threw down their anns. The fuur chiefS ca.nx up to us, and we an sat down on the blanket We corrnnenced discussing the subject, fur which they were convened. We asked them, if they were ready to make a peace with us; and if not what were the objections? 1hey replied, that they bad no objections to a peace with the Americans, but would never make one with the Spaniards. When we asked their reasons, they answered tr.at tltey r..ad been long at war vv:ith tl-te Spani~rds, and that a great many mnrders ha_d been mutually inflicted on either side. They admitted, that they bad taken a great many horses from the Spaniards, but indignantly alleged, that a 1arge party of their people bad come in to make peace with the Spaniards, of which they pretended to be very desirous; that with such pretexts, they bad decoyed the party within their walls, and then coilll\"llenced butchering them like a flock of sheep. The very rew who had escaped, had taken an unalterable resolution never to make peace with them 'fu pursuance,' they continued, 'of our purposes of revenge, great m:m:IDers of our nation went in among the Spaniards, and were baptized. There they remain mithful spies fur us, infOrming us when and where there were favorable opportunities to kill, and phmder our enemies.' We told them in reply, that if they really relt disposed to be at peace with the Americans, these mines were now working jointly by us and the Spaniards; that it was wrong in them to revenge the crimes of the guilty upon the 361122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824---1830 innocent, and that [77] these Spaniards bad taken no part in the cowardly and cruel butchery, of which they bad spoken; and that if they would not be peaceable, and allow us to work the mines unmolested, the Americans would consider them at war, and woUld raise a sufficient body of men to pursue them to their lurking p1aces in the mountains; that they bad good evidence that om peop1e could travel in the woods and among the mountains, as well as the:rmelves; and that we could shoot a great deal better than either they or the Spaniards, and that we had no cowards among us, but true men, who had no rear and would keep their word. The chiefS answered, that if the mines belonged to the Americans, they would promise never to disturb the people that worked them We ]eft them, therefure, to infur that the mines belonged to us, and took them at their word. We 1hen lit the pipe, and all the Indians gathered in a circle round the fire. The rom chiefS, each in succession made a long speech, in which we could often distinguish 1he terms A.tmricans, and Espanola. The men listened with proround attention, occasionally sanctioning what was said by a nod of the head. We 1hen comrrenced smoking, and the pipe passed twice round the circle. They then dug a ho1e in the ground in the centre of the circle, and each one spat in :it. They then filled it up with earth, danced round it, and stuck their arrows in 1he little mound. They then gathered a large pile of stones over it, and painted themselves red. Such are their ceremonies of making peace. All the rorms offue ceremony were fimliliar to us, except the pile of stones, and spitting in the ho1e they had dug, which are not practised by the Indians on the Arrerican :frontiers. We asked them the meaning ofthe spitting. They said, that they did it in token of spitting out all their spite and revenge, and burying their anger under the ground. It was two o'clock befure all these ceremonies were finished. We then showed them our reserve rorce in the trench. They evinced great alarm to see their enemies the Spaniards so close to them, and all ready fur action. We explained to them, that we intended to be in good fuith, if they were; and that these [78] men were posted there, only in case they showed a disposition to violence. Their fears vanished and tranquility returned to their countenances. The chiefS laughed, and said to each other, these Americans know how to fight, and make peace too. But were they to fight us, they would have to get a company entirely of their own people; fur that if they took any Spaniards into their company, they would be sme to desert them in the time of action. We thence all n:mched to the mines, where we killed three beeves to reed the Indians. After they had eaten, and were in excellerrt hwnor, the head chief made a present to my mther, often miles square of a tract of land lying on a river about three miles :from the mines. It was very :favorable fur cultivation, and the Spaniards had several titms attempted to tmke a crop of grain upon it; but the Indians had as often either killed the cultivators, or destroyed the grain. My :father infurmed them, that though the Jand might be his, he should be ob]jged to employ Spaniards to cuJti:vate it fur him; and that, having made the land his, they must consider these cultivators his people, and not mo1est them With a look of great firmness, the chief said 'that he was a man of truth, and had given his word, and that we should :find that nothing belonging to the mines would be disturbed, for that he never would a1low the treaty to be violated.' He went on to add, 'that he WRrrted to be at peace with us, because he had dir.;covered, that the Americans never showed any disposition to kill, except in battle; that they bad had a proof of this in our not killing the two prisoners we had taken; but had sent one of them to invite his people to come in, and make peace with us, and that he took pleasure in making known to us, that they were good people too, and had no wish to injure men that did not disturb or iqjure them' An this mrce of bringing the Indians to te!'Il\"B of peace with this establishment was of infinite service to the Spaniards, though of none to us; fur we neither had any interest in the mines, nor intended to stay there much longer. But we were glad to oblige don Juan who bad been so great a benemctor [79] to us. He, on his part, was most thankful to us; fur he could now work the mines without any risk of losing men or cattle. He could now raise his own grain, which he had hitherto been obliged to pack 200 miles, not without having many of those engaged in 37/122 5/1QI13 Pattie's PersOI'lfll Narratiw, 1824--1830 bringing :it, either killed or robbed. The Indians now bad so much changed their depo:rt:ment as to bring in horses or cows, that they fuund astray from ilie mines. They regularly brought in deer and turk.ies to se11, which don Juan, to keep alive their friendship, purchased, whether he needed ilie articles or not. Every day more or less Indians came into the settlement to go and hunt deer and bears with us. They were astonished at the closeness of our shooting; and nothing seemed to delight them so much, as our telling them, we would learn them to shoot our guns. My :father had the honor to be denominated in their language, the big Captain. Don Juan, apprehending that the truce with the Indians would last no :longer than while we staid, and that after our departure, the Indians would resume their fOrmer habits of robbery and murder, was desirous to retain us as long as possible. We agreed to stay until December, when our plan was to commence another trapping expedition on the Helay~ fullowing it down to its mouih. With every disposition on the part of don Juan to render our stay agreeable, the tirre passed away pleasantly. On the 16th of September, the priest, to whose diocese the mines belonged, made a visit to the mines, to release the spirits of those who bad died since his last visit, from purgatory, and to make Christians by baptising the little persons who had been born in the same time. This old priest, out of a reverend regard to his own person, had fled from this settlement at the commencement of the Indian disturbances; and had not returned until now, when the Indians bad made peace. A body of Indians happened to be in, when the priest came. We were exceedingly amused with the interview between the priest and an Indian chie~ who, from having had one of his bands bitten offby a bear, was called Mocho Mano. The priest asked the one handed chie~ why [80] he did not offer himself fur baptism? Mocho remained silent fur some time, as :if ruminating an answer. He then said, 'the Appache chief is a very big rogue now. Should he get his crown sprinkled with holy water, it would either do him no good at a}], or if it had any e:trect, would make him a greater rogue; fur that the priests, who made the water holy, and then went sprinkling it about among the people fur money, were the biggest rogues of all.' This made the priest as angry as it made us merry. When we bad done laughing, Mocho asked us, how we baptised among our people? I answered that we had two ways ofperfurrning it; but that one way was, to phmge the baptised person under water. He replied promptly, 'now there is some sense in that;' adding that when a great quantity of rain full from the clouds, it made the grass grow; but that it seemed to him that sprinkling a rew drops of water amounted to nothing. The priest, meanwhile, prophesied, that the peace between the Spaniards and Indians would be of very short duration. On the 18th, he left the mines, and returned to the place whence he had come. On the 20th, we started with some Imlian guides to see a mountain of salt, that they assured us existed in their country. We travelled a northerly course through a heavily timbered country, the trees chiefly of pine and live oak. We killed a great number ofbears and deer on the first day; and on account of their reverence fur my :father, they treated me as :ifi had been a prince. On the second we arrived at the salt hill, which is about one htmdred miles north of the mines. The hill :is about a quarter of a mile in length, and on the front side of it is the sah blu:fl; eight or ten reet in thiclmess. It has the appearance of a bJack rock, divided from the earthy matters, with which the salt is mixed. What was to me the most curious circumstance of the whole, was to see a fresh water spring boiling up within twenty reet from the salt blu.f4 which is a detached and solitary hill, rising out of a valley, which is of the richest and blackest soil, and heavily timbered [81] with oak, ash and black wa1nut. I remained here two days, during which I killed fifteen deer, that came to lick salt. An Indian woman of our company dressed all my deer skins, and we loaded two mules with the salt, and started back to the mines, where we anwed the first ofOctober. Nothing could have been more seasonable or acceptable to don Juan, than the salt we brought with us. Having mentioned these mines so often, perhaps it may not be amiss, user .ln'ission.com'-ctLJdYmlmanlhlml/patlie/patiie.hlml 38/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 to give a rew detai1s respecting them Within the circurn:ference of three miles, there :is a mine of copper, goJd and silver, and beside, a cliff of load stone. The silver mine :is not worked, as not being so profitable, as either the copper or goJd mines. We remained here to the last ofDecember, when the settlement was visited by a company ofFrench trappers, who were bmmd fur Red river. We :immediately made preparations to return with them, which again revived the apprehensions of don Juan, that the Indians would break in upon the settlement as soon as we were gone, and again put an end to the working of the mines. To detain us efiectually, he proposed to rent the mines to us fur five years, at a thousand dollars a year. He was willing to :furnish provisions fur the first year gratis, and pay us fur all the improvements we should make on the estab1ishment. We could not but be aware, that this was an excellent offur. My father accepted it. The writings were drawn, and my father rented the establishment on his own account, selecting such partners as he chose. I, meanwhile, fu]t within me an irresistible propensity to resume the employrrent of trapping. I had a desire, which I can hardly describe, to see more of this strange and new country. My :father sl.l'flered greatly in the view of my parting with him, and attempted to dissuade me from it. He strongly painted the dangers of the route, and represented to me, that I should not find these Frenchmen like my own cmmtry people, fur companions. All was unavailing to change my :fixed purpose, and we left the mines, January 2d, 1826. We travelled down the river Helay, of which I have furmerly [82] given a description, as fur as the point where we had left it fur Battle-hill. Here, ahhough we saw fresh Indian signs, we met with no Indians. Where we encamped fur the night, there were arrows sticking :in the ground. We made an early start on the 161:h, and at evening came upon the self same party ofindians, that had robbed us of our horses, the year past. Some of them. had on articles of my :lather's clothes, that he had left where we buried our furs. They had made our beaver skins :into robes, which we now purchased of them. While this bargain was transacting, I observed one of the Indians mounted on the self same horse, on which my futher bad travelled from the States. My blood instant]y boiled within me, and, presenting my gun at him, I ordered him instantly to dismount. He immediately did as I bade him, and at once a trepidation and a1arm ran through the whole party. They were but twenty men, and they were encumbered with women and children. We were thirteen, well mounted and armed. The chief ofthe party came to me, and asked me, ':if I knew this horse?' I answered, that 'I did, and that it was mine.' He asked me again, 'if we were the party, whose horses and furs they bad taken the year befure?' I answered, that I was one of them, and that :ifhe did not cause my furs and horses to be delivered up to me, we would kill them all on the spot. He immediately brought me 150 skins and three horses, observing, that they bad been furnished, and had eaten the rest, and. that he hoped this would satiszy me, fur that in the battle they had sufl.ered more than we, be having lost ten men, and we having taken from them four horses with their saddles and bridles. I observed to him in reply, that he must remember that they were the aggressors, and had provoked the quarre~ in trnving robbed us of our horses, and attempting to kill ns. He arlrnitted that they were the aggressors, in beginning the quarre~ but added, by way of apology, that they had thought us Spaniards, not knowing that we were Americans; but that now, when he knew us, he was willing to make peace, and be in perpetual friendship. On this we lit the pipe of peace, and smoked friends. I gave mm some red [83] cloth, with which he was delighted. I then asked him about the diffurent nations, through which our route woukllead us? He named fuur nations, with names, as he pronotmeed them, sufficiently barbarous. All these nations he described as bad, treacherous and quarrelsome. Though it was late in the evening, we resumed our nmch, until we had reached the point where the river runs between mountains, and where I had turned back the year befure. There is here 1itt1e tirriber, beside musqueto\u00ad wood, which stands thick. We passed through the country of the first two tribes, which the Indian chief bad 39/122 5/19113 Pa!:lie's Personal Narratlw, 1824--1830 described to us, without meeting an individual of them On the 25th, we arrived at an Iru.lian village situated on the south bank of the river. Almost all the inhabitants of this village speak Spanish, fur it is situated only three days journey from a Spanish furt in the province ofSonora, through which province this river runs. The Indians seemed disposed to be friendly to us. They are to a considerable degree cultivators, raising wheat, com and cotton, which they ma:tlllfucture into cloths. We left this village on the 25th, and on the 281h in the evening arrived at the Papawar village, the inhabitants of which came running to meet us, with their fuces painted, and their bows and arrows :in their hands. We were alar:i:red at these hostile appearances, and halted. We told them that we were friends, at which they threw down their arms, laughing the while, and showing by fueir countenances that they were aware that we were frightened. We entered the village, and the French began to manifust their uncontrollable curiosity, by strolling about in every directkm. I noted several crowds of Indians, collected in gangs, and talking earnestly. I caDed the leader of my French companions, and infu:rmed him that I did not like these movements of the Indians, and was fearful that they were Jaying a p1an to cut us all up. He Jaugbed at my fears, telling me I was a coward. I replied, that I did not think that to be cautious, and on our guard, was to show cowardice, and that I still thought it best fur us to start [84] off At this he became angry, and told me that I might go when I pleased, and that he wouki go when he was ready. I then spoke to a Frenchman of our number, that I had known fur a hng titre in Missouri; I proposed to him to join me, and we wouki leave the village and encamp by ourselves. He consented, and we went out offue village to the distance of about 400 yards, under the pretext of going there to feed our horses. When the sm was about half an hour high, I observed the French captain coming out towards us, accompanied by a great number of Indians, aD armed with bows and arrows. This con:.firmed me in my conviction that they intended us no good. Expressing my apprehensions to my French companion, he observed in his peculiar style of English, that the captain was too proud and headstrong, to allow him to receive instruction from any one, fur that he thought nobody knew any thing but hirmelf Agreeing that we had best take care of ourselves, we made us a fire, and commenced our arrangerrents fur spending the night. We took care not to oosaddle our horses, but to be :in readiness to be off at a m:nnent's warning. Our French captain came and encafll.led within a hundred yards of us, accompanied by not less than a hundred Indians. They were all exceedingly officious in he ]ping the party unpack their nn.Ues; and in persuading the captain, fuat there was no danger in turning them all loose, they promised that they wouki guard them with their own horses. This proposal delighted the lazy Frenchmen, who hated to go through the details of preparing fur encampment, and had a particular dislike to standing guard :in the night. The Indian chief then proposed to the captain to stack their arms against a tree, that stood close by. To this also, mider a kind of spell of :infutuation he consented. The Indian chief took a rope, and tied the arms fil.st to a tree. 1ts I saw this, I tolrl the capt!-lin th.at it seemed to me no mark of their being friendly, fur them to retain their own arms, and persuade us to putting ours out of our power, and that one, who had known Indians, ought to be better acquainted with their character, than to encamp with them, without his men having [85] their own arms in their hand. On this he flew into a most violent passion, calling me, with a curse added to the epithet, a coward, wishing to God that he bad never taken rre with him, to dishearten his men, and render them insubordinate. Being remarkable neither fur furbearance, or fulling to pay a debt of hard words, I gave him as good as he sent, telling him, among other things no ways :flattering, that he was a liar and a fuol, fur that none other than a fuol wouki disarm his men, and go to sleep :in the midst of armed savages in the woods. To this he replied, that he would not allow rn-: to travel any longer in his company. I answered that I was not only willing, but desirous to leave him, fur that I considered myself safer in my own single keeping, than under the escort of such a captain, and that I estimated him only to have sense enough to lead people to destruction. user .>rnission.comt-drudy'l'flll'nanlhtml/pa!:li e/pa!:lie.htr'rd 40/122 to mutter harsh language in reply, as I returned to my own camp. It being now dusk, we prepared, and ate our supper. We bad just :finished it, when the head chief of the village crum to invite us to take our supper with them, adding, by way of inducement, that they had brought some fine pumpkins to camp, and had cooked them fur the white people. We told him, we had taken supper; and the more he :insisted, the more resolutely we refused. Like the French captain, he began to abuse us, telling us we had bad hearts. We to:Jd him, that when with such people, we chose rather to trust to our heads than our hearts. He then asked us to let some of his warriors come and sleep with us, and share our blankets, alleging, as a reason fur the request, that the nights were cold, and his warriors too poor to buy blankets. We to:Jd him, that he could easily see that we were poor also, and were no ways abundantly supplied with blankets, and that we shouki not allow them to sleep with us. He then ImrChed off to the French camp, evidently sulky and in bad temper. While roundly rating us to the French captain, he gave as a reason why we ought not to sleep by ourselves, that we were in danger ofbeing killed in the night by another tribe oflndians, with whom he was at war. [86] The captain, apparently more calm, came to us, and told us, that our conduct was both imprudent and improper, in not conciliating the Indians by consenting to eat with them, or allowing them to sleep w:ith us. My temper not having been at an sweetened by any thing that had occurred since we full out, I told him, that if he had a fimcy to eat, or sleep with these Indians, I bad neither power nor the will to control him; but that, being determined, that neither he nor they should sleep with me, he had better go about his business, and not disturb me with useless importunity. At this he began again to abuse and revile me, to which I made m return At length, having exhausted his stock of epithets, he returned to his camp. As soon as we were by ourselves, we began to cut grass fur our horses, not intending either to unsaddle, or let them loose fur the night. My companion and myself were alike convinced, that some catastrophe was in reserve from the Indians, and seeing no chance of defending ourselves against an odds of more than twenty to one, we concluded, as soon as an shouki be silent in the camp, to fly. We packed our mules so as to leave none of our e:llects behind, and kept awake. We re:rmined thus, tmtil. near midnight, when we heard a :fierce whistle, which we instantly mtderstood to be the signal fur an attack on the French camp. But a moment ensued, befure we heard the clashing of war clubs, fullowed by the shrieks and heavy groans of the dying French, mingled with the louder and more horrible yells of these treacherous and blood thirsty savages. A moment afterwards, we heard a party of them Imking towards us. To convince them that they could not butcher us in our de:funceless sleep, we fired upon them 'This caused them to retreat. Convinced that we had no time to lose, we mounted our horses, and fled at the extent of our speed. We heard a single gun discharged in the Indian can:~p, which we supposed the act of an Indian, who had k::illed the ovvner. We took our direction towards a high mountain on the south side of the river, and pushed fur it as :fust as we thought our horses could endure to be driven We reached the mountain at day break, [87] and made our way about three miles up a creek, that issued from the mountain. Here we stopped to refresh our horses, and let them reed, and take fuod oursel-ves. The passage of the creek was along a kind of crevice ofthe mourrta.ir>.., and we were strongly convinced that the Indians would not fullow upon our trail further than the entrance to the mountain. One of us ascended a high ridge, to survey whatever might be within view. My companion, having passed nearly an hour in the survey, returned to me, and said he saw something on the plain approaching us. I ascended with him to the srum place, and plainly perceived something black approaching us. Having watched it fur some time, I thought it a bear. At length it reached a tree on the pla~ and ascended it. We were then convinced, that it was no Indian, but a bear searching rood. We couki see the smokes arising from the Indian town, and had no doubt, that the savages were dancing at the moment around the scalps of the tmfortunate Frenclnren, who had :fullen the victims of their indolence and rash confidence in these :fuithless people. All anger fur their abuse of me fur my timely advice was swallowed up in pity fur their fute. But yesterday these people were the merriest of the merry. What were they now? Waiting a rew moments, we saw the supposed bear descend the tree, and advance directly user .\u00bbTission.coml-ct~mlmanlhl.ml/patlie/patlia.hlrnl 41/122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 to the branch on which we were encamped. We bad obseiVed that the water of this branch, almost :irm:rediately upon touching the plain, was lost in the and sand, and gave no other evidence of its existence, than a rew green trees. In a rooment we saw buttons glitter on this object from the reflected g1are of the sun's rays. We were undeceived in regard to our bear, and now supposed it an Indian, decorated with a coat of the t.m:fbrtunate Frencb:rnen. We concluded to aJlow him to approach close enough to satisfY our doubts, before we fired upon him We Jay still, until he came within fair rifle distance, when to our astonishment, we discovered it to be the French captain! We instantly made ourselves known from our perch. He uttered an exc:lamation of joy, and rell prostrate on the earth. Fatigue and [88] thirst bad brought him to death's door. We raised him, and carried him to our camp. He was wounded in the head and :face with many and deep wounds, the swelling of which had given him rever. I happened to have with me some salve, which my :father gave me when I left the mines. I dressed his wounds. Having taken rood, and sated his thirst, hope returned to him. So great was his change in a fuw hours, that be was able to roove off with us that evening. In his present miserable and fOrlorn condition, I exercised too much humanity and fOrbearance to think of adverting to our quarrel of the preceding evening. Probably estimating my furbearance aright, he himself led to the subject He observed in a tone apparently of deep compunction, that if he bad bad the good sense and good temper to have listened to my apprehensions and cautions, both he and his people might have been now gaily riding over the prairies. Oppressed with mixed feelings, I hardly knew what reply to make, and only remarked, that it was too late now to la.tmnt over what was unchangeable, and that the will of God had been done. After a silence of some time, he resumed the conversation, and related all the particulars of the terrible disaster, that had come to his knowledge. His own escape he owed to retaining a pocket pisto~ when the rest of their a.nm were stacked. This he fired at an Indian approaching him, who full, and thus enabled him to. fly; not, however, until he bad received a number of severe wounds from their clubs. I had not the heart to hear him relate what became of the rest of his comrades. I could easily divine that the treacherous savages had :tiiLD\"dered every one. Feelings of deep and burning revenge arose in my bosom, and I longed fur nothing so much as to meet with these monsters on any thing like terms of equality. About sunset we could ~tinctly discern the river bottom about five miles ~tant from us. When it became dark, we descried three fires close together, which we judged to be those of savages in pursuit o1 us. Like some white peopJe, the Indians never fOrgive any persons that they have outraged and injured. We hahed, and took counse~ what [89] was to be done. We concluded that my companion and myself should leave our wounded cornpamon to take care of the horses, and go and reconnoitre the catnp, in which were these fires, and ~cover the mnnber of the Indians, and if it was great, to see bow we could be most likely to pass them unobserved. When we had arrived close to the fires, we discovered a considerable number of horses tied, and only two men guarding them We crawled still closer, to be able to discern their exact number and situation. In this way we arrived within fifty yards of their camp, and could see no one, but the two, any where in the distance. We concluded, that all the restofthe company were asleep in some place out of our view. We pres~d it would not be long befOre some of them would awake, it being now ten at night. Our intention was to take aim at them, as they should pass between us and their fire, and drop them both together. We could distinctly hear them spealcing about their horses. At length one of them called to the other, in English, to go and wake their relief guards. Words would poorly express my feelings, at hearing these beloved sounds. I sprang from my couching posture, and ran towards them They were just ready to shoot me, when I cried a friend, a friend ! One of them exclaimed, 'where in God's name did you spring from' 'You seem to have come out of the earth' The surprise and joy upon mutual recognition was great on both sides. I gave him a brief sketch of the recent catastrophe of our company, as we fullowed them to can::~p. The company was all roused and gathered round us, eagerly listening to the recital of our recent ~aster. At hearing my sad story, they expressed the hearty sorrow of good and true men, and joined us in purposes of vengeance against the Indians. We were now thirty-two in all We fired twelve guns, a signal which the wounded captain heard and understood, user .>fflssion.com'-rhJd1mlmanlhlml/patlie/pallie.h1:r'rd 42/122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narrati~.e, 1824--1830 fur he immediately joined us. We waited impatiently fur the morning. As soon as :it was bright dawn, we all funned under a genuine American leader, who could be entirely relied upon. [90] His orders were, ihat twenty should :march in :front of the pack horses, and twelve behind. In the evening we encamped within five miles of the Indian village, and made no fires. In the morning of the 31st, we examined all our arms, and twenty-six of us started to attack the village. When we had arrived close to it, we discovered most fOrtunately, what we considered the dry bed of a creek, though we afterwards discovered :it to be the okl bed of the river, that bad very high banks, and ran within a hundred yards of the village. In this bed we all funned ourselves securely and at our leisure, and marched quite near to the verge of the village without being discovered. Every man posted himseJf in readiness to fire. Two of our men were then ordered to show theJ.n.qelves on the top of the bank. They were immediately discovered by the Indians, who considered them, I imagine, a couple of the Frenchmen ihat they had :tailed to kill. They raised the yell, and ran towards the two persons, who instantly dropped down under the bank. There must have been at least 200 in pursuit. They were in a moment close on the bank. In order to prevent the escape of the two men, they spread :into a kind of circle to surround them This brought the whole body abreast of us. We allowed them to approach within twenty yards, when we gave them our fire. They commenced a precipitate retreat, we loading and firing as :fast as was in our power. They made no pause in their village, but ran off; men, wornen and children, towards a motm.tain distant 700 yards :from 1heir village. In less than ten minutes, the village was so completely evacuated, that not a human being was to be fuund, save one poor okl blind and deafindian, who sat eating his mush as unconcernedly as if all had been tranqml in the village. We did not molest him. We appropriated to our own use whatever we fuund in the village that we judged would be of any service to us. We then set fire to their wigwa.tm, and returned to our camp. They were paid a bloody price fur their treachery, fur 110 of them were slain. At twelve we returned to the village in a body, and retook all the horses of the Frenchmen, that they bad killed. [91] We 1hen undertook the sad duty ofburying the remains of the unfOrtunate Frenchmen. A sight more horrible to behoki, I have never seen. They were literally cut in pieces, and :fragm:mts of their bodies scattered in every direction, round which the monsters had danced, and yelled. We then descended the river about a mile below the village, to the point where it enters the Helay :from the north. It aftbrds as much water at this point as the HeJay. In the morning ofthe 1st ofFebruary, we began to ascend BJack river. We round it to abound with beavers. It is a most beautiful stream, bounded on each side with high and rich bottoll.l). We travelled up this stream to the point where :it forks in the mountains; ihat is to say, about 80 miles from its mouth. Here our company divided, a part ascending one furk, and a part the other. The left furk heads due north, and the right furk north east. It was my lot to ascend the latter. It heads in mountains covered with snow, near the head of the left band furk of the San Francisco. On the 16th, we all met again at the junction of the furks. The other division fuund that their furk beaded in snow covered mountains, as they supposed near the waters ofRed river. They had a1so met a tribe of Indians, who called themselves _Mokee. They futuid them no ways disposed to l1ost'Jity. From their deportment it would seem as if they had never seen white people befure. At the report of a gtm they full prostrate on the ground. They knew no other weapon of war than a sling, and with this they had so much dexterity and power, that they were able to bring down a deer at the distance of 1 00 yards. We thence returned down the HeJay, which is here about 200 yards wide, with heaVJly timbered bottoms. We trapped its whole course, from where we xret it, to its junction with Red river. The point of junction is inhabited by a tribe of Indians called Umene. Here we encamped fur the night. On the morning of the 26th, a great many of these Indians crossed the river to our camp, and brought us dried beans, fur which we paid them with red cloth, with which they were delighted beyond [92] measure, tearing it into ribbands, and tieing it round their arms and legs; fur if the truth must be told, they were as naked as Adam and Eve in their birth day suit. They were the 431122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824---1830 stoutest men, with the finest furms I ever saw, well proportioned, and as straight as an arrow. They contrive, however, to inflict upon their children an artificial defurmity. They flatten their heads, by pressing a board upon their tender scalps, which they bind fust by a ligature. This board is so large and ~ that I have seen women, when swimming the river with their children, towing them after them by a string, which they held :in their mouth. The little things neither suflered nor comp1ained, but floated behind their mothers like ducks. At twelve we started up Red river, which is between two and three hundred yards wide, a deep, bold stream, and the water at this point entirely clear. The bottoms are a mile in general width, with exceedingly hig1:l, barren cli:HS. The timber of the bottoms is very heavy, and the grass rank and high. Near the river are many small lakes, which abound in beavers. March 1st we came among a tribe oflndians, called Cocomarecopper. At sight of us they deserted their wigwams, one and all, and fled to the mountams, leaving an their e:frects at our discretion. Of course we did not meddle with any thing. Their com was knee high. We took care not to let our horses rryure it, but marched as mst as we could from their village, to deprive them of their homes [in] as little time as possible. About fuur miles above the town we encamped, and set our traps. About twelve next day it began to rain, and we pitched our tents. We had scarce kindled our fires, when 100 Indians came to our camp, all painted red in token of amity. They asked fire, and when we had given it, they went about 20 yards from us, and as the rain bad been heavy and the air coot they made a great fire, rotmd which they an huddled. We gave them the bodies of six large fut beavers, which they cooked by digging holes in the ground, at the bottom of which they kindled fires, and on the fires threw the beavers which they covered with dirt. This dainty, thus prepared they greedily devoured, entrails [93] and all. Next morning, fuarful that our guns might have experienced inconvenience from the rain, we fired them off to load them afresh They were amazed and aJarmed, to see us make, what they called thunder and 1ightrring. They were still more startled, to see the bullet holes in the tree, at which we had aimed. We made signs to them, that one baD would pass through the bodyoftwo men. Some of our menbad brought with them some scalps ofthe Papawars, the name of the tribe where our French captain lost his company. They infOrmed us that they were at war with that tribe, and begged some of the scalps to dance round. They were given them, and they began to cut their horrid anticks about it. Our traps had taken thirty beavers the Jast :rrigbt. We gave them the meat of twenty, with which present they were delighted, their gratitude inducing them to manifest a:frection to us. They ate and danced all day and most of the night. On the morning of the 3d, they left us, returning to their camps. We resumed our march, and on the 6th arrived at another village of Indians called Mohawa. When we approached their village, they were exceedingly alarmed. We marched directly through their village, the women and children screaming, and hiding themselves in their buts. We encamped about three mt1es above the VIllage. We had scarcely made our arrangements fur the night, when 100 of these Indians fOllowed us. The chiefwas a dark and sulky looking savage, and he made signs that he wanted us to give him a horse. We made as prompt signs of refusal He replied to this, by pointing first to the river, and then at the furs we had taken, intimating, that the river, with an it contained, belonged to him; and that we ought to pay him for what we had taken, by giving him a horse. When he was again refused, he raised himself erect, with a stem and fierce air, and discharged his arrow into the tree, at the same time raising his hand to his mouth, and making their peculiar yell. Our captain made no other reply, than by raising his gun and shooting the arrow, as it still stuck in the tree, in two. The chief seemed bewildered with this mark of close [94] marksmanship, and started ofl with his :men. We had no small apprehensions of a night attack from these Indians. We erected a hasty :fOrtification with logs and skins, but sufficiently high and thick, to arrest their arrows in case of attack. The night, contrary to our fuars, passed without interruption from them On the morning of the 7th, the chief returned on horse back, and :in user .lmission.com'-li\"udy'mt.rnanlhtml/patti tone again demanded a horse. The captain bade him be oft; in a ]anguage and with a tone alike understood by all people. He started off on full gallop, and as he passed one of our horses, that was tied a few yards from the camp, he fired a spear through the animal He had not the pleasure to exuh in his revenge fur more than fifty yards, befure he full pierced by fuur bullets. We could not doubt, that the Inilians would attempt to revenge the death of their chief After due consideration, we saw no better pJace in which to await their attack, than the one we now occupied. On the rear we were defended by the river, and in front by an open prairie. We made a complete breastwork, and posted spies in the limbs of the tall trees, to descry the Indians, if any approached us, while still at a distance. No Indians approached us through the day, and at night a heavy rain commenced fulling. We posted sentinels, and seemed om horses under the river bank. We kindled no fires, and we passed ilie night without annoyance. But at day break, they let fly at us a shower of arrows. Of these we took no notice. Perhaps, thinking us intimidated, they 1hen raised the war whoop, and made a charge upon us. At the distance of 150 yards we gave them a volley of rifle ba:Jk. This brought them to a halt, and a moment after to a retreat, more rapid than their advance had been We sallied out after them, and gave them the second round, which induced aD, that were not furever stopped, to :fly at the top of their speed. We had killed sixteen of their number. We returned to our camp, packed, and started, having made a determination not to allow any more Indians to enter our camp. This affitir happened on the 9th. We pushed on as rapidly as possible, fearful that these red [95] children of the desert, who appear to inherit an equal hatred of all whites, would fullow us, and attack us in the night. With tirrely warning we had no rear of them by day, but the a:ffitir of the destruction of the French company, proved that they might become funnidable roes by night. To prevent, as fur as might be, such accidents, we raised a fortification round our camp every night, until we considered ourselves out of their reach, which was on the evening of the 12th. This evening we erected no breast\u00ad work, pJaced no other guard than one person to watch our horses, and threw ourselves in careless security round our fires. We had taken very little rest fur fuur rrigbts, and being exceedingly drowsy, we had scarcely laid ourselves down, befure we were sound asleep. The Indians had still fullowed us, too filr o:ff to be seen by day, but had probably surveyed our camp each night. At about 11 o'clock this night, they poured upon us a shower of arrows, by which they killed two men, and wounded two more; and what was most provoking, fled so rapidly that we could not even give them a round. One of the slain was in bed with me. My own hunting shirt had two arrows in it, and my blanket was pinned fust to the ground by arrows. There were sixteen arrows discharged into my bed. We extinguished our fires, and it may easily be imagined, slept no more that night In the morning, eighteen of us started in pursuit of them, leaving the rest of the company to keep camp and bury our dead. We soon came upon their trail, and reached them late in the evening. They were encamped, and making ilieir supper from the body of a horse. They got sight ofus befure we were within shooting distance, and fled. We put spurs to our horses, and overtook them just as they were entering a 1hicket. Having every advantage, we killed a greater part of them, it being a division of the band t.\"iat :had attacked us. We suspemled those fr..at we r..ad killed upon the trees, and left the:ir bodies to dangle in terror to the rest, and as a proo~ how we retaliated aggression. We then retumed to our company, who had each received sufficient warning not to encamp in the territories [96] of hostile Indians without raising a breast-work round the camp. Red river at tlris point bears a north course, and a:ffurds an abundance of the finest lands. We k.illed plenty ofm:n.mtain sheep and deer, though no bears. We continued our march until the 16th, without seeing any Indians. On that day we came upon a small party, of whom the men fled, leaving a single woman. Seeing herself in our power, she began to beat her breast, and cry Cowera, Cow era ; from which we gailiered, that she belonged to that tribe. We treated her kindly, and travelled on On the 23d, we came to a village of the Shuena Indians. As we approached it, they came out and began to fire arrows upon us. We gave them in retmn a round of rifle balls. In the excitement of an attack, we Jaughed heartily to see these sons of the desert dodge, and skulk away halfbent, as though the heavens were fulling upon From 451122 511Q/13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 :manner we :in:furred, that they were in met wholly unacquainted with white people, or at least they never befure heard the report of a gun The whole establishment dispersed to the roountains, and we marched through the vffiage without seeing any inhabitants, except the bodies of those we had killed. We had received more than one lesson of caution, and we moved on with great circumspection. But so much of our time was taken up in de:funce and attacks, and furtifYing our camps, that we had little leisure to trap. In order that our grand object should not be wholly defuated, we divided our men into two companies, the one to trap and the other to keep guard. This expedient at once rendered our trapping very productive. We discovered little change in the fuce of the country. The course of the river still north, flowing through a rich valley, skirted with high mountains, the summits of which were white with snow. On the 25th we reached a small stream, emptying :into Red river through the east bank, up which we detached three men, each carrying a trap, to discover ifbeavers abounded in that stream They were to retmn the next day, while we were engaged in shoeing our horses. The next day elapsed, but none returned. We became anxious about their fute; and on the [97] 27th, started to see what had become of them At mid-day we fuund their bodies cut in pieces, and spitted befure a great fire, after the same fashion which is used in roasting beaver. The Indians who had murdered them, saw us as we ca.me on, and fled to the mountains, so that we had no chance of avenging the death of our unfurtunate companions. We gathered the :fragments of their bodies together and buried them With sadness in our hearts, and dejection on our cowtenances, we retmned to our camp, struck our tents, and marched on. The temperature in this region is rather severe, and we were wretchedly clad to encounter the cold. On the 28th, we reached a point of the river where the mountains sl:mt in so close upon its shores, that we were compelled to climb a mountain, and travel along the acclivity, the river still in sight, and at an immense depth beneath us. -Through this whole distance, which we judged to be, as the river meanders, 100 leagues, we had snow from a fuot to eighteen inches deep. The river blu:OS on the opposite shore, were never m:>re than a mile from us. It is perhaps, this very long and furmidable range of m:>untains~ which bas caused~ that this country ofRed river, bas not been more explored, at least by the Al:rerican people. A march m:>re gloomy and heart-wearing, to people hungry, poorly clad, and mourning the loss of their companions, cannot be imagined. Our horses bad picked a little herbage, and had subsisted on the bark of shrubs. Our provisions were running low~ and we expected every hour to see our horses entirely give out. April 1 Otb, we arrived where the river emerges :from these honil mountains, which so cage it up, as to deprive all human beings of the ability to descend to its banks, and make use of its waters. No mortal has the power of describing the pleasure I feh, when I could once more reach the banks of the river.-Our traps, by furnishing us beavers, soon enabled us to renew our stock of provisions. We likewise k:illed plenty of elk, and dressed their skins for clothing. On the 13th we reached another part of the river, emptying into the main river from the [98] north. Up tllls we all trapped two days. During th1r.: excars:ion we :root a band of hostile Indians, who attacked us with an unavailing discharge of arrows, of whom we killed fuur. On the 15th, we returned to the banks ofRed river, which is here a clear beautiful stream We moved very slowly, fur our beasts were too lean and worn down, to allow us to do otherwise. On the 16th we met with a large party oi the Shoshonees, a tribe of Indians fiunous fur the extent of their wanderings, and fur the number ofwhite people they had killed, by pretending friendship to them, until they fuund them disarmed, or asleep. One of our company could speak their language, from having been a prisoner am:>ng them fur a year. They were warmly clad with buffuloe robes, and they had muskets, which we knew they must have taken from the white people. We demanded of them to give up the fire 3lll'E, which they refused. On this we gave them our :fire, and they fled to the m:>untains, leaving their, women and children in our power.- We had no disposition to molest them We Narratiw, 1824--1830 WOilleD, that they had recently destroyed a company of French hunters on the head waters of the Platte. We fuund six of their yet fresh scalps, which so exasperated us, that we hardly refrained from killing the women. We took from them all the beaver skins which they bad taken from the slain French, and five of their mules, and added to our provisions their stock of dried buflhloe meat. We had killed eight of their Il1eD, and we m:ntified the women excessively, by compelling them to exchange the sca]ps of the l.Il1furtunate Frenc:hri\"IDn fur those of their own people. We resumed our march, and ascended the river to the point where it rorked again, neither furk being rmre than from twenty-five to thirty yards wide. On the 19th, we began to ascend the right band furk, which pursues a N. E. course. On the 23d, we arrived at the chief village of the N abahoes, a tribe that we knew to be :friendly to the whites. We enquired of them, if we coukl cross the Rocky Mountains best at the head of this furk or the other; and they infOrmed us, that the rmuntains [99] were impassable, except by fOllowing the left band furk. Knowing that they were at war with the Shoshonee, we let them know how many of them we had killed. With this they were delighted, and gave us eight horses, one fur each man we had slain. They sent with us, moreover, ten Indians to point out to us the route, in which to cross the n:x:n:mtains. On the 25th, we started up the left hand furk, and arrived on the 30th, in the country of the Pewee tribe, who are friendly to the Nabahoes. Their chief village is situated within two days' travel of the low gap, at which we were to cross the mountains, at which gap we arrived on the first ofMay. The crossing was a work, the difficuhy of which may be imagined from the nature of the case and the character of the :mountains.- The passage occupied six days, during which we had to pass along compact drifts of snow, higher than a man on horseback. The narrow path through these drifts is made by the frequent passing ofbufihloes, ofwhich we round many dead bodies in the way. We had to pack cotton-wood bark on the horses fur their own eating, and the wood necessary to make fires fur our cooking. Nothing is to be seen among these mountains, but bare peaks and perpetual snow. Every one knows, that these :mountains divide between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. At the point where we crossed them, they run in a direction a little north of west, and south of east, further than the eye can reach. On the 7th, we struck the south furk of the Platte, near Long's Peak, and descended it five days. We then struck across the plain to the main Platte, on which we arrived on the 16th. In descending it we futmd the beavers scarce, fur all these rivers had been thoroughly trapped. The river is skirted with only a rew small willows, and the country is open prairie, entirely destitute of trees. We saw :immense droves of elk, buffuloes, and white bears, which haunt the butfuloe range to prey upon those noble animals. We bad the merriest sport imaginable, in chasing the buffitloes over these perfectly level plains, and shooting them with the arrows we had taken from the Indians [100] we had killed. I have killed myself; and seen others kill a buffilloe, with a single shot of an arrow. The bows are made with ribs ofbufialoes, and drive the arrows with prodigious furce. On the 20th, we left this river and started fur the Big Horn, a furk of the Yellow Stone, itself a considerable river oftbe Missouri We reached the Big Hom on the 31st, and round but rew beavers. June 2d, we struck over towards the main Yellow Stone, and on the 3d entered the country of the Flat Heads, who were entirely friendly. We purchased some furs of them They are Indians oi exceedingly bandsom:: furms, were it not fur the horrid defunnity of their heads, which are transversely from ear to ear but a :fuw inches in diameter, and in the other direction monstrous, giving them the appearance of wearing a military cap with all its plumage. This plumage is furnished by their matted tresses ofhair, painted and skewered up to a high point. This monstrosity is occasioned by binding two pieces ofboard on each side of the bead of the new\u00ad born infunt, which is kept secure with bandages, until the child is three years old, at which time the head bones have acquired a firmness to retain their then shape during lire. On the 11th, we reached the Yellow Stone, and ascended it to its head; and thence crossed the ridges ofthe Rocky Mmmtains to Clarke's fork of the Columbia. But all these streams had been so much trapped, as to yield but hundred yards wide, a bold, clear, pleasant stream, rerrmkable fur the m.m:Der and excellence of its fish, and most beautiful country of furtile :land on its shores. We ascended this river to its head, which is in Long's Peak, near the head waters of the Platte. We thence struck our course for the head waters of the Arkansas, on which we arrived July 1st. Here we met a band of the Grasshopper Indians, who derive their name from gathering grasshoppers, drying them, and pulverizing them, with the meal of which they make TI11.1Sh and bread; and this is their chief article of fuod. They are so little improved, as not even to have furnished themselves with [ 1 01] the mean.:; of killing buffitloes. At sight of us, these poor two-legged animals, dodged into the high grass like so tmny partridges. We marched up 11ris stream, trapping fur the rew beavers which it afibrded. Its banks are scantily timbered, being only skirted with a fuw willows. On the 5th, we met a war party of the Black Foot Indians, all well mounted. As soon as they saw us, they came fiercely upon us, yelling as though the spirit of darkness bad loaned them the voices of all his tenants. We dismounted, and as soon as they were within shooting distance, we gave them our fire, which they promptly returned. The contest was fierce fur something more tban 20 minutes, a part of the titne not more than 50 yards apart. They then retreated, and we mounted our horses, and gave them chase, though unavailingly, fur their horses were as fleet as the wind, compared with ours. We soon desisted from so useless a pursuit, and returned to the battle grmmd. We fuund sixteen Blackfeet dead, and with infinite anguish, counted fuur of our own companions weltering in their blood. We buried them with sorrowful hearts, and eyes full of tears. Ah! Among those who live at home, surrounded by llllln:rrous relations and :friends, in the midst of repose, plenty and security, when one of the number droops, and dies with sickness or age, his removal leaves a chasm that :is not filled fur years. Think how we must have mourned these brave men, who had shared so many dangers, and on whose courage and a:id we had every day relied fur protection. Here on these retrote plains, fur from their friends, they had :fallen by the bloody arrow or spear of these red, barbarous Isbmaelites of the desert, but neither mwept nor unrevenged. Having perfurmed the sad task of depositing the bodies of these once warm hearted :friends in the clay, we ascended to the head ofth:is river, and crossed the mountain that separates its waters from those of the Rio del Norte, which river we struck on the 20th. We began to descend it, and on the 23d met a band of the Nabahoes, who accompanied us [102] quite to their chiefvillage. It will be seen, that an these streams upon which we have been trapping, rise :from sources which interlock with each other, and the same range of peaks at very short distances from each other. These furm the heads ofRed river of the east, and the Colorado of the west, Rio del Norte, Arkansas, Platte, Yellow Stone, Missouri and Columbia. The village ofthese Indians :is d:istant 50 miles from the Rio del Norte. We remained at it two days, and rested our horses, and refreshed ourselves. This tribe some years since bad been at war with the Spanish, during which they plundered them of great numbers of horses, mules and cattle, which caused that they bad now large stocks of these animals, together with flocks of sheep. They ra:ise a great abundance of grain, and manu:facture their wool rruch better than the Spanish. On the first of August we arrived at Santa Fe, with a fine amount of :furs. Here disaster awaited us. The Governor, on the pretext that we bad trapped without a license from him, robbed us of an our furs. We were excessively provoked, and bad it not been from a sense of duty to our own beloved country, we would have redressed our wrongs, and retaken our furs with our own arn::rs. Here I remained until the 18th, disposing of a part of my goods, and reserving the rerrninder fur a trip which I contemplated to the province of Sonora. I bad the pleasure once more of receiving the a:trectionate greeting of Jacova, who gave me the most earnest counsels to quit tb:is dangerous and rambling way oflifu, and settle myself down in a house of my own. I thanked her for her kindness and good counse~ and promised to follow it, after rambling another year in the wilderness.- Thence I went to the mines, where I bad the inexpressible sat:isfuction again to embrace my dear :father, whom I fuund in perfuct health, and making money rapidly. I retmined there three days, and, accompanied with one servant, arrived in Hanas on the first of September. Th:is :is a small town situated 4a/122 5119113 Pal:!ie's Personal Narralhe, 1824--1830 in the province of Biscay, between the province of Sonora and New Mexico, in a directionS. W. from the copper mines. [103] The country is generally of that character, denominated in Kentucky, barren. The soil is level and black. These people raise a great quantity of stock, such as horses, cows, sheep and goats. Their fimning imple:rnents are clu:rmy and indiflererrt. They use oxen entirely in their agriculture. Their ploughs are a straight piece of timber, five feet long and eight inches thick, mortised fur two other pieces of timber, one to be fitted to the beam, by which the oxen draw, and another to the handle, by which the man holds the plough. The point that divides the soil, is of wood, and hewed sloping to such a point, that a hollow piece of iron is fastened on it at the end. This is one inch thick, and three inches broad at top, and slopes also to a point. Their hoes, axes and oilier tools are equally indifferent; and they are precisely in such a predicament, as might be expected of a people who have oo saw mills, no labor saving machinery, and do every thing by dint ofbard labor, and are withal very indolent and unenterprising. I amused myself at times with an okl man, who daily fell in my way, who was at once rich and to the last degree a miser; and yet devotedly atmched to the priests, who were akme able to get a 1itt1e money out of him He often spoke to me about the unsafeness of my religion. Instead of meeting his remarks with an argument, I generally affi'onted him at once, and then diverted myself with his ways of showing his anger. I tokl him that his priest treated him as the Spanish hostlers do their horses. He asked me to explain the comparison. I observed, 'you know how the hostler in the first place throws his lasso over the n:rule's neck. That secures the body of the beast. Next the anirml :is b1indfukled. That hinders his seeing where he is led. Next step he binds the saddle safe and :fust Then the holy father rigs his heeJs with spurs. Next come spur and 1asb, and the animal is now restive to oo purpose. There is no shaking off the rider. On he goes, till the arrimal tm.der him dies, and boili go to hell together!' At this he flew into such a violent rage, as to nm at me with his knife. I dodged out of his [1 04] way~ and appeased him by convincing him that I was in jest The rich, in their way of living, unite singular contrasts of magnificence and meanness. For instance, they have rew of the useful articles of our dining and tea sets, but a great deal of massive silver plate, and each guest a silver furk and spoon. The dining room is contiguous to the kitchen. A window is thrown open, and the cook hands a large dish through the window to a servant, who bears it to the tab1e. The entertainer he]ps himself first, and passes the dish mtmd to all the guests. Then another and another is brought on, often to 1he nt.mi:Jer of sixteen. All are savored so strong with garlic and red pepper, that an American at first cannot eat them The meat is boiled to such a consistency that a spoon manages it better than a knife. At 1he close of the dinner they bring in wine and cigars, and they sit and smoke and drink wine until drowsiness steals upon them, and they go to bed fur their siesta. They sleep until three in the afternoon, at which time the church bell tolls. They rise, take a cup of chocolate, and handle the wine freely. This short affuir over, 1hey return and sit down on the shaded side of the house, and chHtt..er bke so many geese till :night, when they divide, a part to mass, and a part to the card table, where I have seen the poor, betting their shirts, hats and shoes. The village contains 700 souls. On the 6th, I departed :from 1his town, travelling a west course through a most beautiful country, the plains of which were covered with domestic animals rumring wild. On the 8th I arrived at the root of the mom1tain, that divides the province ofSooora from Biscay. I slept at a country seat, where they were making whiskey of a kind of plantain, of which I have spoken before, which they called Mascal (Maguey). Here were assembled great nt.mi:Jers oi Spaniards and Indians. They were soon drunk, and as a matter of course, fighting with knives and clubs. In the morning, two Spaniards and one Indian were fuund dead. Late in the rooming, a file of soldiers arrived~ and took the suspected TilW\"derers to prison 491122 511QI13 Pattie's Personal Narrati-.e, 1824--1830 In morning I commenced climbing the mountain befure [1 05] me, and in the evening arrived at a small town in Sonoro, called Barbisca; situated on the bank of a most beautiful little stream, called Iago, which ~charges itsetl into the Pacific ocean, near the harbor ofY rrrus. Its banks are not much timbered, nor is the soil uncomrmnly good. The morning of the 9th was a great religious festival, or fiunous Saint's day, which collected a vast crowd of people. After breakfust and mass, the image of the virgin Mary was paraded round the public square in solemn procession, during which there was a constant crash of carmon and small arms. Then an o1d priest headed a procession, bearing the image of Christ, nailed to a cross. After these :in:Rges were returned to their church, they brought into a square enclosure, strongly fenced fur that purpose, a wild bull, which they threw down, tied and sharpened its horns. The tops of the houses were all covered with people to see the spectacle that was perfunning. The bull was covered with red cloth, and two tren entered the enclosure, each holding in the right hand a bundle of sky rockets, and in the left a red handkerchief The rockets were lashed to a stick a fuot long, in the end of which was a small naiJ, a half an inch long, with a beard at the end, like that of a fish hook. They then untied the fierce animal No sooner was he on his reet, than he sprang at one ofbis assailants, who avoided his attack, by dextrously slipping aside, and as the animal darted by him, stuck in his neck two small rockets, one on each side. The other assailant then gave a sharp whistle to draw the infuriated animal upon him. The bull snorted and dashed at him He dodged the animal in the same manner, as the other had done, and left sticking :in his furehead, as he passed, a garland of artificial flowers, made of paper, beautifuily cut and painted, and 1arge enough to cover his whole furehead. In this way they kept alternately driving him this way and that, sticking rockets in him as he dashed by them, until he was covered with eight or ten, clinging to his neck and shoulders. They then touched the crackers with a lighted match. Words would not paint the hull's expressions ofrage and terror, as he bounded round the enclosure, covered with fire, [106] and the rockets every moment ~charging like fire arms. After this, a man entered with a small sword. The buD beDowed and darted at him As the bull dropped his head to toss him, he set his feet upon the horns, and :in a twinkling, thrust his sword between the shoulder blades, so as to touch the spinal marrow. The animal dropped as dead as a stone. The drum. and :fifu then struck up, as a signal fur the horsetren to cotre and carry off the dead anima~ and bring :in a fresh one. All this was conducted with incredible dispatch. In this way seven bulls were successively tortured to death, by rootl.ren After tbis, fuur men entered on horseback, equipped with spears :in the shape of a trowe~ and a handle fOur fuet long. With this spear in the one hand, and a noose :in the other, they gallopped round the buD. The bull :imrrediately made at the horsemen passing him, who moved just at such a pace, as not to allow the bull to toss the horse. The horseman then couched his spear backwards, so as to lay it on the buD's neck. The bull instantly reared and tossed, and in the act furced the spear between his fure shoulders, so as to hit the spinal marrow. Iftbe spear is laid rightly, and the animal makes his accustomed motions, he drops instantly dead. But to do this requires infinite dexterity and fearlessness. If the man be chunsy, or of weak-nerves, he is apt to fuil in couching the spear right, in which case, as a matter of course, the horse is gored, and it is ten to one that the man is slain. In this way fourteen bulls were killed, and with them, five horses and one man, during this festival At night commenced gambling and card playing, and both as fiercely pursued as the bull fighting. This great reast lasted three days, during which, as the people were in a very purchasable ln:nn:Jr, I sold a number ofhundred dollar's worth of my goods. On the morning of the 12th, I left this place, and in the evening arrived at a small town called Vassarac, and remained there one day. The country in the vicinity is well timbered and very hilly. The woods are full of wild cattle and horses. On the 13th, I travelled through a fine rich country, abounding with cattle, and arrived :in the evening at a town called Tepac, [107] situated on a small creek, near a mountain, :in which there is a go1d mine worked by the Iago Indians, a nation furmerly under the protection of an old priest. He attempted to practice some new imposition upon them, and they killed him some years ago. On this the Spaniards made war upon them, and the conflict was continued some years. They lost the best and bravest ofthe:ir men, and the remnant were obliged to submit to such user.>fl'ission.c:om'-ctud}l'rnlmanlhtmlfpattie/pattia.h1ml 50/122 5119f13 Pattie's Personal Narrati~Ae, 1824--1830 terms as the Spaniards saw fit to impose. They were e:i:lher condel1'11led to the mines, or to raise rood fur those who wrought them I remained in this town three days, and purchased gold in bars and Jmnps of the Indians, at the rate often dollars per ounce. The diggings seldom exceed twenty feet in depth. Most of the gokl is fuund on the surface after hard rains. Their mode of extracting the gold from the earth with which it is mixed, or the stone in which it is imbedded, is this. The stone is pulverised or ground, still keeping the matter wet. It is carefully mixed with mercury, and kneaded w:i:lh the bands, until the water is separated from the mass, and the mercury is perfectly incorporated with it. This process is repeated, until the water runs off perfectly clear. They then grind or tri.tw.-ate the mass anew until all the particles of earthy' matter are washed away. The remaining matter is amalgam, of the color of silver, and the consistency of nmsh. They then put it into a wet deer s~ and strain the mercury by pressure through the pores o1 the skin. The gold is left, still retaining enough mercury to give it the color of silver. The coarse way of managing it afterwards, is to put it in the fire, and evaporate all the mercury from it, and it is then pure virgin gold. There is a tmre artificial way of managing it, by which the mercury is saved. This province would be among the richest of the Mexican country, if it were inhabited by an enlightened, enterprising and industrious people. Nothing can exceed the indolence of the actual inhabitants. The only point, :in which I ever saw them dispJay any activity, is in throwing the Jasso, and in horsemanship. In this I judge, they surpass all other people. Their great [108] business and con:nmn pursuit, is in noosing and taming wild horses and cattle. On the 15th, I left this place and travelled through a country well timbered and watered, though the land is too broken to be cultivated, and in the evening arrived in a town called V arguacha. This is a pJace miserably poor, the people being both badly red and clothed. But their indolence alone is in fault. The land in the immediate vicinity o1 the town is good, and the woods teem with wild cattle. But they are too lazy to provide more meat than will serve them from day to day, On the 17th I continued my course through a beautiful country, thinly settled by civilized Indians, who raise sugar cane and abundance of stock. They are obviously more enterprising and industrious than the Spaniards. Approaching the shore of the great Pac:i:fic, I fuund the country 1mre level and better settled. Some rich and noble sugar :furms lay in my view. On the 22d I arrived in Patoka, which is a considerable town, and the capital of this province. It is two days travel hence to Y mus. The people here seemed to me more enlightened, and to have a higher air of civilization than any I had seen in the whole country. It probably results from the intercourse they have w:i:lh foreigners, from their vicinity to the Pacific. Most of them are dressed in the stile of the A.tmrican people. Their houses are much better furnished, and the furmers are supplied with superior funning utensils, compared w:i:lh any thing I saw in the interior. The chief manu:filctures are soap and sugar, the latter of an inrerior quality, I imagine, in consequence of the clumsy 1mde of manu:fucturing it. From the port ofYrrms they also export considerable quantities of tallow and hides, for which the :furmers are repaid in merchandize at an enormous advance. A great many horses and miles are driven from the interior to this port. Many also are taken to the American states. The price of miles in this province is from three to fuur dollars a head. I remained here until I had disposed of all my goods. On the 26th, I left this town, and travelled on to port Y rnus, at which [1 09] I arrived on the 28th, and first saw the waters of the vast Pac:i:fic. I spent a day here on board an American ship, the master of which was surprised at the account I gave of myself; and wouJd hardly believe that I had travelled to this place from the United States. I was equally a~d at hearing him reJate the disasters which had befhllen him at sea. On the 29th, I left this port, and travelled a N. W. course, through a country full oi 51/122 5/1Q/13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 :inhabitants, and abounding in every species of fruit. Snow never fuDs, ahhough the general temperature is not so wann but that woollen garments may be wom To add to its advantages, :it is very healthy. On the 7th of October, I arrived at a town caTied Oposard. The popu1ation amounts to about 8000 souls. I here became acquainted with one of my own countrymen, married to a Spanish woman. He infOrmed me, that he had been in this country thirty years, eight of which he bad spent in pmon. The sulfurings he endured from the Spaniards were incredible; and I :internally shuddered, as he related, lest I, in travelling through the country might full into similar rnisfurtunes. As some palliation oftheir cruehy, he observed, that he was made prisoner at the period when the revolution was just commencing in that country. At tbat time the Inquisition was still in furce, and committed many a poor mortal to the flames, fur his alleged heresy. He assured :m.'), that he should have met the same fute, had he not become a member of their church. He afterwards married a :lady, who had gained his affuctions by being kind to him in pmon I remained with this man two days, and on the third resumed my journey, travelling an easterly course, and part of the time over a very rough country. I met no inhabitants, but Indians, who were urrifurmJy friendly. On the 1Oth, I arrived at the mines ofCarrocha, which were in the province of Chihuahua, situated between two mountains, and considered the richest silver mines in New Mexico. There are about 800 miners working this mine, and they have advanced mder gromd at least half a mile. On the 12th, I started fur the capita~ and reached :it on the 16th, passing over great 1racts of good and bad land, all [110] untilled, and most ofit an uninhabited wilderness. This city :5 the next largest inN ew Mexico. It :5 the largest and handsomest town I had ever seen, though the buildings are not so neat and well arranged as in our country. The room are :Oat, the walls well painted, and the streets kept very clean. Here they sme1t and matll.l.fucture copper and silver, and several other metals. They have also a mint. The ter.rm of their currency are very difrerent from ours. They count eight rials, or sixteen fuur pence halfpennies, to the dollar. Their merchandize :5 packed from Ymus, or Mexico. I have heard much talk about the Splendid churches in th:5 city. It is fur others, who think much of such immense buildings, wrung from the Jabors ofihe poor, to describe them For my part, having said :it is a 1arge and clean town, I present a result of their institutions and :rmrmers, which I considered the lJDre important sort of infurmation During a stay of only three days here, ten dead bodies were brought into town, of persons who had been murdered in the night. Part of the lli.Ulber were supposed to have been killed on account of having been known to carry a great deal of 11Dney with them, and part to have had a quarrel about so~re abandoned women. This last is a most common occasion of night murders, the people being stillmore addicted to jealousy, and mder still less restraints of law, than in old Spain, in the cities of which, assassinations from th:5 cause are notoriously frequent. I asked my :in:ID1.111a11t touching these matters, if there was no pofue in the city? He answered, that the furrm of the law were C01Jl'lete, and that they had a numerous guard, and that :it was quite as likely they committed the murders 1:b.eJ:J:Eelves, as not. I came to the same conclusion, fur in a small and regu1ar city like this, :it was impossible that so m!.Ltty guards, pm-adirt_g the streets by night, should not be aware of the commission of such deeds, and acquainted with the perpetrators. No inquest of any sort was held over the bodies. They were, however, paraded through the streets to beg money to pay the priests for performing fimeral rites at their burial This excited in me [ 111] still more disgust, than the murders. I expressed myself in consequence, witl1 so much freedom, in regard to this sort oi miserable imposition, as to give great offence to my host, who, like most of the people, was rigidly devoted to the religion of the church. On the evening of 16th, I left this city, and travelled through a fine country, thickly inhabited by shepherds, who live in stmll towns, and possess a vast abundance of stock. It :5 well watered, but thinly timbered. The most magnificent part of the spectacle is presented in the lofty snow covered mountains, that rise fur in the distance, and have their smnmits lost in the clouds, glistening in indescribable brilliance in the rays of the ming and setting sun. user .>frission.coml-clr~rntmanJhlml/pattie/pattie.hlml 521122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narraliw, 1824--1830 The road at this time was deemed to be full of robbers, and very dangerous. I was so furtunate as to meet with none. On the 18th, I arrived at a small town, called San Bueneventura, which is surrounded with a wall. In filet, most of the considerabJe villages are walled. They are called in Spanish, Presidio, the Engljsh of which is, a garri'!lon. In the furenoon, I crossed a small river called Rio Grande, and travelled down this stream all day, the banks oi which were thickly settled, and in high cultivation, with wheat, com and barley. On the 22d, I arrived at a village called Casas Grandes, or the Great Houses? On the 23d, I pursued an east course towards Passo del Norte, situated on the banks of the Rio del Norte. I travelled over a very rough country with some high mountains, inhabited by a wandering tribe of the Appache Indians, that live by seizing their opportunities for robbery and muder among the Spaniards, riding off upon the stolen horses, to 1he obscure and ahnost inaccessible fustnesses of their mountains, where they subsist upon the stolen horseflesh. I know not, whether to call the Passo del Norte, a settlement or a town. It is in filet a kind of continued village, extending eight miles on the river. Fronting this large group of houses, is a nursery of the fruit trees, of almost all countries and climes. It has a length of eight miles and a breadth of nearly three. I was struck with the magnificent vineyards of this place, :from[l12] which are made great quantities of delicious wine. The wheat fieJds were equally beautifu], and the wheat of a kind I never saw befure, the stalks genera.lly yieJding two heads each. The land is exceedingly rich, and its :furtility increased by irrigation. On the 28th, I started fur the Copper mines, wrought by my futber. This day my course led me up the del Norte, the bottoms of which are exceedingly rich. At a very short distance from the Passo, I began to come in contact with grey bears, and other wild animals. At a very little distance on either side are high and ragged m:nmtains, entirely sterile of all vegetation. I had no encounter with the bears, save in one instance. A bear exceedingly hungry, as I suppose, came upon my horses as I was resting them at mid-day, and :made at one of them I repaid him fur his impudence by shooting him through the brain. I made a most delicious dinner of the choice parts of his flesh. My servant would not touch it, his repugnance being shared by great numbers in his condition. It is fuunded on the notion, that the bear is a sort of degenerated man, and especially, that the ent:ra:iJs are exactly like those ofhurm.n beings. On 1he 30th, I struck off from the del Norte, and took my course fur the Copper mines directly over the mountains, among which we toiled onward, subsisting by what we packed with us, or the product of the rifle, until the 11th of N overnber, when I had once more the satisiaction of embracing my mther at the Copper mines. He was in perfect health, and delighted to see me again. He urged me so earnestly to remain with him, though a stationary lifu was not exactly to my taste, that I consented from a sense of filial duty, and to avoid irq:lortunity. I remained here until the first of December, amusing myself sometimes by hunting, and sometimes by working in the gold mine, an employment in which I took much pleasure. In a hunting excursion with a companion who was an American, he one morning saw fit to start out of bed, and commence his hunt while I was yet asJeep in bed. He had scarcely advanced a league, befure he killed a deer on the top of a high ridge. He was so inadvertent, as to commence skinning the anima~ befure [ 113] he bad re-loaded his rille. Thus engaged, he did not perceive a bear with her cubs, which bad advanced within a :fuw reet ofbim. As soon as he saw bis approaching companion, without coveting any further acquaintance, he left deer and rifle, and ran fur his lifu. He stopped not, until he arrived at the mines. The bear full to work fur a meal upon the deer, and did not pursue him We immediately started back to have the sport ofhunting this animal As we approached the ridge, where he had killed the deer, we discovered the bear descending the ridge towards us. We each of us chose a position, and his was behind a tree, which he coukl mount, :in case he wounded, without killing her. This most ferocious and terrible anima~ the grizzly or grey bear, does not climb at all I chose my place opposite him, behind a 531122 5'19113 Pattie's PersOI\"'a! Narratiw, 1824--1830 large rock, which happened to be near a precipice, that I bad not observed. Our agreemmt was to wait until she came within 30 yards, and then he was to give her the first fire. He fired, but the powder being damp, his gun made long fire, whence it happened that he shot her too low, the ball passing through the belly, and not a roortal part. She made at him in terrible rage. He sprang up his tree, the bear close at his heels. She con:nnenced biting and scratching the tree, making, as a Kentuckian would phrase it, the lint fly. But finding 1hat she could not bite the tree down, and being in an agony of pain, she turned the course of her attack, and came growling and tearing up the bushes befure her, towards me. My companion bade me lie still, and my own purpose was to wait until I could get a close fire. So I waited until the horrible animal was within six reet of me. I took true aim at her head. My gun :flashed in the pan. She gave one growl and sprang at me with her 1nouth open. At two strides I leapt down the unperceived precipice. My jaw bone was split on a sharp rock, on which my chin s1ruck at the bottom Here I lay senseless. When I regained recollection, I round my companion had bled me with the point of his butcher knife, and was sitting beside me with his hat full of water, bathing my head and mce. It was perhaps an hour, befure I gained full recollection, [114] so as to be ab1e to walk. My companion bad cut a considerable orifice in my arm with his knife, which I deemed rather supererogation; fur I judged, that I had bled sufficiently at the chin When I bad come entirely to :myself; my companion proposed that we should finish the campaign wi1h the bear. I, fur my part, was satisfied with what had already been done, and proposed to retreat. He was importunate, however, and I consented. We ascended the ridge to where he had seen the bear lie down in the bushes. We fixed our guns so that we thought ourselves sure of their fire. We then climbed two trees, near where the bear was, and made a noise, that brought her out of her :lair, and caused her to spring fiercely towards our trees. We fired together, and killed her dead. We then took after the cubs. They were three in mnnber. My companion soon overtook them They were of the size of the largest rackoons. These imps of the devil turned upon him and made fight. I was in too much pain and weakness to assist him. They put him to all he could do to clear himself of them He at length got away from them, leaving them masters of the field, and having acquired no roore laurels than I, from my combat with my buffuloe calf His legs were deeply bit and scratched~ and what was worse, such was the character of the affuir, he only got ridicule fur his assault of the cubs. I was several weeks in recovering, during which time, I ate neither meat nor bread, being able to swallow nothing but liquids. The country abounds with these fierce and temble animals, to a degree, that in some districts they are truly furrnidable. They get into the com :fields. The owners hear the nome, which they make among the com, and supposing it occasioned by cows and horses that have broken into the :fiekis, they rise from their beds, and go to drive them out, when instead of finding retreating domestic animals, they are assailed by the grizzly bear. I have been acquainted wi1h several futal cases of that sort. One of them was a case, that :intimate]y concerned me. Iago, my servant, went out with a man to get a load of [115] wood. A bear came upon this man and killed him and his ass in the team A slight flight of snow bad fallen. Some Spaniards, who bad witnessed the miserable fate oftheir COll.IJ!aition, begged some of us to go and aid them in killing the bear. Four of us joined them We trailed the bear to its den, which was a crevice in the blufE We came to the mouth and :fired a gun. The anima], confident :in his fierceness, came out, and we instantly killed it. This occurred inN ew Mexico. This stationary and unruffied sort of :l:i:fe had become tmendurab:Je, and with fifteen Americans, we arranged a trapping expedition on the Pacos. My mther viewed my rambling propensities with stem displeasure. He had taken in a Spanish superintendent, who acted as clerk. This person bad lived in the United States from the age of 18 to 30, and spoke English, French and Spanish. This man arranged the calculations, and kept the accounts of my mther's concerns, and had always acted with :intelligence and fl.delity. The concern was on the whole prosperous; and although I feh deep sorrow to leave my mther against his wishes, I had at :least the satE:taction to know, that I was of no other use to him, than giving him the pleasure of my society. 541122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrali\\e, 1824--1830 On the 7th, our company arrived on fue del Norte, and crossed it in the evening to fue eastern shore. On the evening of the 8fu, we struck fue Pacos about twenty miles above its junction with the del Norte. 'Tim day's 1rave] was through a wild and precipitous country, inhabited by no human being. We killed plenty ofbears and deer, and caught some beavers. On fue 9th, we began to ascend the river furough a rich and delightful plain, on which are to be seen abundance of deserted sheep fulds, and horse pens, where the Spanish vachers once kept fueir stock. The constant incursions of the Ind.ians compelled this peaceful people to desert these fair plains. Their deserted cottages inspired a melancholy feeling. This river nms from N. E. to S. W. and is a clear, beautiful stream, 20 yards wide, with high and dry bottoms of a black and rich soil The mountains run almost parallel to the river, and at the distance of [116] eight or ten miles. They are thickly covered with noble pme furests, in which aspen trees are intermixed. From their fuot gush out many beautiful clear springs. On fue whole, this is one of fue loveliest regions fur ~rs fuat I have ever seen, though no permanent settlements could be made there, until the murderous Indians, who Jive in the mounmins, should be subdued. We advanced slowly onward, until the 15th, without meeting any Indians. At day break of this day, om sentinels apprized us, that savages were at hand. We had just time to take shelter behind fue trees, when they began to let fueir arrows fly at us. We returned them the compliment with ba11s, and at the :first shot a number of them full. They rermined firm and continued to pom in their arrows from every side. We began to find :it exceedingly difficult to dodge them, though we gave them some rounds befure any one of our men was struck. At length one man was pierced, and they rushed futward to scalp him I darted from behind my tree to prevent them I was assailed by a perfect shower of arrows, which I dodged fur a moment, and was then struck down by an arrow in the b:ip. Here I should have been instantly killed, had not my companions made a joint fire at the Indians, who were rushing upon me, by which a number of them were 1aid dead. But the agony of my pain was insupportable, fur the arrow was sti11 fust in my hip. A momentary cessation of their mows enabled me to draw out the mow from my hip, and to commence re-loading my gun. I had partly accomplished this, when I received another arrow under my right breast, between the bone and the flesh. This gave me less pain than the other shot, and finding I could not by any effurt extract the arrow, I snapped it off; and finished loading my gun. The Indian nearest me fell dead, and I hobbled off; g]ad to be once m:>re sheltered by a tree. My companions were not slow in making their rifles crack, and in raising mutual cheers of encol.U'age:ment. The Indians were vastly om superiors in numbers, and we fuund it convenient to slip under the river bank. We were now complete]y sheltered [117] from their arrows. After we bad gained this security, they stood but a few shots more, befure they fled, leaving their dead and wm.mded at our mercy. Truth is, we were too rmch exasperated to show mercy, and we cut off the heads of aD, indiscriminate]y. 551122 OUr bu wu one ~ and two wo1.Ulded., another beside ~though neither ofw; ~.

Never had I seen such frantic leaps and gestures of joy. The screatnS and yells of exultation were such as cannot be imagined. It seemed as though a whole bedlam had broke bose. When we told them that we had hst but one man, their screams became more frantic still. Their medicine man was then called, and he produced an emollient poultice, the materials of which I did not know but the e:trect was that the anguish of our wounds was at once assuaged. By the application of this same remedy, my wounds were quite healed in a furtnight. The scalps, which some of our number had taken from the Muscallaros, were soon erected on a pole by the N abahoes. They it.mlediately commenced the fiercest dancing and singing I had yet seen, which continued without interruption three days and nights. During all this tiln!, we endured a sort of worship from them, particularly the women. They were constantly presenting us with their favorite dishes, served in diflerent ways, with dried berries and sweet vegetables, so:rne of which, to people in our condition, were really agreeable. In size and complexion 1hese people resemble the Muscallaros, and their bows and arrows are similar; though some ofthe latter have fire arms, and their dress is rrmch superior.- [119] Part of their dress is of the same kind with tltat of the furmer, though the skins are dressed in a more workmanlike manner, and they have plenty ofblankets of their own maiii.lfacturing, and constituting a much better article than tltat produced by the Spaniards. They dye the wool of difrerent and bright colors, and stripe them with very neat figures. The women are much handsomer, and have lighter complexions than the men. They are rather stmn in stature, and n:ndest and reserved in their behaviour. Their dress is chiefly composed of skins made up with no small share of taste; and showily corded at the bottom, funning a kind belt ofbeads and porcupine quills.-They are ahogether the handsmrest women I have seen among the red people, and not inferior in appearance to many Spanish wmren. Their deportment to our people, was a mixture ofk:indness and respect On the 21st, we started back to the river, accompanied by the whole party ofNabahoes, who assured us that they would guard us during the remainder of our hunt. We returned to the river through a beautiful and level country, most of it well timbered and watered. On our return we killed several bears, the talons of which the Indians took fur necklaces. On the 26th, we arrived at our battle ground. 'The view of the bodies of the slain, an tom in pieces by wild beasts, inexpressibly disgusting to us, was equally a spectacle of pleasure to our red friends. We pointed out the grave of our companion. They an walked in solerm procession round it, singing their fimeral songs. As they left it, every one left a present on the grave; some an arrow, others meat, moccasins, tobacco, war-feathers, and the like, all articles of varue to them These simple people believe tltat the spirit of the deceased will have immediate use fur them in the lire to co:rne. Viewing their o:trerings in this light, we could not but be a:frected with these testimonies of kind reeling to a dead stranger. They then gathered up the remains of their slaughtered enemies, threw 1hem in a heap, and cut a great quantity of wood, which they piled over the remains. They then set fire to the wood. We struck our tents, [120] marched about five miles up the river, set our traps, and encamped fur the night. But the N abahoes danced and yelled through the night to so much ef:Iect, as to keep all the beavers shut up in their houses, for, having been recently trapped, they were exceeding1y cautious. On the morning of the 27th, we :infu~d them why we had taken no beavers, and during the fullowing night they were perfectly quiet We marched onward sbwly, trapping as we went, until we reached the Spanish settlements on this river. On New Year's eve, January 1st, 1827, the Spaniards ofthe place gave a fandango, or Spanish ball. All our company were invited to it, and went. We appeared befure the Alcalde, dad not unlike our Indian friends; that m to say, we were dressed in deer skin, with leggins, moccasins and hunting shirts, all of this article, with the addition of the customary Indian article of dress around the loins, and this was of red cloth, not an article of which had been washed since we left the Copper Mines. It may be imagined that we did not cut a particular dandy-like 57/122 5/19/13 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824--1830 figure, among people, many of whom were rich, and would be considered well dressed any where. Notwithstanding this, it is a strong proof of their politeness, that we were civilly treated by the ladies, and had the pleasure of dancing with the handsorrest and richest of them When the ball broke up, it seenxd to be expected of us, that we should each escort a lady home, in whose company we passed the night, and we none of us brought charges of severity against our :fuir companions. The fimdango room was about furty by eighteen or twenty feet,. with a brick floor raised fuur or :five feet above the earth. That part of the room in which the 1adies sat, was carpetted with carpetting on the benches, fur them to sit on. Simple benches were provided fur the accommodation ofthe gentlemen. Four men sang to the music of a vioJin and guitar. All that chose to dance stood up on the floor, and at the striking up of a certain note of the rrms:ic, they all commenced c1apping their hands. The 1adies then advanced, one by one, and stood fucing their partners. The dance then changed to a waltz, each [121] man taking his 1ady rather liDCeremoniously, and they began to whir1 ro~ keeping true, however, to the music, and increasing the swffiness of their whirJing. Many of the rnovenxnts and figures seemed very easy, though we fuund they required practise, fur we tl1LlSt certainly have made a most laughable appearance in their eyes, in attempting to practise them Be that as it may, we cut capers with the nimblest, and what we could not say, we managed by squeezes ofthe hand, and little signs of that sort, and passed the time to a charm The village, in which was this ball, is called Perdido, or the :lost town, probably :from sotre circumstances in its history. It contains about 500 souls and one church. The bishop was present at this ball, and not only bestowed his worshipful countenance, but danced before the Lord, like David, with all his might. The more general custom of the ladies, as fur as I observed, is to sit cross legged on the floor Jike a tailor. They are considerably addicted to the industry of spinning, but the mode has no resemblance to the spinning of our country. For a whee~ they have a straight stick about a fuot long, rounded like the head of a spool In the middle of the stick is a hole, through which the stick is :fastened. Their rmde of spinning with this very sitq)le instrument reminded me strongly of the sport of my young days, spinning a top, fur they give this spinning affuir a twir~ and let it nm on until it has lost its comnrunicated motion to impart it anew. This shift fur a spinning wheel they can necataro. They manufucture neither cotton nor wool into cloth, and depend ahogether on fureign trade fur their clothing. The greatest part of this supply comes over ]and from the United States. On the 2d, we started fur San Tepee, through a comrtry generally barren, though abounding in water. We saw plenty ofbears, deer and antelope. So:rne of the first we killed, because we needed their flesh, and others we killed fur the same reason that we were often obliged to kill Indians, that is, to trend their rude manners, in fiercely making at us, and to show them that we were not Spaniards, to give them the high sport of seeing us run. We arrived in the above ~d town [122] on the 5th, and so1d our furs. Here I met again some of the companions who carne with me in the first instance :from the United States. I enquired about others, whom I held in kind remembrance. Sorre had died by lingering diseases, and others by the :fatal ball or arrow, so that out of 116 men, who came from the UP.ited States in 1824, tlJere were not more tb.an sixteen alive. Most of the :fallen were as true men, and as brave as ever poised a rifle, and yet in these rermte and fureign deserts fuund not even the benefit of a grave, but left their bodies to be tom by the wild beasts, or mang]ed by the Indians. When I heard the sad roll offue dead called over, and thought how often I had been in equal danger, I relt gratefUl to my Almighty Benefactor, that I was alive and in health. A strong perception of the danger of such courses as mine, as shown by the death of these men, came over my mind, and I made a kind of resolution, that I woukl return to my horre, and never venture into the woods again. Among the number of my :fuJlen companions, I ought not to furget the original leader of our company, Mr. Pratte, who died in his prirre, of a lingering disease, in this p1ace. On the 1Oth, I coiDIJEilCed descending the Del Norte fur the Copper Mines, in hopes once more to have the pleasure of embracing my futher, and re1ate to him what I had su:ffured in body and mind, fur neglecting to fullow his 581122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 wise and fatherly counsel I now travelled slowly and by myself; and on the 12th, arrived at the house of my old friend the governor, who met :me at his door, and gave :me such an embrace, as to start the blood from my scarcely healed wound. I did not perceive at the rooment, that his embrace had produced this e:Jrect, and entered the house, where I met Jacova, who received me with a partial embrace, and a manner of constrained politeness. She then sat down by :me on the sopha, and began asking me many questions about my adventure since We had parted, often observing that I looked indisposed. At length she discovered the blood oozing through my waistcoat. She exclaimed, putting her hand on the wound, 'and good reason you have to look [123] so, fur you are wounded to death.' The look that accompanied this remark, I may not describe, fur I would not be thought vain, and the stem character of my adventures furbids the intennix:ture of any 'thing of an entirely diflerent aspect I was not long, however, in convincing her that my wound was not reaDy dangerous, and that I owed its present bleeding to the friendship of her :lather, a cause too flattering to be matter of regret. This drew :from me a narrative of the occasion of my wound, which I related in the same simple terms and brief manner in which it is recorded in my jomnal A long conversation of questions and replies ensued, of a nature and on subjects not necessary to relate. On the 20th, imploring CJOd that we might meet again, we parted, and I resumed my journey, travelling slowly fur my father's residence at the Copper Mines. I paused to rest and a:rrruse myself in several ofthe small towns on my way. On the 26th, I had the high sa1Efuction once more to hold the hand of my :lather, and to :find him in health and prosperity, and apparently with nowise abated a:Jrection fur me, though I had rejected his counsels. This a:Jrection seen:rd to receive a wanner glow, when he heard my determination not to take to the woods again. I then in return wished to make myself acquainted with the true state ofhis affirirs. He had established a vacherie on the river Membry where he kept stock. He had also opened a fium on the 1and which the old Appache chief had given him, which enabled him to raise grain fur the use ofhis own establishment at the mines. He had actually a supply of grain in advance fur the next year. He had made simi1ar improvemmts upon every thing appertaining to the mines. The resuh of the whole seemed to be, that he was :malcing rooney rapidly. He still retained the Spaniard, of whom I have spoken befure, as clerk and superintendent, believing him to be a man of real stability and weight of character, and placing the most entire reliance both upon his capacity and integrity. I was less sanguine, and had my doubts, though having seen no decided filets, [124] upon which to ground them, I did not deem myself justified in honor to impart my doubts to my :lather. On the lOth of February, my :lather requested me, on his account, to take a trip to Alopaz, to purchase fur his establishment some wine and whiskey, which articles sen at the mines at a doDar and a half a pint. I started with one servant and six. pack mules, each having a couple of stnall barrels fustened over their saddles, after the manner o1 our panniers. On the 16th, I reached the place, and purchased my cargo, but the weather was so inclen:rnt, that I thought it best not to return until it softened. I became acquainted with an American, married in this place. He was by pursuit a gunsmith, and had been up the upper Missouri with Col Henry, and an old and noted trader on that river. The mutual story of\\vb.at \\Ve tt.vo b.ad seen and su:ffured, would probably appear :incredib1e, and beyond tr..e common order of things, to roost people, except those who have hunted and trapped in the western parts of this continent, aroong the mountains and savages, and has nothing upon which to depend, but his own firmness ofheart, the defunce ofhis rifle, and the protection of the all present God. To such persons, the incidents which we mutually related, would all seem nattrral. I remained here until the 1st of April Spring in its peculiar splendor and glory in this country, had now wakened the fie1ds and furests into lire, and was extending its empire of verdure and flowers higher and l:rigber up the mountains towards their snowy peaks. On this day I commenced my journey of return to the mines, with my servant and my cargo bestowed on my mules. Though the fuce of the country was an life and beauty, the roads so recently thawed, were exceedingly muddy and heavy. One of my mules in consequence gave out the second day. My servant 59/122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narraliw, 1824--1830 packed the load of the tired mule upon his riding one, and walked on fuot the remainder of the day. During the day we discovered fresh bear tracks in the wood, and my servant advised me to have my gun loaded. At this remark I put my hand in my shot pouch, and fuund but a single ball, and [125] no lead with which to make more. At this discovery I saw at once the uselessness of self reproach of my own carelessness and neglect, though it will be easily imagirled, what anxiety it created, aware that I had to travel through a long and dreary wilderness, replenmhed with grizzly bears and hostile Indians. Neither did I dare disclose a particle of what was passing in my mind to my servant, through rear that he would be discouraged, in which case, I knew his first step would be to tum back, and leave me to make the journey alone. It would have been impossible fur me to do this, as we were both scarcely able to arrange the affitirs of the journey. We advanced cautiously and were unmolested through the day. But I passed a most uncomfOrtable night through fear of the bears, which, thawed out, were emerging from their winter dens with appetites rendered ravenous by their long winter fast. We and our mules would have furnished them a delicious feast, after the hunger of months. No sleep visited my eyes that night. At ten o'clock of the 3d, we met a Spaniard on horse back. I accosted him in the usual terms, and asked ifhe had met any Indians on his way? He answered that he had, and that there was a body of friendly Appaches encamped near the road, at a distance of a little more than a league. I was delighted with this iniDnnation, fur I supposed I should be able to purchase a horse of them, on which I might mount my servant. While I was refiecting on this thought, my servant proposed to purchase his horse, and ofrered him a blanket in exchange. He instantly dismounted, took the blanket, and handed over the horse. Happy to see the poor fellow once more comfurtably mounted, we bade the easy Spaniard adieu, and gaily resumed om: journey. In a short time, according to his infonmtion, we saw the Indian camp near the road, from which their sm:>kes were W;ible. We were solicitous to pass them mrobserved and pushed on towards a stopping place, which we might reach at twelve o'clock. Here we stopped to enable our horses to rest, and eat, fur the grass was fine. I ordered my servant to spancel the nrules, and tether the horse to a shrub by a long rope. [126] My gun recJined upon the packs. We ate a 1ittle ourselves, and afterwards I spread my b1anket on the grass, close by the horses, and lay down to repose royse~ though not intending to go to sleep. But the bright beams of the soo full upon 1m in the midst of the green solitude, and I was soon in a profuund s1eep. A Jarge straw hat on the side of my fuce shaded my head from the sm While et:Yoyjng this profuund sleep, fum: of the Appaches carre in pursuit of us. It seems our Spaniard had stolen his horse from them, a fuw hours befure. They came upon us in possession of the horse, and supposed me the thief One of them rode close to me, and rmde a dart at me with his spear. The stroke was aimed at my neck, and passed through my hat, nailing it to the grmmd just back of my neck, which the cold steel barely touched. It awakened me, and I sprang to my reet. Four Indians on horse back were around me, and the spear, which had been darted at me, still nailed my hat to the ground. I immediately seired the spear and e1evated it towards the Indian, who in tum rmde his horse spring out of my reach. I called my servant, who had seen the Indians approacb.ir>.g me, and bad hidden himself in the bushes. I then sprang to my gun, at the distart..ce of ten or fifteen paces. When I had reached and cocked it, I presented it at an Indian who was unsheathing his fusil As soon as he discovered rny piece elevated, he threw himself from his horse, full on his knees, and called fur mercy. What surprized me, and arrested my fire, was to hear him can me by my Christian name. I returned my rifle to my shoukler and asked him who he was? He asked me, if I did not know Targuarcha? He smote his breast as he asked the question The name was fumiliar. The others dismounted, and gathered round. An understanding ensued. When they learned the manner in which we came by the horse, their countenances were expressive of real sorrow. They had supposed me a Spaniard, as they said, and the thief of their horse. They begged me not to be angry, with a laughable solicitude, o:trering me the horse as the price of friendship. Above all, they were [127] anxious that I should not relate the a:ffirir to my futher. They seemed to have an awe of him, resembling that due to the Supreme Being. This awe he had maintained by his steady deportment, and keeping up in their minds the impression, that he 60/122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narrali-.e, 1824--1830 always had a :large army at command, and was able, and disposed at the first .insult, or breach of the treaty on their part, to bring it upon them to their utter destruction. To all their apologies and ldnd words and excuses, I answered that I knew them as well as any other man, and that they were not to expect to atone fur a dastardly attempt to take my lifu, and coming within a hair's breadth of taking it, by ofiering me a present, that I believed that they knew who I was, and only wanted an opportunity, when they could steal upon me unarmed, and kill me, as they had probably committed many other similar nmrders; that were ready enough to cry pardon, as soon as they saw me handling my rifle, hoping to catch me asleep again, but that they would hencefOrward be sure to find me on my guard. At this the In.dian who had darted the spear at me, exclaimed that he loved me as a brother, and woukl at any occasion risk his 1ifu in my derence. I then distinctly recollected him, and that I had been two months with the band, to which he belonged, roving in the woods about the mines. Targuarcha had shown a singular kind of attachment to me, waiting upon me as if I had been his master. I was perfectly convinced that he had thrust his spear at me in absohrte ignorance, that it was me. Still I thought it necessary to .instil a lesson of caution :into them, not to kill any one fur an imagined enemy, mti1. they were sme that he was guilty of the supposed wrong. Consequently I dissembled distrust, and told him, that it looked very little Eke friendship, to dart a spear at the neck of a sleeping man, and that to tell the plain truth, I had as little confidence in him, as a white bear. At this charge of treachery, he c~ close to me, and looking a:ffuctionately in my mce, exclaimed in Spanish, 'if you think me such a traitor, kill me. Here is my breast. Shoot.' At the same time he bared his breast with his hand, with such a [128] profutm.d expression of sorrow in his countenance, as no one was ever yet able to dissemble. I was so:f:l:ened to pity, and told him that I sincerely fOrgave him, and that I would hencefOrward consider him my friend, and not infOrm my futher what he had done. They all promised that they would never attempt to kill any one again, until they knew who it was, and were certain that he was guilty of the crime charged upon him Here we an shook hands, and perfuct confidence was restored. I now called again fur my servant, and after calling till I was hoarse, he at length crawled from behind the bushes, like a :frightened turkey or deer, and looking wild with terror. He had the satisfuction ofbeing heartily 1aughed at, as a person who had deserted his tmSter in the moment of peril. They are not a people to spare the feelings of any one who proves hil:melf a coward by deserting his place. They bestowed that term upon him without mercy. All his reply was, sullenly to set himself to packing his mules. Now arose a friendly controversy about the horse, they .insisting that I should take it, as the price of our renewed friendship, and I, that I would not take it, except on hire or pmcbase. They were obstinate in persisting that I shoukl take the horse along with me, and finally promised ifi woukl consent, that they would return to camp and bring their families, and escort me to the mines. To this I consented, though I had first taken the precaution to procme some rifle baDs of them We then resmned our journey, and travelled on without incident till the 5th, when they overtook us, and we travelled on very amicably together, mtil. we reached the Membry, which nms a south course, and is lost in a wide arid plain, after winding its way through prodigious high, craggy momtains. It affurds neither :fish nor beavers, but bas wide and rich bottoms, of which as I have mentioned, they gave my futher as much as he chose to cultivate. From the point where the road crosses this river to the mines, is reckoned 15 miles. Here we met the chief of this band of the Appaches, with a great number of his people. They were [129] aD delighted to see us, and not the less so, when they discovered that we had spirituous liquors, of which they are fOnd to distraction. There was no evading the importunities of the chief to stay all night with him, he promising, ifl would that be would go in next day user .>mission.com'-drud}lmlmanlhlml/pattia/pallia.h1ml 61/122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 with me to my :father. I had scarcely arrived an hour, when I saw the Indian, that had darted his spear at me, come to 1he chief with shirt laid aside, and his back bare. He handed the chief a stout switch, asldng him to whip him The chief :immediately flayed away about 50 lashes, 1he blood showing at every stroke. He then asked me, iffue 1hing had been done to my satisfaction? I told him tbat I had no satisfaction to demand. The chief who had whipped him, was positively ignorant of 1he crime, for which he had sl.lfl:ered this :in:ftiction. But he said, when one of his men begged a flogging, he took it fur granted, that it was not fur the good deeds of the sl.lfl:erer, and that he deserved it. When I learned that it was a vohmtary penance fur his o:lfunce to me on the road, I :fult really sorry, and made him a present of a quart of whiskey, as an internal unction fur the smart ofhis stripes, a medicine in high esteem among the Indians in such cases. When we arrived at 1he mines, the old chief enquired what had been done to me on the road? As soon as he was infur:rned, he sprang up, tore his hair, and seized a gun to shoot the poor culprit I interposed between them, and convinced him, that Taguarcha had not been really to bJame in any thing but his haste, and that if I had really been 1he thief; he would have done right to kill me, and get back his horse, and that not even my father would have thought the worse of him, but that we should both now like him better, as well as his people, fur what had happened. On 1he 15th, my :father proposed to give me a sum of money, with which to go into the United States to purchase goods for the mines. The Jaborers much pre:furred goods, at the custo:nmy rate, to money, and the profit at that rate was at least 200 per cent on the cost. I was reluctant to do this, fur my thoughts still detained me :in that country. It was then concluded to [130] send the befure mentioned Spanish clerk on the commission, with sufficient money to pay fur the goods, consigned to merchants in Santa Fe, to be purchased there, provided a sufficient quantity bad recently arrived from 1he United States to furnish an asso~t, and if not, he was recommended to merchants in StLouis, to make the purchases there. On the 18th, he started under these orders, under the additional one, that on his arriving at Santa Fe, and learning the state of things there, he should :immediately write to the mines to that effuct In the customary order of things, this letter was to be expected in one mmth from the day he left the mines. After he was departed, he left none behind to doubt his truth and honor, nor was there the least suspicion of him, until the time had e1apsed without a letter. A dim surmise began then to grow up, that he had nm. off with the money. We were still anxiously waiting fur intelligence. During this interval I bad occupied the pJace of clerk :in his stead. It was now insisted that I should go in search of the villain, who bad obtained a good start of a month ahead of us, and 30,000 dollars value in gold bullion to expedite his journey. On 1he 20th, I started in the search, which I confess seemed hopeless, fur he was a :rmn of infinite ingenuity, who could enact Spaniard, which he really was, or Russian, Frenchman or Englishman, as he spoke the languages ofthese people with fluency. Still I pushed on with :full purpose to make diligent and unsparing search. On the 30th, I arrived at Santa Fe. I made the most anxious and careful enquiry fur him, and gave the most accurate descriptions of him \"there. But no one bad seen or heard of such a person. I sorrowfuiJy retraced my steps down the Rio del Norte, now without a doubt of his treachery, and bitterly reflecting on myself fur my heedless regard of my :father's request. Had I done it, we had both secured an affluence. Now I clearly furesaw poverty and misfOrtune opening befure us in 1he :future. For myself I :fu]t little, as I was young and the world befure me; and I :fult secure about taking care of myself [ 131] My grief was fur my father and his companions, who had toiled night and day with unwearied assiduity, to accumulate something fur their dear and helpless families, whom they had left in Missouri; and fur the bve of whom they had ventured into this rough and unsettled country, full of thieves and murderers. My father :in particular, had left a Jarge and rmtherless fumily, at a time oflifu to unable to 62/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 take care of themselves, and altogether dependent on him fur subsistence. There is no :misery Jike self condemnation; and I su:f:rered it in all its bitterness. The reflections that fullowed upon learning the full extent of the disaster, which I could but charge in so:rre sense upon myse~ ca:rre, as such reflections genera1ly co:rre, too :late. I arrived at the Passo del Norte on the 1Oth of May, and repeated the same descriptions and enquiries to no purpose.- Not a trace remained of him here; and I almost concluded to abandon the search in despair. I could irl:llgine but one m::>re chance. The owner of the mines lived at Chihuahua. As a rorlom hope I concluded to proceed to that city, and infunn the governor of our misfOrtune. So I pushed to Chihuahua, where I arrived on the 23d. I found the owner of the mines in too much anxiety and grief of mind on his own account, to be cool enough to listen [to] the concerns of others. The President of the Mexican republic had issued orders, that all Spaniards born in old Spain, should be expelled from the Mexican country, giving them but a m::>nth' s notice, in which to settle their a:Oairs and dispose of their property. He being one of tbat c1ass, had enough to think of on his own account. However, when he beard of our :misfOrtune, he appeared to be concerned. He then touched upon the critical state ofhis own a:ffuirs. Am:mg other things, he said he had all along hoped that my :father was able and disposed to purchase those mines. He had, therefore, a motive personal to himse~ to make him regret my mther's loss and inability to make the purchase. He was now obliged to sell them at any sacrifice, and had but a very short tirne in which to settle his [ 132] a:ffuirs, and leave the country. He requested me to be ready to start the next day in company with him to the mmes. Ear1y on the 24th, we started with re:Jays ofhorses and mules. As we travelled very rapidly we arrived at the mines on the 3oth, where I fuund my mther and his companions :in the utroost anxiety to learn something what bad happened to me. When they discovered the owner of the mines, whose nrure was Don Francisco Pablo de Lagera, they came furth :in a body with countenances full of joy. That joy was changed to sadness, as soon as Don Pablo infOrmed them the object ofhis visit. They perceived :in a moment, that nothing now rerm:ined fur them but to settle their af!airs, and search fur other situations in the country, or return to the United States in a worse condition than when they left it. My mther determined at once not to think of this. Nothing see:rn;:d so feasible, and confurmable to his pursuits, as a trapping expedition. With the pittance that remained to him, after all demands against the firm were discharged, and the residue according to the articles of agreement divided, he purchased trapping equipments fur fuur persons, himself included. The other three he :intended to hire to trap fur him On the 1st of Ju1y, all these matters had been arranged, and my mther and myself started fur Santa Fe, with a view to join the first company tbat should start on a trapping expedition from that place. On the 1oth, we arrived at Santa Fe, where we remained until the 22d, when a company of thirty men were about to commence an expedition of that sort down Red river. My mther joined this company, and in the name of the companions made application fur license of safe transit through the province of Chihuahua, and Sonora, through which runs the Red river, on which we meant to trap. The governor gave us a passport :in the fOllowing terms: [133] CustomHouse ofthe frontier town ofSanta Fe, in the territory ofNew Mexico. Custom House Certificate.

On the 23d, my mther was chosen captain or commander of the company, and we started on our expedition. We retraced our steps down the del Norte, and by the mines to the \u00b7riVer Hehy, on which we arrived on the '6th o1 Octo}jer, and began to descend it, setting our traps as we went, near our camp, whenever we saw signs ofbeavers. But our stay on 1:lm stream was short, fur it had been trapped so often, that there were but rew beavers remaining, and those :fuw were exceedingly shy. We therefOre pushed on to some place where they might be more abundant, and less shy. ~mt.Jhe_J2J;b.._and_~Sth reacbedJ3eaver ~ lkrn~QlJlldJhem m ~nsidemble numbers, and we conc~roceed in a south course, and trap the river in its downward course. But to prevent the dlsagreement and insubordination which are apt to spring up in these associations, my mther drew articles of agreerrent, purporting that we should trap in partnership, and that the first one who should show an open purpose to separate from the company, or desert it, should be shot dead; and that if any one should disobey orders, be should be tried by a jury of our nmnber, and iffuund guilty should be fined fifty dollars, to be paid in fur. To this instrument we an agreed, and signed our names. [ 134] The necessity of some such compact had been abundantly discovered in the course of our experience. Men bound only by their own will and sense of right, to the duties of such a sort of partnership are certain to grow restless, and to furm smaller clans, dlsposed to dislike and separate :from each other, in parties of one by one to three by three. They thus expose thel.'lEelves to be cut up in detail by the savages, who comprehend an their movements, and are ever watchful fur an opporturrity to show their hatred of the whites to be :fixed and inextinguishable. The fOllowing are some of the more conmon causes of separation: Men of incompatible tempers and habits are brought together; and such expeditions can out :irmumerable occasions to try this disagreeJ.'relJt of character. Men, hungry, naked, futigued, and in constant jeopardy, are apt to be ill-tempered, especially when they arrive at camp, and instead ofbeing a1lowed to ilirow themselves on the ground, and sleep, have hard duties of cooking, and keeping guard, and making breast-works assigned them But the grand difficulty is the fullowing. In a consid.erable company, half its numbers can catch as many beavers as all. But the half that keep guard, and cook, perfurm duties as necessary and important to the whole concern, as the others. It always happens too, in these expeditions, that there are some infinitely more dextrous and skilful in trapping and hunting than others. These capabilities are soon brought to light. The expert know each other, and fuel a certain superiority over the inexpert. They know that iliree or fuur such, by themselves, will take as many beavers as a prot:l:liscuous company of thirty, and in fuct, an that a stream a:lfurds. A perception of their own comparative importance, a keen sense of self interest, which sharpens in the desert, the mere love of roving in the wild license of the furest, and a capacity to become hardened by these scenes to a per:fuct callousness to an rear and sense of danger, until it actually comes; such passions are sufficient to thicken causes of separation among such companions in the events of every day. Sad experience bas made me acquainted with an these causes [135] of disunion and dissolution of such companies. I have learned them by wounds and suflerings, by toil and danger of every sort, by wandering about in the wild and desolate mountains, a1one and half starved, merely because two or three bad rren bad divided our company, strong and sufficient to thermelves in union, but miserable, and exposed to ahnost certain ruin in separation. Made painfully acquainted with an these filets by experience, my futher adopted this expedient in the hope that it would be 641122 But m~ 1fm~ and the prudtmce and er\u00bbfiY of my ~s ~, din.mkm soon bepn to spring up m om party. the to ki and cat our do~ then six of our lxmles.

Here the greater part of the company expressed rusinclination to fullowing our contemplated route any longer. That is, they conceived the route to the mouth of the He1ay, and up Red river ofCalifurnia too long and tedious, and too much exposed to mnrerous and hostile Indians. They, therefure, determined to quit the He1ay, and strike over to Red river by a direct route across the country. My father reminded them of their article. They assured him they did not consider themselves bound by it, and that they were a majority, against which nothing could be said. My fi:tther and myself still persevered in fullowing the original plan. Two of the men had been hired on my father's account. He told them he was ready to pay them up to that time, and dismiss them, to go where they chose. They observed, that now that the company had commenced separating, they believed that in a short time, there would be no stronger party together than ours; that they had as good a rusposition to risk their lives with us, as with any division of our number, and that they would stay by us to the [137] death. After this speech fuur others of the company voh:mteered to remain with us, and we took them in as partners. On the 27th, we divided the hunt, and all expressing the same regret at the separation, and heartily wishing each other an roamer of prosperity, we shook hands and parted! We were now reduced to ejgbt in number. We tmde the most solerm pledges to stand by each other unto death, and adopted the severest caution, of which we bad been too faithfully taught the necessity. We tied our horses every night, and encamped close by them, to prevent their being stolen by the Indians. Their fuot-prints were thick and fresh in our course, and we could see their smokes at no great dEtance north of us. We were wen aware\u00b7 that they were hostile, and watching their opportunity to pomce upon us, and we kept ourselves ready fur action, equally day and night. We now took an ample abundance ofbeavers to supply us with meat, in consequence of our reduced numbers. Our horses also :tared well, fur we cut plenty of cotton-wood trees, the bark of which serves them fur food nearly as well as com We tlrus travelled on prosperously, until we reached the jmction of the He1ay with Red river.\u00ad Here we fuund the tribe of Umeas, who had shown the:Il'Eelves very friendly to the company in which I had fOrmerly passed them, which strongly inspired confidence :in them at present. Some of them could speak the Spanish language. We made many inquiries of them, our object being to gain :infOrmation of the rustance of the Spanish settlements. We asked them where they obtained the c1oth they wore around their loins? They answered, from the Christians on the coast of the Califumia. We asked ff there were any Christians living on Red river? They promptly answered, yes. This information afterwards proved a source of error and misfortune to us, though our motive fur :inquiry at this time was mere curiosity. It was now the 1st ofDecember; and at mid-day we began to see the imprudence of spending the remainder of the day and the ensuing night with such numbers of Indians, however friendly in appearance. We had a tolerable fund of experience, in [ 13 8] regard to the trust we might safely repose in the red skins; and knew that caution is the parent of security. So we packed up, and separated from them Their town was on the opposite shore ofRed river. At our enca:rqmxmt upwards of two hundred of them swam over the river and visited us, all apparently friendly. We allowed but a fuw of them to approach our camp at a time, and they were obliged to Jay aside their arms. In the midst ofthese rrrultitudes of :fierce, naked, swarthy savages, eight of us seemed no more than a little patch of snow on the side of one of the black mountains. We were perfectly aware how critical was our position, and determined to :intermit no prudence or caution. To interpose as great a distance as possible between them and us, we marched that evening sixteen miles, and 661122 5/1Q/13 Pattie's Personal Narrali~.e, 1824--1830 encamped on the banks of the river. The place of encampment was a prairie, and we drove stakes fast in the earth, to which we tied our horses in the midst of green grass, as high as a man's head, and within ten fuet of our own :fire. Unhappily we had arrived too late to make a pen fur our horses, or a breast work for ourselves. The sky was gloomy. Night and stonn were settling upon us, and it was too late to complete these important arrangements. In a short time the stonn poured upon us, and the night becarre so dark that we could not see our hand befure us. Apprehensive of an attempt to steal our horses, we posted two sentinels, and the remaining six lay down under our wet blankets, and the pelting of the sky, to such sleep as we might get, still preserving a little :fire. We were scarcely asleep before we were aroused by the snorting of our horses and mules. We an sprang to our ar.rns, and extinguished our little fire. We could not see a foot befure us, and we groped about our camp fueling our way among the horses and mules. We could discover nothing; so concluding they might have been frightened by the approach of a bear or some other wild anima~ some of us commenced rekindling our fires, and the rest went to sleep. But the Indians had crawled among our horses, and bad cut or untied the rope by which each one was [ 13 9] bound. The horses were then all loose. They then instantly raised in concert, their fiendish yell. As though heaven and earth were in concert against us, the rain began to pour again, accompanied with howling gusts of wind, and the fiercest gleams of lightning, and crashes of thunder. Terrified alike by the thunder and the Indians, our horses all took to :ffight, and the Indians repeating yell upon yell, were close at their heels. We sallied out after them, and fired at the noises, though we could see nothing. We pursued with the ut:roost of our speed to no purpose, fur they soon reached the open prairie, where we concbJded they were joined by other Indians on horseback, who pushed our horses still taster; and soon the clattering of their heels and the yells of their accursed pursuers began to fude, and become indistinct in our ears. Our reelings and reflections as we returned to camp were ofthe gloomiest kind. We were one thousand miles from the point whence we started, and without a single beast to bear either our property or ourselves. The rain bad past. We built us a large fire. As we stood rm.md it we discussed our deplorable condition, and our future alternatives. Something was to be done. We all agreed to the proposition of my father, which was, early in the morning to pursue the trails of our beasts, and if we should overtake the thieves, to retake the horses, or die in the attempt; and that, fulling in that, we should return, swim the river, attack their town, and kill as many of the inhabitants as we could; fur that it was better to die by these Indians, after we had killed a good mnnber of them, than to starve, or be killed by Indians who had not ~ured us, and when we could not defend ourselves. Accordingly, early in the morning of the 2d, we started on the trail in pursuit of the thieves. We soon arrived at a point where the Indians, departing from the plain, had driven them up a chasm of the mountains. Here they bad stopped, and caught them, divided them, and each taken a di.ffurent route with his ph.mdered horses. We saw in a mon:xmt that it was impossible to fullow them further to any purpose. We abandoned [140] the chase, and returned to our camp to execute the second part of our plan When we arrived there, we stopped fur a leisure rreal of beaver meat. \\Vhen we 1-..ad bestowed ourselves to this clair.!'; resort, a Dutchman \\vith us broke the gloomy silence of our eating, by observing that we bad better stuff ourselves to the utmost; fur that it would probably, be the last chance we shoUld have at beaver rreat. We all acquiesced in this observation, which though made in jest, promised to be a sober 1ruth, by eating as heartily as possible. When we had finished our mea~ which looked so likely to be the last we should enjoy together, we made rafts to which we tied our guns, and pushing them onward before us, we thus swam the river. Having reached the opposite shore, we shouldered our rifles, and steered fur the town at which we arrived about two in the afternoon. We n:mched up to the :numerous assemblage of huts in a manner as reckless and undaunted as though we had nothing to apprehend. In met, when we arrived at it, we fuund it to contain not a single living being, except one miserable, blind, dea~ and decrepid old man, not unlike one that I described in a hostile furmer visit to an Indian village. Our exasperation of despair :inclined us to kill even him My father furbade. He apparently heard nothing and cared fur nothing, as he saw nothing. His head was white with age, user .>mission. com/~ r:t\"ucl}f'm1manlhlml/patlia/patlie.hlrnl 67/122 5/19/13 Pattie's Personal eyes appeared to have been gouged out. He may have thought himself an the while in the midst ofhis own people. We discovered a plenty of their kind of fuod, which consisted chiefly of acorn m.ISh. We then set fire to the village, burning every hut but that which contained the old man Being built of flags and grass, they were not long in reducing to ashes. We then retmned to our camp, re-swimming the river, and reaching the camp befure dark. We could with no certainty divine the cause of their having evacuated their town, though we attributed :it to rear oi us. The occurrences of the preceding day strengthened us in this impression. While they remained with us, one of our men happened to fire off his gun. As though they never had heard [141] such a noise befure, they an full prostrate on the earth, as though they bad an been shot. When they arose, they would an have taken to flight, bad we not detained them and quieted their rears. Our conversation with these Indians of the day befure, now recurred to our recoJlections, and we congratulated ourselves on having been so inquisitive as to obtain the now important infurmation, that there were Spanish settlements on the river below us. Driven from the resource of our horses, we happily turned our thoughts to another. We bad an the requisite tool!;) to build canoes, and directly around us was suitable timber of which to make them It was a pleasant scheme to soothe our dejection, and prevent our lying down to the sleep of despair. But this alternative determined upon, there remained another apprehension sufficient to prevent our enjoying quiet repose. Our rears were, that the unsheltered Indians, horse-stealers and all, would creep upon us in the night, and massacre us an. But the night passed without any disturbance from them On the morning of the 3d, the first business in which we engaged, was to build mrrselves a little furt, sufficient fur defence against the Indians. This finished, we cut down two trees suitable fur canoes, and accomplished these important objects in one day. During this day we kept one mm posted in the top of a tall tree, to descry ff any Indians were approaching us in the distance. On the m::mnng of the fuurth we conrnenced digging out our canoes, and finished and launched two. These were fuund insufficient to carry our furs. We continued to prepare, and launch them, mrt:il we had eight in the water. By uniting them in pairs by a platfunn, we were able to embark with all our furs and traps, without any extra burden, except a man and the necessary traps fur each canoe. We bid our saddles, hoping to purchase horses at the sett:lem:mts, and return this way. We started on the 9th, floating with the current, which bore us downward at the rate offuur miles an hour. In the evening we passed the burnt town, the ruins of which still threw up [142] smouldering smoke. We floated about 30 miles, and in the evening encamped in the midst of signs ofbeavers. We set 40 traps, and in the morning of the 1Oth caught 36 beavers, an exceJlent night's hunt. We concluded from this encouraging co:rnmencerrent, to travel slowly, and in hunters' phrase, trap the river clear; that is, take all that could be allured to come to the bait. The river, below its junction with the He1ay, is from 2 to 300 yards wide, with high banks, that have ililapi.dated by fulling in. Its course is west, and :its titrlJer chiefly cotton-wood, which in the bottoms is lofty and thick set. The bottoms are from six to ten miles wide. The soil is b1ack, and mixed with sand, though the bottoms are subject to immdation in the flush waters of June. This immdation is occasioned by the melting of the snow on the mountains about its head waters. We now floated pleasantly downward at our leisure, having abundance of the meat of :fat beavers. We began in this short prosperity, to furget the loss of our horses, and to consider ourselves quite secure from the Indians. But on the 12th, at mid-day, by mere accident, we happened, some way below us, to discover two Indians perched in a tree near the river bank, with their bows and arrows in readiness, waiting evidently until we should float close by them, to take off some of us with their arrows. We betrayed no signs of having seen them, but sat with our guns ready fur a mir shot. When we had floated within a little short of a lnm.dred yards, my father and another of the company gave them a salute, and brought them both tumbling down the branches, reminding us exactly ofthe full of a bear or a tw'key. They made the earth sound when they struck it. Fearful that they might be 68/122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narrati~. 1824--1830 part of an ambush, we pulled our canoes to the opposite shore, and so!lle of us climbed trees, from which we could command a view ofboth shores. We beca:rne satisfied that these two were alone, and we crossed over to their bodies. We discovered that they were of the number that bad stoJen our horses, by the met, that they were bound round the waist with some of the hemp ropes with which our horses bad been tied. We ln.mg the bodies of the 1hieves [143] from a tree, with the product of their own thefts. Our thoughts were much relieved by the discovery of this met, fur though none of us relt any particular furbearance towards Indians under any circumstances, it certainly would have pained us to have killed Indians that had never disturbed us. But there could be no compunction fur having slain these two thieves, precisely at the 1110ment that they were exu]ting in the hope of getting a good shot at us. Beside they alarmed our fulse security, and reamed us a lesson to keep nearer the middle of the river. We continued to float slowly downwards, trapping beavers on our way almost as fast as we could wish. We sometimes brought in 60 in a morning. The river at this point is remarkably circuitous, and bas a great nun:ber of islands, on which we took beavers. Such was the rapid increase of our :furs, that our present crafts in a rew days were insufficient to cany them, and we were compelled to stop and make another canoe. We have advanced between 60 and 70 miles from the point where we built the other canoes. We find the timber larger, and not so thick. There are but rew wild animals that belong to the country further up, but some deer, panthers, fuxes and wild-cats. Of birds there are great numbers, and many varieties, most of which I have never befure seen. We killed some wild geese and pelicans, and likewise an animal not unlike the A.:frican leopard, which came into our camp, while we were at work upon the canoe. It was the first we had ever seen. We :finished our canoe on the l71h, and started on the 20th. This\u00b7 day we saw ten Indians on a sand bar, who fled into the woods at the sight of us. We knew them to be dif:furent people from those who had stolen our horses, both by their size and their di:f:rerent manner of wearing their hair. The heads of these were shaved close, except a tuft, which they wore on the top of their head, and which they raised erect, as straight as an arrow. The Umeas are oi gigantic stature from six to seven reet high. These only average five teet and a half They go perfectly naked, and have dark complexions, which I imagine [144] is caused by the burning heat of the sun. The weather is as hot here at this time, as I ever experienced. We were all very desirous to have a ta1k with these Indians, and enquire of them, how near we were to the Spanish settlements; and whether they were :imrneruately on the bank, fur we began to be fearful that we had passed them Three days passed without our having any opportunity of conversation with them But early on the morning of the 241h, we round sorre fumilies yet asleep in their wigwams, near the water's edge. Our approach to them was so imperceptible and sudden, that they had no chance to flee. They were apparently frightened to insanity. They surrendered without making any further effurt to escape. While they stared at us in terrified astomshment; we made them comprehend that we bad no design to kill, or iqjure them We o:H:ered them meat, and made signs that we wi...shed to smoke with them They readily comprehended us, and the ghastliness of terror began to pass from their countenances. The women and children were yet screaming as if going into convulsions. We made signs to the rren to have them stop this annoying noise. This we did by putting our bands to our 1110uths. They it:rnnediately uttered something to the worren and children which made them still. The pipe was then lit, and smoking coli'liJleDCed. They pu:fred the smoke towards the sky, pointed thither, and uttered so!lle words, of course unintelligible to us. They then struck themselves on the breast, and afterwards on the furehead. We understood this to be a sort of religious appeal to the Supreme Being, and it showed more like reverence to him, than any thing we had yet seen among the Indians; though I have seen none but what admit that there is a master of :ti:fe, whom they call by a name to that import, or that of Great Spirit When the smoking was :finished, we began to enquire of them by signs, bow fur we were from the Spanish 691122 5/19/13 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824--1830 settlement? This we e:fiected by drawing an itmge of a cow and sheep in the sand and then :imitating the noise oi each kind of domestic animals, that we supposed the Spaniards would have. They appeared [145] to understand us, fur they pointed west, and then at our clothes, and then at our naked skin From this we inferred that they wished to say that further to the west lived white people, as we were. And this was an we could draw from them on that subject We then asked them, if they had ever seen white people befure? This we effucted by stretching open our eyes with our fingers, and pointing to them, and then looking vehe:mently :in that direction, while we pointed west with our fingers. They shook their heads in the negative. Then stretching their own ears, as we had our eyes, striking themselves on the breast, and pointing down the river, they pronounced the word wechapa. This we afterwards understood implied, that their chieflived lower down the river, and that they had heard from him, that be had seen these people. We gave the wo:rnen some old shirts, and intimated to them as wen as we could, that it was the mshion of the wo:rnen to cover themselves in our country, fur these were in a state of the most entire nudity. But they did not seem rightly to comprehend our wish Many of the women were not over sixteen, and the most perfect figures I have ever seen, perfectly straight and syrm:retrical, and the hair of some banging nearly to their heels. The men are exceedingly active, and have bright countenances, and quick apprehension. We gave them rmre meat, and then started. They fuibwed our course along the bank, until night. As soon as we Janded, they were very officious in gathering wood, and perfOrming other offices fur us. They showed eager curiosity :in examining our arms, and appeared to understand their use. When my :lather struck :fire with his pisto~ they gave a start, evidencing a mixture of astonishment and terror, and then re-examined the pistol, apparently solicitous to discover how the fire was made. My mther bade me take my rifle, and shoot a wild goose, that was sitting about in the middle of the river. He then showed them the goose, and pointed at me, as I was creeping to a point where I might take a fu.ir shot They aD gazed with intense curiosity, first at me, and then at the goose, until I fired. At the rooment of the report, [146] some fen flat on the ground, and the rest ran fur the bushes, as though Satan was behind them As soon as the mllen had recovered from their a.mazement, they also fled. Some of our company stopped them, by seizing some, and holding them, and showing them that the goose was dead, and the ma:rmer in which it had been ldlled. They gradually regained confidence and composure, and called to their companions :in the bushes. They also came furth, one by one, and when the nature of the report of the gtm had been explained to them, they immediately swam into the river and brought out the goose. When they carried it round and showed it to their companions, carefully pointing out the ban hole in the goose, it is impossible to show more expressive gestures, cries and movements of countenances indicative of wonder and astonishment, than they exbfuited. The night which we passed with them, passed away pleasant]y, and to the satisfuction of all parties. In the morning their attention and curiosity were again bigh]y excited, when we brought in our beavers, which a:rmunted in number to thirty-six. After we bad finished skinning them, we left the ample supply offuod furnished by the bodies of the beavers, in token of our :.friendship, to these Indians, and floated on. On the 27th, we arrived at the residence of the chief We perceived that they had made ready fur our The d d n \" lrm;,..,n- 1 f' ,. \" 1 d As 1~~;! d, 1 1 1 reception. \u00b71 y ha prepare a reast tor us oy ~ a numoer or rn.rrea. ogs. -soon as we lffirue tae cme1 came to us, accompanied by two subordinate chie:IS. When arrived dose to us, he excla:itned, wechapa, striking himself on the breast, pointing to our company, and repeating the sam:: phrase. We understood from this, 1hat he wished to know who was our captain? We all pointed to my mther, to whom the chief immediately advanced, and a:fiectionately embracing him, invited us to enter his wigwam We shouldered our rifles, and an fuTiowed this venerable looking man to his abode. There be had prepared several earthen dishes, in which the flesh of young and fut dogs was served up, but without salt or bread. We an sat down. The pipe was lit, and we, and the thirty Indians present began to smoke. While we were smoking, they used many gesticulations and signs, the [147] purport of which we coukl not make out, though, as they pointed often at us, we supposed we were the subjects of their gestures. The pipe was then taken away, and the chief arose, and stood in the centre of the circle which we furmed by the manner in which we an sat around the fire. He then made a long harangue, and as we understood not a user .>mission.com'-ct'~mtrnan1111m!/patlie/pattia.hlml 70/122 51'19/13 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824--1830 word, to us rather a tedious one. We took care to make as many gestures :indicative ofunderstanding it, as though we had comprehended every word. The oration finished, a large dish of the choice dogs flesh was set befOre us, and signs were made to us to eat. Having learned not to be delicate or disobliging to our savage host, we full to work upon the ribs of the dorrestic barkers. When we had eaten to satisfuction, the chief arose, and puffing out his naked belly, and striking it with his hand, very significantly inquired by this sign, if we had eaten enough? When we had answered in the affirmative, by our mode of making signs, he then began to enquire of us, as we understood it, who we were, and from whence we c~, and what was our business in that country? All this we interpreted, and replied to by signs as significant as we could imagine. He continued to enquire of us by signs, if we had met with no misfOrtunes on our journey, calling over 1he names of several Indian tribes in that part of the country, among which we distinctly recognized the name of the Urreas? When he mentioned this name, it was with such a lowering brow and fierce countenance as indicated clearly that he was at war with them We responded to these marks of dislike by an equal show of detestation by making the gesture of seeming desirous to shoot at them, and with the bitterest look of anger that we could assume; making him understand that they had stolen our horses. He made signs of intelligence that he comprehended us, and made us sensible ofhis deep hatred, by giving us to understand that they had killed many of his people, and taken many more prisoners; and that he had retaliated by killing and taking as many Umeas. He pointed at the same time to two small children, and exclaimed Umea! We [148] pointed at them with our guns, and gave him to understand, that we had killed two of them Some of our people had brought their scalps along. We gave them to him, and he, looking first towards us, and then fiercely at them, seemed to ask if these were the scalps ofhis enemies? To which we replied, yes.-He then seized the hair ofthe scalps with his teeth, and shook them, precisely as I have seen a dog any small game that :it had killed. He then gave such a yell of de1ight, as collected all his people round him in a moment, and such rejoicing, yelling, and dancing ensued from both men and women, as I shall fOrbear to attempt to describe. Their depo~nt on this occasion was in :fact much nearer bestial than h:wmn. They wouk:l. leave the dance rmmd the scalps in tum, to come and caress us, and then return and resume their dance. The remainder of this day and the ensuing night passed in being in some sense compelled to witness this spectacle. In the morning of the 28th, when we brought in the contents of our traps, we fotmd we had taken twenty-eight beavers. When my father enquired this morning anew fur the direction of the Spanish settlements, and how fur they were distant, we could make out :from the signs of the chief no infunm.tion more exact than this. He still pointed to the west, and then back at us.-He then made a very tolerable imitation of the rolling and breaking ofthe surf on the sea shore. Below he drew a cow and a sheep. From this we were satisfied that there were Spanish settlements west of us; and our conclusion was, that they could not be very d1stant. At mid-day we bade these friendly Indians fureweD, and resumed our slow progress of floating slowly do-wn the stream, still setting our traps, whenever we found any :indications ofbeavers. We met with no striking incident, and experienced no molestation until January 1st, 1828. On this day we once more received a shower of arrows from about fifty Indians of a tribe called Pip~ of whom we were cautioned to beware by the friendly Indians we had last left. I fOrgot at the time to mention the name of that people, when speaking of them, and [149] repeat it now. It is Cocopa. When the Pipi fired upon us, we were floating near the middle ofthe river. We :immediately commenced pulling fur the opposite shore, and were soon out of the reach oftheir arrows, without any individual having been wounded. As soon as om crafts touched the shore, we sprang upon the bank, took fuir aim, and showed them the dif.Ierence between their weapons and ours, by levelling six of them The remainder full :flat, and began to dodge and skulk on all fOurs, as though the heavens had been loaded with thtmder and mill stones, which were about to rain on them from the clouds. 71/122 5/1Q/13 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824---1830 We re-loaded our gws, and rowed over to the opposite, and now deserted shore. The :fullen lay on the sand beach, some of them not yet dead. We ftnmd twenty three bows and the co:mplement of arrows, most of them belonging to the fugitives. The bows are six fuet in lengili, and made of a very tough and elastic kind of wood, which the Spaniards can Tarnio. They polish them down by rubbing them on a rough rock. The arrows are furmed of a reed grass, and of the satre length with their bows, with a fuot of bard wood stuck in the end of the cavity of the reed, and a flint spike fitted on the end of it.-They have very large and erect furrm, and black skins. Their long black hair floats in tresses down their backs, and to the termination of each tress is mstened a snail sheD. In other respects their dress consists of their birth-day suit; :in other words, they axe perfectly naked. The river seems here to nm upon a high ridge; fur we can see from our crafts a great distance back into the country, which is thickly covered with ImJSquito and other low and scrubby trees. The land is exceedingly marshy, and is the resort oi numerous flocks of swans, and blue cranes. The rackoons are in such numbers, that they cause us to lose a great many beavers, by getting into our traps and being taken instead of the true game. They annoy us too by their squalling when they are taken From the junction of the two rivers to tbis place, I judge to be about a hundred miles. We find the climate exceedingly warm, [150] and the beaver fur, in accommodation to the climate, is becoming short We conclude, in consequence, that our trapping is becoming of less importance, and that it is our interest to push on fuster to reach the settlements. A great many times every day we bring our cra:fi:s to shore, and go out to see if we carmot discover the tracks ofhorses and cattle. On the 18th, we first perceived that we bad arrived on the back water of the tide; or rather we first attributed the deadness oftbe current to the entrance of some inundated river, swollen by the melting of the snow on the mountains. We puzzled our brains with some other theories, to account fur the deadness of the current. This became so entirely still, that we began to rig our oars, concJuding that instead of our hitherto easy progress of floating gent]y onward, we had hencefOrward to make our head-way down stream by dint of the machinery of our arms. We soon were thoroughly enlightened inregard to the slackness ofilie water. It began to rundown again, and with the rapidity of six miles an hour; that is, double the ordinary current of the stream We were all much surprised, fur though I had seen the water of the Pacific at Ynms, none of us bad ever :fult the influence of the tides, or been in a craft on the ocean waters befure. People of the same tribe, upon which we bad recently fired, stood upon the shore, and called loud]y to us as we passed, to come to land, making signs to us, that the motion of ilie water would capsize our crafts. They showed a great desire that we might come to shore, we had no doubt, that they might rob and nrurder us. We preserved such a distance from them, as to be out of the reach of their arrows, and had no intention to fire upon them Had we wished fur a shot, they were quite within rille distance. We floated on, having had a beautiful evening's run, and did not come to land, until late; we then pitched our camp on a low point of land, unconscious, from our inexperience ofthe met, that the water would return, and run up stream again. We made om car..oes :last to some small trees, and an lay down to sleep, except my m:ther, who took the first watch. He soon aroused us, and called on us all [151] to prepare fur a gust of wind, and a heavy rain, which he thought betokened by a rushing noise he heard We re~d in a :fuw rmments, that it was the returning tide. Still, so strongly impressed were we, that a shower was approaching, that we made an the customary arrangements of preparation, by stretching our blankets to keep out the water :from above. But our enemy assailed us :from another quarter. Om camp was inundated from the river. We landsmen from the interior, and unaccustomed to such movements of the water, stood contemplating with astonislnnent the rush of the tide coming in from the sea, in conflict with the current of the river. At the point oi conflict rose a high ridge of water, over which came the sea current, combing down like water over a mildam. We an sprang to our canoes, which the rush of the water had ahnost capsized, though we held the fusts with our hands. 72/122 5/19/13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 fu twenty minutes the place where we Jay asleep, and even our fire pJace was three reet under water, and our blankets were all afloat. We had some vague and general ideas of the nature of the tide, but its particular operations were as rruch unknown to us, as though we never had heard of it at all In the consternation of our ignorance, we paddled our crafl:s, as well as we could, among the timber, not dreaming that in the course of a fuw hours, the water would full again. As it was, we gathered up our floating blankets, got into our canoes, and hekl fust to the brushes, until the water rell again, leaving us and our canoes high and dry. We were now assailed by a new aJarm, lest the Indians, taking advantage of this new position in which we were placed, would attack and mn.-der us. fu such apprehensions we passed the night, tmtil the n10ming shone upon us with a bright and beautiful sun, which enabled us to dry all our wet things, and re-animated us with the confidence which springs from the view of a bright :firmament and a free and :full survey of our case. When the tide returned we got into our crafl:s, and descended with it, still expecting to find Spanish settlements. We continued in this way to descend, when the tide ran out, until the 28th, when the surf came up the [152] river so strong that we saw ina moment, that our crafl:s could not live, ifwe floated them into this tumultuous commotion of the water. Here we were placed in a new position, not the least disheartening or trying, among the painful predicaments, in which furtune had placed us. The fierce billows shut us in from behw, the river current from above, and murderous savages upon either hand on the shore. We bad a rich cargo of furs, a little independence fur each one of us, could we have disposed of them, as we had hoped, among the Spanish people, whom we expected to have fuund here. There were no such settlements.-Every side on which we looked offured an array of danger, famine and death. In this predic~nt, what were furs to us? Our :first thought was to conn:nit our :furs to the waters, and attempt to escape with our lives. Our second resolve was to ascend the liver as :far as we could, bury our furs, and start on foot fur some settlement. We saw that the chances were greatly against us, that we should perish in the attempt; fur the country yiekled little to subsist on, and was full of Indians who are to the 1ast degree savage and mn.-derous, and whom nothing can subdue to kindness and :friendship. We bad no idea of ever putting ourselves in their power, as long as one ofus could fire a pistol, or draw a knife. We now began to ascend with the tide, when it served us, and lay by when it ran down, mtil we arrived at the point where it ceased to flow. We then applied our oars, and with the help of setting-poles, and at times the aid of a cordelle, we stel.lllmd the current at the rate of one, and sometimes two miles an hour, mrtil. the tenth ofF ebruary, when we met a great rise of the river, and futmd the current so strong, that we had no power to stem it in any way. So we concluded to abandon our canoes, come to shore, bury our :fin-s, and make our way across the peninsula to the coast ofCalifurnia, which we thought from the infurrmtion of the Indians, could not be ve:ry ilistant. On the 16th, we completed the burying of our :furs, and started on fuot with our packs on our backs. The contents ofthese [153] packs were two blankets fur each man, a considerable quantity of dried beaver treat, and a rifle with the ammunition. Our first days journey was through a cowtry to the 1ast degree trying to our strength and patience. It was through the river bottom, which was thick set with low, scrubby brush, interwoven with tall grass, vines and creepers. The making our way through these was excessively slaW1h and fu.tiguing. We bad a single alleviation. There was plenty of fresh water to drink. We were so :fu.tigued at night, tbat sleep was irresistible. The weather was warm, and we kindled no fire, through rear of the savages. We started on the morning of the 18th, all complaining much of stiffuess and soreness of our limbs. We had been unused to wallcing fur a great length of time; and this commencement was a rude experiment of resuming the habit. At two in the afternoon, we reached the edge of a large salt plain, which runs parallel with the river. Here we struck a north west course, and travelled the remainder of this hot and fu.tiguing day without :finding any water. We began to suffer severely from thirst. The earth, also, was so loose and sandy, tbat at every step we sank up to our ankles, the stm beaming down a fierce radiance the while; 731122 5119/13 Pattie's Personal Narra!he, 1824--1830 which made it seem as :if the heavens and the earth were on fire. Our tongues became so parched, that not a particle of moisture flowed into our mouths. In this miserable and furlom condition, abandoned by strength, courage and hope, we found solt'e little alleviation of our misery, when the blaze of the sun was gone, and the cool night enabled us to throw down our weary and exhausted bodies mder its dewy shade. We made an early start in the morning, and pushed on as men, as thirsty as we were, naturally would, in 'the hope of finding water, until two in the afternoon. What a sight of joy! I have no words to express our delight at 'the sight of a J.ittle Jake befure us. We sprang greedily to it. The water was salt, too salt to be drank! Not the slightest :indication of any other water course, or any olt'en offresh water was anywhere in view. Far in the distance a snowcovered mountain glittered in the [154] sun, and on the opposite shore of this salt Jake, and at a distance of three or fuur miles from it, rose some bills of considerable height. We thought that from the summit of 'these hills we might possibly diqcover solt'e water. We gathered dry flags, of which there was a great abtmdance about us, and made a kind of raft, on which each one of us put his pack, and swam the Jake, pushing the 1i:ttle rafts that carried our packs, befure us. The Jake is about two hundred yards wide, and contains a great variety of fish. In length the lake stretches north and south, bounded on each shore with high, level and well timbered land, though apparently affurdlng no fresh water. When we reached the west shore of the Jake, we saw :fresh Indian fuot-prints in the sand. This assured us, that there was water at no great d.i-ltance. One of our company and myse1f started and ascended the highest peak of the hills in our view. We were not long in descrying a smoke in the south, at the distance of about ten miles. This sight gave us great courage and hope; fur we reh assured that there must be water between us and the Indian camp. In a molt'ent we started back with a vigorous step, to infurm our companions, who were resting themse1ves under the shade of a tree. The infOrmation re-animated them, as it bad us. We all shouldered our packs with a degree of alacrity, and pushed on toward the smoke.-We arrived about three in the afternoon on a small mound, wit1:rin a quarter of a mile of the Indians. We could distinctly nunner them, and futmd 'them between furty and fifty in number, and their wolt'en and children were with them Here again was arncious ground of debate, what course we should pursue? should we attempt the long and uncertain course of conciliation, befure the accomplishment of which we might perish with thirst? or should we rush among them, and buy the delicious elelt'ent which we had full in view, at the hazard of our lives? Men as thirsty as we were, would be likely to fix upon the latter ahemative, and we did so. We examined our arms to see that we were prepared to attack, or repe~ according to circ~tances, determined to fire upon them, :if they [ 15 5] showed either a disposition fur fight, or to keep us from the water. We were within a hundred and fifty yards of them befure they perceived us. As soon as they saw us they all fled to the bushes, men, women and children, as though satan was behind them We had no disposition to arrest them, but rushed forward to the water, and began to sJake our burning thirst. My father immediately cautioned us against drinking too much, pointing out at the same time the hurtful consequences. But t:ren have always proved tbemse1ves slow to resist their appetites at the command of their reason. Most of us overloaded our empty stotmebs with water, and soon became as s:ick as death. After vomiting, however, we were relieved. My mther told us that we had better stand to our anm; fur that the Indians had probably only fled to hide their wotmn and children, and prepare themselves to return and fight us. Scarcely bad he :finEhed these remarks, when we discovered them bearing down upon us, painted as black as a tlnmder cloud, and yelling like so many fiends. Some of them were armed with clubs, solt'e with bows and arrows. We all arranged ourselves to receive them, behind the top of a large fuJlen tree. When they were within rifle shot, user.lfl'lission.coml-a~mtmanlhtml/patlie/pattia.html 74/122 5/19{13 Pattie's Personal Narrati~, 1824--1830 we made signs to them to halt, or that otherwise we shoukl fire upon them They comprehended us, halted and ceased yelling, as though they wished to hear what we had to say. We made signs that we were friendly. At this they gazed in apparent confusion of thought, and seemed to be questioning each other, touching the meaning of our signs. These signs we continued to repeat. At length one of them called aloud :in Spanish, and asked us who we were? How delightful were these somtds! We answered Americans. They repeated the name, asking us ifwe were :friendly and Christians? To these questions we made a ready affirmative. They then proposed a treaty with us. Nothing coukl be more agreeable to us. At the sa:rne time we perceived that only eight of their people came to us, and the remainder oftheir company kept back. These eight that seemed to be their chief[156] me~ advanced to us, while the rest, with extren:te anxiety painted upon their countenances, stood ready :fur action. We all sat down on the ground, and commenced talking. They enquired with great precjsion, who we were, whence we came, how we arrived here, what was our object, and whether we had met with any misfummes? We answered these questions to their satismction; and soon the pipe was lit, and we commenced smoking. They then dug a hole in the gromtd, in which they buried their war axe, and professed to deposite all i1l feelings with it. The Indian of their mnnber, who spoke the Spanish language, was a fugitive from the Mission of St. Catherine.- Threatened with the punishment of some misdemeanor, he had fled from the establishment After we had :fimshed smoldng, they asked us :ff the remainder of their mnnber might not come and converse with us. This we objected to, miless they would bring their women and children with them To this order they expressed great reluctance. Tbis reluctance by no means tended to allay our previous jealousy of their pretended friendship. We asked them their reasons fur being unwilling to bring their wo:men and children? They answered promptly that they did not feel it safe to put their women and children in our power, until they were more acquainted with us. There seemed reason :in t:lm. We observed, that their men might corre, provided they wou1d leave their arms behind. To this they readily assented, and ca:lled out to their men to come on, leaving their arms behind. A part of them seemingly rrruch delighted, threw down their arms and came on. The remainder equally dissatisfied, wheeled about, and walked moodily away. The new comers sat down in a circle rotmd us. The pipe was again lit and circled round. Again the t.erim of the treaty were repeated, and they all expressed their satismction with them They observed, that their head chief was absent, at the distance of two day's journey to the south, that in three or fuur days he wou1d come and see us, desiring us to remain with them until he should come. Nothing cou1d be more opportune fur [157] us, fur we were all excessively :futigued, and needed a few days rest. After tms they went and brought their women and children, who, like the other Indians we had seen, were all stark naked. At first they were excessively shy of us. This shyness wore off; and in the course of the day changed to an eager curiosity to examine us, and an admiration of our red flannel shirts, and the white skin under them ; fur little show of whiteness was to be seen in our :fuces. They soon ventured close to us, and with their own bands opened our bosoms, uttering exclamations of curiosity and aduliration, especia.Il\"j on feeling the softness of our skn1s, in comparison of theirs. They cert..ainly seemed to prefer our complexion to theirs, notwithstanding it bad not the stamp of their :fushi.on. At length they made up to one of our companions, who was of a singularly light complexion, fuir soft skin, and blue eyes. They wanted him to strip himself naked that they might expJore him thoroughly, fur they seemed to be doubtful of his being alike white in every part of his body. This, but as mildly as possible, he refused to do. They went off and brought a quantity of dried fish of excellent quality, and presented him. We persuaded him to oblige these curious and good natured women, by giving them a full view of his body. He was persuaded to strip to his skin. This delighted them, and they conversed and laughed am:mg the:rmelves, and they came one by one and stood beside him; so as to compare their bodies with his. After this, as long as we staid, they were constantly occupied in bringing us cooked :fish and the vegetables and roots on which they are accustomed to reed. On the 25th, the head user.mission.comf-~ucl)lmlmanlhlrrUpattie/pattie.hlml 75/122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narra1f'.e, 1824--1830 chief came. He was a venerable looking man, whom I judged to be about fifty years old. His countenance was thoughtful and serious, and bm hair a little gray. At his return bm people greeted him with an acc1atmtion of yells, that made the wild desert echo. The pipe was lit, and we all sat down by him and smoked again. He was a man o1 but rew words, but of sound judgment. After the smoking was finished, he asked us the same questions which had been asked us before. We [158] made him similar answers, adding, that we wanted to travel to the Spanish settlelrents and purchase horses, 1.1pon which we might ride home to our own country, and that we would pay him well ifhe would send some ofhis men to guide us to those settlements. He asked us in reply, what we bad to give him? We showed him our blankets, and he expressed himself delighted with them, observing at the same time, that he would have preferred to have had red cloth. On this we pulled off our red shirts and stripped them into small pieces like ribbons, and distributed them among the people. They tied the strips round their legs, arrm and heads, and seemed as much overjoyed with these small tatters of worn red flatme~ as we should have been, to have brought our furs to a good market am:mg our own people. In giving away our red shirts, we gave away, what in this warm climate was to us wholly unnecessary. To cany our blankets on our backs was a useless burden We gave two of them to the chief The two guides that he was to send with us we were to pay after our arrival at the Spanish settlements. These points of contract between us were settled to the mutual satisfuction of aD. We started on the 26th, with our two guides, neither of whom could speak Spanish, and of course we had nothing to do but fullow them in silence. We struck off a south west course, which led in the direction of the snow covered mountain, which still loomed up in its brightness before us. Our guides made signs that we should arrive at the fuot about midnight, though the distance appeared to us to be too great to be travelled over in so short a time. We were yet to learn, that we should find no water, until we drank that of the mehed snow. We perceived, however, that their travelling gait, worn as we were, was more rapid than ours. We pushed on as fust as we could a league :further, when we were impeded by a high hill in our way, which was about another league to the swnmit, and very precipitous and steep. When we reached the top of it we were much exhausted, and began to be thirsty. We could then see the arid salt plain stretching all the way :from the root of this bill to the snow covered mountains. [159] We thought it inexpedient to enquire of our guides, if there was no water to be fuund between us and the mountain. It appeared but too probable, that such was the fuct. To know it to a certainty, would only tend to unnerve and dishearten us. If there was any, we were aware that we should reach it by travelling no more distance than as if we knew the met. We romd it best to encourage the little hope that remained, and hurried on through the drifted sand, in which we sank up to our ankles at every step. The cloudless sun poured such a blaze upon it, that by the scorching' of our fuet, it might have seemed almost hot enough to roast eggs in. What with the fierce sun and the scorching sand, and our extreme fatigue, the air seemed soon to have extracted every particle of moisture' :from our bodies. In this condition we marched on until nearly the middle of the day, without descrying any indication of water in any quarter. A small shrubby tree stood in our way, affording a tolerable shade. We ]aid ourselves down to ts\"t a rew minutes rest. The Indians stern]y beckoned us to be up and onward, now fur the first 1in1e clearly explaining to us, that there was no water until we reached the mountains in view. 'Ibis l.IDSeasonable and yet necessary :infurmation, extinguished the last remainder of our hope, and we openly expressed ow rears that we should none of us ever reach it. We attempted to chew tobacco. It would raise no moisture. We took our bullets in our mouths, and moved them round to create a moisture, to relieve our parched throats. We bad travelled but a little further before our tongues had became so dry and swollen, that we could scarcely speak so as to be understood. In this extremity of nature, we should, perhaps, have silllk voluntarily, had not the relief been still in view on the sides of the snow covered mountains. We resorted to one expedient to moisten ow lips, tongue and throat, disgusting to reJate, and still more disgusting to adopt In such predicaments it bas been round, that nature disburdens people of all conditions of 76/122 5119113 Paf:lie's Personal Narrali-.e, 1824--1830 ceremony and disgust. Every thing bends to the devouring thirst, and the love of lifu. The application of this [160] hot and salt liquid seemed rather to emage tban appease the torturing appetite. Though it offered such a semblance of what woukl satisty thirst, that we economized every particJe. Our amiab]e Dutchman was of a sweetness of temper, that was never ru:ffled, and a cahmess and patience that appeared proof against an events. At another time, what Jaugbter woukl have circulated through our camp, to hear him make merry of this expedient! As it was, even in this horrible condition, a fuint smile circulated through our company, as he discussed his substitute fur drink. 'Vell, mine poys, dis vater of mein ish more hotter as hell, und as dick as boudden, und more zaher as de zeas. I can't drink him. For Cod's sake, gifme some of yours, dat is more tinner.' Having availed ourselves to the utmost of this terrible expedient, we marched on in company a fuw miles further. Two of our companions here gave out, and lay down under the shade of a bush. Their tongues were so swollen, and their eyes so sunk in their heads, that they were a spectacle to behold. We were scarcely able, from the condition of our own mouths, to bid them an articulate farewell We never expected to see them again, and none of us had much hope of ever reaching the mountain, which still raised\u00b7 its white summit at a great distance from us. It was with difficulty that we were enabled to advance one fuot befure the other. Our limbs, our powers, even our very resolutions seemed palsied. A circumstance that added to our distress, was the excessive and dazzling brightness of the sw's rays, so reflected in our eyes :from the white sand that we were scarcely able to see our way befure us, or in what direction to fOllow our guides. They, accustomed to go naked, and to traverse these burning deserts, and be waffected by such~. appeared to stand the heat and drought, hke came1s on the Arabian sands. They, however, tried by their looks and gestures to encourage us, and induce us to quicken our pace. But it was to no purpose. However, we still kept moving onward, and had gained a fuw miles more, when night brought us she1ter at least from the insupportable radiance of the sun, and smrething of coolness and moisture. [161] But it was so dark, that neither we or our guides could discover the course. We stopped, and made a large fire, that our companions, if yet living, and able to move, might see where we were, and how to direct their own course to reach us. We a1so fired some guns, which, to our great relief and pleasure, they answered by firing ofl theirs. We still repeated firing guns at interva1s, until they came up with us. They supposed that we bad fuund water, which invigorated their spirits to such a degree, that it aroused them to the effurt they had made. When they had arrived, and fuund that we bad reached no water, they appeared to be angry, and to complain that we bad disturbed their repose with fu1se hopes, and had hindered their dying in peace. One of them in the recklessness oi despair, drew from his package a small phial, half full of laudanwn, and drank it off; I suppose in the hope of sleeping himself quietly to death. We an expected it would have that effuct. On the contrary, in a fuw moments he was exbilarated, bke a man in a state of intox:icatimL He was full of talk, and Jaughter, and gaiety of heart. He observed, that he bad taken it in hopes that it would put him to s1eep, never to wake again, but that in fuct, it had made him as well, and as fresh, as in the morning when he started; but that if he had imagined that it would prove such a sovereign remedy fur thirst, he would cr.eerful]y have shared it with us. We scraped dmvn beneath t.lre burning surface of the sand, until we reached the earth that was a litt:1e cool We then stripped off all our clothing and Jay down Our two Indians, also Jay down beside us, covering themselves with their blankets. My father bade me lay on the edge of one of their blankets, so that they could not get up without awakening me. He was fearful that they would arise, and fly from us in the night. I implicitly confOrmed to my :father's wish, fur bad this event happened, we should an undoubtedly have perished. But the Indians appear to have meditated no such expedient, at any rate, they Jay quiet until morning. As soon as there was Hgbt enough to enable us to travel we started, much refreshed by the coolness of the night, and the [162] sleep we had taken. We began our morning march with renewed alacrity. At about ten in the furenoon we arrived at the fuot of a sand hill about a half a mile in height, and very steep. The side was composed 77/1'22. 5119113 Pattie's Personal NarratiiA'l, 1824--1830 of 1oose sand, which gave way under our reet, so that our advancing root steps would slide back to their rormer places. This soon exhausted our little remaining strength; though we still made many an unavailing e:ffurt to ascend. The sm. was now so high, as to beam upon us with the same insu:ffurable raruance of yesterday. The air which we :inhaled, seemed to scald our lungs. We at length concluded to travel towards the north, to reach, if we might, some point where the hill was not so steep to ascend. At two in the afiernoon we fuund a place that was neither so steep nor so high, and we determined here to attempt to cross the bill. With great exertions and infinite difficulty, a part o1 us gained the summit of the hill; but my futher and another of our company, somewhat advanced in years, gave out below, though they made the most persevering efforts to reach the summit of the hill with the rest. Age bad stiflened their joints, and laid his palsying band upon their once active limbs, and vigorous fratnes. They could endure this dreadful journey no longer. They had become so exhausted by :fiuitless e:lfurts to climb the hill, that they could no hnger drag one fuot after the other. They bad each so completely abandoned the hope of ever reaching the water, or even gaining the summit of the hill, that they threw the.rmelves on the ground, apparently convinced of their mte, and resigned to die. I :instantly determined to remain with my father, be it fur :ti.:fu or death. To this determination he would by no means consent, as he remarked it would bring my destruction, without its availing him. On the contrary, he insisted, that I should go on with the rest, and if I fuund any water near at hand, that I should return with my powder hom full. In this way he assured me, I might be :instrumental in saving my own lire, and saving him at the same time. To this I consented, and with much fatigue gained the summit of the hill, where my companions were seated waiting fur us. They seemed undetermined, [163] whether to advance onward, or wait fur my father, until I related his determination. My purpose was to proceed onward only so fur, as that, if the Almighty should enable us to reach water, I might be able to return with a powder hom full to him and Mr. S1over, (fur that was the name of the elderly companion that retmined with him) This reso:Jution was agreed to by aD, as a proper one. Being satisfied by our consciences as well as by the reasoning of my father and his companion, that we could render them no service by remaining with them, except to increase their su:trerings by a view of ours; and aware, that every moment was precious, we pushed on once more fur the mountain. Having descended this hill, we ascended another of the same wearying ascent, and sandy character with the funrer. We toiled on to the top of it. The Eternal Power, who hears the ravens when they cry, and provideth springs in the wilderness, had bad mercy upon us! Imagine my joy at seeing a clear, beautiful running stream of water, just be:low us at the fuot of the hill! Such a blissful sight I had never seen befure, and never expect to see again. We all ran down to it, and :full to drinkfug. In a fuw moments nothing was to be heard among us, but vomiting and groaning. Notwithstanding our mutual charges to be cautious, we bad overcharged our parched stomachs with this cold snow water. Notwithstanding I was sick myself; I emptied my powder hom of its contents, filled it with water, and accompanied by one companion, who had also filled his powder hom, I returned towards my :father and Mr. SJover, his exhausted cornpanirm, v,.rith a quick step. We fuw..d them in the same position in which we had left them, that :is, stretched on the sand at full length, under the unc:louded blaze of the sun, and both fast asleep; a sleep :from which, but for our relie~ I believe they would neither of them ever have awakened. Their lips were black, and their parched mouths wide open. 781122 'Ihei-uum.wi:lg poBture and m sunken eyes 10 ~ ~ that I nm in a mght tD my i.br10 thinking him, ibr a m.m:eut, n:taly dead.

We gave them each a blanket, and they started back to their own people on the n:nming of the 8th. At the same time we commenced our journey wi1h our new guides, and began to climb the mountain. This is so exceedingly lofty, as to require two days' travel and a half to gain its summit. During this ascent, I severely bruised my heel We none of us wore any thing to shield our reet :from the bare and sharp rocks, which composed ahnost the whole surface of this ascent, but thin deer skin moccasins. ObJiged to walk on tip toe, and in extreme anguish, the severe fatigue oi scrambling up sharp stones was any thing, mther than agreeable. But I sumrmned patience and courage to push on until the 12th. My leg then became so swollen and :in:flamed that it was out of my power to travel firrther. The pain was so severe as to create rever. I lay myself down on the side of a sharp rock, resigning myself to my fate, and determined to make no e:ffurt to travel :further, until I relt relieved. My companions all joined with my futher, in encouraging me to rise, and make an e:ffurt to reach the mission, which they represented to be but three miles distant. It was out of the question fur me to think of it, and they concluded to go to the settlement, and obtain a horse, and send out fur me. I kindled me a :fire, fur I sl..l.'fi:ered severe chills. The Indians gave me the strictest caution against allowing myself to go to sleep in their absence. The reason they assigned fur their caution was a substantia] one. The grizzly bear, they said, was common on these mountains, and would attack and devour me, unless I kept on my guard. I paid little attention to their remarks at the time. But when they were gone, and I was left alone, I examined the priming, and picked the flints of my gun and pistol I then Jay down and slept, until somrtime in the early part of the night, when [166] two Indians came out from the settlement, and informed me that the corporal of the guards at St. Catbarines wished me to come in. Being feverish, stiff; sore and withal testy, I gave them and their corporal no very civil words. They said that the corporal only wanted me to come in, because he was afraid the grizzly bears would kill me. I asked them why they did not bring a horse fur me? They infurmed me, that the Mission bad none at disposal at that time, but that they would carry me on their backs. So I was obliged to avail myself of this strange conveyance, and mounted the back of one of them while the other carried my arms. In this way they carried me in, where I found my companions in a guard house. I was ordered to enter wi1h them by a swarthy looking rellow, who resembled a negro, rather than a white. I cannot describe the indignation I relt at this revolting breach of humanity to people in suffering, who had thrown thetDSelves on the kindness and protection of these Spaniards. We related the reasons why we bad come in after this manner. We showed them our passport, which certified to them, that we were neither robbers, murderers, nor spies. To all this their only reply was, how should they know whether we had come clandestinely, and with improper views, or not? Against this question, proposed by such people, all reasonings were thrown away.-The cowardly and worthless are naturally cruel We were thrown completely in their power; and instead of that circumstance exciting any generous desires to console and relieve us, their only study seemed to be to vex, degrade, and torrrxmt us. Here we reiP.ained a week, liviP..g on com mush, which we received once a day; when a guard of soldiers ca:me to conduct us from thi<; place. This mission is situated in a valley, surrounded by high mountains, with beautiful streams of water :flowing from them The natives raise sufficient com and wheat to serve fur the subsistence of the mission. The mission establishment :is built in a quadrangular furm; all the houses furrning the quadrangle contiguous to each other; and one of the angles is a large church, adjoining which are the habitations of [167] the priests; though at this time there happened to be none belonging to this at home. The number of Indians belonging to the mission at this time, was about five lnmdred. They were destitute of stock, on accmmt of its having been phmdered from them by the free, wild fudians of the desert. The air is very cool and temperate, and bard frosts are not uncommon This cool temperature of the atmosphere I suppose to be owing to the immediate proximity of the snowy mountains. On the 18th, we started under the conduct of a file of soldiers, who led us two days' trave~ over very high 80/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrati~.e, 1824--1830 mountains, a south west course, to another mission, caJled St Sebastian, situated near the sea coast, in a de1ightfu1 vaiiey, surrounded, like the other, by lofty moun1:a:ios, the sides of which present magnificent views of the ocean. This mission contains six hundred souls. This mission establishment, though much richer and neater than the other, :is, however, built on a precisely similar plan. Here they have rich vineyards, and raise a great variety of the fruits of ahnost all climates. They also raise their own supplies of grain, and have a tolerable abundance of stock, both of the larger and smaller kinds. A serjeant has the whole military command. We round him of a dark and swarthy comp:lexion, though a man oi tolerable infurmation. He seemed disposed to conduct towards us with some courtesy and kindness. He saluted us with politeness, conducted us to the guard house, and begged us to content ourselves, as well as we could, mtil he could make some more satisfu.ctory arrangements fur our com.furt and convenience. To put him to the proof of his pro:fussed kindness, we told him that we were very hungry. They soon had a poor steer k:illed, that reeled as it walked, and seemed sinking by natural decay. A part of the bhre flesh was put boiling m one pot, and a parcel oi com m the other. The whole process reminded :me strongly of the arrangements which we make in Kentucky, to prepare a mess fur a diseased cow. When this fu:mous fuast was cooked, we were marched furth into the yard, in great ceremony, to eat it. All the men, women and children clustered round us, and [168] stood staring at us while we were eating, as though they had been at a menagerie to see some wild and unknown animals.- When we were fairly seated to our pots, and began to discuss the contents, d:isgu.'jted alike with the fuod, with them, and their behaviour, we could not furbear asking them whether they really took us to be human beings, or considered us as brutes? They looked at each other a mo:me:nt, as if to reflect and :f:i:arre an answer, and then replied coolly enough, that not being Christians, they considered us little superior to brutes. To this we replied, with a suitable mixture of indignation and scorn, that we considered ourselves better Cmtians than they were, and that if they did not give us something to eat more befitting men, we would take our guns, live where we pleased, and eat venison and other good things, where we chose. This was not mere bravado, fur, to our astonishment, we were still in possession of our arms. We bad made no resistance to their treating us as prisoners, as we considered them nothing more than petty and ignorant officers, whom we supposed to have conducted improperly, from being unacquainted with their duty. We were all confident, that as soon as intelligence of our arrival should reach the commanding officer ofthis station, and how we had been detained, and treated as prisoners, we should not only be released from prison, but recompensed fur our detention. This determination of ours appeared to alarm them The infurmation of our menaces, no doubt with their own cormnents, soon reached the serjeant. He immediately came to see us, while we were yet at our pots, and enquired of us, what was our ground of complaint and dissatisfaction? We pointed to the pots, and asked him if he thought such fuod becoming the laws ofhospitality to such people? He stepped up to the pots, and turning over the contents, and examining them with his :fingers, enquired in an angry tone, who had served up such rood to us? He added, tlmt it was r.ot fit to give a dog, and tlmt he would punish those who had procured it. He cornfurted us, by assuring us that we should have something fit to eat cooked fur us. We immediately returned quietly to the guard house. But a [ 169] short time ensued befure he sent us a good dish of fut mutton, and some tortillas. This was precisely the thing our appetites craved, and we were not long in making a hearty meal After we had red to our satisfaction, he came to visit us, and interrogated us in what manner, and with what views we had visited the country? We went into clear, full and satisfactory details of infOrmation m regard to every thing that could have any interest to him, as an officer; and told him that our object was to purchase horses, on which we might return to our own country; and that we wished him to intercede in our behalf with the commander in chie:t; that we might have permission to purchase horses and mules among them, fur this purpose. He promised to do this, and returned to his aparlment. user was, that he would reflect upon the subject, and in the course offuur days write to his co1111.1Ja1:1der, from whom he might expect an answer in a furtnight.- When we somded him as to the probability of such a request being granted, he answered with apparent conviction, that he had no doubt that it woukl be in our favor. As our hopes were intensely fixed upon this issue, we awaited 1his answer with great anxiety. The commander at this time was at the port of San Diego. During this period of our suspense, we had full liberty to hunt deer in the woods, and gather honey from the blossoms of the Masca\\ which grows plentifuily on the sea shore. Every thing in this strange and charming country being new, we were continually contemplating curiosities of every sort, which quieted our solicitude, and kept alive the :interest of our attention. We used to station ourselves on the high pinnacles of the cli:fiS, on which this vast sea pours its tides, and the retreating or advancing tide showed us the strange sea monsters of that ocean, such as sea1s, sea otters, sea elephants, wha1es, sharks, sword fish, and various other unshapely sea dwellers. Then we walked on the beach, and examined the infinite variety of sea shells, all new and strange to us. Thus we amused ourselves, and strove to kill the time until the 20th, when the answer of the commander arrived, which [170] explained itself at once, by a guard of soldiers, with orders to conduct us to the port of San Diego, where he then resided. We were ordered to be in immediate readiness to start fur that port. This gave uq umning1ed satisfaction, fur we bad an undoubting confidence, that when we shoukl reaDy have attained the presence of an officer whom we supposed a gentleman, and acting independently of the authority of others, he would make no difficulty in granting a request so reasonable as ours. We started on the 2d, guarded by sixteen soldiers and a corporal They were a1l on horseback, and allowed us occasionally to ride, when they saw us nmch mtigued. Our first day's journey was a north course, over very rough Irountains, and yet, notwithstanding this, we made twenty\u00ad five miles distance on our way. At night we arrived at ano1her :mission, situated like 1he funner, on a charming plain. The :mission is called St. Thomas. These wise and holy ~ren mean to make sure of the rich and pleasant things of the earth, as well as the kingdom of heaven. They have large plantations, with splendid orchards and vineyards. The priest who presides over this establis~nt, told Ire that he bad a thousand Indians tmder his care. During every week in the year, they kill thirty beeves fur the subsistence of the mission. The hides and tallow they sell to vessels that visit their coast, in exchange fur such goods as they need. On 1he fullowing Iroming, we started early down 1his valley, which led us to the sea shore, along which we travelled the remainder of the day. This beautiful plain skirts the sea shore, and extends back from it about fuur miles. This was literally covered with horses and cattle belonging to the mission. The eye was lost beyond this bandsoJ.re plain in contemplating an immeasurable range ofmountains, which we were told thronged with wild horses and cattle, which often descend from their mountains to the plains, and entice away the domesticated cattle with them The wild oats and clover grow spontaneously, and in great luxuriance, and were now knee high. In the evening we arrived at the port ofTodos Santos, and there passed the night. Early on the 23d, we marched on. This day we [171] travelled over soire tracts that were very rough, and arrived at a mission situated :irmnediately on the sea board, called St. Michael Like the rest, it was surrounded with splendid orchards, vineyards and :fields; and was, fur soil, climate and position, all that could be wished. The old superinte:ndfug priest of the establishment showed himself very friendly, and equaDy inquisitive. He invited us to sup with him, an :invitation we should not be very likely to refuse. We sat down to a large table, elegantly furnished with various dishes of the country, all as usual highly seasoned. Above aD, the supply of wines was various and abundant. The priest said grace at the close, when fire and cigars were brought in by the attendants, and we began to smoke. We sat and s1roked, and drank wine, until 12 o'clock. The priest infunned us that the population ofbis mission was twelve hundred souls, and the weekly and a corresponding amount of grain The mission possessed three thousand head of domesticated and tamed horses and mules. From the droves which I saw in the plains, I should not think this an extravagant estimation. In the morning he presented my mther a sadd1e mile, which he accepted, and we started. This day's travel still carried us directly along the verge of the sea shore, and over a plain equally rich and beautifuJ with that of the preceding day. We amused ourselves with noting the spouting of the huge whales, which seemed p1aying near the strand fur our especial amusement. We saw other marine animals and curiosities to keep our interest in the journey alive. In the evening we arrived at a Ranch, called Buenos Aguos, or Good Water, where we encamped fur the night. We started early on the 25th, purchasing a sheep of a shepherd, fur which we paid him a knife. At this Ranch they kept thirty thousand head of sheep, belonging to the mission which we had left. We crossed a point of the mountain that made into the water's edge. On the opposite side of this motmtain was another Ranch, where we staid the night. This Ranch is fur the purposes ofhenling horses and cattle, of which [172] they have vast numbers. On the 26th, our p1ain lay outstretched befure us as beautiful as ever. In the evening we came in sight of San Diego, the p1ace where we were bound. In this port was one merchant vesse~ which we were told was from the United States, the ship Franklin, of Boston. We had then arrived within about a league of the port. The corporal who had charge of us here, came and requested us to give up our arrm, infOrming us, it was the customary request to all strangers; and that it was expected that our arms would be deposited in the guard house before we could speak with the commander, or general We replied, that we were both able and disposed to carry ow: arms to the guard house ourselves, and deposite them there if such was our pleasure, at our own choice. He replied that we could not be allowed to do this, fur that we were considered as prisoners, and under his charge; and that he shou1d become responsible in his own person, if he should allow us to appear befure the genera~ bearing our own arrm. This he spoke with a countenance of seriousness, which induced us to think that he desired no rmre in this request than the perfunmnce ofhis duty. We therefure gave him up our rifles, not thinking that this was the last ~ we should have the pleasw:e of shouldering these trusty friends. Having l.IDburdened ourselves of our defence, we marched on again, and arrived, much :fatigued, at the town at 3 o'clock in the evening. Our arms were stacked on the side of the guard house, and we threw our :fatigued bodies as near them as we could, on the ground. An officer was dispatched to the general to infurm him of our a.rriva1, and to know whether we could have an :immediate audience or not? In a short time the officer returned with an answer fur us, that we rrrust remain where we were until morning, when the general would give us a hearing. We were still sanguine in seeing on]y o~ns of good. We furgot our past troubles, opened ow: bosom to hope, and resigned ourselves to profuund sleep. It is true, imru:merable droves of fleas perfurmed their evolutions, and bit all their pleasw:e upon our bodies.-[173] But so entire was our repose, that we scarcely tmned fur the night. No dre~ of what was in reserve fur us the fulhwing day floated across our :minds; though in the morning my body was as spotted as though I had the ~asles, and my shirt specked with :innumerable stains ofblood, let by the ingenious 1ancets of these same Spanish fleas. On the 27th, at eight A M., we were ushered into the generars office, with our hats in our hands, and he began his string of interrogations. The first question was, who we were? We answered, Americans. He proceeded to ask us, how we came on the coast, what was our object, and had we a passport? In answer to these questions we again went over the story of our misfurttmes. We then gave him the passport which we had received from the governor of Santa Fe. He examined this instrument, and with a sinister and malicious smile, observed, that he believed nothing of an this, but considered us worse than thieves and murderers; in met, that he held us to be spies fur the old Spaniards, and that our business was to lurk about the country, that we might inspect the weak and defenceless points of the frontiers, and point them out to the Spaniards, in order that they might introduce their troops into the user he would utterly detect us, and prevent our designs.- This Jast remark he uttered with a look of vengeance; and then reperused the passport, which be tore in pieces, saying, it was no passport, but a vile furgery of our own contrivance. Though amazed and confinmded at such an unexpected charge, we firmly asserted our innocence in regard to any of the charges brought against us. We infurmed him that we were born and bred thorough and full blooded republicans; and that there was not a man of us who wouki not prefer to die, rather than to be the spies and instruments of the Spanish king, or any other king; and that but a rew years since, we had all been engaged in fighting the furces of a king, allied with savages, and sent against the country of our home; and that on this very expedition we had been engaged in a great many battles wi1h the Indians, hostile to bE people, redeeming their captives, [ 17 4] and pUiliming their robberies and murders. In distress, and in want of every thing from the robbery oftbese hostile Indians, we had taken refuge :in bE country, and claimed its protection. We told him we considered it an mworthy return fur such general deportment, and such particular services to their country, that we shoukl be viewed as spies, and treated as prisoners. He stopped us :in the midst of our plea, apparently through rear that representations, which must have carried conviction to his prejudiced mind, might tend to soften his obdurate heart, and unnerve his purpose towards us. He toki us be did not wish to hear any :more of our long speeches, which he considered no better than lies; fur that if we had been true and bona fide citizens of the United States, we should not have left our country without a passport, and the certificate of our chief magistrate. We replied that the laws o1 our country did not require that honest, comroon citizens, should carry passports; that it did not interfure with the :individual business and pursuits of private individuals; that such persons went abroad and returned umroted by the government; and :in all well regu]ated states, su:fficiently protected by the proof that they were citizens of the United States; but that there were in our country two classes of people, fur whom passports were necessary, slaves and soldiers; that fur the slave it was necessary to have one, to certi:fY that he was travelling with the knowledge and permission of his master; and fur the so:ldier, to show that he was on fin\"lougb, or otherwise abroad with the permission of his officer. As we spoke this with emphasis, and fimmess, he told us that he bad had enough of our falsehoods, and begged us to be quiet. He ordered us to be remanded to our prison, and was immediately obeyed. As we were driven out ofhis office, my :father, who was exceedingly exasperated, observed, 'my boys, as soon as we arrive in the guard house, Jet us seize our arms and redress ourselves, or die in the attempt; fur it seems to me that these scoundrels mean to murder us.' We all unanirmusly agreed to this advice, and walked back with a willing mind, and an alert step. [175] But our last hope of redressing ourselves, and obtaining our liberty was soon extinguished. On entering the guard house, our arms had been re:rnoved we knew not where. They had even the impudence to search our persons and to take from us even our pocket knives. The orderly sergeant then told us, that he was under the necessity of placing us in separate apart:rnents. This last declaration seemed the death stroke to us all. Affiiction and mutual sufrering and danger bad endeared us to each other, and this separation seemed like rending our:hearts. Overcome by the suddermess oftb.e blow, I threw :mya.rms round the neck ofmyfuther, burst :into tears, and excla:itmd, 'that I furesaw, that the parting would be furever.' Though my :futher seemed subdued, and absorbed in meditation, he reproved this expression of my feelings, as weak and umnanly. The sergeant having observed my grie\u00a3: asked me, pointing to him, if that was my father? When he learned that it was, he showed himself :in some degree affucted, and remarked, that it seemed cruel to separate futher and child, and that he would go and explain the relationship to the general, and see if be coukl not obtain permission fur us to remain together. On this he set oft' fur the generafs office, leaving me :in the agony of suspense, and the rest gazing at each other in mute consternation and astonishment The sergeant returned, :infunning me, that instead of being softened, the general had orily been exasperated, and had in nothing relaxed his orders, which were, that we must immediately be put :in separate confinement He accordingly ordered some sokiiers to assist :in locking us up. We embraced each other, and fullowed our conductors to our separate prisons. I can affirm, that I had only wished to live, to sustain 84/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narralill!l, 1824--1830 the increasing age and infirmities of my mther. When I shook bands with him, and we were tom :in sunder, I will say nothing of my feelings, fur words would have no power to describe them As I entered my desolate apartment, the sergeant seerred really a:flected, and assured me, that neither my companions nor myself shoukl su:fler any want oi fuod or ~ as fur as he coukl prevent it, fur that he did not consider us guilty, nor worthy of such treatment. [176] My prison was a cell eight or ten feet square, with walls and floor of stone. A door with iron bars an inch square crossed over each other, hl<:e the bars of window sashes, and it grated on its iron binges, as it opened to receive rre. Over the external front of this prison was :inscribed in capital1etters Destinacion de la Cattivo. Our blankets were given us to lie upon. My :father had a stmll package of medicines which he gave in charge to the sergeant, binding him on his word ofhonor not to part with it to any one. My door was locked, and I was left to reflect upon our position and my past misfurhmes; and to survey the dreary walls of my prison. Here, I thought, was my everlasting abode. Liberty is dear to every one, but doubly dear to one, who had been :from :infuncy accustorred to free range, and to be guided by his o-wn Will. Put a man, who has ranged the prairies, and exulted in the wilderness, as I have fur years, in a prison, to let him have a full taste of the blessings of :freedom, and the horror of shackles and confinement! I passed the remainder of the day in fierce walking backwards and furwards over my stone floor, with no object to contemplate, but my swarthy sentine~ through the grate. He seemed to be true to his office, and fitly selected for his business, fur I thought I saw him Jook at me through the grate with the natural exultation and joy of a bad and malicious heart in the view of misery. When the darkness of night came to this dreary place, it was the darkness of the grave. Every ray of light was extinct I spread my blankets on the stone floor, in hopes at least to find, fur a rew hours, in the oblivion of sleep, some repose from the agitation of my thoughts. But in this hope I was disappointed. With every other friend and solace, sleep too, fled from me. My active mind ranged every where, and returned only to unavailing effurts to imagine the condition and feelings of my futb.er and what woukl be our u1timate mte. I shut my eyes by an effurt, but nature would have her way, and the eyelids would not close. At length a glimtrer of dayligbt, through my grate, relieved this long and painful effurt to sleep. I arose, went to my grate, [177] and took all possible survey of what I could see. Directly in front of it was the door of the gen.erars office, and he was standing in it. I gaEd on him awhile. Ab! that I bad bad but my trusty rifle well charged to my mcel Could I but have had the pleasure of that single shot, I think I would have been willing to have purchased it by my life. But wishes are not rifle balls, and will not kill The church bell told eight in the morning. The drum rolled. A soldier came, and handed me in something to eat. It proved to be dried beans and corn cooked with rancid tallow! The contents were about a pint I took it up, and brought it within the reach of my nostrils, and sat it down in unconquerable loathing. When the soldier retmned in the evening to bring me more, I handed him my morning ration untasted and just as it was. He asked me in a grufl tone why I had not eaten it? I told him the smell of it was enough, and that I could not eat :it. He threw the contents of the dish in my mce, muttering something which amounted to saying, that it was good enough fur such a brute as I was. To this I answered, that ifbeing a brute gave claims upon that dish, I thought he had best eat it hil.melf On this he flung away in a passion, and retmned no more that night, for which I was not sorry. Had the fuod even been fit to eat, my thoughts were too dark and my mind too much agitated to allow me appetite. In met, I fult myself becoming sick. At night I was visited by the serjeant, who asked me about my health and spirits in a tone and manner, that indicated real kindness of reeling. I trusted in the reality of his sympathy, and told him, I was not we11 He then questioned me, if I had eaten any thing? I told him no, and explained to him the double reason, why I had eaten user .mission.coml-crudy'mtrnanlhlmltpattialpattie.hlml 85/122 5/19/13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 11324--1830 nothing. He answered that he would remove one of the causes, by sending me something good. I then asked him if he had seen my father? He said he had, though he had been unable tn hold any conversation with him, fur want of his understanding Spanish. I thanked him fur this :manifustation of friendship, and he left me. In a [178] short time he returned with two well cooked and seasoned dishes. I begged him tn take it first tn my father, and when he had eaten what he wished, he might bring the remainder to me, and I would share it among my companions. He assured me that my father was served with the same kind offuod, and that my companions should not be furgotten in the distribution. While I was eating, he remained with me, and asked me, ifi had a mother, and brothers, and sisters in my own country? My heart was :fu11, as I answered him He proceeded tn question me, how Jong it bad been since I had seen them or heard :from them, and in what I had been occupied, during my Jong absence :from my country? My misfOrtunes appeared to affuct him When I had finished eating, he enquired how I had passed the preceding night? In all his questions, he dispJayed true humanity and tenderness of heart. When he left me, be affuctionately wished me good night. This night passed as sleepless and uncomibrtable as the preceding one. Next day the kind serjeant brought my dinner again, though from anxiety and growing indisposition I was unable to eat. At night he came again with my supper, and to my surprise accompanied by his sister, a young lady of great personal beauty. Her first enquiry was that of a kind and affuctionate nature, and concerned my father. She enquired about my age, and all the circumstances that induced me to leave my country? I took leave to intimate in my answer, my extreme anxiety tn see my relatives, and return tn my country, and in particular, that it was like depriving me of life, in this strange Jand, and in pmon, tn separate me :from my old and infirm father. She assured me that she would pray fur our salvation, and attempt to intercede with the general in our behalf; and that while we retnained in prison, she would allow us to suffur nothing, which her power, means or influence could supply. She then wished me a good night, and departed. I know not what is the influence of the ministration of a kind spirit, like hers, but this night my sleep was sound and dreamless. She :frequently repeated these kind visits, and redeemed to the letter all her pledges ofkindness. For I su:ffured fur nothing [179] in regard to fuod or drink. A bed was provided fur me, and even a change of c1othing. This undeviating kindness greatly endeared her to me. About tim time, Captain John Bradshaw, of the ship Franklin, and Rufus Perkins, his supercargo, asked leave of the general, to come and visit us. The general denied them But Captain Bradshaw, like a true hearted American, disregarded the little brief authority of this miserable republican despot, and fearless of danger and the consequences, came to see me without leave. When I spoke to him about our buried -furs, he asked me about the chances and the means we had tn bring them in? And whether we were disposed to rmke the effurt, and if we succeeded, to sell them to him? The prisoners, as he separately applied to them, one and an assured him, that nothing would give them rrore pleasure. He assured us, that he wouki leave nothing in his power 'Wldone, in making effurts to deliver us :from our confinement. We thanked him fur this proffured :friendship, and he departed. His first effurts in our fuvor were directed to gaining the fri.endship of the general, in order to soften his :feelings in regard to us. But in this he entirely failed. He then adopted an innocent stratagem, which was more successful He infurmed the general that he had business with a Spanish merchant in port, which he could not transact fur want of some one who could speak the language fluently, who would interpret fur him, that he understood that one of the American prisoners could speak the language perfuctly weD, and that if he would allow that prisoner to come and interpret fur him a fuw hours, he would bind himself in a bond to any amount, that the prisoner at the expiration oi his services, would return voluntarily to his prison. To this the general gave his consent. Captain Bradshaw came to my prison, and I was permitted by the general's order to leave my prison When I went abroad, Captain Bradshaw conducted me to the office of an old captain, who had charge of the arms. We begged him tn intercede with the general to obtain his pennission, that we might go out and bring in our furs. user.mission.com'-cr~mimanlh1mf/pattie/pattia.hlml 861122 5119/13 Pattie's Captain Bradshaw and the supercargo, Rufus Perkins, would be our security in any amount, that the general was d:iqposed to n.attiD, that we wouki return, and surrender ourselves to him, at the close of the expedition. He was at once satisfied of our honor and integrity, and. that we were by no :means those spies, whom the general took us fur, and he promised to use all his irrlluence with the general, to persuade him to dispatch us fur our furs. We assured him, that in addition to our other proofS, that we were bonafide Americans, and true republicans, we had docmnents under the proper signature ofthe President of the United States, which we hoped, wouki be sufficient to satisfY him, and every one, who we were. He asked to see those papers, of which I spoke. I told him they were my :father's commission of first lieutenant in the ranging servlce, during the late war with England, and an honorable discharge at the close of the war. He promised to communicate this infunmtion to the general and departed, proposing to return in balfan hour. During this interval we walked to my :father's cell and I had the satisfuction of speaking with him tbrough the grates. He asked :rne if I had been visited by a beautiful young lady? When I assented, he replied, that this charming young woman, as a ministering angel, had also visited his cell with every sort of kindness and relief; which she had extended to each one of our companions. I had the satisfuction afterwards, of speaking with each one of our companions. I need not add, how much delighted we were to speak with one another once more. From these visits I returned to the office of the captain of arms. We found him waiting with the most painful intelligence. Nothing could move the general, to allow us to go out and bring in our furs. He expressed a wish, notwithstanding, to see the commission of which I had spoken, and that I should return to my ceD. I gave the papers to Captain Bradshaw, requesting him to return them to my :futher, after the general should have examined them This he promised, and I took my leave of him, returning to my dreary prison, less buoyant and more completely desponding of my Hberty than ever. [181] In a rew moments Captain Bradshaw and Perkins Caire again to my cell and said that the general had no :faith in our papers, and couki not be softened by any entreaty, to give us our Hberty. As he said this, the sentine1 Caire up, and stopped him short in his conversation, and ordered them off affirming, that it was the generars express comrm.nd, that he shouki not be a1lowed to see or speak with me again. They however pledged their honor as they left :me, that whenever an occasion ofi:ered, they would yield us all the assistance in their power, and wishing me better fu:rtune, they departed A furtnight elapsed in this miserable prison, during which I had no other consolation, than the visits of the young lady, and even these, such was the strictness of the general's orders, were like all angel visits, few and far between. At length a note was presented me by the seljeant, from my :futher. What a note! I appeal to the heart of every good son to understand what passed within me. This note was written on a piece of paste board tom from his hat The characters were almost illegible, fur they were written with a stick, and the ink was blood, drawn from his aged veins! He infunned me that he was very ill, and without any hope of recovery, that he had but one wish on this side the grave, and that was, to see me once more befure he died. He begged me to spare no entreaties, that the general would grant me permission to come and see him a last i:.it:rn; but, that if this permission could not be obtained, to be assured, that he loved me, and remembered :me a:frectionate]y, in death. This letter pierced :rne to the heart. 0, could I have flown through my prison walls! Had I possessed the strength of the giants, how soon would I have levelled them, even had I drawn down destruction on my own head in doing it. But I could own nothing in my fuvour, but a fierce and self devouring will In hopes that the heart of the general was not all adamant, I entreated the serjeant to go and infurm him of my :father's illness, and his desire to see :rne once tmre, and to try to gain permission that I might have leave to attend upon him, or if that might not be, to visit him once more, according to his wish. He went [182] in compliance with my entreaties, and in a rew minutes returned with a dejected countenance, from which I at once :infurred what was the fute of my application. user.>mission.comt-ctud}lrnlmanlhlml/patlie/patlie.hlml 87/122 5/1QI13 Pattie's Personal NarratiiA':l, 1824--1830 as he related that the general absolutely refused this request. Oh God! of what stuff are some hearts made! and this was a republican officer! What nameless tortures and miseries do not Americans su:ffur in fureign ems from those miserable despots who :first injure and oppress, and then hate the victirm of their oppression, as judging their hearts by their OW!\\ and thinking that their victi1m must be fu1t of purposes of revenge. The honest and kind hearted seljeant hesitated not to express manly and natural indignation, in view of this inbuman brutality of the general, in refusing a :favor, called fur by the simplest dictates ofhuma.nity, a :favor too, in the granting which there could be neither difficulty nor danger. All he could do in the case he promised to do, which was to see that my :father should want no sort of nourisl:rmmt, or aid which he could render him I tried to thank him, but my case was not of a kind to be alleviated by this sort of consolation. When I thought of our expectations of relie~ when we threw ourselves in the power of these vile people, when I took into view our innocence of even the suspicion of a charge that could be brought against us, when I thought of their duplicity of disarming us, and their infumous oppression as soon as we were in their power, and more than all, when I thought of this last brutal cruelty and insult, my whole heart and natme rose in one mingled fueling of rage, wounded affection, and the indignation o1 despair. The image of my venerable :father, suffuring and dying unsolaced and unrelieved, and with not a person, who spoke his language, to close his eyes, and I so near him, was befure me wherever I turned my eyes. What a horrible night ensued at the close of this day! As the light was fading, the excellent young lady presented herself at my grate. She repeated all that her brother had related to me, in regard to the cruel refusal of the general While she discussed this subject, the tears ren from her eyes, and I had the consolation to know, that one person at least reb: real sympathy [183] fur my distress. She added, in :fultering tones, that she was well aware that in a case like this words were of but little avail, but that I might be assured of the kindest attention to all the wants of my :father, that she could relieve; and that if it was the will of God, to take him out of this world of sorrow and change, that he should be buried decently and as ifhe were her own :father. Judge what I must have relt towards this noble minded and kind hearted yomg lady! As she withdrew, my prayers at this time were hearty, if never befure, that God would reward her a thousand fuld in all good things, fur her sympathy with our sufferings. 11rus passed away these days of agony and suspense. The young :lady visited me as often as it was understood the generafs orders would permit, that is, once in two or three days., bringing me fuod and drink, of which in the present state of my thoughts, I had little need. In fuct, I had become so emaciated and feeble that I could hardly travel across my prison floor. But no grief arrests the ftigbt of time, and the twenty-fumth of April came, in which the seljeant visited me and in a mamer of mingled kindness and :firrnooss told me that my :father was no more. At these tidings, simple truth calls on me to declare, my heart relt relieved. I am a hunter, and not a person to analyze the reelings of poor human nature. My father now was gone, gone where the voice of the oppressor is no more beard. Since the death of my mother, I have reason to think, that lifu bad been to him one long burden. He had been set free from it all, and set free too, from the cruelty of this vile people, and the still viler general I reb: weak, and exhausted myself: and I expected to rejoin him in a rew days, never to be separated from him Lire was a burden of which I longed to be relieved. After I had given vent to natural feelings on this occasion, the serjeant asked me touching the manner in which we bury our dead in our country? I infun:ned him He then observed that the reason why he asked that question was, that his sister wished, that my :father's body might be interred in a manner confurmable to my wishes. I could only thank him fur all this [184] kindness and humanity to me, as he left me. I passed the remainder of this day in the indulgence of such reflections as I have no wish to describe, even had I the power. At night the setjeant's sister again visited my prison. She seemed neither able nor disposed to enter upon the subject 88/122 be:fbre usD and~ to cal up the 1n my thougl:lm.

I Jay down upon :my bed, and passed many hours in the oblivion of sleep. The customary habit of sleep during the night returned to me; and my strength and appetite began to return with it. I relt an irresistible propensity to resume :my furmer habit of smoking. I named my inclination to my friend the setjeant. He was kind enough to :furnish me cigars. This was a new resource to aid me in killing the time. Apart from the soothing sensation of smoking, I amused myself fur hours in watching the curling of my smoke from the cigar. Those who have always been free, cannot imagine the corroding tormmts of thoughts preying upon the bosom of the prisoner, who bas neither :friend to converse with, books to read, or occupation to fill his hours. On the 27th of June, Captain Bradshaw's vessel was seized, on the charge of smuggling. There were other American vesseJs in this port at the same t:irre, the names of the captains of which, as fur as I can recollect, were Seth Rogers, Aaron W. Williams, and H. Cumringbam These gentlemen, jointly with their supercargoes, sent me five ounces of gold, advising me to keep this money secret from the knowledge of the Spaniards, and preserve it as a resource fur my companions and mysel:J; in case of emergencies. About this time the general received several packages ofletters in English, the contents of which, not understanding the [186] language, he could not make out. There was no regular translator at hand; and he sent orders to the setjeant to have me conducted to the office fur that purpose. When I entered the office he asked me if I could read writing? When I told him yes, he procured a seat, and bade me sit down. He then presented me a letter in English, requesting me to translate it into Spanish Though I put furth no claims on the score of scholarship, I perfectly comprehended the meaning of the words in both languages. I accomplished the translation in the best marmer in my power; and he was pleased entirely to approve it He proceeded to ask me a great many questions relative to my travels through the Mexican counlly, how long I bad been absent from my own country, and what had been my occupation, during that absence? To all which questions I returned satisfactory answers. When he bade the guard return me to prison, he informed me that he should probably call fur me again. I retm.ned to my prison somewhat cheered in spirits. I furesaw that he would often have occasion ror my services as a translator, and if I showed an obliging disposition, and rendered myself useful, I hoped to obtain enlargement fur :myself and my companions. As I expected, I was summoned to his office fur several days in succession. On my entering the office he began to assume the habit of saluting me kindly, giving me a seat, enquiring after my health, and showing me the other customary civilities. When I fuund him in his best humor, I generally took occasion remotely to hint at the case of our being detained as prisoners. I tried, gently and soothingly, to convince him of the oppression and injustice of treating the innocent citizens of a sister republic, as if they were spies. He generally showed a disposition to evade the subject; or alleged as a reason fur what he bad done, that he regretted exceedingly that circumstances on our part seemed so suspicious, that, obliged as he was, to execute the :Jaws ofbis comrtry, he relt himself compelled to act as he bad done; that it was fur from his disposition to desire to punish any one UJ:Yustly, and \\vlllmut cause; and that he would be glad :ifwe could produce any substantial [187] evidence to acquit us from the suspicion ofbeing spies. Though, as a true and honest man, I knew that every word he pronounced was a vile and deceitful lie, yet such :is the power of the oppressor, I swallowed my rising words, and dissembled a sort of satisfuction. Waiving the further discussion of our imprisonment, I again recurred to the subject of permission to bring in our furs, persuading him, ii he had any doubts about our good faith in returning to this place, to send soldiers to guard us; assuring him, that on obtaining our furs we would pay the soldiers, and indenmif)r him fur any other expense he might incur on the occasion; and that, moreover, we would reel ourselves as grateful to him as ifhe bad bestowed upon us the value oi the furs in money. He heard me to the close, and listened with attention; and though he said be coukl not at present give his consent, he promised that he would dehberate upon the subject, and in the course of a week, let me know 9Q/122 5/19/13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 the result of his resolution He then bade his soldiers remand me to prison. I begged him to allow me to comm.micate this conversation to :my companions. This he refused, and I re-entered :my prison. From these repeated interviews, I began to acquaint myself with his interior character. I perceived, that, like most arbitrary and cruel~ he was fickle and infirm of purpose. I determined to take advantage ofthat weakness in his character by seeming submissive to his wishes, and striving to confOrm as fur as I could to his capricious wishes; and more than aD, to seize the right occasions to tease him with importunities for our liberty, and permission to bring in our furs. Four days elapsed befure I had another opportunity of seeing him During this time I had finished the translation of a number ofletters, some of which were from Capt Bradshaw, and related to the detention ofbis ship and cargo, and himself When I had finished these translations, and was re-admitted to his presence, I asked him if he had come to any determination in regard to letting us go to bring in our furs? He answered in his surliest tone, no! How different were :my reflections on returning to my prison from those with which I had left it! How earnestly I wished that [188] he and I had been together in the wild woods, and I armed with :my rifle! I furmed a firm purpose to trans1ate no more letters fur him I fuund that I had gained nothing by this sort of service; nor even by dissembling a general disposition to serve him I was anxious fur another request to translate, that I might have the pleasure of refusing him, and of telling him to his fuce that though I was his prisoner, I was not his s1ave. But it was three days befure he sent fur me again. At their expiration I was summ:med to his office, and he offured me a seat, according to furmer custom When I was seated, with a smiling countenance be banded me a packet of letters, and bade me translate them I took one, opened it, and carelessly perused a fuw lines, and returning the packet back, rose from my seat, and to:Jd him I wEhed to return to my prison; and bowing, I moved towards the door. He darted a glance at me resembling that of an enraged wild beast; and in a voice, not unlike the growl of a wounded, grizzly bear, asked me why I did not put myself to the translation of the letters? Assuming a manner and tone as surly as his own, I told him my reasons were, that I clid not choose to labor voluntarily fur an oppressor and enemy; and that I bad come to the determination to do it no longer. At this he struck me over the head such a bhw with the flat ofhis sword, as well nigh dropped me on the floor; and ordered the soldiers to return me to prison, where he said I should lay and rot The moment I recovered from the sturming effuct of the blow I sprang toward him; but was immediately seized by the guards, and dragged to the door; he, the while, muttered abundance of the curses which his language supp:Jies. In return, I begged him to consider how much it was like an officer and gentleman to beat an unarmed prisoner in his power, but that if I only had a sword to meet him upon equal tei'Im, I could easily kill as many such dastards as be was, as could come at me. He bade me be silent, and the soldiers to take me off They shoved me violently on befure them to prison When it chsed upon me I never expected to see the sun rise and set again. [189] Here I remained a week without seeing even the young lady, who was justly so dear to my heart She was debarred by the generafs orders not only from visiting me, but even sending me provisions! I was again reduced to the fure of com boiled in spoiled tallow, which was brought me twice a day. At this juncture came on Capt. Bradshaw's trial The declaration of the Captain, supercargo and crew was to be taken, and all the parties separately interrogated by a Spaniard. Not an :individual of them could speak a word of Spanish, except the Captain, and he was not allowed to translate :in his own case. The general supposed that by interrogating the parties separately, he should be able to gain some advantage from the contradictions of the testimony, and some positive proof of smuggling. Capt. Bradshaw being denied the privilege of :interpreting fur his crew, requested the general to procure some one who might be allowed to perfurm that office fur him The general told him that I was capable of the office, ifi could be gained to the humor; but that he would as willingly deal with a dev.il, as with me, when out ot lnm.lor. Capt Bradshaw asked him ifhe might be allowed to converse with me on the subject? He consented, and Capt B. came to my prison. In reference to the above infurmation, he asked me what had taken place between me user.mission.coml-ctuc\u00a51T11man/111:ml/pattie/pa!lie.html 91/122 5/19!13 PatHe's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 and the general which had so exasperated him against me? I reJated all the c:irclJI.llStances of our last interview. He laughed heartily at my defiance of the general I was ready, of course, to render any service by which I could oblige Capt B. He returned to the genera], and infunned him that I was ready to tmdertake to translate or interpret in his case. fu a short time my door was opened, and I was once more conducted to the office of the general Capt B. was sitting there in waiting. The general asked me if I bad so fur changed my mind, as to be willing to translate and :interpret again? I told him I was always ready to perfunn that office fur a gentleman. I placed such an emphasis on the word gentleman, as I purposed, should infunn him, that I intended that appeTiation fur the [190] Captain, and not fur him. Whether he really misunderstood me, or <}i)semb:led the appearance of misunderstanding me, I know not. He on]y named an hour, in which he should call on me fur that service, cautioning me to act in the business with truth and good fuith. I told him that my countrymen in that respect, bad greatly the disadvantage of his peop:le; fur that it was our weakness, not to know how to say any thing but the truth. At this he smiled, ordering me back to prison, until I should be called fur next day. At eight the next rooming, I was again sun:m:med to his office, where he proceeded, through me, to question Captain B. touching the different ports at which he had traded, and what was his cargo, when he left the U. S.? He added a great many other questions in relation to the voyage, irrelevant to the purposes of this journal The clerk on this occasion was an Indian, and a quick and elegant writer. Capt B. produced his bill of Jading, and the other usua] documents of clearing out a ship; all which I was obliged to translate. They being matters out of the line of my pursuits, and I tm1dng no pretensions to accurate acquaintance with either 1anguage, the translation, of course, occupied no inconsiderable time. It was nearly twelve, when he bade us withdraw, with orders to meet him again at his office at two in the afternoon. Capt B. accompanied me to prison, and as we went on, requested me to make the testimonies ofhis crew as nearly correspond, and substantiate each other, as possible; fur that some of them were angry with him, and would strive to give testimony calculated to conde:rm him. I assured him that I would do any thing to serve him, that I could in honor. I entered my prison, and slept smmdly, until the bells struck two. I was then reconducted to the general's office; where he continued to interrogate Capt B., until three. The Supercargo, Mr. R Perkins, was then called upon to produce his maniresto, and cautioned to declare the truth, in relation to the subject in question. This manifesto diffured in no essential respect :from the account of the Captain. At sunset set they were [ 191] dismissed, and I remanded to my prison. Day after day the same task was imposed, and the same labors devolved upon me. I at length summoned courage to resume the old question of permission to go out and bring in our furs. To my surprise he remarked, that as soon as he had finished taking all the evidence in relation to Capt. Bradshaw's ship and cargo, he would not on]y allow us to go, but would send soldiers to prevent the Indians from molesting us. I :infOrmed him, that his intended kindness would be unavailing to us, if he did not allow us to depart befure the month of August; fur that in that month the melting of the snow on the mountains at the sources of Red river caused it to overflow, and that our furs were buried in the bottom, so that the river, in overflowing, would spoil them He rep1ied, that it was out ofhis power to grant the consent at this time, which was the 19th of July. On the 28th he had :finished taking all the depositions, and I again asked him fur permission to go and bring in our furs. He still started delays, alleging that he had made no arrangements fur that purpose yet. Capt. B. was present, and asked him to allow me to stay with him on board his vesse~ promising that he would be accountable fur me. To my astonis:hnlent the general consented. I repaired to the house of the yomg lady, who bad been so kind to me. She received me with open arms, and l1.'1a!lifusted the most unequivocal delight. She congratuJated me on being once rmre free from my rusmal pmon, and asked me a thousand questions. The Captain and myself spent the evening 92/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824--1830 with her; and at its close, I repaired with him. on board his beautiful ship, the first sea vessel I had ever been on board. It maybe imagined what a spectacle of :interest and eager curiosity the :interior offuis ship, the rigging, masts, awning, :in short, every thing appertaining to it, would be to a person raised as I had been, and of a mind naturally inquisitive. What a new set of people were the sru1ors! How amus:ing and strange their dialect! They heartily shook me by the hand, and corrnnenced describing the several punishments they woukl inflict upon the general, if they had him. in their [192] power. Among the diflerent :inflictions purposed, none seemed to please them better, than the idea of tarring and fuathering him, all which I would gladly have seen him endure, but the worst of it was, after all, the general was not in their power. I spent the greater part of the night with the captain and supercargo, conversing about the oppressions and cruelties of the general, and the death of my futher, fur, dur:ing the time of his sickness, Captain Bradshaw had sailed to Monte el Rey, and had not returned, until a:fter his death. He intended, be said, ifhlli vessel was condemned, to slip his anchors, and nm out of the harbor, at the risk ofbeing sunk, as he passed the furt. He promised me, if I would take passage with him, that I sboukl fu.re as he did, and that, when we should arrive at Boston, he would obtain me some situation, in which I could procure a subsistence. I thanked him. fur his very kind ofi.er, but remarked, that my companions had su.ffured a great deal with me, that we had bad many trials together, and had hazarded our lives fur each other, and that now I would sufrer any thing rather than desert them, and leave them in prison, probably, to have their suflerings enhanced, :in consequence of my desertion. In the morning we all three went on shore together, and took brealditst at the bouse of my friend, the brother of the young lady. We passed from breakfust, to the office of the general I asked leave ofbim to visit my companions :in prison. His countenance became red with anger, and he ordered the guard to search me, and take me to prison I perceived that he thought I had ar.t1::5 concealed about me, and assured him I had none. This did not hinder the guard :from searching me, befure they put me in prison. I heard no rmre from him, and remained shut up in prison until the 28th of August. On that day the general ordered :roo again to be conducted to his office, where, according to his request, I translated so:rre letters fur him When I had nhed, he asked me if I still had an inclination to go fur my furs? I replied, that I bad reason to suppose that they had been covered [193] befure t:lm time, with the waters of Red river, and were all spoiled; but that nevertheless, I should be glad to be certain about it, and at least we should be able to bring in our traps. He asked me what adequate security I could give fur our good behavior, and the certainty of our return, provided he should allow us the use of our arms fur self defunce? I replied, that I knew no one, who could give the security required, but that the soldiers he would send with us, would be his security fur our return; but that it was out of the question to think of send:ing us on a trip, so dangerous under any circumstances, without allowing us to go ar:rned. He remmded :rre to prison, saying, that he would reflect upon it, and let me know the result of his reflections in the rmming. I reflected as I walked to prison, that I could have procured the security of Captain Bradshaw, merely fur the asking. But I knew the character of my companions, and was so well aware, how they would feel when all should be once :free again, and well armed, that I dared not bind any one in security fur us. Such had been the extent of the injuries we had su:ffured, and so sweet is revenge, and so delightful liberty, when estimated by the bondage we had endured, that I was convinced that Mexico could not array furce enough to bring us back alive. I furesaw that the general would send no more than ten or twelve soldiers with us. I knew that it would be no more than an anmsement to rise upon them, take their horses fur our own ridlng, flea some of them. of their skins, to show them that we knew how to inflict torture, and send the rest back to the general on fuot Know:ing that the temptation to some retaliation of this sort would be irresistible, I was determined that no one ofmy countrymen should be left amenable to the laws on our account Such thoughts passed through my mind as I told the genera~ I could offer him no security. 931122 5119/13 Pattie's PerSIJflal Narratiw, 1824--1830 Next morning, immediately after eight, I was allowed to walk to the generars office without being guarded. What a fund reeling came back to my heart with this small boon of liberty! How much I was exalted in my own thoughts, ihat I [194] could walk fifty yards entrusted with my own safu keeping! When I entered the generals office, he saluted me with ceremonious politeness. 'Buenas dias, don Santiago,' said he, and showed me to a seat He proceeded to make known his pleasure, in respect to me and my companions. fu the first place he told us, we were all to be allowed the use of our a.rrm, in the next place, ihat he woUld send fifteen ofhis soldiers with us; and in the third place, that we should all be allowed a week, in which to exercise ourselves, befure we set out on our expedition All this good furtune delighted us, and was more almost, than we woUld have dared to wish My companions, :in an ecstacy of satismctiol\\ soon joined us :from their prisons. We met with as much a:lfuction and gladness of heart, as ifwe bad been brothers. They looked more like persons en:ru:J.Cipated from the prison of the grave, than human beings; and I am perfectly aware, that my spectre like visage must have been equally a spectacle to them We had the privilege of walking :in the vicinity of the port, accompanied by a guard of soldiers. Our only immediate restriction was the necessity of returning to our guard house to sleep at night. In this way our time passed pleasantly. On the 3d of September, the general sent fur me to his office. When I entered, he presented me a note, and bade me accompany a soldier to a mission at the distance of 1hirty miles, where be stated I was to deliver this note to a priest, and that he perhaps would be able to furnish us with horses and m.Ues fur our expedition to bring :in our furs. I started with the soldier, each of us wen mounted. 'The note was unsealed, and I read it of course. 'The contents were any thing, rather than encouraging. It contained no demand fur the horses, as I had hoped. It simply stated to the priest, what sort of person the general supposed me to be, that we had furs buried on Red river, and wished horses on which to ride out and bring them in, and that if the priest fult disposed to hire his horses to us, he would send soldiers with us to bring us back. [195] Discouraging as the note was, we pushed ahead with it, and arrived at the priest's mission some time befure night. I handed the note to the old priest, who was a very grave looking personage. He read the note, and then asked me to come in and take some wine with him, of which they have great plenty. I fullowed him into a large parlor, richly adorned with paintings of saints, and several side boards, abundantly stored with wines, which I took it fur granted, were not unacceptable to the holy man. The glass ware, the decorations of the parlor, and the arrangement of every thing showed me at a g]ance, that this priest was a man of taste and :fashion. So I was on my guard not to let any of my hunting phrases and back-wood's clialect escape me. He asked me a great many questions about the circumstances of my passage across the continent, to all which I responded :in as choice and studied words as I could command. He then asked me how many beasts we should want? I replied that there were seven of us, and that we should each need a pack mule, and a horse to ride upon, which woUld be fuurteen :in all He then asked how many days it woUld require to go, and return? I answered, that this was a point upon which I could not pronounce with certainty, since I was unacquainted with the road, and accidents might change the issue. He then proposed to charge what was tantamount to 25 cents of our money a day fur each mule, that carried a saddle, during the expedition, longer or shorter. To this I consented, and he drew an article of agreeJ:I:ent to that effuct. He then wrote a note to send by me to the genera], :in rep]y to his. By 1his time the sun was setting, and the church bells began to strik.e. On this he knelt, and co:rrmenced his prayers. He was repeating the Lord's prayer. According to the customs of his church, when be had commenced a member of a sentence, I finished it, by way of response. Such are their modes of repeating their prayers, when there are two or more in company. When we bad finished, be turned to me, and asked me why I had prayed? I answered fur the salvation of my soul He said, that it had a christian appearance, but that he bad been [196] infu~d, tlmt the people of our cmmtry did not believe that man had a soul, or that there is a Saviour. I assured him, that he bad been entirely misinfOrmed, fur that we bad churches on every side through an the land, and that the people read the Scriptures, and believed all that was taught 941122 5/19/13 Pattie's PerSOI1!l! Narraliw, 1824--1830 in the Gospe~ according to their understanding of it. But he continued, 'your people do not believe in the :immacu1ate conception of the Virgin Mary.' I replied, that what the general faith of the people upon this point was, I could not say, and that fur myself; I did not pretend to have sufficiently studied the Scriptures, to decide upon such points. My assumed modesty soothed him, and he told me, that it was evident, I had not studied the Scriptures, fur that ifi had, I could not be in doubt about such obvious articles offuit:h. I acquiesced in his supposition, that I had not studied the Scriptures, remarking, that I was aware that they contained many mysteries, about which the people in my country entertained various opinions. He said that he was truJy sorry, that I was not trore conversant with the Scriptures, fur that ifl had been, I coukl not have been led astray by the Protestants. His time, however, he added was now too limited to enlighten me, but he laughed, as he said he hoped to have the pleasure ofbaptming me on my return. To this I replied with a smile, fur the truth was, I was fearful of disgusting him, and breaking off the bargain. Glad was I, when he dismissed this subject, and began to chat about other matters. We had an excellent supper, and I was shown to :roy bed. In the morning I took leave of the old father, and arrived on the fullowing evening at San Diego. My companions were delighted with the apparent complete success of my mission The general infunned us, that we should have permission to start on the 6th, and that our beasts would be ready fur an early start on that day. On the evening of the 5th, be called us to his office, and asked us, how many days we thought the expedition would require? We infurmed him, as near as we could conjecture. He then said, that he could not spare any soldiers to accompany us. We answered, that it was a point of [197] indifference to us, whether he did or not 'To insure your return however,' he rejoined, 'I shall retain one of you as a hostage fur the return of the rest,' and pointing to me, he :infOrmed me, 'that I was the selected hostage,' and that I must remain in prison, during their absence, and that if they did not return, it would convince him, that we were spies, and that in consequence he would cause me to be executed.' At this horrible sentence, breaking upon us in the sanguine rapture of confidence, we all. gazed at each other in the consternation of despair. Soire of om company remarked, that they had better abandon the expedition altogether, than leave Ire behind. Others stood in mute indecision We had all in truth confidently anticipated never to return to this place again. My indignation, meanwhile, had mounted to such a pitch, as wholly to absorb all sense of persona] danger, or care about myself It seemed as if Providence had put the unrelenting seal of disappointment to every pJan I atterqpted to devise. I tokl them to go, and not allow my detention to dishearten, or detain them, fur that I had no fear of any thing, the general could :inflict, that I bad little left, but 1ifu to relinquish, and that their refusal to go, as things now were, would be taken fur ample proo:iS, that we were spies, and would ensure our condenmation and the conviction, that we never bad intended to return. On this they all agreed to go, and began to pledge their honor and every thing sacred, that they would return, iflifu was spared them I told them to fullow their own inclinations, as to returning, fur that I would as willingly be buried by the side of my father, as any one else; that, however, I did not believe the laws of the country would bear the general out, in putting me to death. The general now bade us arrange eve:ry thing to start early in the trorning. I was again locked up in my prison, though my companions spent the greater part of the night in conversing with me. In the morning, when they were ready to start, they came and shook hands with me. When the Dutchman, as good hearted a fellow as ever lived, took my band he burst into tears, and said, 'goot py Jim, if I ever does come [198] back, I will bring an army mit Ire, and take yours and your daddy's bones from dis tammed comt:ry, fur it is worse as hell' I should have laughed heartily at him, had not his tears prevented rre, fur I knew, that they came from his heart. Mounting their mules they now set off Their only arms were old Spanish nruskets, which, when fired, I would ahnost as soon have stood befure as behind. Under such circumstances, knowing, that they would be obliged to pass through numbers ofhostile tribes ofJndians, I was very doubtful of their return. 95/122 511Qf13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 18.24--1830 On the 8th, Captain Bradshaw came to my prison, and asked rre, why I was in prison, and my companions at liberty? I told lrim the whole story. When he bad heard it, he expressed doubts in regard to their returning. I replied to him, that I was not at all in doubt of their return, if they lived. He then told rre, that he intended to go to the general, and demand his papers on the 11th, and if they were not given up to him, he would cut cable, and run out in spite of any one, adding his advice to rre, which was, that I should write to the consul at W ahu and infOrm him of my imprisonment. He seerred to think, I might thus obtain my release. Mr. R Perkins would undertake, he said, to place it in the bands of the consul, as he was acquainted with him I answered, that I bad neither ink nor paper. He said I should have sorre in a rew minutes, and took leave ofrre. A soldier soon entered with writing materials, and I wrote my letter to Mr. Jones, fur that was the name of the consUl, stating every circumstance relative to our imprisonment, and the death of my futher, giving the names of all our party, and begging him, if it was not in his power to obtain our freedom, that be would infurm om government of our situation. I supposed it was in his power to grant my first request, placed as he was, in the midst of a fureign nation. On the 11 tb, at the request of the genera], I was conducted to his office, to serve as :interpreter fur the captain and Mr. P. The papers were now demanded by them The general refused to comp]y with the demand, and told them, that both the vessel and cargo were condemned, but that if they would discharge [199] the cargo, and deliver it to him, he would allow them to clear the vesse~ to go and seek redress, wherever they pleased. The captain's answer to this was, that it was not in his power to do so, and that the laws ofhis country would hang him, ifhe thus gave up his ship and cargo at the request of an individual The general now became enraged, and repeating the words, at the request of an :individua~ added, the ship and cargo have both been lawfully condemned, and if they are not given up peaceabJy, I have soldiers enough to take the ship, and every thing belonging to it. In rep]y the captain remarked, that he came to trade on the coast, and not to fight, that. if he was disposed to seize the vessel or cargo, he bad nothing to say further, than that he should not aid, or advance in any shape the unlading of the vessel himself; and taking up his bat wa1ked away. I asked permission of the general to go to Miss. Peaks, to get a change of clothing, which was granted. He, however, told me to be in haste. My principal business there was to give my letter to Mr. P., fur I knew that captain B., would set sail with the first breeze, of which he could avail bimse1f I fumd both the gentlerren in the house, when I entered. I was assured by M. P ., that he would give the Jetter to the consuJ, and endeavor to interest him in my behalf I thanked him, and was upon the po:int of talcing leave, when captain B. asked rre to take a note from him to the genera~ and to tell him that he would like to have an answer, and would wait an hour fur it. I took the note and went to the general's office, gave hlm the note and told hlm what the captain bad said. He bade rre sit down, after he bad read the note, fur a few minutes. I obeyed, and he passed into the adjoining room, and ordered his porter to can the ensign Ramirez. The porter hastened to execute his commission, and in a few minutes the ensign entered. The general and ensign then began to converse, drawing near the door, behind which I was seated. I heard distinctly the furrrer tell the latter, that captain B., and Mr. P., were both at Peak's awaiting an answer from him, and that he would send me to tell them that he was engaged at [200] present, but at the expiration of an hom and a half they should have their answer through roe. Meantime he, the ensign, was to provide a guard of soldiers, with which to take them prisoners, and then the vessel and cargo would be sure. AD this, as I have said, I heard distinctly. He then came in, and told me to go and infurm them, as he told the ensign, he should direct me. I hastened to captain B., and told him what I bad heard from the general concerning him. I advised lrim to go to the vessel :irmnediately, fur that the ensign and guard would soon be upon the spot. Both he and Mr. P. went directly to the vesse~ and I returned to the genera~ to infurm lrim that I bad delivered his rressage. He then ordered rre to return to prison. It was now three o'clock. fu a few holU\"S the ensign returned from the pursuit of captain B., and as he passed the prison on his way to the general's office he shook his sword at rre with vengeance in his fRee, saying, 'Oh! you traitor!' I inferred from this, that he supposed I had infurmed the captain of the projected attempt to take him prisoner. My situation now user.XI11ission.com'-crud)drnlmanlhln1!/patlielpatlia.hlml 961122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrati\\e, 1824--1830 seemed to me desperate. I thought more of :my comrades than myself; fur I could not expect to live. Concluding that I should soon be executed, I reared, that when they returned, they would be put to death also. In a fuw minutes I was surrn:noned to the gen.erafs office. I expected to hear my sentence. When I entered the general bade me stand by the door, near a large table, at which several ofhis clerks were seated writing, and he then gravely asked me ifl had overheard the conversation which took p1ace between himself and the ensign, after he bad read the note brought by me to him from captain B? I replied that I did not see the ensign at that time, and furthermore could not say positively, whether he bad held any conversation with the ensign, since my arrival on the coast or not. The general proceeded to question me, as to the met of my having advised the captain to go on board his ship, and if I knew the motives, which induced him to do so, after saying that he would wait fur an answer to his note. [20 1] He 1ried to extort an answer from me such as he wished, threatening me with death if I did not re1ate the truth. I regarded an tlm1 as no more than the threats of an old woman, and went on to state what was most likely to be favorable to :my cause. I was now remanded to prison with the assurance, that iffuund guilty, death would be my doom. A fuw days only e1apsed befure, the breeze serving, the Captain slipped anchor, and ran out of the port. He was compelled to perfurm this under a heavy shower of camon balls poured furth from the fbrt, within two hundred yards of which he was obliged to pass. When he came opposite it, he hove to, and gave them a broadside in return, which :frightened the poor engineers from their guns. His escape from the port was made without suffering any serious iqjury on his part. Their shots entered the hull of the vesse~ and the sails were considerably cut by the grape. I was greatly rejoiced when I heard oftheir escape from these thieves. The General pretended great disgust at the cowardly conduct of the engineers, but, I believe, had he been there, be would have run too. I have no fiUth in the courage of these people, except where they have greatly the advantage, or can kill in the dark, without danger to themselves. This in my view is the a:roount of a Spaniard's bravery. But to return to :myself; I rermined in prison, until a sufficient time had elapsed, as I thought, fur the return of my companions. I still did not entirely despair of seeing them; but the Spaniards cam;: daily and hourly to my prison with delighted countenances to tell me that my companions had deserted me, and that the General would soon have me executed. Some consoled me with the :infurmation, that at such an hour or day, I was to be taken out, and burnt alive; and others, that I was to be stationed at a certain distance, and shot at, like a target, or hung. These unreeling wretches thus harrassed and tormented me, until the arrival of :my companions on the 30th Sept put an end to their taunts, with regard to their desertion of me. They brought no fur however, it having been an spoiled [202] as I had expected, by an overflow of the river. Our traps which they did bring, were sold, and a part of the proceeds paid to the old priest fur the hire of the mules. I have tailed to remark, that my comrades bad returned with the loss of two of their number, one of whom we learned, bad married inN ew Mexico. When the party reached the river, these two concluded that rather than return to prison, they woukl run the risk of being killed by the Indians, or ofbeing starved to death; and set furth on their perilous journey through the wilderness to New Mexico on fbot. The probability of their reaching the point of their destination was very slight, it being a great dlstance and through great dangers. Happily fur us, their not retw.ning, did not appear to strengthen the Genera~ in his opinion of our being spies. I bad the pleasure of conversing with my companions an hour, or more, after which they were again disarmed, and all of us returned to our separate places of confinement. I had now no prospect befure me, but that oflingering out a miserable and useless life in my present situation; as I was convinced, that the only inducement, which operated in the Generars mind, to allow a part of us to go in search of our property was the hope of taking a quantity of furs and other vahlabJes from us. I was thankfu] that he obtained nothing but the traps, which, as he knew no more how to use, than a blind horse, could be of no usar.Jmission.com/-crud}dmimanlhlml/patlielpatlie.hlmt 97/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824--1830 utility to him. This reeling may seem a poor gratification, but it was certain]y a natural one. In this condition we remained fur months, never seeing the outside of our prison, deprived of the pleasure we bad received from the visits of the charitable young lady, funnerly allowed entrance to us, and the advantage we bad derived from the generous nm.nislurent she so kindly furnished us, and compelled by hunger to eat the food set befure us by our jailors; and confined principally to dried beans, or com boiled in water, and then fried in spoiled ta:Jhw. At length the small pox began to rage on the upper part of the coast, carrying off the inhabitants by hundreds. Letters [203] from the distressed people were continually arriving. praying the general to devise some means to put a stop to the disease, which seemed to threaten the comtry with destruction. The general was thus beset by petitions fur several weeks, befure he could offer a shadow of relief fur them He was much aJarrred, rearing that the disorder might extend its ravages to that part of the coast where he resided. One day the soldiers, through mere inquisitiveness, asked the Dutclnmn if he knew any remedy fur the complaint? He answered that he did; but that he bad none of the article that constituted the remedy. He added, however, that he thought that my futher bad brought some of it with him, as he recollected his having vaccinated the people at the copper mines. This conversation was co:rmmnicated to the general itln.rediately, who sent a sergeant to me to inquire if I bad any of the remedy spoken of by the Dutchman, as brought by my father? I answered in the affirmative; I then showed him where I bad been vaccinated on the right arm, and assured him that it bad efrectually protected me from the small pox. Upon his demand whether I knew the mrthod of applying it, I again answered in the affirmative; but when he asked me to show him the remedy, and let him have it to apply to his own arm, as he was rearful of losing bis 1ifu from the spread of this dreadful disease, I told him I would not. This sergeant, who wished the matter, was my friend, and brother of the charitable young lady who had procured my futher's buria], and fur whom I would have sacrificed my life. But tbinlcing this my only chance fur regaining liberty, I refused it to him, saying, that I woukl neither show it to any one, nor apply it, unJess my liberty and that of my companions was rendered secure; and that in sustaining this resolution I would sacrifice my life. I also mentioned that I must be paid, over and above my liberty. My object in this, was to influence the fears of the general If he acceded to my proposition, my friend and his sister would share the benefit in common with others. If I granted the request of the sergeant to inoculate him, I might lose my advantage; but my gratitude decided me [204] against allowing himself and his sister to be exposed to an imminent danger, which I could avert. I told him that ifhe would pledge himsel( solemnly, fur his own part, and that of his sister, that he would not cotni:DJJ11icate the matter to another individua~ I would secretly vaccinate them He replied that I need not rear his betraying me, as he would much rather aid me in my design, which he thought excellent, and likely to accomplish my wishes. He then left me to communicate the result of our conversation to the general This incident, so important in its influence upon my fortunes, occurred December 20th. The sergeant had not been absent more than a balfhour, when he returned and told me that the general said be woukl give me a passport fur a year, if I would vaccinate all the people on the coast; and furthermore, if I conducted properly during that period, that he would at the expiratkm of it, pay me fur my services, and give me my liberty. His countenance was bright with delight, as he related this to me, not dreaming that I could refuse what seemed to him so good an ofrer. When I repeated, in reply, my resolution not to vaccinate any one, except on the conditions I bad stated, and added that I would not agree to any terms without an audience from the genera~ his pleasure vanished, giving place to g1oom as he told me be did not think the general would accede to the proposal to set my companions and myself at liberty upon parole fur one year, ibr any consideration; but that, if I persisted in my refusa~ be reared I should incur some violent punishment, and perhaps death. My answer was, that in my present situation I did not dread death. I then usar.>mssian.coml-a~mtmanlhlml/patlielpa!lle.hlml 98/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrali~~e, 1824--1830 requested lrim to tell the general I wished to talk with him personally upon the subject. He went, and in a rew minutes returned with orders to conduct me to the Generafs office. Upon my arrival there, the General questioned me with regard to the efficacy of the remedy of which he had been much infunned in the same manner as I have related in the conversation between the sergeant and myself; and he then repeated the same terms fur the matter [205] and the application of it, that he bad transmitted me through my friend, to which I replied as befure. When I had finished, he asked me in a surly manner, what my own terms were? I told him, as I had done the sergeant, that I would vaccinate all the inhabitants on the coast, provided he would allow myself and companions to leave our prison on parole fur one year, with liberty to travel up or down the coast, in order to find some occupation, by which we couki obtain food and clothing. Upon hearing 1his his rage burst forth. He told me l was a devil; and that if I did not choose to take the offur he had made, he would compel me to perfunn its conditions, or put me to death. I replied, that he could take my life; but that it was beyond his power to compel me to execute his commands adding, that life or liberty would be no object to me, if my companions were denied the enjoyment of them with me. They had had the alternative in their power of leaving me in prison to suffur alone, or returning to share my captivity, and bad chosen the latter; I cone Wed by saying, that rather than accept of liberty while they remained in prison, I would undergo all the tonnents his excellency could devise. He said he might as well let loose so many wolves to ravage his country, as give myself and companions the liberty I required; adding, that he gave me twenty-fuur hours to reflect on the alternative ofhis wrath, or my liberty upon the conditions be bad proposed. I was now remanded to prison. As I walked out, I remarked to the Genera~ that my resolution was fixed beyond the possibility of change. He made no reply, and I proceeded to prison The soldiers who accompanied :me, tried to induce :me to confOrm to the General's wishes, saying, that be was a terrible man when enraged. I made them no answer, and entered my prison, where I remained until 8 o'clock the next day; when I was again escorted to the office, and asked by the Genera~ what security I would give for the good behaviour oi myself and COII\\)anions, ifbe let us out on parole fur one year? I told lrim I would give none, for no one here knew :me. He then ordered me back to prison, where he said I should lay and rot, calling :me a carracho [206] picaro , and similar na:rnes, which I did not regard. I walked to my prison as undauntedly as I could. I now relt somewhat encouraged; fur I perceived he was not inflexible in his resolutions, and by adhering firmly to mine, I hoped finally to conquer him In the course of the night be received a letter containing infurmation of the death of one ofhis priests, and that great numbers were ill of the small pox. Early in the rmming of the 23d I received a sun:nnons to attend him at the usuaJ place. When I arrived, he said he wanted to see my papers, that is, those I had mentioned as being my :father's co~sion and his discharge from the service of a ranger. I to1d him they were at Miss Peak's, which was the name of the young lady who bad been so kind to me. He sent a soldier fur them, who soon returned with them I translated them to him He said that was a sufficient proof of my being an A:rnerican; and asked ff my companions could produce proofS of their belonging to the same country? I replied that I did not know. He sent orders for them to come to the office; and before their arriva~ told me that all he now wanted, was proof that they were Americans, to let us go on a parole, as all Americans were tolerated in his country. My opinion with regard to his rmtive in the case was, that he was less mwilling to grant our liberty, as the payment for my services in spreading the vaccine disease, now that he knew we bad no property fur him to extort from us. He talked, too, about rendering himself liable to suffur the rigor of the laws of his country, should be set us free, without our establishing the met of our being Alrericans. My companions entered: I was glad to see them Their beards were long, and they were haggard and much 991122 5119!13 Pattie's Personal Narratlw, 1824--1830 reduced in :flesh. I gave them to understand what was wanting, and they readily produced so:rre okl b1ack papers, :fumiqhing in themselves proof of any thing e:lse, as much as of their owners being A.tnerican citizens. I, however, so interpreted them, that they established the point with the General I believe be [207] had as firmly credited this met from the first hour he saw us, as now. He concluded to let us out a week upon tria~ befure be gave us freedom on parole, although be compelled :rre to engage to vaccinate all the people in the furt. He then directed us to endeavor to find some employment around the furt, which woukl procure us fuod, and to return every night to the guard house to sleep. The guard bell now tolled eight o'clock, and according to the permission given, we walked in the direction of our inclinations. I went directly to Miss Peak's, who was much astonished, and apparently delighted to see :rre at liberty. She had expected, she said, every day to see me on my way to be shot, or lnmg. The manifustation of kindness and benevolence to us having been furbidden by our jaihrs, she now indernrrified her hurrmrity and good fee]ing by telling me how much she had regretted not being allowed to send :rre proper fuod, asking me if I was not hungry? and proceeding, befure I could answer, to spread a table with every thing good, of which I partook plentifully; after which we had a pleasant conversation together. My ef!joyment of my furtunate change of situation was, however, mingled with uncertainty, as to the length of its duration. I relt that I was still in the lion's jaws, which might close upon me from the first impu1se of petulance or anger. I therefure, endeavoured to devise so:rre way of availing myself of my mo:rnentary freedom, to place myselfbeyond the possibility oflosing it again. That one which suggested itself to me, was to prevail upon the officer, who had our rifles in charge to allow us possession of them fur a short time, to clean them When we should once more have them in our hands, I hoped we woukl have resolution to retain them, until death rendered them useless to us. I went to my companions, and imparted my plan to them They agreed with me upon all points. The only difficuhy now was, to Jay our bands upon our arms. I went directly to the apartment of the officer, in whose care they were, one of the best hearted Spaniards I have ever seen. I appealed to his goodness ofheart in order to obtain my purpose, telling [208] him, that we only wanted the rilles a rew minutes, in order to rub off the rust, and dirt, which must have accurmilated upon them I told him after this was done, they should be returned to him He did not answer fur so:rne minutes; and then said, that if be complied with my request, and was discovered by the General to have done so, he should be punished. I replied that there was no danger of an act of this. kind, a mere kindness of this sort being known by any, but those immediately concerned; concluding by slipping ten dollars in silver, which had been given :rne by Capt. B., into his band. He then handed :rre the rifles, and all belonging to them, through a back door, cautioning :rne not to let my having them in possession be known. I answered, that I would be upon my guard. I was now joined by my companions. We fuund an old and tmoccupied house, into which we entered, and soon put our guns in order, and charged them well, resolving never to give them into the hands of a Spaniard again. We had been so treacherously dealt with by these people, that we did not consider it any great breach of honour to mil in our promise of returning our arms, particularly as the officer had taken my money. We then concluded to conceal our rifles in a thicket near at hand, and to keep our pistols, which the officer had also given us as a part of our arms, concealed around our persons. At night we went to the guard house to sleep, as we had been corrnnanded to do. The officer who gave me the rifles, came to me, and asked why I bad not returned the arms according to promise? I tokl him that I had not finished cleaning them, and repeated, that the General should not know I had them He charged me to fulfil my furmer promise of returning the arms on the succeeding :tDOrning. I satisfied him, tl:rinking as befure, that it made no great di:ffurence what is said to such persons, in a position like ours. :Early the next morning we :met a countryman by the name of James Lang, who bad come upon the coast to smuggle, and to kill sea otters fur their skins, which are very valuable. He was now here secretly, to enquire if sea user .Jmission.comt-ctl.ldy'mlmanlhlml/patlielpatlie.hlml 1001122 in [209] abundance higher up the coast; and to obtain infurrmtion on some other points connected with his pursuits. He told us he bad a boat distant eighty miles down the coast, with :men :in search oi otters, and proposed that we should accompany him to it, offuring to furnish every thing required fur this species oi hunting. and give us half of whatever we caught, addin& that when his brig returned from the Gallipagos islands, where it had gone in search of tortoise shell, he would give us a free passage to our own country. We an considered this an offur advantageous to us, as it held out the prospect of our being enabled to obtain sol1letb:ing in the way of gain, after which a way would be open fur our return to our homes, and we agreed to meet him on a certain day at Todos Santos , in English All Saints. This took place on the 24th. Our new friend set off to rejoin his companions, and we full to consultation upon the best method of conducting in our present circumstances. We did not wish to do any thing, that would render us a:rnenable to the laws of the country, should we be detected in our attempt to escape. We were consequently precluded from relying on horses to aid us in hastening beyond the reach of pursuers. The night was chosen, as the time fur our experiment; but in the course of an hour. a:fter this determination was made, all my companions excepting one, receded from it, pronouncing the plan of running ofi without any cover fur our intentions, not a good one. They proposed :instead of it, that we should ask permission oi the General to go a hunting, assigning as our reason fur this request, that we were barefuot, and wanted to kill some deer :in order to obtain their skins to dress, to Imke us moccasins. I consented to this plan, and to try its efficacy immediately, I went to the General's office. It was late, but I related my errand. He asked me, where I could get arl'JE, to kill deer with? I replied, that ifhe would not allow us to use our own arms, we could borrow some. He refused the permission, I bad asked ofbim On Christmas night, the one among my companions, whom I [21 0] have mentioned, as agreeing with me, in regard to the original plan fur our escape, set off with me at 12 o'clock, while the people, who were an Catholics, were engaged in their devotions at church. We were obliged to leave our comrades, as they woukl not accompany us in our enterprise. We travelled entirely by night, and reached the befure mentioned place of rendezvous on the 28th. We fuund Mr. Lang and his men in confinement, and his boat taken by the Spaniards. We gained this infurmation in the night, without committing ourselves. We retreated to the woods, in which we remained concealed through the day. At night our necessities compelled us to enter a house, in order to obtain sorm rood. It was occupied by a wklow and her two daughters. 1hey gave us bread, milk and cheese, treating us with great kindness. We spent a week passing the day :in the woods, and going to this friendly house to get fuod in the night; in the hope of hearing of some vesse~ by means of which we might escape from this bated coast. But no such good fu:rtune awaited us. We then concluded to return, and see our comrades, whom we supposed to be again in prison; although we were determined never again to be confined there ourselves alive, with our own consent. So we waJked back to San Diego, killing some deer by the way, the skins of which we carried to the furt. To our great admiration and surprize, we fuund our companions at liberty. They infurmed us, that the General was exceedingly anxious fur my return, and that our arms bad not been detmnded, although the officer, through whose means we obtained them, had been placed under guard. I feh grieved by the latter part of this infurrmtion, as I had deceived the unfortunate man, when he intended to do me a kindness, of the utmost importance to my interests, as I viewed it. He would probably, be severely punished. But I nevertheless was :firm in my purpose to retain my arms. It was late in the day; but the companion of my flight and myself proceeded to present ourselves befure the Genera~ leaving our rifles concealed in a safe place. Our pistols we carried in our [211] bosoms, detennined not to be taken to prison without o:ffuring resistance. The General appeared much surprised to see us, and asked where we bad been? I told him, that we had been out 1011122 5/1Q/13 Pattie's Personal Narrati'A'l, 1824--1830 upon a hwting expedition; upon which he wi~Jhed to know if we had killed any thing? We answered in fue affirmative. He then looked serious, and demanded of :me, if I was not aware that it was wrong to goo~ without taking leave ofhim? My reply was, that I did; and that he refused it to :me; and that fuen I concluded to go without permission, knowing it could not be a crime. His next question was, how I obtained my arms? I told him the truth with regard to this point. The succeeding demand was, why I did not return them, according to my promise? To which I replied, that I did not :intend to return them :from the first; and I now declared that they should never be taken from me fur the time to come, while I drew my breath. He smiled, and said he did not want them; but that I must begin to vaccinate the people of the garrison; fur that he wfuhed me to go up the coast soon to practice vaccination there. On the 18th of January, 1829, I began to vaccinate; and by the 16th ofFebruary had vaccinated all the people belonging to the :furt, and the Indian inhabitants of the mission of San Diego, three miles north of the :fOrmer place. It is situated in a valley between two mountains. A stream runs through the valley, from which ships obtain fresh water. An abundance of grain is raised at this mission. Fruit of all kinds, growing in a temperate climate, is also plentiful The climate is delightfully equal The lmsbandman here does not think of his fields being moistened by the fulling rain. He digs ditches around them, in which water is conveyed from a stream, sufficient to cover the ground, whenever the moisture is required. Rains seJdom :fhll in the summer or autumn The rainy season corrnnences in October; and continues until the last of December, and sometimes even through January; by which time the grass, dover and wild oats are knee high. When the rain does come, :it fulls in torrents. The gullies rmde in the sides of the mountains by the rains are of an enormous sire. [212] But to return to my own affairs. Having completed my vaccinations in this quarter, .and procured a sufficient quantity of the vaccine matter to answer my purpose, I declared myself in readiness to proceed :further. I communicated the rmtter to one thousand Spaniards and Indians in San Diego. February 28th, the General gave us each a legal :furm, granting us liberty on parole fur one year, at the expiration oi which period :it was in his power to remand us to prison, if he did not incline to grant us our freedom He likewise gave me a letter to the priests along the coast, containing the inforrmtion that I was to vaccinate all the inhabitants upon the coast, and an order providing fur 11X all necessary supplies of fuod and horses fur my journey. lhese were to be :furnished me by the people, at:D:)Dg whom I fuund myself cast. They were, also, rurected to treat me with respect, and indenmif:Y 11X fur my services, as fur as they thought proper. The latter charge did not strike me agreeably; fur I :fOresaw, that upon such conditions my services would not be worth one cent to me. However, the prospect of one whole year's liberty was so de1ightfu1, that I concluded to trust in Providence, and the generosity of fue stranger, and think no more of the matter. With these feelings I set furth to the next mission, at which I bad already been. It was called San Luis. I reached it in the evening. I fuund an old priest, who seemed glad to see me. I gave him the General's letter. After be bad read it, be said, with regard to that part of it which spoke of payment, that I had better take certificates from the priests of each mission, as I advanced up the coast, stating that I bad vaccinated their inhabitants; and that when I arrived at the upper mission, where one of the high dignitaries of the church resided, I should receive my recompense fur the whole. Seeing nothing at all singular in this advice, I concluded to adopt it. In the morning I entered on the perfOrmance of my duty. My subjects were Indians, the missions being entirely composed of them, with the exception ofihe priests, who are the rulers. [213] The m.nnber of natives in this mission was three thousand, nine hundred and fuur. I took the oki priest's certificate, as bad been recommended by him, when I bad completed my task. This is said to be the largest, most fl.ouri~bing, and every way fue most important u.'!er.xmission.coml-drud}fmtmanlhlml/patlielpattia.htrnl 1021122 5/19/13 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824---1830 mission on the coast. For its consumption fifty beeves are killed weeldy. The bides and tallow are sold to ships fur goods, and other articles fur the use of the Indians, who are better dressed in general, than the Spaniards. All the income of the mission is placed :in the hands of the priests, who give out clothing and fuod, according as it is required. They are also self constituted guardians of the female part of the mission, shutting up under lock and key, one hour after supper, all those, whose husbands are absent, and all young women and girls above nine years of age. During the day, they are entrusted to the care ofthe matrons. Notwithstanding this, all the precautions taken by the vigilant futhers of the church are fuund insufficient. I saw women in irons fur misconduct, and men in the stocks. The furtl'U are expected to remain a widow six months after the death of a husband, after which period they may many again. The priests appoint officers to superintend the natives, while they are at work, from a.roong themselves. They are called alcaides , and are very rigid in exacting the perfOrmance of the allotted tasks, applying the rod to those who full short of the portion of labor assigned them They are taught in the diffurent trades; some of them being blacksmiths, others carpenters and shoe-makers. Those, trained to the knowledge of music, both vocal and instrumental, are intended fur the service of the church. The women and girls sew, knit, and spin wool upon a large whee~ which is woven into bJankets by the men. The alcaides, after finishing the business of the day, give an account of it to the priest, and then kiss his hand, befure they withdraw to their wigwams, to pass the night. This mission is composed of parts of five difrerent tribes, who speak dment languages. The greater part of these Indians were brought from their native mountains against their own inclinations, and by compulsion; [214] and then baptised; which act was as little voluntary on their part, as the fu:nner had been After these preliminaries, they had been put to work, as converted Indians. The next mission on my way was that, called St. John the Baptist The mountains here approach so near the ocean, as to leave only room enough fur the location of the mission. The waves dash upon the shore immediately in front of it. The priest, who presides over this mission, was in the habit of indulging his love of wine and stronger liquors to such a degree, as to be often intoxicated. The church had been shattered by an earthquake. Between twenty and thirty of the Indians, men, women and children, had been suddenly destroyed by the fulling of the church bells upon them After co111l11Ullicating the vaccine matter to 600 natives, I left this place, where mountains rose behind to shelter it; and the sea stretched out its boundless expanse befure it. Contimring my route I reached my next point of destination. This establis~nt-was called the mission of St. Gabriel Here I vaccinated 960 individuals. The course from the mission ofSt. John the Baptist to this place led me from the sea-shore, a distance of from eighteen to twenty miles. Those, who selected the position of this mission, fullowed the receding mountains. It extends from their fuot, having in front a large tract of country showing srmll barren hills, and yet aflOrding pasturage fur herds of cattle so numerous, that their number is unknown even to the all surveying and systematic priests. In this species of riches St. Gabriel exceeds all the other establishments on the coast. The sides of the mountains here are covered with a growth of live oak and pine. The chain to which these mountains belong, extends along the whole length of the coast. The furt St. Peter stands on the sea coast, parallel to this mission. My next advance was to a small town, inhabited by Spaniards, called the town of The Angels. The houses have flat roofS, covered with bituminous pitch, brought from a place within four miles ofthe town, where this article boils up from the earth. As the liquid rises, hollow bubbles like a shell of a [215] large size, are furmed. When they burst, the noise is heard distinctly in the town. The material is obtained by breaking off portions, that have become hard, with an axe, or something of the kind. The large pieces thus separated, are 1aid on the root; previously covered with earth, through which the pitch carmot penetrate, when it is rendered liquid again by the heat of the sm. In this place I vaccinated 2,500 persons. user.Jmission.com/-ctud}lrnlrnanlhlml/patlie/patlia.hlrnl 103/122 5119/13 Pattie's Personal Narraliw, 1824--1830 From this p:lace I went to the mission of St. Ferdinand, where I communicated the matter to 967 subjects. St. Ferdinand :is thirty miles east of the coast, and a :fine place in point of position. The mission ofSt. Buenaventura succeeded. Not long previous to my arrival here, two priests had eloped from the establishment, taking with them what gold and silver they could Jay their hands upon. They chose an American vesse~ in which to make their escape. I practised my new calling upon 1 000 persons in this mission. The next point I reached was the furt ofSt Barbara. I fuund several vessels lying here. I went on board of them, and spent some pleasant evenings in company with the co:rmnanders. I ergoyed the contrast of such society with that of the priests and Indians, among whom I had lately been. This place has a garrison of fifty or sixty soldiers. The mission lies a half a mile N. W. of the furt. It :is situated on the summit of a hill, and a:ffurds a fine view of the great deep. Many are the hours I passed during this long and lonely journey, through a country every way strange and fureign to me, in looking on the ceaseless motion of its waves. The great Leviathan too played therein. I have often watched him, as he threw spouts of water into the air, and moved h:is huge body through the liquid surfuce. My subjects here a:mol.mted to 2600. They were principally Indians. The next mission on my route was that called St. Enos. I vaccinated 900 of its inhabitants, and proceeded to St. Cruz, where I operated upon 650. My next advance was to St. Luis Ob:ispes. Here I fuund. 800 subjects. The mission of St. MJchael fuDowed in order. In it I vaccinated 1850 persons. [216] My next theatre of operations was at St. John Bap:istrnno. 900 was the number that received vaccination here. Thence I went to La So1ada, and vaccinated 1685, and then proceeded to St Carlos, and co:rnrnunicated the matter to 800. From the Jatter mission I passed on to the furt ofMonte ElRey, where :is a garrison ofa hundred soldiers. I fuund. here 500 persons to vaccinate. The name of this place in English signifies the King's mount or hill. Forests spread armmd Monte El Rey fur miles in all directions, composed of thick clusters of pines and live oaks. Numberless grey bears find their home, and range in these deep woods. They are frequently known to attack men. The Spaniards take great numbers of them by stratagem, ldlling an old horse in the neighborhood of their pJaces of resort. They erect a sca:lfuld near the dead animal, upon which they place themselves during the night, an:red with a gun or lance. When the bear approaches to eat, they either shoot it, or pierce it with the lance from their elevated position. N otwitbstanding: an their precautions, however, they are sometimes caught by the wounded animal; and after a man has once wrestled with a bear, he will not be likely to desire to make a second trial of the saxre gymnastic exercise. Such, at any rate, :is the opinion I have heard those express, who have had the good furtune to come off alive from a contest of this kind. I do not speak fur myself in this matter, as I never caxre so near as to take the close hug with one in my lifu; though to escape it, I once came near breaking my neck down a precipice. From Monte El Rey I advanced to the mission of St. Anthony, which lies thirty miles E. from the coast In it I fuund one thousand persons to inoculate. I had now reached the region of small pox, several cases of it having occurred in this mission. The ruling priest of this establishment infurmed me, that he did not consider it either necessary or advisable fur me to proceed :further fur the purpose of inoculating the inbab:itan:t:s of the country, as the small pox had prevailed universally through its whole remaining extent. As I had heard, while in [217] San Diego, great numbers had been carried off by it. I then told him that I w:ished to see the church officer who had been described to me by the first priest whom I had seen on my way up the coast. He furnished me a horse, and I set off fur the port ofSanF:ranc:isco, vaccinating those whom I fuund on the way who had not bad the smallpox. I reached the above mentioned pJace, on the twentieth ofJune, 1829. Finding the person of whom I was in search, I presented him an the certificates of the priests of the missions in which I bad vaccinated, and the letter of the General I had inoculated in all twenty-two thousand persons. After he had finished the perusal of these papers, he 104/122 5119113 Pattie's Perslll'lt:l! Narratiw, 1824--1830 asked me, what I thought nzy services were worth? I replied, that I shoukl leave that point entirely in his judgment and decision. He then remarked, that he must have so:rne time to reflect upon the subject, and that I must spend a week or two with him I consented willingly to tlris proposa], as I was desirous of crossing the bay of San Francisco to the Russian settlement,. called the Bodego. I proceeded to carry nzy wish into execution on the 23rd, accompanied by two Coriac Indians, whose occupation was the killing of sea otters fur the Russians, who hire them into their service. Those who pursue this employment, have water crafts made of the sea lions' skins, in the shape of a canoe. Over tlris spreads a top, completely covered in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of the entrance of any water. An opening is left at the bow and stern, over which the person who has entered draws a covering of the same material with that of the boat, which :fustens firmly over the aperture in such a manner, as to make this part entirely water proof; as any other portion of the boat. Two persons generally occupy :it. No position can be more secure than theirs, from an the dangers of the sea. The waves dash over them hannless. The occupants are stationed, one at the bow, and the other at the stem; the latter guides the boat, while the other is provided with a [218] spear, which he darts into the otter whenever he comes within its reach. Great numbers are thus taken. But to return to myselE We crossed the bay, which is about three miles in width. It is made by the entrance of a considerable river, called by the Spaniards Rio de San Francisco. After we reached the north shore, we travelled through a beautiful country, wkh a rich soil, wen watered and timbered, and reached the Russian settlerrent in the night, having come a distance of thirty miles. As our journey had been made on foot, and we had eaten nothing, I was exceedingly futigued and hungry. I accompanied my fellow travellers, who belonged here, to their wigwa.ms, where I obtained some fuod, and a seal skin to sleep upon. Early in the morning I arose, and :learning from one of my late companions where was the dwelling of the commander of the place, I proceeded towards it. I bad become acquainted with this person while I was vaccinating the inhabitants of San Diego. He came there in a brig, and insisted upon my proJ:Dil;ing him that I would come and communicate the remedy to the people ofhis estab~nts. o:ffuring to recompense me fur nzy services. I agreed to do what he wished, shoukl it be in my power. Accordingly, finding that the Spaniard did not intend to keep a strict guard over my movements, I availed myself of this opportunity of fu1fiDing the expressed wish ofDon Seraldo, fur so was he called. I reached the pJace pointed out to ~ by the :friendly Indian, and was received by the above mentioned gentleman with the warmest expressions of kindness and friendship. He said that so long a time had elapsed since he saw l:l:Je, he was afraid I had furgotten our conversation together, and that circumstances had rendered my coming to him ~ossible. He had sufrered greatly from the rear that the small pox would spread among his people, befure he should be enabled to prevent danger :from it, through the means of the kine pox. After breakfust, he circulated an order among the people, for an who wished to be provided with a safe guard against the terrible malady that had approached them so near, to come to [219] his door. In a rew hours I began my operations; and continued to be constantly occupied fur three days, vaccinating during this period fifteen hundred individuals. I reminded them all that they must return on the fourth day, provided no signs of the complaint appeared; and that they were not to rub, or roughly touch the spot, should the vaccine matter have proper e:ffuct. This done, Don Seraldo o:ffirred to accompany me through the furt and around the settle~nt, in order to show me the position, and every thing which might be new and interesting to me. Its situation is one of the most beautiful that I ever beheld, or that the imagination can conceive. The furt stands on the brow of a handsome hill, about two hundred feet above the level of the sea. This hill is surrounded on all sides fur two miles with a charming plain. A lofty mountain whose sides present the nob :lest depth of furest, raises a summit, g]ittering with perpetual ice and snow on one hand, and on the other the level surface is lost in the waves of the sea. Clear cold streams pour down 105/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 the mountain, unceasingly from d:iffurent points, and glide through the plain, imparting moisture and verdure. The same miliitudes of domestic animals, that are every where seen in this cmmtry, graze armmd in the pastures. They find abundant pasturage in the wi1d oats, which grow spontaneously upon this coast. Very little attention is paid to cUltivation, where so many advantages are united to :favor it. The amount of produce of any kind raised is small, and the inhabitants depend fur bread entirely upon the Spaniards. I remained in this delightful place one week. At the expiration of this time Don Serakio gave me one hundred dollars, as payment fur my services, and then mounted me upon a horse and conducted me back to the bay himsel.t; and remained on 'the shore, until he saw me safe upon the other side. I soon saw myself again :in the presence of the Spanish priest, from whom I was to receive my recompense fur the services perronned on my long tour. He was not aware where I bad been, until I :infunned him When I bad toki him, he asked [220]me what Don Serakio had paid me? I stated this matter as it was. He then demanded of me, how I liked the coast of Califurnia? I answered, that I very nruch admired the appearance of the country. :His next question was, how I would like the :idea of living in it? It would be agreeable to me, I returned, were it subject to any other funn of goverrn:rent. He proceeded to question me upon the ground of my objections to the present form of goverr:nrent? I was careful not to satisfY him on this point. He then handed me a written piece of paper, the translation of which is as follows: I certiJY, that James 0. Pattie has vaccinated an the Indians and whites on this coast, and to recompense him fur the same, I give the said James 0. Pattie my obligation fur one thousand head of cattle, and Jand to pasture them; that is, 500 cows and 500 :mules. This he is to receive after be becomes a Catholic, and a subject ofthis government. Given in the missionofSt Francisco on the 8th ofJuly, in the year 1829. JOHN CABORTES When I bad read this, without making use of any figure of speech, I was struck dumb. My anger choked me. As I was wen aware of 'the tact, that this man had it in his power to hang me if I insuhed him, and that here there was no Jaw to give me redress, and compel him to pay me justly for my services, I said nothing fur some time, but stood looking him full in the fuce. I camot judge whether he read my displeasure, and burning feelings in my countenance, as I t1rus eyed him, and would have sought to pacifY me, or not; but befure I made a movement of any kind, he spoke, saying, 'you look displeased, sir.' Prudential considerations were sufficient to withhold me no longer, and I answered in a short manner, 1hat I felt at that moment as though I should rejoice to :find myself once more in a country where I should be justly dealt by. He asked me, what I meant when I spoke ofbeing justly dealt by? I told him [221] what my meaning was, and wished to be in my own country, where there are Jaws to compel a :man to pay another what he justly owes him, without his having the power to attach to the debt, as a condition upon which the payment is to depend, the submission to, and gratification of: any ofhis whimsical desires. Upon this 'the priest's tone became loud and angry as he said, 'then you regard my proposing that you should become a Catholic, as the expression of an uqjust and whimsical desire!' I toki him 'yes, that I did; and that I would not change my present opinions for an the money his mission was worth; and moreover, \"that befure I would consent to be adopted :into the society and companionship of such a band of murderers and robbers, as I deemed were to be fumtd along this coast, fur the pitiful amount of one thousand head of cattle, I would suffur death.' When I had thus given honest and pJain utterance to the feelings, which swelled within me, the priest ordered me to leave his house. I walked out quickly, and possessed myself of my rifle, as I did not know, but some of his attendants a,t hand might be set upon me; fur if the comparison be allowable the priests of this country have the 106/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 people as much and entirely under their control and command, as the people of our own countly have a good bidable dog. For rear they should come barking at me, I hastened away, and proceeded to a ranch , where I procured a horse fur three dollars, which I mounted, and took the route fur Monte El Rey. I did not stop, nor stay on my journey to thE p1ace. I fuund upon my arrival there, an American vessel in port, just ready to sail, and on the point of departure. Meeting the Captain on shore, I made the necessary arrangements with him fur accompanying him, and we went on board together. The anchor was now weighed, and we set sail In the course of an hour, I was thoroughly sick, and so continued for one week. I do not know any word, that explains my feelings in this case so well as that of heart sickness. I ate noihing, or little all thE time; but after I recovered, my appetite [222] returned in tenfOld strength, and I never enjoyed better health in my lifu. We continued at sea fur several months, sailing from one port to another, and finally returned to that ofMonte El Rey, from which we had set sail. It was now the 6th of January, 1830, and I feh anxious to hear something in relation to my companions, from whom I had so long been separated. I accordingly went on shore, where I m:rt with a great number of acquaintances, both Americans and English. The latter infOrmed me, that there was a revolution in the country, a part of the inhabitants having revohed against the constituted authorities. The revoked party seemed at present like1y to gain the ascendency. They had promised the English and Alrericans the same privileges, and 1iberty in regard to the trade on the coast, that bekmged to the native citizens, upon the condition, that these people aided them in their attempt to gain their freedom, by imparting advice and funds. This infOrmation gladdened my very heart. I do not know, if the fueling be not wrong; but I instantly thought of the unspeakable pleasure I should e~oy at seeing the genera~ who had imprisoned me, and treated me so little like a man and a Christian, in futters himsel\u00a3 Under the :influence of these feelings, I readily and cbeerfuDy appropriated a part of my little store to their use, I would min have accompanied them in hopes to have one shot at the general with my rifle. But the persuasions of my col.ID1rymen to the contrary prevailed with ~. They assigned, as reasons fur their advice, that it was enough to give cmmsel and funds at first, and that the better pJan would be, to see how they managed their own affitirs, befure we comnitted ourselves, by taking an active part in them, as they had been fuund to be a treacherous people to deal with. On the 8th of the month, Gen Joachim Solis p1aced himself at the head of one hundred and fifty sokliers well armed, and began his march from Monte El Rey to the furt ofSt Francisco. He was accompanied by two cannon, which, he said, he should make thunder, if the furt was not quietly given up to him Gen Solis had been transferred from a cmrnnand in the city of Mexico [223] to take command of the insurgents, as soon as they should have formed the1melves into so~thing like an organized party, and have come to a head. He had left Monte El Rey with such a furce as circumstances enabled him to coTiect, recru:iting upon his route, and inducing aTI to join him, whom he could influence by fuir words and promises. As has been said, he threatened the furt of St. Francisco with a bloody contest, in case they resisted his wishes. He carried with him written addresses to the inhabitants, :in which those, who would range themselves under his standard, were o:flered every thing that renders :lifu desirable. They all :flocked round hlm, giving in their adhesion. When he reached the fort, he sent in his propositions, which were acceded to, as soon as read by the majority. The minority were principally officers. They were all imprisoned by General Solis, as soon as he obtained possession of the place. He then proceeded to make laws, by which the inhabitants were to be governed, and placed the furt in the bands of those, upon whom, he thought he could depend.- These a:rrangements being all made, he began his return to Monte El Rey, highly delighted with his success. user.lmission.com/-crl.ld)lmtmanlhlml/patlia/pal.tia.hlml 107/122 511SI13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 There now seemed 1itt1e doubt oflris obtaining possession of the whole coast in the course of a fuw months. He remained at Monte El Rey increasing his furce, and drilling the new recruits, until the 28th ofMarch, when he again marched at the bead of two hundred sokliers. The present object of attack was Santa Barbara, where the commander under the old regime was stationed. The latter was Gen. Echedio, my old acquaintance of San Diego, for whom I bore such good will He was not in the least aware of the visit intended him by Gen. Solis; the 1atter having prevented any tidings upon the subject reaching him, by posting sentinels thickJy fur some distance upon the road, that lay between them, to intercept and stop any one passing up or down. The insurgent General bad as yet succeeded in his p1ans; and was so elated with the prospect of surprising Gen. Ecbedio, and completely di;possessing him of his power, and consequently having all in his own hands, that he [224] did not consider it necessary any longer to conceal his real character. The proressions of the kind purposes of the insurgent towards the English and Americans will be recollected; and also, that it was at a time when application was made by these Spaniards to them for aid. The tone was now changed. Threats were now made, with regard to the future treatment, which we, unfOrtunate 'fOreigners, might expect, as soon as Gen. Solis became master of the coast. We reamed this through a Mexican Spaniard, whose daughter Captain Cooper had married. This old gentleman was told by the General, that he intended either to compel every American and Englishman to swear allegiance to the govermnent, which should be established, or drive them from the country. This infOrmation was, however, not con:nmmicated to us, until the General bad departed We held a consultation upon the subject, to devise some means, which should render him incapable of carrying his good :intentions towards us :into effuct. No other expedient suggested itself to us, but that of sending General Echedio :infOrmation of the proposed attack, in time to enable him to he prepared fur it. We agreed upon this, and a letter was written, stating what we deemed the points most necessary fur him to know. The signatures of some of the principal men of the place were affixed to it; fur those who 'think alike upon important points soon understand one another; and the character of Solis bad not been wve:iled to us alone. It was important, that General Echedio should attach consequence to our letter, and the infurmation, it contained, would come upon him so entirely by surprize, that he might very naturally entertain doubts of its correctness. I added my :narr:1e to those of the party to which I belonged. 'The object now was to have our doc~nt conveyed sa:fuly :into the bands of Gen. Echedio. We sent a runner with two good horses and instructions, how to pass the anny of Solis in the night undiscovered. All proceedings had been conducted with so nruch secrecy and caution, that the matter so fur rested entirely with ourselves. We occasionally heard the c.iJ:mms around [225] us express di;like towards the insurgent General; but as they did not seem inclined to carry their opinions :into action, we concluded these were only remarks made to draw out our thoughts, and took no notice of them From after circumstances I believe, that the number ofbis enemies exceeded that of his friends; and that the remarks, of which I have spoken, were made in truth and sincerity. Mean while we impatiently awaited some opportunity of operating to the disadvantage of the General, and to bear what had taken place between him and Gen. Echedio. A messenger arrived on the 12th of April with the infurmation, that the commander of the :insurgents had ranged his men for three days in succession befure the furt upon the plain A continual firing had been kept up on both sides, during the three days, at the expiration of which Gen Solis, having expended his a:rrmmition, and consumed his provisions, was compelled to withdraw, having sustained no loss, except that of one horse from a sustained action of three days! The spirit with which the contest was conducted may be inferred from a fuct, related to me. 'The cannon balls discharged :from the furt upon the enemy were discharged with so little furce, that persons arrested them in their course, without sustaining any rryury by so doing, at the point, where :in the common order of things, they must have inflicted death. Upon the reception of this news, we joined in the prevalent expression of opinion around us. The name and fume of Gen. Solis was exahed to the skies. All the florid comparisons, usual upon such occasions, were put :in requisition, and all the changes were sung upon his various characteristics wit, honor and courage. The point was carried so fur 1081122 5119/13 Pattie's Personal Narraliw, 1824--1830 as to bring him within some degrees of relationship to a supernatural being. Then the unbounded skill he displayed in marshalling his furce, and his extreme care to prevent the useless waste ofhis men's lives were expatiated upon, and placed in the strongest light The climax of his excellence was his having retreated without the loss of a man. This was the burden of our theme to his friends, that is, the fifty soldiers, in whose charge he bad left the command of the [226] furt. The Captain Cooper, of whom I have spoken, looked rather deeper into things, than those around him; and consequently knew the most e:frectual means of operating upon the inefficient machines, in the furm of men, which it was necessary fur our present purpose, to re:move out of the way fur a time. Accordingly he rolled out a barrel of good okl rum, inviting all the friends of the good and great Gen Solis to come, and drink his health. The summons was readily obeyed by them Being somewhat elevated in spirit by the proceedings of their noble genera], previous to swallowing the genuine :inspiration of joy, the fueling afterwards swelled to an extent, that burst all bounds, and finally left them prostrate and powerless. We, like good Christians, with the help of some of the inhabitants, conveyed them into some strong houses, which stood near, while they remained in their helpless condition, 1ocking the doors safuly, that no harm might come to them In our pity and care fur them, we proposed, that they should remain, until they relt that violent excit:ements are nyurious, from the natural re-action of things. We now proceeded to circulate another set of views, and opinions among the inhabitants in the vicinity of the furt; and such was our success in the business of indoctrination, that we soon counted all their votes on our side. General Solis was now pitched down the depths, as heartily as he had befure been exalted to the heights. Huzza fur Gen. Echedio and the Americans! was the prevailing cry. The next movement was to make out a Jist of our 11ames, and appoint officers. Our number including Scotch, Irish, English, Dutch and Americans, amounted to thirty-nine. The number of Americans, however, being the greatest, our party received the designation of Arrerican Captaln Cooper was our commanding officer. We now marched up to the castle, which is situated on the brink of a precipice, overlooking the sea, and fuund fuur brass fie]d pieces, :motm.ted on carriages. These we concluded to cany with us to the furt. The remainder placed so as to command a sweep of the sur.face of water below, and the surrmmding ground, we spiked rearing, ffthey fell into the [227] hands of Solis, that he might break down our walls with them This done, we went to the magazine, and broke it open, taking what powder and ball we wanted. We then posted sentinels fur miles along the road, to which we knew Solis was hastening in order to prevent news of our proceedings from reaching him, befure it was convenient fur us, that he should know them We were aware ofhis intention to return here to recruit again, and it was our wish to surprize him by an unexpected reception, and thus obtain an advantage, which should counterbalance his superiority of numbers. In so doing, we only availed ourselves of the precedent, be had given us, in his managerrent with regard to Gen Echedio. He had not derived benefit from his pJan, in consequence ofhis too great confidence of success, which led him to discover his real feelings towards ow: people. We hoped to avail ourselves of what was wise in his plan, and profit by his mistakes. We shut up all the people, both men and women, in the furt at night, that it might be out of their power to attempt to make their way, under the cover of darkness, through our line of sentinels, to give information, should the inclination be felt. Our precautions were not taken through rear of him, should he even come upon us, prepared to encounter us as enemies: but from the wish to take both himself and army prisoners. Should they learn what we bad done, we feared, they would pass on to St. Francisco, to recruit, and thus escape us. Our designs were successful; fur in a rew days General Solis and his men appeared in sight of the first of our sentinels, who quickly transmitted this infOrmation to us. Our preparations fur receiving him were soon made, with a proper regard to politeness. A regale of music from air ins1:n.D:rents, called cannons, was in readiness to incline him to the right view of the scene befure him, should he seem not likely to confOrm to our wish, which was, simply, tl:Jat 109/122 5/19!13 Pattie's Personal Narrati~, 1824--1830 he should surrender to us without making any difficulty. Our fOrtification was in the furm of a square, with only one entrance. From each side of this entrance a wall projected at [228] right angles from it fifty yards. The Spaniards call them wings; and it seems to me a significant and fitting name fur them We intended to allow the approaching party to advance between these walls, befure we began our part. Our camons were charged with grape and balls, and placed in a position to produce an efrect between the waTh:J. Every man was now at his post, and General Solis approaching within sight of the furt, a srmlJ cannon which accompanied him was discharged by way of sahrte. No answer was returned to him. The piece was reloaded, and his fire and dnnn began a lively air, and the whole body moved in a quick step towards the furt, entering the space between the wings, of which I have spoken. This was no sooner done than our matches were in readiness fur instant operation. Captain Cooper commanded them to surrender. He was irrn.mdiately obeyed by the sokliers, who threw down their arms, aware that death woukl be the penalty of their refusal The General and six o1 his mounted officers fled, directing their course to St Francisco. Six of our party were soon on horseback with our rifles, and in pursuit of them I had been appointed orderly sergeant, and was one of the six. We carried orders from the principal Spanish civil officer, who was in the furt, and bad taken an active part in a11 our proceedings, to bring the General back with us, either dead or alive. The commands of our military commander, Captain Cooper, spoke the same 1anguage. I confess that I wanted to have a shot at the fugitive, and took pleasure in the pursuit. We went at full speed, fur our horses were good and fresh. Those belonging to the party we were so desirous to overtake, would of course be somewhat weary, and jaded by their kmg jomney. We had not galloped many miles, befure we perceived them in advance of us. As soon as we were within hearing distance of each other, I called upon them to surrender. They replied by wheeling their horses and firing at us, and then striking their spurs into their horses' sides, to urge them onward. We :ID1lowed, producing more efrect with our spurs than they had done, and calling upon [229] them again to surrender, or we should :fire, and give no quarter. They at length reined up, and six dismounted and laid down their arms. 'The seventh remained on horse back, and as we came up, fired, wounding one of our mnnber sligbtly in the right arm He then turned to resume his :ffigbt; but his horse had not made the second spring, befure our guns brought the hero from his saddle. Four of our ba:Ds had passed through his body. 1be whole mnnber being now assembled together, victors and vanquished, General Solis offured me his sword. I refused it, but told him, that :hirmelf and his officers must accompany tm in my return to the fOrt. He consented to this with a countenance so expressive of dejection, that I pitied him, notwithstanding I knew him to be a bad rmm, and destitute of all princip:Je. The man who bad lost his lifu through his obstinacy, was bowd upon his horse, and the others having remounted theirs, we set out upon our return. Our captives were all disarmed except General Solis, who was allowed to retain his sword. We reached the furt three hours befOre stmSet. The General and his men were dismounted, and irons put upon their leg;, after which they were locked up with those who had :IDrgotten themselves in their joy at the good :IDrtme of their poor general These events occurred on the 18th of March. On the 20th the civil officer of whom I have be:IDre spoken, together with Captain Cooper, despatched a messenger to General Echedio, who was still in Santa Barbara with written intelligence of what we had accomplished. It was stated that the Americans were the originators of the whole matter, and that their 1lag was waving in the breeze over Monte El Rey, where it would remain, until his excellency came :hirmelfto take charge of the place; and he was requested to hasten his departure, as they who had obtained possession were anxious to be relieved from the care and responsibility they :IDund imposed upon them We were very well aware that he would receive our infunmtion with unming]ed pleasure, as he expected Solis 110/122 5119/13 Pattie's Personal Nam.ttiiR3, 1824--1830 would return in a short time to Santa Barbara, to give him another battle. [230] It was said, that upon the reception of the letter he was as much rejoiced as though he had been requested to come and take charge of a kingdom As soon as he could make the necessary arnmgements he CClllE to Monte E1 Rey, where he arrived on the 29th. We gave the command of the place up to him; but befure he would suffur our flag to be taken down, he had thirty guns discharged in honor of it He then requested a list of our names, saying, that if we would accept it, he would give each one of us the right of citizenship in his country. A splendid dinner was made by him fur our party. On the night of the 29th a vessel arrived in the port. In the morning it was round to be a brig belonging to the Atrerican consul at Macho, John W. Jones, esq., who was on board of it. This was the same person to whom I wrote when in prison at San Diego by Mr. Perkins. I met with lrim, and had the melancholy pleasure of relating to him in person my sufrerings and imprisonment, and every thing, in short, that had happened to me during my stay in this country. This took place in my first interview with him He advised me to make out a correct statement of the value of the furs I had lost by the General's detention of me, and also of the length of time I had been imprisoned, and to take it with me to the city of Mexico, where the American minister resided, and place it in his hands. It was probable, the consul continued, that he would be able to compel the Mexican government to indemnifY me fur the loss of property I had sustained, and fur the nyustice of my imprisonment. The probability of my success was not slight, provided I could establish the truth of my statement, by obtaining the testimony of those who were eye witnesses of the :facts. I infurmed the consul that I had not means to enable me to reach the city of Mexico. A gentleman who was present during this conversation, after hearing my last remark, mentioned that he was then on his way to that place, and that if I would accompany him he would pay my expenses; and if circUI.11Stances should happen to induce me to think of returning thence to tbe United States, I should do so free of expense. I expressed my thanks [231] fur this o:trer, and said that if I succeeded in recovering only a portion of what I had lost I woukl repay the money thus kindly expended in my behaJf; but the ob]igation of gratitude imposed by such an act, it woukl be impossible fur me to repay. In confOrmity to Mr. Jones' advice and instruction, I sat myself down to make out an account fur the inspection of the American minister. When I had completed it, I obtained the signatures, of some of the first among the inhabitants ofMonte El Rey, and that of the civil officer before mmtioned, testifYing as to the truth of what I said, so :fur as the circumstances narrated had come under their observation. The General having received the list of our names, which he had requested, he now desired, that we might all come to his office, and receive the right of citizenship :from his band, as a reward fur what we had done. I put my paper in my pocket, and proceeded with my companions and Mr. Jones to the indicated p1ace. The General had been much surprized to find my name in the list fi.nnished him; but as I entered the room, he arose hastily from his seat and shook my hand in a friendly manner, after which I introduced him to the consul He see:rred surprised as he heard the name of this gentleman, but said nothing. After pointing us to seats, he walked out of the room, saying he shoukl return in a fuw moments. I concluded, that he thought, I had brought the consul, or that he had accompanied ~ fur the purpose of questioning him on the subject of my imprisomnent and that of my companions. He retwned, as soon as he had promised, having so~ papers in his hand. After he bad seated hinlsel4 he began to interrogate ~ with regard to what had happened to ~, during the long time that had e1apsed since he had last seen me, adding, that he did not expect ever to have ~t me again; but was happy to see me a citizen of his country. My answer in reply to the last part of his remarks was short. I told him, he had not yet enjoyed any thing :from tbat source, and with my consent never shoukl. He looked very serious upon this m:mifustation offinmess, or [232] whatever it may be called on my part, and requested to know my objections to being a citizen of the country? user .>rnlssi on.coml-crud}(rntmanthtmlfpattialpattie.hlm! 1111122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narraliw, 1824--1830 rep tied that it was simply having been reared in a country where I could pass from one town to another, without the protection of a passport, which instead of affording real protection, subjected me to the examination of every petty officer, near whom I passed, and that I should not willingly remain, where such was the order of things. Besides, I added, I was liable to be thrown into pmon like a criminal, at the caprice of one clothed with a little authority, ifl fuiled to show a passport, which I might either lose accidentally, or in some way, fur which I might not have been in the least in mult. The Genera~ in reply, asked me if in my country a fureigner was permitted to travel to and fro, without first presenting to the properly constituted authorities of our govennnent, proof from those am:mg the officers ofhis own government appointed fur that purpose, of his being a person of good character, who might safuly be allowed to traverse the cmmtry? I told him I had once attempted to samzy him on that head, and he very abruptly and decidedly contradicted my account; and that now I did not reel in the 1east compe11.ed, or inclined to enter upon the matter a second time. All which I desired ofhim, and that I did not earnestly desire, was, that he would give me a passport to travel into my own cmmtry by fue way of the city of Mexico. If! could once more place my fuot upon its free soil, and enjoy the priceJess bJessing$ of its liberty, which my unfOrtunate father, of whom I could never cease to 1hink, and who had died in his prison, assisted in maintaining, I should be satisfied. While I thus spoke, he gazed steadily in my face. His swarthy complexion grew pa1e. He read in my countenance a strong expression of deep feeling, awakened by the nature of the remembrances associated with him He felt that there was something rearful in the harvest of bitterness which the oppressor reaps in return fur his quries and cruelties. I thought, he [233] reared, if he did not grant my request fur a pass, that I might carry into execution the purposes of vengeance; to which I used to give utterance in my burning indjgnation at his conduct at the time of my father's death. Whenever I saw him pass my prison I seized the opportunity to tell him, that if my time fur redress ever came, he would find me as unflinching in my vengeance as he had been in his injuries. I only expressed the truth with regard to my reelings at the i:il're, and even now I owe it to candor and honesty to acknowledge, that I could have seen him at the moment oft:lffi conversation su:ffur any infliction without pity. He did not hesitate to give the pass I desired; but asked ~ what business led ~ out of my way to the United States around by the city of Mexico? My direct course, he remarked, Jay in a straight direction through New Mexico. For reply, I drew out of my pocket the paper I had written befOre coming to his office, and read it to him, telling him that was the business which Jed~ to the city ofMexico. I then asked him if all the facts there stated were not true? His answer was in the affirmative; 'but,' added he, 'you will not be able to recover any thing, as I acted in confOrmity to the laws of my country. If you will remain in this country I will give you sol'l::etbing handso~ to begin with.' I assured him that I would not stay, but I wished him to show me the laws which allowed, or justified him in imprnoning myself and my companions fur entering a country as we did, compelled by rnisfurtunes such as ours. In return, he said he bad no laws to show, but those which recommended him to take up and imprison those whom he deemed conspirators against his country. 'What marks of our being conspirators did you discover in us,' rejoined I, 'wbich warranted your imprisoning us? I am aware of none, unless it be the evidence furnished by our comtenances and appare~ that we had undergone the extrel'l::e of misfortune and distress, which had come upon us without any agency on our part, and as inevitab:Je evils to which every human being is liable. We were led by the hope of obtaining relief, to seek refuge in your protection [234] In confirmation of our own relation, did not our papers prove that we were Americans, and that we had received legal pe~sion from the very gove~ under which we then were, to trade in the country? The printed declaration to this effuct, given us by the governor of Santa Fe, which we showed you, you tore in pieces befure us, dec1aring it was neither a license nor a passport.' The General replied, that he did tear up a paper given him by us, but that in fuct it was neither a passport nor a license. 112/122 Pattie's Personal happy tbat :it is in my power to prove, in the presence of the American consul, the truth of what I have said with regard to the license.\" I then produced another copy of the paper tom up by him, which had been given my father by the governor of Santa Fe, at the same titre with the furrner. He looked at :it, and said nothing more, except that I might go on, and try what I could do in the way of recovering what I had lost. The consul and myself now left him, and returned to Capt. Cooper's. The consul laughed at me about my quarre] with the General In a rew :tmments the latter appeared among us, and the remainder of the day passed away cheerfully in drinking toasts. When the General rose to take leave of us, he requested the consul to call upon him at his office; as he wanted to converse with him upon business. The consul went, according to request, and the General contracted with him fur the transportation of Gen. So1is, and sixteen other prisoners to San Bias, on board his vesse~ whence they were to be carried to the city ofMexico. The 7th ofMaywas :fixed :fur the departure of the brig, as the General required some time :fur making necessary arrangements, and preparing documents to accompany the transmission of the prisoners. When I heard that this delay was unavoidable, I went to the Genera] and returned my passport, telling him I shou1d want another, when the vessel was ready to sail, as I intended to proceed in :it as fur as San B1as. He consented to give me one, and then joked with me about the [235] honor, I should e11ioy, ofaccompan:ylng Gen. So :lis. I replied in the same strain, and left him. Captain William H. Hinkley and myself went to the mission of San Carlos, where we spent three days. During the whole tit:ne, we did little beside express our astonishment at what we saw. We bad :fhl1en upon the :fustivaldays of some saint, and the services per:furmed in his honor all passed l.Dlder our eyes. They were not a rew, nor wanting in variety, as this was a noted festival Our admiration, however, was principally excited by the contest between grizzly bears and bulls, which constitutes one of the exhibitions of these peop:le. Five Jarge grey bears had been caught, and fastened in a pen built :fur the purpose of confining the buDs, during a bu1lba:iting. One of the latter anilmJs, held by ropes, was brought to the spot by men on horseback, and thrown down. A bear was then drawn up to him, and they were fastened together by a rope about fifteen feet in :length, in such a :manner, that they could not separate from each other. One end of :it is tied arol.Dld one of the furereet ofthe bull, and the other armmd one of the hind reet ofthe bear. The two were then left to spring upon their reet. As soon as this movement is made, the bull makes at the bear, very often deciding the fate of the :furocious animal in this first act If the bull fails in goring the bear, the fierce animal seizes him and tears him to death. Fourteen oftbe latter lost their lives, befure the five bears were destroyed. To Captain Hinkley this was a sight of novel and absorbing interest. It had 1ess of novelty fur me, as since I bad been on the coast, I bad o:ften seen sttnilar combats, and in met worse, having been present when men entered the enclosure to encounter the powerfi.d bull in his wild and untamed fierceness. These unfOrtunate persons are armed with a small sword, with which they sometimes succeed in saving their own lives at the expense of that of the animal I once saw the man full in one of these horrible shows; they are conducted in the fullowing manner: the man enters to the bull with the weapon, of which he avails himself; in the right [236] hand, and in the left a small red flag fastened to a staff about three reet in length. He whistles, or makes some other noise, to attract the attention of the anima~ upon hearing which the bull comes towards him with the speed of fury. The man stands firm, with the flag dangling be:fure him, to receive this terrible onset. When 1he bull makes the last spring towards him, he dexterously evades it, by throwing his body from behind the tJag to one side, at the same time 1hrusting his sword :into the animafs side. If this blow is properly directed, blood gushes from the :tmuth and nostrils of the bull, and he fulls dead. A second blow in this case is seldom required. Another mode of killing these animals is by men on horseback, with a spear, which they dart into his neck, 1131122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 irmnediately behind the horns. The horse is often killed by the bull When the animal chances to prefur running from the fight to engaging :in it, he il killed by the horseman, by being thrown heels over head. This il accomplished by catching hold of the tail of the bull :in the full speed of pursuit, and giving a tum around the head of the saddle, :in such a marmer, that they are enabled to throw the animal into any posture they choose. After we returned to the furt, it took us some time to relate what we had seen, to the consul Feeling it necessary to do something towards supporting myse~ during the remaining time of my stay in thE part of the country, I took my rifle, and joined a Portuguese in the attempt to kill otters along the coast. We hunted up and down the coast, a distance offurty miles, killing sixteen otters in ten days. We sold their skins, some as high as seventy-five dollars, and none under twenty-five. Tlrree hundred dollars full to my share from the avails of our trip. Captain Cooper was exceedingly desirous to purchase my rifle, now that I should not be likely to make use of it, as I was soon to proceed on my journey to the city of Mexico. I presented it to him, :lbr I could not 1hink of bartering :lbr money, what I regarded, as a tried :friend, that had aftbrded me the means ofsubsiltence and protection fur so long a time. My [23 7] conscience would have reproached me, as though I had been guilty of an act of ingratitude. The period of my departure from this coast was now close at hand, and my thoughts naturally took a retrospect of the whole time, I bad spent upon it. The misery and su:ffuring of various kinds, that I had endured in some portions of it, had not been able to prevent me from fueling, and acknowledging, that this country is more calculated to charm the eye, than any one I have ever seen Those, who traverse it, if they have any capability whatever of perceiving, and admiring the beautiful and sublime in scenery, must be constantly excited to wonder and praise. It is no less remarkable fur uniting the advantages of hea.1tb:fulness, a good soil, a temperate climate, and yet one of exceeding miJdness, a happy mixture of level and elevated grolllld, and vicinity to the sea. Its inhabitants are equally calcu1ated to excite dislike, and even the stronger fuelings of disgust and hatred. The priests are omnipotent, and aD things are subject to their power. Two thirds of the population are native Indians under the immediate charge of these spiritual rulers in the numerous missions. It ~ a well known fuct, that nothing is more entirely opposite to the nature of a savage, than labor. In order to keep them at their daily tasks, the most rigid and ume:mitting supervision :is exercised. No bondage can be more complete, than that under which they live. The compulsion laid upon them has, however, led them at times to rebe~ and endeavor to escape :from their yoke. 'They have seized upon a.rms, murdered the priests, and destroyed the buildings of the missions, by pre-concerted stratagem, in several instances. When their work of destruction and retnbution was accomplished, they fled to the mountains, and subsisted on the flesh of wild horses which are there fuund :in innumerable droves. To prevent the recurrence of similar events, the priests have passed laws, prohibiting an Indian the use or possession of any weapon whatever, under the penalty oi a severe punishment. On the 25th I addressed the companions of my furmer joumeyings and imprisonment in San Diego by letter. They had [238] remained in the town of Angels, during the months which had elapsed since my separation from them, after our receiving liberty upon parole. I bad kept up a constant correspondence with them in this interval My objects at present were to :infurm them of my proposed departure fur my native country, and request them, if they should be called upon so to do, to state every thing relative to our irnprisonmmt and loss of property, exactly as it took place. I closed, by telling them, 1hey might expect a letter from me upon my arrival in the city ofMexico. On the 8th ofMay I applied for my passport, which was readily given me, and taking leave of the General and my friends, I entered the vesse~ in which I was to proceed to San Bias, at 8 o'c1ock in the morning. The sails of the brig, which was called the Vohmteer, were soon set, and speeding us upon our way. 'The green water turned white, as it met the advance of our prow, and behind us we ]eft a smooth belt of water, affurding a singu]ar contrast to the waves around. I watched the disappearance of this single smooth spot, as it was lost in the surrounding billows, 1141122 5119/13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 when the :influence the move:rrent of our vessel ceased, as a spectac:Je to be contemplated by a Jand's man with interest. But no reeling of gratification operated in the minds of the poor pmoners in the hold. They were ironed separately, and then an fustened to a long bar of iron. They were soon heard mingling prayers and groans, interrupted only by the violent vomiting produced by sea sickness. In addition to this misery, when rear finmd entrance :into their thoughts during the :inte:rvak of fue cessation of extreme sickness, it seemed to them, as if every surge the vessel made must be its last. In this miserable condition they remained, until the 19th, when we arrived at SanBlas. The prisoners here were delivered into the charge ofthe commanding officer of the place. Captain Hinkley, his mate, Henry Vina~ and myself diserrbarked at this place, in order to collm'mce our journey over land to Mexico. The necessary arrangements fur our undertalcing occupied us three days. We fuund the season warm on our arrival here. Watermelons were abundant, and also green [239] com, and a great variety of ripe fruit Two crops of com and wheat are raised in the year. A precipice was shown me, over which, I was told, the Mexicans threw three old priests at the comrrencement of the revoh against the king of Spain.-'I'hli port is the centre of considerable business in fue seasons of spring and :lhl1 During the summer, the inhabitants are compelled to :leave it, as the air becomes infected by the exhalations, arising from the surrounding swamps. Myriads of musquitos and other small insects fill fue air at the same time, uniting with the furmer cause to render the place uninhabitable. Great quantities of sah are rmde upon the flats in the vicinity of San BJas. I did not infurm myself accurately, with regard to the manner, in which it is rmde; but as I was passing by one day, where the preparation of it was carried on, I observed what struck :rre as being both curious and novel The earth was laid off in square beds. Around their edges dirt was heaped up, as though the bed, which I have :rrentioned, was :intended to be covered with water. We began our journey well armed, as we had been infurmed that we should, in all probability, find abundant occasion to use our anns, as we advanced. Our progress was slow, as we confOrmed to the directions given us, and kept a constant look out fur robbers, of whom there are said to be thousands upon this route. On the 25th we reached a small town called Tip~ where we remained one day to rest from our futigue, and then set off again fur Guadalaxara, distant eight days' journey. Our path led us through a beautiful country, a great portion of which was mder cultivation. Occasionally we passed through small villages. Beggars were to be seen standing at the comers of all the streets, and along the highways. They take a station by the road side, having a dog or chiki by them, to lead fuem into fue road when 1hey see a traveller approaching. They stand until the person reaches the spot upon which they are, when they ask ahns fur the sake of a saint, whose image is worn suspended armmd their neck, or tied armmd the wmt [240] 'This circumstance of begging for the saint, and not fur themselves, struck me as a new expedient in the art ofbegging. At first we gave a trifle to the poor saint. As we went on we fuund 1hem so nutrerous that it became necessary fur us to husband om alms, and we finally came to 1he conclusion that the large brotherhood ofbeggars could occasionally diversifY their mode oflifu by a dexterous management of their fingers, and shut our purses to the demands of the saints. The country fur so1:1:1e time befure we drew near Guadalaxara, was rather barren, although its immediate vicinity is delightful We reached that city on the 2d of June, and spent three days in it. It is situated upon a fine plain, which is overspread by the same numbers of do:rnestic anitmls that I had seen in New Mexico and Califurnia. The city is walled in, with gates at the dif:furent entrances. These gates are strongly guarded, and no one is allowed to enter them until they have been searched, in order to ascertain if they carry any srrruggled goods about them The same precaution :is used when any one passes out of the city. A passport must be shown fur the person, his horse, and arms, and a statement from the principal peace officer, of the mnnber of trunks with which he set out upon his 1151122 5/19113 Pattie's Personal Narrali~A:~, 1824--1830 journey, and their contents. This caution is to prevent smuggling; but it does not effuct the purpose, as there is more contraband trade here, than in any place I was ever in befure. I was not able to ascertain the number of :inhabitants of this city. The silver mines of Guanaxuato are near GuadaJaxara. They are carried on at present by an English company. The evening befure our departure we went to the theatre. The actresses appeared ymmg and beautiful, and danced and SmJ.g charmingly. The 5th day of June we res~d our jomney to the city of Mexico. Again we trave1led 1hrough a channing country, tolerably thickly settled. On our way we ten in company with an officer belonging to the service of the country. He had ten soldiers with him Upon his demanding to see our passports we showed them to him, though he had no authority to make [241] such a deJ.mnd. After he had finished their perusal he returned them with such an indiflerent air, that I could not resist an inclination to ask him some questions that might perhaps have seemed rude. I first asked him what post he fi1led in the army? He answered, with great civility, be was first lieutenant I then requested to know, to what part of the country be was travelling? He said, still in a very civil manner, that he had had the comnand of some troops :in Guanaxuato, but was now on his way to the city of Mexico, to take charge of the 6th regim:mt:, which was ordered to the province of Texas, to find out among the Americans there, those who had refused obedience to the Mexican laws. He added, that when be succeeded in finding them, be would soon learn them to behave we11 The Jast rermrk was made in rather a contemptuous tone of voice, and with something like an implied insult to me. This warmed my blood, and I replied :in a tone not so gentle as prudence might have counse1led a stranger in a fureign land to have adopted, that if himself and his men did not conduct themselves properly when they were among the Americans, the Jatter would soon despatch them to another comtry, which they had not yet seen; as the Americans were not Mexicans, to stand at the comer of a house, and bide their guns behind the side of it, while they looked another way, and pulled the trigger. At 1flli;; he flew into a passion. I did not try to irritate him any further, and he rode on and left us. We pursued our way slowly, and stopped fur the night at Aguabuena, a small town on the way. We put up at a house, a sort of posada, built fur 1odging travellers.- Twenty-five cents is the price fur the use of a room fur one night It is seldom that any person is round about such an establishment to take charge of it but an old key bearer. Provisions must be sought elsewhere. It is not often necessary to go :finiher than the street, where, at any hour :in the day until ten o'clock at night, men and women are engaged in crying d.ifrerent kinds of eatables. We generally purchased our rood of them After we had finished our supper two English gentlemen entered, who were on their way to the city of Mexico. [242] We concluded to travel together, as our point of destination was the same, and we should be more able to resist any adversaries we might encounter; this cmmtry being, as I have befure mentioned, mrested with robbers and thieves, although we had not yet fu.llen in with any. These gentlemen infurmed us that the greatest catholic festival of the whole year was close at hand. If we could reach the city of Mexico befure :its celebration, we should see something that would repay us for hastening our journey. As we were desirous to lose the sight of nothing curious, we proceeded as fust as circurmtances would permit, and reached the city on the 1Oth, ]ate in the evening, and put up at an inn kept by an Englishman, although, as in the other towns :in which we had been, we were obliged to seek fuod elsewhere, the only accommodation at the inn being beds to sleep in, and liquors to drink. we round supper in a co free house. We were awakened early in the morning by the ringing ofbells. As we stepped into the street we met three biers carried by some men guarded by sokliers. Blood was dropping from each bier. The bearers begged money to pay the expenses of burying the bodies. I afterwards learned that these persons were murdered on the night of our arriva~ upon the Alameda, a promenade north of the city, in one of the suburbs. We visited this p1ace, and round it covered with thousands of people, some wa1king, and others sitting on the seats pJaced around this public pleasure grmmd. Small parties are sheltered from view by thickets of a growth, like that in our country, used fur hedges.

These partially concea:Jed parties are usually composed of men and women of the lowest orders, engaged in card playing. Such are to be seen at any hour of the day, occupied in a way which is most likely to terminate the rreeting in an affray, and perhaps murder. Blood is frequently shed, and I judged from what I saw of the order of things, that the accounts of the numerous assassinations committed rumng this populace, were not exaggerated. One of the characteristics of this peop:Je [243] is jealousy. Notwithstanding the danger really to be apprehended from visiting t:1:m; p1ace after certain hours, my two companions and myself spent several evenings in it without being molested in the slightest degree. But one evening as we were returning to our lodgings, we were compelled to kneel with our white pantaloons upon the dirty street, while the host was passing. We took care afterwards to step into a house in tirrle to avoid the troublesome necessity. We attended a bull baiting, and some other exhibitions fur the amusement of the people. Being one evening at the theatre, I had the :misfurtune to lose my watch from my pocket, without being aware when it was taken. It would have been useless for me to have thought of looking around for it, as I stood in the midst of such a crowd that it was almost an impossibility to move. The accounts of t:1m city which I bad met with in books led me to expect to find it p:laced in the midst of a lake, or surromded by a sheet of water. To sa\"IE:fY myself with regard to the truth of this representation, I mounted a horse, and made the circuit of the city, visiting sorne villages that Jay within a league of it. I fowd no lake; but the land is low and flat A canal is cut through it, for the pw:pose of carrying off the water that descends from 1he mountains upon the level surface, which bas the appearance of having been formerly covered with water. A mountain which is visible from the city, presents a circular summit, one part of which is covered with snow throughout the year: upon the other is the crater of a volcano, which is continually sending up proof of the existence of an mceasing fire within. Early upon the first day of my arrival in this city, I waited upon Mr. Butler, the American charge d'affilirs. After I had made myself known to him he showed me a communication from President Jackson to the President of t:1m comtry, the purport of which was, to request the latter to set at liberty some Americans, imprisoned upon the coast ofCalifbrnia. I then banded him the statement I had made according to the advice [244] ofMr. Jones. He asked :me many questions relative to the losses I bad sustained, which I answered, and then took my leave. A number of coaches were to leave the city for Vera Cruz on the 18th of June. My companions and myself took places in one of them On the 15th I again called upon Mr. Butler to obtain a passport to Vera Cruz, where I intended to embark for America. He took rne to the palace of the President, in order that I might get my passport. This circUl:'l:6tance was agreeable to me, as I was desirous to see this persol\\ of whom I bad heard so much. Upon arriving at the palace I round it a splendid building, although much shattered by the balls discharged at it by the furmer President Guerero, who is now flying from one place to another with a rew followers, spreading des1ruction to the extent ofhis power. A soldier led me into the presence of the President. He was walking to and fro when I entered the room, apparently in deep meditation Several c1erks were present, engaged in writing. He received :rne politely, bowing as I advanced, and bade :rne sit down In answer to his inquiry what I wished of him? I told my errand. He then asked :me from what direction I came? I replied, from Califbmia. Califumia! said he, repeating the word with an air of interest. I answered again, that I left that part of the country when I began my present journey. You :n:rust have been there then, rejoined he, when the late revolution took place, ofwhich I have but a short ti.me since received information I remarked, that I was upon the spot where it occurred, and that I took my departure :from the coast in the same vessel that brought sixteen of the captives taken in the course of its progress, and that I disembarked at St. Bias at the same time that they were taken from the vessel He resumed the conversation by saying, you were probably one of the Americans who, I am told, assisted in subduing the revoked party. I told him, 117/122 5119/13 Pattie's Personal Narrali~.e, 1824--1830 he was correct in his opinion; and by so doing I had had the good furtl.:lne to gain my liberty. His countenance expressed surprise at the conclusion of my remark; and he proceeded [245] to ask me~ what meaning I had, in saying that I had thus regained my own liberty? I then related my story; upon which he said he bad understood that General Echedio had acted contrary to the Jaws, in several instances, and that, in consequence, he had ordered him to Mexico to answer fur his conduct. I was surprised at the condescension of the President in thus expressing to me any part of his intentions with regard to such a person. I accounted fur it by supposing that he wished to have it generally understood, that he did not approve of the UQjust and cruel treatment which the Americans bad received. The president appeared to me to be a man of plain and gentlemanJy manners, possessing great talent. In this I express no more than my individual opinion; to which I must add that I do not consider myself competent to judge of such points, only fur myself He gave me a passport, and I returned to Mr. Butler's office, who infurmed me that he wished me to take a very fine horse to Vera C~ fur the ~an consul at that place. He said that I would find it pleasant to vary my mode of travelling, by occasionally rid1ng the horse. I readily consented to his wish, requesting him to have the horse taken to the place from which the coach would set off; early in the morning, when I would take charge of it. I now took leave ofMr. Butler and proceeded to my lodgings. I fuund both my companions busily engaged in packing, and arranging fur departure. I :immediately entered upon the same employrrent. I had two trunks; one I filled with such articles as I should require upon my journey; and in another I pJaced such as I should not be likely to use, and a great many curiosities which I had collected during my long wanderings. The Jatter trunk I did not calculate to open until I reached my native land. At 8 o'clock on the morning of the 16th our coach left the city, in company with two others. We were eight in munber, including the coachman. Three of the party were Jadies. One was a Frenchwoman, a married Jady travelling without her husband. Another was a Spanishwoman, who bad married [246] a wealthy Irishman, and was accompanied by her husband. The third was the wife of a Mexican officer, a1so one of the eight This gentleman was an inveterate enemy of the disp1aced President General Guerero. We journeyed on very amicably together, without meeting with the sligbtest disturbance, until the second day, when, about three o'clock in the afternoon, we were met by a company of fifty men, all well mounted and armed. At first sight of them we had supposed them to be a party which bad been sent from the city in search of some highwayrren who had committed murder and robbery upon the road on which we were travelling, a rew days previous to our departure. A rew minutes served to show us our mistake.- They surrmmded the coaches, commandlng the drivers to halt, and announcing themselves as followers of General Guerero. They demanded money, of which they stated that they were in great need. The tone of this demand was, however, humble, such as beggars would use. While they addressed us :in this manner, they contrived to pJace thexmelves among and armmd the persons of our party in such a way as to obtain entire command of us. The instant they had completed this purpose, they presented their spears and muskets, and demanded our anns. We resigned them without o:flering an objection, as we saw clearly, that opposition woukl be unavailing. They now proceeded to take from us what they thought proper. I was allowed to retain my tnmk of clothing fur my journey. The Mexican officer was sitting by his wire in the coach. Some of the sokiiers seized him, and dragged him from his ahmst distracted wife out of the carriage. His fute was summarily decided, and he was hung upon a tree. When this dreadful business was terminated, we were ordered to drive on We gladly hastened :from such a scene ofhorror. But the agony of the unfOrtunate wife was an impressive memorial to remind us of the nature of the late occurrence, bad we needed any other than our own remembrances. We left this afflicted lady at Xalapa, in the care of her relations. A great quantity of jalap, which is so much used in medicine, is obtained from this place. [24 7] After leaving Xalapa, we advanced tlrrough a beautiful comtry. We passed many small towns on this part of our route. Our course had been a continued descent, after crossing the mountain sixteen miles from the city of Mexico. The user.lfYlission.com'-druc:l)lrnlrnanlhlml/pattia/patlie.lllrnl 118/122 5/1!ll13 Pattie's Personal Narratiw, 1824--1830 road is excellent, being paved fur the most part. It is cut through points of mountains :in several places. This work must have been attended with :itmnense labor and expense. We reached Vera Cruz on the 24th. On the 27th Captain Hinkley and his mate embarked fur New York. I remained with the consul Mr. Stone, until the 18th ofJu]y. A vessel being in readiness to sail fur New Orleans at this time, I was desirous to avail myself of the opportunity to return to the United States. Mr. Stone and some others presented me money sufficient to pay my passage to the point to which the vessel was bound. It was very painful to me to incur this debt of gratitude, as I could not even venture to hope that it would be in my power to repay it, either in money or benefits of any kind. The prospect, which the future o:trered me, was dark. It seemed as if misfOrtune had set her seal upon a1l that concerned my destiny. I accepted this oifuring of kindness and benevolence with thanks direct from my heart, and went on board the vessel It would be idle fur me to attempt to descnbe the feelings that swelled my heart, as the sails filled to bear me from the shores of a country, where I had seen and suffured so nmch. My dreams of success in those points considered most D:nportant by my fellow men, were vanished furever. After an my endurance of toil, hunger, thirst and imprisonment, after encountering the fiercest wild beasts in their deserts, and fiercer men, after tracing streams befure unmeasured and unvisited by any of my own race to their source, over rugged and pathless mountains, subject to every species of danger, want and misery fur seven years, it seemed hard to be indebted to charity, however kind and considerate it might be, fur the means of returning to my native Jand. [248] AB we sped on our way, I turned to look at the land I was leaving, and endeavored to withdraw my thoughts from the painful train into which they had :fu.llen Vera Cruz is the best furtified port I have ever seen The town is walled in, and wen guarded on every side with heavy cannon. The part of the wan extending along the water's edge, is surmounted by guns pointing so as completely to command the shipping in the harbour. A reef of rocks arises at the distance of half a mile from the shore opposite the city, and continues visible fur several miles in a south direction, joining the main land seven or eight miles southwest ofVera Cruz. A furt stands upon that part of the reef which fronts the town. Ships :in leaving or entering the harbour are obliged to pass between the furt and the town. We reached New Orleans on the first of August, although the wind had not been entirely :fu.vorable. It blew a still bree:ze from a direction which compelled us to run within :five points and a half of the wind. As I approached 1he spot where my fuot would again press its native soil, my imagination transported rre over the long course of river which yet lay between me, and an I had left in 1he world to love. I cannot express the delight which thrilled and softened my heart, as I funded myself entering my horre; fur it was the home I had known and loved when my mother lived, and we were happy that rose to my view. Fancy could not present another to me. There were my brothers and sisters, as I had been used to see them The pleasant shade of the trees lay upon the turfbefure the door of om dwelling. The paths armmd were the same, over which I had so often bounded with the elastic step of cbi.ldhood, ef!joying a happy existence. Years and change have no place in such meditations. We landed, and I stood upon the shore. I was aroused by the approach of an Englishman, one of my fullow passengers, to a sense of my real position. He asked me ifl had taken a passage in a steamboat fur Louisville? I imtn::diately answered in the negative. He \"then said he had bespoken one in the Cora; and as I had [249] not chosen any other, he would be glad if I would go on in the sarre one with him, and thus continue our companionship as long as possible. So saying he took me by the arm to lead me in the direction of the boat of which he spoke, that we might choose our births. AB we advanced together, it occurred to me to ask the price of a passage to Louisville? I was answered, furty dollars. Upon hearing this I stopped, and told my companion I could not take a birth just then, at the same time putting my hand in my pocket to ascertain if the state of my funds would permit me to do so at all. The Englishman seeing my embarrassment, and coJ1jecturing rightly its origin, instantly remarked, that the passage money was not to 11!ll122 5119/13 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824--1830 be paid until the boat arrived at Louiwille. I was ashalred to own my poverty, and invented an excuse to hide it, telling him, that I had an engagement at that time, but would wa1k: with him :in the evening to see about the passage. He :left me in consequence. I then discovered, that so fur from being abJe to take a cabin passage I had not money enough to pay fur one on the deck. I re-entered the vessel in which I had arrived. As I approached tbe captain I saw him point me out to a person conversing with him, and heard him say, 'there is the young man I have been mentioning to you He speaks Spanish, and will probably engage with you' When I was near enough he introduced me to the stranger, whom he called Captain Vion. The latter addressed a rew remarks to me, and then requested me to accompany him into his vessel I consented and fullowed him on board. He then told me, that he wished to engage a person to accompany him to Vera Cruz, and aid in disposing of his vessel and cargo; and asked if I was inc :lined to go with him fur such a purpose? I said, in reply, that :it would depend entirely upon the recompense he offured fur the services to be perfOrmed. He remarked, that he would give a certain per cent upon the brig and cargo, in case it was sold. I partly agreed to his proposa~ but told him that I could not decide finally upon it until I had considered the matter. He then requested [250] me to come to him the next day at 12 o'clock, when I would find him at dinner. I left him, after promising to do so, and wandered about looking at the city until evening, when I met the EngHshman from whom I had parted in the morning. He said he would now accompany me to the steam boat, that we might choose our births according to our engagement. I had no longer any excuse to offur, and was compelled to acknowledge that the contents of my purse were not sufficient to justi:JY me in contracting a debt of furty dollars. I added, that I had an idea of returning to Vera Cruz He replied, that in regard to the passage mmey I need have no uneasiness, nor hesitate to go on board, as he would defray my expenses as fur as I chose to go. In respect to my plan of returning to Vera Cruz, he said that it would be exceedingly unwise fur me to carry :it into execution; as the yellow rever would be raging by the time I reached the city, and that it was most likely I should full a victim to it I had, however, determined in my own mind that I would nm. the risk, rather than ask or receive aid from a person to whom I was comparatively unknown, and accordingly I refused his kindly pro:ffured assistance, telling him at the same tirre, that I relt as grateful to him as though I had accepted his offered kindness, and that I would have availed myself of his benevolent :intentions towards me, had he been a resident of my country; but as I knew him to be a traveller in a furejgn Jand, who might need all his funds, he must excuse l.'m. He then asked me if I had no acquaintance in New Orleans, of whom I could obtain the money as a loan? I replied, that I did not know an individual in the city; but if I carried my plan of returning to Vera Cruz into execution, I should probably be enabled to proceed to my friends without depending on any one. Upon~ we separated, and each went to his lodging. At ten the succeeding Imming my English friend carne to my boarding house, accompanied by Judge Johnston, who accosted me with a mamer of paternal kindness, enquiring of me bow long I had been absent from my country and relations? [151] I naturally enquired in tm11, if he was in any way acquainted with them? He replied, that he was; and advised me to ascend the river, and visit them I expressed to him how pleasant it would be to me to visit them, but assured him that it was out of my power to enjoy that pleasure at present. He enquired why? I avoided a direct answer, and remarked, that I proposed returning to Vera Cruz. He not only urged strong objections to this, but offered to pay my passage up the river. It may be easily imagined how I re1t in view of such an offer from this generous and respectable stranger. I thankfully accepted it, only assuring him that I should repay him as soon as it was in my power. He replied that it was a matter of no consequence. He advised me to go on board the steam boat and choose my birth, alleging, that he had business in the city which would not allow him to accompany me on board. 120/122 5119113 Pattie's Personal Narrative, 1824--1830 My English friend seemed highly gratified by this good furtune of mine, and went with me on board the steam boat, where I chose a birth. 'The name ofthis gentleman was Perry, and he was one of the two whom I have already mentioned, who bad travelled in company with me from the city ofGuadalaxara to Mexico. On the fourth, at nine :in the morning, the starting bell nmg on the steam boat, and Judge Johnston, Mr. Perry and myself went on board. This was the first steam boat on which I bad ever been Scarcely was the interior of the first slrip I was ever on board at San Diego, a spectacle of more exciting interest. How much more delighted was I to see her stem the migbty current of the MEsissippi As I remarked the plantations, bends and fOrests sinking in the distance behind me, I relt that I was rapidly nearing home; and at every advance my amciety to see my relations once more, increased. To the many enquiries, made by Judge Jol:mston, touching the interior of the continent where I bad been wandering, I am sure I must have given very lmSatisfuctory answers, much as I wished to oblige him My thoughts dwelt with such constant and :intense solicitude upon horne, that I relt myself unable to frame answers to questions upon any other subjects. [252] Horne did I say? I have none. My father and mJther sleep -widely separated from each other. They left nine orphans without resources to breast this stormy and mutable world. I, who ought to supply the place of a parent to them, shall carry to them nothing but poverty, and the withering remembrances of an tmbappy wanderer, upon whom misfOrtune seems to have stamped her :inexorable seal I parted with Judge Jol:mston at Cincinnati, who gave rne a line of introduction to Mr. Flint, fur which I relt under renewed obligations to him, hoping it would be of service to rne. I left Cincinnati; and on the 30th of August arrived at the end of my jomney. I have bad too much of real incident and afiliction to be a dealer in romance; and yet I should do irgustice to my :feelings, if I closed this journal without a record of my sensations on reaching home. I have still befOre rne, mchanged by aD, that I have seen, and su:ffirred, the pictrrre of the abode of my infimt days and juvenile rernembrances. But the present reality is all as rrruch changed, as my heart. I rneet my neighbors, and schoo1 fullows, as I approach the home of my grandfuther.- They neither recognize me, nor I them. I look for the deep grove, so fuithfu11y remaining in my memJry, and the stream that mur.m.rred through it The woods are levelled by the axe. The stream, no longer protected by the deep shade, bas almost run dry. A storm bas swept away the noble trees, that had been spared fur shade. The :fruit trees are decayed. I was first met by my grandtoother. She is tottering l.Ulder the burden and decline of old age, and the sight of me only recalls the painful rernembrance of my father, worn out by the torture of his oppressors, and buried in the distant land of strangers and enemies. I couJd hardly have remembered my grandfather, the once vigorous and undamted hunter. With a :feeble and tremulous voice, he repeats enquiry upon enquiry, touching the fute of my :lather? I look round fur the dear band ofbrothers and sisters. But one of the numerous group remains, and he too young to know me; though I see enough to remind me, how much he has stood in need of an efficient protector.- I hastily enquire fur the rest. One is here, and another is there, and my head is confused, in listening to the names oi the places of their residence. I left one sister, a child. She is married to a person I never knew; one, who, from the laws of our nahrre, can only regard :me: with the eye of a stranger. We call each other brother, but the affuctionate word will not act as a key, to lUllock the fOuntains of fraternal fueling. They, however, kindly invite me to their home. I am impelled alike by poverty and affuction, to remain with them fur a time, till I can forget what has been, and weave a new web of hopes, and furm a new series of plans fur sorne pursuit in li:re. Alas! disappo:i:ntments, such as I have encountered, are not the motives to impart vigor and :firrmess fur new projects. The freshness, the visions, the hopes of my youthful days are all vanished, and can never return. If any one of my years bas relt, that the fashion of this world passeth away , and that all below the sun is vanity, it is I. If there is a lesson from my wanderings, it is one, that inculcates upon cbildren, remaining at the paternal home 1211122 5119/13 Pattie's Personal Narrati11e, 1824--1830 in peace and privacy; one that counsels the young against wandering fur away, to see the habitations, and endure the inhospitality of strangers.
