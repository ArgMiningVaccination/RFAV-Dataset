Micewere injected with several larkspur toxin-protein con-jugates or adjuvant alone to determine whether theresulting immunological response altered animal sus-ceptibility to methyllycaconitine, the major toxic lark-spur alkaloid. Although vaccinations increased the lethal dose for intravenous methyl- lycaconitine toxicity, overlapping condence intervalsdid not provide evidence of differences between the vac-cinated and control groups. In the lycoctonine conjugate(LYC)-vaccinated group, mouse survival was related ( P Key Words: Delphinium, Lethal Dose, Mice, Toxicity, Vaccination 2003 American Society of Animal Science.

Sci. 2003. 81:232-238 Introduction Many larkspurs ( Delphinium spp.) found on the rangelands of the western United States are poisonousto livestock, and annual losses attributed to larkspurpoisoning are valued in millions of dollars (Williamsand Cronin, 1966; et al., 1988). that are toxic tomammals (Pelletier and Keith, 1970; Manners et al.,1992; 1993). These compounds act as potent neuromus-cular blocking agents that block acetylcholine receptorsin the muscle and brain resulting in muscle weakness,paralysis, respiratory failure, and death (Benn and Jennings, 1994; Dobelis et al.,1999). 1The protocol for animal use in this research was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IA-CUC), Utah State University, Logan.

When mice with lowantibody titers were removed from the vaccinatedgroups in which titer was related to survival, the recal-culated LD 50estimates were 20% greater than the LD 50 of the control group. However, the 95% condence inter-vals of the recalculated LD 50groups overlapped with the control groups. Overall, these results suggest thatvaccination altered methyllycaconitine toxicity in miceand that vaccination may be useful in decreasing theeffects of larkspur toxins in animals. Additional studiesare warranted to continue development of potentiallarkspur vaccines for livestock. In general, the alkaloids possessing a N-(methylsuc- cinimido) anthranilic ester methyllycaconitine, are themost toxic of the larkspur The chemical struc-tures of methyllycaconitine and related larkspur LD 50of 4.8 mg/kg in mice (Panter et al., 2002), is the most prevalent of the highly toxic MSALalkaloids in tall larkspurs of the western United States(Manners et al., 1995). Thus, the relatively high toxicityand prevalence of methyllycaconitine in tall larkspursmakes it the prime target for vaccination studies toalleviate larkspur toxicity. Previously, we reported the chemical synthesis of ly- coctonine, 14-deacetylnudicauline, and methyllycaconi-tine protein immunoconjugates (Lee et al., 2000). Thesealkaloid-protein immunoconjugates were injected intosheep and antibodies raised to the immunoconjugates.Antisera of sheep were obtained from blood samplesand were found to bind the MSAL-type larkspur toxinsin vitro. Using these antisera, sensitive ELISA weredeveloped for the measurement of larkspur alkaloidsin biological samples (Lee et al., 2000). This paper reports the use of lycoctonine, 14-deacetyl- nudicauline, and methyllycaconitine protein immuno-conjugates as vaccines against in mice.

The effectiveness of the different in elevating the LD 50of methyllycaconitine Freund's complete sorbitanmonolaurate (Tween Reagent-grade BSA Mesa, CA). The methyllycaconitine used for dos-ing the mice was extracted from Delphinium barbeyi plant material using methods previously described(Gardner et al., 2000). The extracted methyllycaconi-tine was determined to be 76% pure when analyzed byflow-injection electrospray ionization mass spectrome-try against methyllycaconitine standard wereacquired on a Finnigan LCQ Mass Spectrometer (Finni-gan Corp., San Jose, CA). Samples were loop-injectedinto the electrospray source using a 50:50 methanol:1% acetic acid solution at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Thegreatest impurity detected in the extracted methyllyca-conitine had a mass of 465, which is consistent withthe alkaloids 14-dehydrobrowniine and deltamine, andwas present at approximately 4%. and deltamine have both been found in D. barbeyi plant material, and previously reported LD 50estimates are one and two orders of magnitude greater than meth-yllycaconitine, respectively (Manners et al., 1993). Thesame lot of extracted methyllycaconitine was used ex-clusively in both vaccination trials. The extracted meth-yllycaconitine was dissolved in buffered physiologicalsaline using previously established protocols (Mannerset al., 1993). was ster-ile ltered through \u00b5m syringe stored in vials at 4 \u00b0C for toxicity testing. Meth- yllycaconitine solutions prepared in this manner andstored at 4 \u00b0C are stable for >6 mo after preparation (Panter, unpublished data).

All alkaloid-protein conjugates were di- luted to a concentration of approximately 1 mg/mL indeionized distilled water and stored ( 120\u00b0C) as 1-mL aliquots until use. The primary immunogen injection solution was pre- pared by adding an aqueous hapten-fetuin conjugatesolution (1 mg/mL, 2.25 mL) to sterile saline (2.25 mL).This solution was in turn emulsied with completeFreund's adjuvant (4.5 mL) yielding a total volume of9 mL. Booster injection solutions were prepared in thesame manner as the primary injection solution withincomplete Freund's adjuvant used in place of completeFreund's adjuvant. The control primary injection solu-tion and control booster solution consisted of equalparts sterile saline solution emulsied with completeFreund's Titer/Competitive Binding Assays were dissolved in carbonatebuffer (250 ng/100 \u00b5L, 0.05 M, pH 9.6) and 100 \u00b5L added to each well of a microtiter plate. Microtiter plates wereincubated (2 h, room temperature [ RT] and then 16 h, 4\u00b0C), inverted to remove excess coating solution, cov- ered with an adhesive plate sealer, and stored in aplastic bag ( 20\u00b0C; up to 6 mo). The plates were washed (3\u00d7) with saline-Tween buffer (0.15 MNaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) and blotted dry. Blocking buffer (150 \u00b5L; 0.1 MTris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% skim milk powder) was added, and then the plates were incubated (1 h,RT). The plates were then washed (3 \u00d7) and blotted dry. For the competitive binding assay, free methyllyca- conitine (50 ng) diluted in the blocking buffer (50 \u00b5L) was added to the wells in triplicate followed by 50 \u00b5L of antiserum diluted (1:30,000 and 1:60,000 for the miceinjected with the MLA and DAN immunoconjugates,respectively) in the blocking buffer. For titer measure-ments, made in the absence of free toxin, the serumwas diluted serially (1:1000 to 1:512,000) in blockingbuffer serial dilutions and added to the wells in singlet.The plates were incubated (2 h, RT), washed (4 \u00d7), HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (100 \u00b5L) diluted 1/10,000 in blocking buffer was added to all wells. Theplates were incubated (1 h, RT), washed (4 \u00d7), and 100 \u00b5L of tetramethylbenzidine/H 2O2substrate (pH 5.5; 30\u00b0C; Bos et al., 1981) was added to each well. After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50\u00b5Lo f0 . 5 MH 2SO4to each well and the UV absorbances were measured at 450 nm with a BIO-RAD model 3550-UV microplate reader (Bio Rad Laboratories, Her-cules, CA).

Booster injections (0.2 mL) with the same dose of hap-ten-fetuin conjugate in incomplete Freund's adjuvantwere given at 3-wk intervals. Control mice were ini-tially injected s.c. with control primary injection solu-tion. At the same time, the treated mice received boosterinjections the control mice were given control boosterinjections (0.2 mL). In Trial 1, two groups of 45 mice each were vaccinated with either MLA or DAN conjugate and received onebooster. A third group of 45 mice was treated with con-trol vaccines. Ten days after the single booster, 10 micefrom each group were killed and their sera collected todetermine whether the mice had developed titers tothe conjugates and to determine whether the antiserabound free methyllycaconitine in vitro before dosing themice with methyllycaconitine. Sixteen days after thebooster and a 12-h fast, vaccinated and control micewere weighed, separated into treatment groups of 35mice each, and dosed with i.v. injections of methyllyca-conitine. Methyllycaconitine injections were performedvia the tail vein in mice restrained in a plastic mouseblock. The mice were maintained under a heat lampfor 15 min to dilate the tail vein. The tail vein wascleaned with 70% ethanol and i.v. injections were ac-complished with a tuberculin syringe equipped witha 1.27-cm-long 27-gauge needle. The volume injectedvaried depending on the dosage delivered. Methyllyca-conitine-induced death occurred in <5 min after injec- tion. Time of injection, clinical effects, and time of deathwere noted and recorded. In Trial 2, three groups of 100 mice each were vacci- nated with MLA, DAN, or LYC conjugates. A fourthgroup with 30 mice was treated with control vaccines.Ten days after the second booster and a 12-h fast, vacci- nated and control mice were weighed, separated intotreatment groups, and dosed with i.v. injections ofmethyllycaconitine using the procedure described inTrial 1. Time of injection, clinical effects, and time ofdeath were noted and recorded. In this trial, mice thatdid not die within 5 min after injection were euthanizedwith carbon dioxide. Blood was drawn via heart punc-ture immediately after methyllycaconitine-induceddeath or euthanasia, sera were obtained, and titerswere determined. Statistics and Calculations Titer values were determined by the method of Ra- ghava et al. (2001). The titer value in this study isdened as the sera dilution at which the optical densityat 450 nm was 0.5. Serum from one mouse in each ofthe three groups was chosen as a standard. The stan-dard sera titer curve was run on the same plate as titercurves from all of the other sera collected for the micewithin the same group. All titer curves within eachgroup were then normalized with respect to the stan- dard titer curve. A mouse was determined to have atiter if the absorbance at a sera dilution than the of the by three times the absorbance of the at the same sera competitivebinding assay was positive when the absorbance read-ings were less than the blank by three times the stan-dard deviation of the blank. The LD 50for methyllycaconitine toxicity in each vac- cination group was determined by a modied up-and-down method (Bruce, 1985) and was calculated usingthe PROC PROBIT procedures of SAS (SAS Inst., Inc.,Cary, NC) on a logistic distribution of the survival data.Condence (ducial) intervals (95%) were also calcu-lated using the same program. In Trial 2, the probability of survival within each vaccination group was compared using titer and dose ina logistic regression model. We used the PROC PROBITprocedure with logistic distribution of SAS (SAS Inst.,Inc.) to t these models. Dose, titer, and their interac-tion were factors used in the model. Binary data (i.e.,lived or died) were not transformed prior to analysisin SAS. Results Trial 1 All 10 mice in the MLA- and DAN-vaccinated groups killed previous to dosing with methyllycaconitine hadtiters. The sera from these mice also bound methyllyca-conitine in vitro. None of the 10 mice in the controlgroup had titers. Lethal dose 50% values and the 95%condence intervals for control and MLA- and DAN-vaccinated groups are shown in Table 1. Overlapping95% condence intervals did not provide evidence ofdifferences, although an increase of 8.6 and 34.7% wasobserved in the LD 50of the MLA and DAN groups, respectively, compared to the control group. Trial 2 Lethal dose 50% values and the 95% condence inter- vals determined for the control, MLA, DAN, and LYCgroups are shown in Table 1. Similar to Trial 1, theoverlapping condence intervals did not provide evi-dence of differences between the LD 50of the MLA, DAN, LYC, and control groups; however, an increase in theLD 50of the MLA, DAN, and LYC groups relative to the control group was again observed. Variations in previously reported LD 50for methylly- caconitine of 7.5 (Manners et al., 1993) and 4.8 mg/kg(Panter et al., 2002), and those reported in this studyof 2.91 and 3.86 mg/kg for Trials 1 and 2, respectively,were noted and may be explained in three ways. First,the relative purity of earlier isolations of methyllyca-conitine from plant material is now known to vary sig-nicantly. Second, the mice used in Trials 1 and 2 inLee et al. 236 Table 1.

Third, the mice in Trial 2 receivedan additional booster and were 2 wk older and an aver-age of 8 g larger than the mice in Trial 1. All threereasons stated above may account for differences be-tween previously reported LD 50values and the values reported in this study, whereas the second and thirdreasons may be explanations for the difference in theLD 50between mice in Trials 1 and 2 in this study. For these reasons a control group was included with eachtrial. Each treatment was compared to the control grouprun within the trial. Relationship Between Mice Survival and Antibody Titer Levels: Trial 2 Sera collected from all mice vaccinated with MLA, DAN, and LYC immunogens in Trial 2 had titers, butnone was observed in the composite sera of the controlmice. The median titers were 41,989 for mice vaccinatedwith MLA, 90,187 for mice vaccinated with DAN, and45,401 for mice vaccinated with LYC. No interactions between dose and titer were detected (P>0.10) for any conjugate. No relationship was found (P=0.365) between survival and titer with the MLA group; however, dose was related ( P=0.001) to survival. Both titer ( P=0.030) and dose ( P=0.0001) were related to survival of the mice in the DAN (7) group. Both titer(P=0.001) and dose ( P=0.044) were also related to survival of the mice in the LYC (5) group. As the chal-lenge dose of methyllycaconitine increased, fewer micesurvived; conversely, more mice with higher titer levelssurvived than those with lower titer levels. However,at the very highest methyllycaconitine doses, the toxindose was so great that all animals died regardless oftiter level. Because both titer and dose were related tosurvival of the mice in the DAN and LYC groups, werecalculated the LD 50for mice in the DAN and LYC groups using only mice that had titers >120,000 and >47,000, respectively. This resulted in a 20% increase in LD 50values to 4.67 mg/kg for the DAN mice and 4.60mg/kg with the LYC mice compared to the LD 50value for the control group. In both cases, the 95% condenceintervals of the recalculated LD 50groups overlapped with the control groups. To determine the signicance of titer without the overwhelming effects from the highest methyllycaconi-tine doses, the logistic regression was run after remov-ing methyllycaconitine dose levels of 4.5 mg/kg orgreater. A of 4.5 mg/kg is ap-proximately LD 75for DAN and LYC mice. Using this \"dose-corrected\" model, titers alone were related(P=0.001) to survival with the LYC group, whereas dose was not related ( P=0.828). In the DAN group using the \"dose-corrected\" model, only dose remainedsignicant ( P=0.003), whereas titers were not related to survival ( P=0.253). The relationship between titer levels alone and the probability of mouse survival forall three conjugates is shown in Figure 3. The sigmoid-shaped curve for the LYC group in Figure 3 shows thatonly this group ts a logistic regression. When a strong relationship between titer and sur- vival exists, and if titer is known, we can predict the Figure 3.

Figure 4 shows the predicted relationship be-tween methyllycaconitine challenge doses (up to 4.5 mg/kg BW), serum titer level, and the probability of the LYC conjugate. As methyllycaconitinedoses increase, higher titer levels are required to main-tain protection (i.e., probability of survival), whereaslower titer levels provide a reduced protective effecteven at lower methyllycaconitine doses. Discussion Several active immunization studies with animals have demonstrated protection against poisonous plant-induced toxicoses. Mice and rabbits A eld vaccine against pho-mopsin mycotoxicosis (lupinosis) in sheep has been suc-cessful in Australia (Payne et al. 1992; Allen et al.,1994; Than et al., 1994; Edgar et al., 1998). A similarvaccine provided protection in sheep against annualryegrass toxicosis and flood plain staggers (Than etal., 1998). Sheep and cattle vaccinated with lantadene-protein conjugates resulted in mild protection againstthe hepatotoxic effects of lantana poisoning (Stewart et al., 1988; Pass and Stewart, 1992). Cox (1985) re-ported the vaccination of sheep with a protein conjugatethat provided partial protection against the toxic me-tabolites of phytoestrogens. Other active immunization studies with plant toxins have resulted in increased toxicosis after compared nonvaccinated gilts fed zearalenone et al., 1990). Micewere reportedly against sporidesmin toxicosisafter vaccination (Jonas and Erasmuson, 1979); how-ever, later studies showed increased toxicosis resultedwhen sheep were vaccinated with the same toxin conju-gate (Fairclough et al., 1984). In the successful vaccination studies with lantana (Stewart et al., 1988; Pass and Stewart, 1992), phytoes-trogen (Cox, 1985) and lupinosis poisoning (Payne etal., 1992; Allen et al. 1994; Than et al., 1994; Edgaret al., 1998), a positive relationship between antibodytiters and vaccine effectiveness was observed. Otherstudies suggest that the generation of antibodies alonedoes not ensure protection against the toxin (Culvenor,1978; Fairclough et al., 1984; Cox, 1985; Cadot et al.,1986). In our trials, antibodies that bound methyllyca-conitine in vitro were raised in mice. Vaccinating micewith larkspur toxin-protein carrier conjugates ap-peared to provide a mild protective effect against meth-yllycaconitine toxicity. Nonetheless, in both trials, the95% condence limits for the LD 50between the vacci- nated and control groups overlapped. In Trial 2, wefound a strong relationship between antibody titer andsurvival with the mice vaccinated with the LYC immu-nogen. This allowed us to predict the probability ofsurvival of LYC-vaccinated mice with a known titer.When mice with low antibody titers were removed fromthe DAN- and LYC-vaccinated groups and the LD 50 recalculated, a 20% increase was observed in the LD 50 values of these groups compared to the control group.Again, the 95% condence intervals of the recalculatedLD 50groups overlapped with the control groups. It has been suggested that the immune system has evolved to degrade macromolecules by breaking peptidebonds and carbohydrate linkages and that if the toxincannot be degraded by the immune system, the pres-ence of antibodies may act as a method to temporarilybind and redistribute the toxin (Edgar, 1994). Thismechanism could act to protect the animal from acutetoxicosis by effectively binding some of the toxin andreducing its distribution to receptor sites, or conversely,contribute to increased or delayed toxicoses by re-taining the toxin in the animal's circulatory system,preventing the toxin from being metabolized or elimi-nated from the animal. Interestingly, many of the suc-cessful plant toxin immunization studies have beenwith toxins that include peptide or carbohydrate ryegrass toxicosis, respectively. Thisinformation and our results suggest the toxin methylly-caconitine, which does not contain peptide or carbohy-drate linkages, is bound by the antibodies, but notreadily degraded by the immune system. The mild trendtoward protection observed in these vaccination trialsis likely due to the temporary binding of methyllycacon-itine by the circulating antibodies reducing the amountavailable to bind to acetylcholine receptors.Lee et al. 238 Implications Vaccinations may be a useful tool to reduce livestock losses to toxic plants. The results suggest that vaccina-tion with the lycoctonine-protein conjugate altersmethyllycaconitine toxicity in mice. Further studieswill be required to evaluate the efcacy of vaccinestargeted against larkspur toxins that kill livestock.Nonetheless, vaccination with lycoctonine or other simi-lar conjugates may be useful in the future to decreasethe effects of larkspur toxins in animals.
