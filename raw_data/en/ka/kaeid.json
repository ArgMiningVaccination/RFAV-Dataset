Vol. 14-8Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is an electronic-only, online monthly publication of the Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, Department of Administ ration, that is published pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of all official rule making notices, official rule text, executive orders of the Governor, and all legislative documents aff ecting rules that are statutorily required to be published in the Bulletin. It may also include other rules-related documents an agency may want to make public through the Bulletin. State agencies are required to provide public notice of all ru lemaking actions and must invite public input. This is done through negotiated rulemaking procedures or after prop osed rulemaking has been initiated. The public receives notice that an agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedures through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and a legal notice (Public Notice of Intent) that publishes in authorized newspapers throughout the state. The legal notice provides reasonable opportunity for the public to par ticipate when a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties may submit written comments to the agency or request public hearings of the agency, if none have been scheduled. Such submissions or requests must be pres ented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" fo r each proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. Once the comment period closes, the ag ency considers fully all comments and information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Changes may be made to the proposed ru le at this stage of the rulemaking, but changes must be based on comments received and must be a \"logical outgrowt h\" of the proposed rule. The agency may now adopt and publish the pending rule. A pending rule is \"pending\" legislative review for final approval. The pending rule is the agency's final version of the rulemaking that will be fo rwarded to the legislature for review and final approval. Comment periods and public hearings are not provided for when the agency adopts a temporary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is identified by the calendar y ear and issue number. For example, Bulletin 13-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2013 ; Bulletin 14-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2014 . Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; V olume No. 13-1 refers to January 2013; V olume No. 13-2 refers to February 2013; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January 2014 is cited as Volume 14-1. The December 2014 Bulletin is cited as V olume 14-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE I DAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is an electronic-only, online comp ilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules of the state of Idaho that are of full force and effect. Any temporary rule that is adopted by an agency and is of force and effect is codified into the Ad ministrative Code upon becoming effective. All pending rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legisla tive session as final rules and any temporary rules that are extended supplement the Administrative Code. These rules ar e codified into the Administ rative Code upon becoming effective. Because proposed and pending rules are not enfo rceable, they are published in the Administrative Bulletin only and cannot be codified into the Admi nistrative Code until approved as final. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect or whether any amendments have been made to the rule, refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index . Link to it on the Administrative Rules homepage at adminrules.idaho.gov . THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by th e Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises distinct rulemaking actions: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings incorporate or require all of these actions. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies must, when feasible, engage in ne gotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brie f explanation of each type of rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested persons and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule through dialogue. Agencies ar e required to conduct negotiated rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8The agency files a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" for publication in the Administrative Bulletin inviting interested persons to contact the agency if interested in discussing the agency's intentions regarding the rule changes. This process is intended to result in the formulation of a proposed rule and the initiation of regular rulemaking procedures. One result, however, may also be that regular (proposed) rulemaking is not initiated and no further action is taken by the agency. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to am end or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to th e adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority for or is occasioning the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the subs tance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective; provided, however, that notwithstanding Sec tion 67-5231, Idaho Code, the absence or accuracy of a fiscal impact statement provided pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the rule. d) if any document is incorporated by reference in the proposed rule, a brief written synopsis of why the incorporation is needed must be in cluded in the notice of proposed ru lemaking, along with a link to the electronic version of the incorporated material or information on how it can be obtained. e) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; f) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; g) the manner in which persons may make written comments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to wh om comments on the proposal may be sent; h) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and i) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. Any proposed rulemaking that is submitted for publication in the Bulletin that would impose a fee or charge must be accompanied by a cost/benefit analysis th at is prepared by the agency. This cos t/benefit analysis must estimate, as reasonably as possible, the costs to th e agency to implemen t the rule and the estimated co sts that would be borne by citizens or the private sector. This analys is is filed with the Director of Legisl ative Services Office who then forwards it to the appropriate germane joint subcommittee assigned to review the promulgating agency's proposed rules. When incorporating by reference, the notice of proposed rulemaking must include a brief synopsis detailing the need to incorporate by reference any additional materials into the rule. The agency must also provide information regarding access to the incorporated materials. At a mini mum, and when available, th e agency must provide an electronic link to the documents that can accessed on a web s ite or post this information on its own web site, or both. This link can be placed into the ru le and activated once it is posted on the Coordinator's web site. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may adopt the pend ing rule. Because a proposed rule is not enforceable, it has no effective date, even when published in conjunction with a temporary rule that is of fu ll force and effect. An agency may vacate (terminate) a rulemaking after th e publication of a proposed rule if it decides, for whatever reason, not to proceed further to finalize the rulemaking. The publication of a \"Notice of Vacation of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin officially stops the formal rulemaking process.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 7 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; orc) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of the above legal criteri a and the governor determines that it is necessary that a rule become effective prior to receivi ng legislative authorization and without allowing for any public input, the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. The law a llows an agency to make a temporary rule immediately effective upon adoption. However, a temporary rule that impo ses a fee or charge may be adopted only if the governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a final rule, or expires under its own terms. The statute that regulates rulemaking in Idaho requires that the text of all proposed rulemakings publish in the Bulletin in order for the rulemaking to be valid. This is true for all temporary rules as well. In most cases, the agency wants the temporary rule to also become a final rule and in most of these cases, the temporary rule and the proposed rule text is identical. In this event, both rulemakings may be promulgated concurrently, however, they remain separate rulemaking actions. The rulemaking is published in the Bulletin as a temporary/proposed rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text in the Bulletin. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule th at has been adopted and is in effect. The agency must publish a notice of rescission to effectively rescind the temporary rule. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rule that is being vacated, the agency, in most instances, will rescind the temporary rule. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Pending Rule.\" This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective and a statement that the pending rule may be rejected, amended or modified by co ncurrent resolution of the legislature; d) an identification of any portion of the rule impo sing or increasing a fee or charge and a statement that this portion of the rule shall not become fi nal and effective unless affirmatively approved by concurrent resolution of the legislature; (e) the specific statutory authority for the rulemaking including a citation to the specific section of the Idaho Code that has occasioned the rulemaking, or the federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; and (f) a specific description, if applicable, of any nega tive fiscal impact on the state general fund greater IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 8 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective; provided however, that notwithstanding section 67-5231, Idaho Code, the absence or accuracy of a fiscal impact statement provided pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the validity or the enforceability of the rule. Agencies are required to republish the text of the pendi ng rule when substantive chan ges have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that me mbers of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the sections or their subparts that have changed from the proposed text are republished. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Adoption of Pending Rule\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is of full force and effect. No pending rule adopted by an agency becomes final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review and approval. Where the legislature finds that an agency has violated the legislative intent of the authorizing statute, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking in whole or in part. A \"Notice of Rulemaking - Final Rule\" and the final codified text must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is partially rejected by concurrent resolution of the legislature. Unless rejected by concurrent resolution, a pending rule that is reviewed by the legislature becomes final and effective at th e end of the session in which it is reviewed without any further legislative action. All pending rules that are approv ed by concurrent resolution become final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution unless otherwise stated. In no event can a pending rule become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

Each state agency ha s a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphab etical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections that are further subdivided into subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administrations's Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. Each rulemaking that is filed with the Coordinator is assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The docket number is a series of a two-digit agency code) in the Bulletin. The fo llowing example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-1401\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule bein g promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"1401\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being published; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2014 . A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2014 would be designated as \" 1402 \". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 1402 . Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections aff ected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 August 6, 2014 -

The action is authorized pursuant to Section 22-3421, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than August 20, 2014. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: 02.03.03.500.02, \"Rules Governing Pesticide and Chemigation Use and Application,\" will be amended to eliminate the specific names of low volatile liquid ester formulations and the date restriction of May 1 to October 1. The dates were put in rule to prevent the possibility of low volatile esters being applied on days when the air temperature might exceed eighty (80) degrees. The industry ha s informed the Department that the dates are no longer needed because many parts of the state do not reach the eighty (80) degree threshold until June or July, if at all, and most low volatile ester herbicides now have temperature restrictions on the label. The temperature restriction is a much better cut-off mechanism to reduce the likelihood of possible damage throughout the different parts of the state. Also, the newer low volatile ester herbicides being used around homes and gardens in Idaho are safer, more stable, are more effective than older ester herbicides, and have adequate restrictions on the label to protect against volatilization. The industry also recommended that the specifi c names of the herbicides be removed so that all liquid ester herbicides are included and not just those named in this older rule. This proposed rule change was recommended by the Pesticide Licensing Advisory Committee. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: NA FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year as a result of this rulemaking: ISDA does not anticipate any fiscal impact from the changes to be made to the Rule during the rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the June 4, 2014 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 14-6, pages 16 and 17 .

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Article IX, Section 2 of the Idaho Constitution and under Sections 33-107, 33-116, 33-1612, and 33-320, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than August 27, 2014. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: House Bill 521 requires each school district and public charter school in Idaho to develop and maintain a strategic plan that focuses on improving the district or charter school student s' performance. It also authorizes the Board to promulgate rules to establish appropriate procedures, qualifications, and guidelines for qualified training providers who will provide training to the LEAs in the development and maintenance of the strategic plans. During the first year, districts must have their plans in place by September 2014. In order to meet this deadline school districts and public charter schools must know what the required qualifications are prior to hiring potential trainers to help them develop these plans. The rule sets out the pro cedures to select qualified tr ainers and the qualifications necessary for one to become a qualified training provider. The specific qualifications for a qualified training provid er include two years' documented training experience in the subject area of training being provided to the LEA a nd three recommendations from individuals that have been trained in the past by the trainer. The rule also stipulates that the trainer ma y not be a current employee of the school district or charter school. Additionally, the strategic pl anning training session must include, at a minimum, the majority of the board of trustees or board of directors and the di strict administrator. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: The temporary rule is necessary to comply with Section 33-320, Idaho Code (HB 521, 2014), which requires school districts to create and maintain strategic plans and allows them to s eek reimbursement for the cost of the training necessary to complete those pl ans. The rule also sets out the proced ures for the selection of a qualified training provider and the requirements and qualifi cation needed to be a qualified training provider. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: NA FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: HB 521 which passed during the 2014 legislative session allo ws for each school district or charter school to seek reimbursement up to $2,000 annually for training. The fiscal note in HB 521 was $326,000. This rule establishes the minimum qualifications for trainers if the district wishes to seek reimbursement from the state for the training provided. The review of the trainers' applications will take additional staff time, however, at present it is difficult to determine the time required to complete the review. The fis cal impact of the legislation did not anticipate the impact on Board of Education staff for the verification of trainer qu alifications nor on the Department of Education staff for processing the reimbursement requests. These tasks will have to be completed using existing resources.STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION Do cket No. 08-0201-1401 Rules Governing Administration Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 24 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because of the need for temporary rulemaking.

This negotiated rulemaking action is authorized pursuant to Section(s) 33-101, 33-105, 33-116 and 33-1202, Idaho Code. MEETING SCHEDULE: A public meeting(s) on the negotiated rulemaking will be held as follows: Meeting dates and times will be posted on the State Board of Education website at www.boardofed.idaho.gov , under the Education Improvement Committee link. The committee will be meeting every two - three weeks. METHOD OF PARTICIPATION: Persons wishing to participate in the negotiated rulemaking must do the following: A group of stakeholders has been convened to negotiate the implementation of the Governor's Taskforce for Improving Education recommendation on the developmen t of a Tiered Certification model. Individuals may participate by attending the committee meetings or listening into the meetings and then providing written comments to Tracie Bent at the Office of the State Board of Education, PO Box 83720, Boise, Idaho 83720-0037 or tracie.bent@osbe.idaho.gov . All meeting dates, locations, and teleconference information will be posted on the Board of Education website at www.boardofed.idaho.gov . DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a statement in nontechnical language of the substance and purpose of the intended negotiated rulemaking and the principle issues involved: In 2013 the Governor convened a broad stakeholder taskforce to make recommendations for improving K-12 education in the state of Idaho. The Taskforce made 20 recommendations, one of those recommendation was to implement a tiered certification model in Idaho. The propose d rule would restructure the current teacher certification model into a three tiered model, where teachers would move from tier to tier through the accomplishment of specific performance measures and experience.

The action is authorized pursuant to Section 54-1208, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing concerning this rulemaking will be held as follows: The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The proposed rule will improve the process the board uses to substantiate the educational requirements that must be met prior to assignment to examinations or granting a prof essional engineer license by comity. It is difficult for the board to ascertain the applicant's ed ucational coursework when reviewing foreign education or non-EAC/ABET accredited applications. Also, applicatio ns for comity licensure in which th e education was completed many years ago are difficult to evaluate where cour se descriptions are no longer published or available. The board is expanding the option of requiring an independent evaluation of an ap plicant's educational credenti als to any graduate of a university program that is not accredited by the EAC/ABET organization. The previous rule applied the credential evaluation only to foreign educated applicants. Additionally, the board is changing th e process to evaluate foreign applicants for comity licensure. The rule revision will separate the foreign applicant process from the interstate applicant process. The foreign applicant process will also separate the foreign credentialing process from those that are board approved and those that are not or are unknown. For the non-approved or unknown foreign countries, the board will add a 2-year U.S. experience requirement along with education and examination requirements similar to those required of U.S. engineers. Finally, a provision is added for the board to waive the prescriptive licensure requirements in this rule and issue a license to an international expert in unique fields of engineering without first approving the licensing process of that country so long as they meet the minimum requirements of Section 54-1219, Idaho Code. This provision is added to enable unique international expertise to be av ailable on a case-by-case basis when needed. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: There is no fee associated with this rule change. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year as a result of this rulemaking: There is no fiscal impact to the state ge neral fund or the agency dedicated fund. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted.

This negotiated rulemaking action is authorized pursuant to Section 54-1208, Idaho Code. MEETING SCHEDULE: A public meeting on the negotiated rulemaking will be held as follows: METHOD OF PARTICIPATION: Persons wishing to participate in the negotiated rulemaking must do the following: Attend the meeting and present your views and thoug hts on the draft amendments or submit your views and thoughts in writing not later than August 27, 2014. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a statement in nontechnical language of the substance and purpose of the intended negotiated rulemaking and the principle issues involved: The draft amendments will require surveyors to perpetuate historic corner record information on the Corner Perpetuation and Filing (CP&F) forms filed or recorded in the county courthouse in lieu of listing all corner record instrument numbers on the Record of Survey map. The reason for this change is that over time, the number of CP&F record filings are increasing, and there is insufficient room on the Record of Survey map to continue the practice of listing all corner record instrument numbers without creating a cluttered map that is less legible to read. Only the most current corner record instrument number is proposed for listing on the Record of Survey map. A concurrent law change to 55-1906, Idaho Code is proposed that is also necessary to complete this change.

The taxpayer may decide which of the used items placed in service in 2003 is consider ed first for the exemption. In this example, computer 1 has been given the exemption first. Since the limitation is based on cost, the remaining used property exemption cannot exceed one hundred thir ty thousand dollars ($130,000) and the QIE cost is determined accordingly. The conveyor be lt is a new investment, first eligible for the QIE in 2005. In 2006, the assembly line, computer 1, and computer 2 would be fu lly taxable at the market value as of January 1, 2006. (4-6-05) ii. Example B. In Example B, the property was purc hased at auction for a cost much less than its market value.Example A Property Description (same taxpayer)Year Placed in ServiceCostNew or UsedQIE Cost 2004 Market Value2004 Exempt Value2004 Taxable Value2005 Market Value2005 Exempt Value2005 35-0103-1401 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 102 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8(4-6-05) d.

Box 36 Boise, ID 83722-0410(208) 334-7742Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 104 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8IDAPA 35 - STATE TAX COMMISSION 35.01.03 - PROPERTY TAX ADMINISTRATIVE RULES DOCKET NO. 35-0103-1404 NOTICE OF RULEMAKING - PROPOSED RULE AUTHORITY : In compliance with Section 67-5221(1), Idaho Code , notice is hereby given that this agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedures. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 63-105A, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than August 20, 2014. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Property Tax Rule 205 is being amended to allow the rule to conform to Idaho code 63-201(9) as amended by HB441a, which recently became law. The rule deletes language that is inconsistent with current law regarding the three factor test which is used to determine if an ite m of property is a fixture and therefore real property. Property Tax Rule 315 deletes the specific statutory refere nces to the various property tax exemptions, and adds the words \"property exempt from property tax\". Property Tax Rule 508 Deletes personal property exempt va lue notification by taxing district or unit rule because reporting is no longer required. It also deletes the noti ce requirements made unnecessary by statutory changes. Property Tax Rule 509 This rule required the reporting of the personal property exemption amount, which no longer needs to be reported. SB1213 dele tes the need to apply for the oil and gas well exemption so the value may not be known. This rule deletes the requirement to report on the abstract exempt personal property and certain exempt oil and gas well property. Property Tax Rule 512 is being amended to delete the word \"fixture\" from the headline describing Category 59 property items. The category is used for personal property and fixtures are statutorily de fined as real property, so should not be included under this category. Property Tax Rule 626 is being amended to clarify that personal property declarations need not be filed every fifth year, and replacement funds which have been establishe d as of 2013 may need to be adjusted if errors are discovered. Taxpayer ownership examples contained in this rule will be transferred to proposed rule 627. Property Tax Rule 627 is a new rule explaining the terms of common enterprise and taxpayer relationships that is transferred from Rule 626. Property Tax Rule 645 changes the existing language from 'requires net income when selling livestock' to 'requires gross income when selling livestock' to be consistent with statute. Property Tax Rule 803 is being amended to require the amount of personal property replacement funds received by the taxing districts to be subtracted before levies are computed. This conforms with HB441a. Property Tax Rule 805 is being amended to provide a procedure for disallowing certain budget increases in accordance with HB560 when entities do not comply with reporting requirements. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: NA FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: NASTATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1404 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 105 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because rules are simple in nature.

(5-8-09) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 315. USE OF RATIO STUDY TO EQUALIZE BOISE SCHOOL DISTRICT (RULE 315). Section 63-315, Idaho Code. (3-30-07) 01. Procedures for Boise School District Ratio Studies . The ratio study conducted by the State Tax Commission to comply with the requir ements of Section 63-315, Idaho Code, shall be conducted in accordance with the \"Standard on Ratio Studies\" referenced in Rule 006 of these rules. The following speci fic procedures will be used. (4-2-08) a. Information on property sales, which meet the requirements of arm's length and market value sales, will be obtained and assembled into samples representing various primary categories, described in Subsections 130.02 through 130.06 of these rules, and secondary categories, described in Rules 510, 511, and 512 of these rules, within designations defined in Subsection 315.02 of this rule in the Boise School District. Except when sales or appraisals must be added or deleted to improve representativeness, sales used will be those occurring within the Boise School District between October 1 of the year preceding the year for which adjusted market value is to be computed and September 30 of the year for which adjusted market value is to be computed. Each sale price is to be adjusted for time and compared to market value for assessment purposes for the year for which adjusted market value is to be computed, to compute ratios to be analyzed. The State Tax Commission may use sales from extended time periods and may add appraisals when data is lacking. The State Tax Commission may delete sales when necessary to improve representativeness. (4-2-08) b. A ratio will be determined for each sale by dividing the market value for assessment purposes of the property by the adjusted sale price or appraised value. (7-1-98) c. A statistical analysis is to be conducted for the sales and any appraisals in each property designation described in Subsection 315.02 of this rule in the Boise School District and appropriate measures of STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1404 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 107 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8central tendency, uniformity, reliability, and normality computed. (4-2-08) d. With the exception of any property designations with extended time frames or added appraisals, if fewer than five (5) sales and appraisals are available, no adjustment to the taxable value of the designation will be made. (7-1-98) e. If there are five (5) or more sales and appraisals and it is determined with reasonable statistical certainty that the property designation is not already at market value for assessment purposes, an adjusted market value will be computed for the Boise School District by dividing the taxable value for the year for which adjusted market value is to be determined by the appropriate ratio derived from the ratio study. The appropriate ratio to be used shall be the weighted mean ratio calculated from the sample for each designation, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this statistic has been distorted by n onrepresentative ratios. In this case the median may be substituted: (4-2-08) f. Within the Boise School District, adjusted market value or taxable value for each primary and each applicable secondary category of real, personal and operating property will be summed to produce the total adjusted market value for the Boise School District. The Boise Schoo l District taxable value will then be divided by this adjusted market value to produce the overall ratio of assess ment in the Boise School Distri ct. Statewide totals are to be calculated by compiling county totals. (4-2-08) g. Urban renewal increment values will not be included in the taxable value or the adjusted market value for the Boise School District. (4-2-08) h. \"Reasonable statistical certainty,\" that the property designation in question is not at market value for assessment purposes, is required. Su ch certainty is tested using ninety percent (90%) confidence intervals about the weighted mean or median ratios. If the appropriate confidence interval includes ninety-five percent (95%) or one hundred five percent (105%), there is not \"reasonable statis tical certainty\" that the property designation is not at market value for assessment purposes. (3-30-01) i. Primary and secondary categories subject to adjust ment following the procedure outlined in this rule and ratio study designations from which measures of central tendency used for adjustments will be derived are: (3-30-07) j. For all secondary categories, described in Rule 510, 511, or 512 of these rules but not contained in the list in Paragraph 315.01.i. of this rule, adjusted market value will equal taxable value. (3-30-07) k. \"Appraisal\" or \"appraised value\" refers to any State Tax Commission provided independently conducted property appraisal. (7-1-98) 02. Use of Property Designations . In computing the ratio for the Bo ise School District, the State Tax Commission will designate property as residential or commercial and shall assign appropriate primary categories, Secondary Categories Primary Categories Ratio Study Designations 12, 15, 18, or 20 Vacant Residential Land Residential 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 26, 31, 34, 37, 40, 41, 46, 47, 48, or 50Improved Residential Property Residential 47, 49, or 65Manufactured Home on Leased LandResidential 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 21, or 22Vacant Commercial or Industrial LandCommercial 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 27, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, or 51Improved Commercial or Industrial PropertyCommercialSTATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1404 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 108 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8described in Subsections 130.02 through 130.06 of these rules, and secondary categories, described in Rules 510, 511, and 512 of these rules, to these designations as shown in Paragraph 315.01.i. of this rule. For the Boise School District, adjusted market value shall be computed by di viding the appropriate ratio ascertained for each of these designations into the sum of the taxable values for each primary and secondary category assigned to a designation. Except as provided in Subsection 315.06 of this rule, for th e taxable value in any secondary category to be included in said sum, at least one (1) observation (sale or appraisal) from that secondary category must be present in the ratio study. If the ratio for any given designation in the Boise Scho ol District indicates that th e market value for assessment purposes cannot be determined with reasonable statistical cer tainty to differ from statutorily required market value, the taxable value shown on the Boise School District abstr act(s) required pursuant to Subsection 315.04 of this rule for each of the secondary categories in cluded in that designation shall be the adjusted market value for said designation for said school district. (4-2-08) 03. Assessor to Identify Boise School Districts .

Exception from Requirement for at Least One Observation for Use of Secondary Category in Adjusted Value Determination . Properties identified as secondary categories 10 and 31 rarely sell separately from farms and therefore do not appear in any ratio study. However, the level of assessment typically is similar to that of other rural residential property, including property in secondary categories 12, 15, 34, and 37. For any ratio study where there is an adjustment to be made to the assessed values in the residential designation, such adjustment shall be applied to any assessed value in secondary category 10, prov ided there is at least one (1) observation (sale) of property identified in either secondary category 12 or 15. Such adjustment shall also be applied to any assessed value in secondary category 31, provided there is at least one (1) observation (sale) of pr operty identified in either secondary category 34 or 37. (3-30-07) 07. Certification of Values . The values required to be certified to the county clerk by the first Monday in April each year under Sec tion 63-315, Idaho Code, shall be published on the State Tax Commission's web site or provided in an alternate format on request by the first Mo nday in April each y ear to satisfy this required certification.

Illustrations of Eligibility Situations Related to Common Enterprise and Related Ownerships . If the taxpayer owns more than one (1) business within one (1) county, he may be entitled to more than one (1) one- hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) exemption within the county. For purposes of this exemption, a taxpayer includes two or more individuals or organizations using the property in a common enterprise, and the individuals or organizations are within a relationship described in Section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code. This is illustrated in the following chart: (3-20-14) [Image Deleted] a. First, an analysis must be made to determine if a common enterprise exists. If entities or individuals are organized to manage a common scheme of business, they would be in common enterprise. (3-20-14) i. Horizontal Commonality is explained by the following chart: (3-20-14) [Image Deleted] Here, the usual functions involved in a working potato farm are split between several LLCs, all of which own the property involved with the functions they perform. The operation of the business is no different than if all the functions were combined in just Potato Farm, LLCSTATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1404 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 114 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8ii. Vertical Commonality is explained by the following chart: (3-20-14) [Image Deleted] b.

If such a relationship is found to exist, the entities or individuals would be considered one (1) taxpayer for purposes of this exemption. (3-20-14) c. Ownership alone does not determine whether entities are considered one taxpayer for purposes of this exemption. Two (2) businesses can have identical ownership, and each receive the exemption, providing they do not operate as a common enterprise. In addition, entities in a common enterprise can receive separate exemptions, providing that their ownership does not consist of a rela tionship identified in Section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code. (3-20-14) d. The following examples are given to illustrate eligibility situations related to common enterprise and related ownerships: (3-20-14) i. Example 1. This is an example of common enterprise, but being entitled to two (2) exemptions because the owners are not related in a manner as described in Section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code. (3-20-14) [Image Deleted] ii. Example 2. This is an example of the same owner with multiple businesses not all united in a common enterprise. Bob' s farm businesses are common enterprises, and therefore entitled to only one (1) exemption for all the farm businesses. Bob' s used car business is not involved with Bob' s farm businesses, so Bob is entitled to an additional exemption related to his used car business. (3-20-14) [Image Deleted] iii. Example 3. This is an example of multiple businesses being entitled to only one (1) exemption because common enterprise exists. (3-20-14) [Image Deleted] iv. Example 4. This is an example showing how owners of common enterprises may intersect. (3-20-14) [Image Deleted]So long as Bob and John are not related in a manner identified in IRC 267, two exemptions exist. One for Potato Seed, LLC. The other for all of Bob's businesses, because they are in a common enterprise and all owned by him. Here, one exemption exists for all of the entities because they are in a common enterprise, due to their vertical commonality, and are all constructively owned by Bob, pursuant to IRC 267. This is an example of how common enterprises can intersect with one another. The companies Bob owns completely receive one exemption; John's companies also receive one exemption, including Rock Crusher, LLC, because John's ownership interest in that company falls within IRC 267.STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1404 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 115 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8e.

TAX LEVY - CERTIFICATION - URBAN RENEWAL DISTRICTS (RULE 804). Section 50-2908, 63-803, and 63-811, Idaho \"Urban renewal district.\" An urban renewal distri ct, as referred to in Section 63-215, Idaho Code, shall mean an urban renewal area formed pursuant to an urban renewal plan adopted in accordance with Section 50- 2008, Idaho Code. Urban renewal districts are not taxing districts. (4-5-00) b. \"Revenue allocation area (RAA).\" A revenue alloca tion area (RAA) as referred to in Section 50- 2908, Idaho Code, shall be the area defined in Section 50-2903, Idaho Code, in which base and increment values are to be determined. Revenue allocation area s (RAAs) are not taxing districts. (4-5-00) c. \"Current base value.\" The current base value of each parcel in a taxing district or unit shall be the value of that parcel on the current base assessment roll as defined under Section 50-2903, Idaho Code. Current base value does not include value found on the occupancy roll. (4-5-00) d. \"Initial base value.\" The initial base value for each parcel is the sum of the taxable value of each category of property in the parcel for the year the RAA is established. (4-5-00) e. \"Increment value.\" The increment value is the difference between the current equalized value of each parcel of taxable property in the RAA and that parcel's current base value, provided such difference is a positive value. (4-5-00) 02. Establishing and Adjusting Base and Increment Values . (4-5-00) a. Establishing initial base value. If a parcel's legal description has changed prior to computing initial base year value, the value that best reflects the prior year's taxable value of the parcel's current legal description must be determined and will constitute the initial base year value for such parcel. The initial base value includes the taxable value, as of the effective date of th e ordinance adopting the urban renewal plan, of all otherwise taxable property, as defined in Section 50-2903, Idaho Code. Initial base value does not include value found on the occupancy roll. (4-5-00) b. Adjustments to base value - general value changes. Adjustments to base values will be calculated on a parcel by parcel basis, each parcel being a unit and the total value of the unit being used in the calculation of any adjustment. Base values are to be adjusted downward when the current taxable value of any parcel in the RAA is less than the most recent base value for such parcel. In the cas e of parcels containing some categories of property which increase in value and some which decrease, the base value for the parcel will only decrease provided the sum of the changes in category values results in a decrease in total pa rcel value. Any adjustments shall be made by category and may result in increases or decreases to base values for gi ven categories of property for any parcel. Adjustments to STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1405 Property Tax Administrative Rules Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 131 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8base values for any real, personal, or operating property shall establish new base values from which future adjustments may be made. In the following examples the par cel's initial base value is one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), including Category 21 value of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) and Category 42 value of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000). (4-5-00) i. Case 1: Offsetting decreases and increases in valu e. One (1) year later the parcel has a one thousand dollar ($1,000) decrease in value in Category 21 and a one thousand dollar ($1,000) increase in Category 42 value. There is no change in the base value for the parcel. (4-5-00) ii. Case 2: Partially offsetting decreases and increas es in value. One (1) year later the parcel has a three thousand dollars ($3,000) decrease in value in Category 21 and a one thousand dollars ($1,000) increase in Category 42 value. The base value decreases two thousand dollars ($2,000) to ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000). (4-5-00) iii. Case 3: Future increase in value following decreases. One (1) year after the parcel in Case 2 has a base value reduced to ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000), the value of the parcel increases by five thousand dollars ($5,000) which is the net of category changes. The base value remains at ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000). (4-5-00) c. Adjustments to base value - splits and combinations. Before other adjustments can be made, the most recent base value must be adjusted to reflect changes in each parcel's legal description. This adjustment shall be calculated as described in the following subsections. (4-5-00) i. When a parcel has been split, the most recent base year value is transferred to the new parcels, making sure that the new total equals the most recent base year value. Proportions used to determine the amount of base value assigned to each of the new parcels shall be base d on the value of the new par cels had they existed in the year preceding the year for which the value of the new parcels is first established. (4-5-00) (8-6-14)T ii. When a parcel has been combined with another parcel, the most recent base year values are added together. (4-5-00) iii. When a parcel has been split and combined with another parcel in the same year, the value of the split shall be calculated as set forth in Subsection 804.02.c.i. and then the value of the combination will be calculated as set forth in Subsection 804.02.c.ii. (4-5-00) d. Adjustments to base values when exempt parcels b ecome taxable. Base values shall be adjusted as described in the following subsections. (4-5-00) i. Fully exempt parcels at time of RAA establishment. When a parcel that wa s exempt at the time the RAA was established becomes taxable, the base value is to be adjusted upwards to reflect the estimated value of the formerly exempt parcel at the tim e the RAA was established. (4-5-00) ii. Partially exempt parcels losing the speculative va lue exemption. When a partially exempt parcel with a speculative value exemption that applies to farmland within the RAA becomes fully taxable, the base value of the RAA shall be adjusted upwards by the difference between the taxable value of the parcel for the year in which the exemption is lost and the taxable value of the parcel included in the base va lue of the RAA. For example, assume a parcel of farmland within an RAA had a taxable value of five hundred dollars ($500) in the year the RAA base value was established. Assume also that this parcel had a spec ulative value exemption of two thousand dollars ($2,000) at that time. Two (2) years later the parcel is reclassified as industrial land, loses the sp eculative value exemption, and has a current taxable value of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The base value within the RAA would be adjusted upwards by forty-nine thousand five hundred dollars ($49,500), the difference between fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and five hundred ($500). The preceding example ap plies only in cases of lo ss of the speculative value exemption that applies to land actively devoted to agriculture and does not apply to timberland. Site improvements, such as roads and utilities, that become taxable after the loss of the speculative value exemption are not to be added to the base value. For example, if, in addition to the fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) current taxable value of the undeveloped land, site improvements valued at twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) are added, the amount reflected in the base value remains fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), and the additional twenty-five thousand dollars STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1405 Property Tax Administrative Rules Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 132 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8($25,000) is added to the increment value. In addition, this example applies only to land that loses the speculative value exemption as a result of changes occurring in 2010 or later and first affecting taxable values in 2011 or later. Parcels that lost speculative value exemptions prior to 2 010 had base value adjustments as described in Subsection 804.02.d.iii. of this rule. (3-29-12) iii. Partially exempt parcels other than those losing the speculative value exemption. When a partially exempt parcel, other than one subject to the speculative va lue exemption that applies to farmland, within the RAA becomes fully taxable, the base value of the RAA shall be adjusted upwards by the diffe rence between the value that would have been assessed had the parcel been fully taxabl e in the year the RAA was established and the taxable value of the parcel included in the base va lue of the RAA. For example, assume a residential parcel within an RAA had a market value of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a homeowner's exemption of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), and a taxable value of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in the year the RAA base value was established. After five (5) years, this parcel is no longer used for owner-occupied residential purposes and loses its partial exemption. At that time the parcel has a taxable value of one hundred eighty thousand dollars ($180,000). The base value within the RAA would be adjusted upwards by fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to one hundred thousand ($100,000) to reflect the loss of the homeowner's exemption, but not any other value increases. (3-29-12) iv. Partially exempt properties for which the amount of the partial exemption changes. For partially exempt properties that do not lose an exemption, but for which the amount of the exempt ion changes, there shall be no adjustment to the base value, unless the current taxabl e value is less than the most recent base value for the property. For example, assume a home has a market value of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) and a homeowner's exemption of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), leaving a taxable value of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), all of which is base value. The following year the homeowner's exemption limit changes to ninety thousand dollars ($90,000), so the property's taxable value increases to one hundred ten thousand dollars ($110,000). The base value remains at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Alternatively, assume the property in the preceding example increases in market value to two hundred twenty thousand dollars ($220,000) and the homeowner's exemption drops to ninety thousand dollars ($90 ,000) because of the change in the maximum amount of this exemption. The base value remains at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Finally, assume the property decreases in value to one hundred eighty-eight thousand dollars ($188,000) at the same time the homeowner's exemption limit changes to ninety thousand dollars ($90,000). The property now has a taxable value of ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000), requiring an adjustment in the base value to match this amount, since it is lower than the original base value of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). (3-29-12) v. Change of exempt status. When a parcel that is taxable and included in the base value at the time the RAA is established subsequently becomes exempt, the base value is reduced by the original most current value of the parcel included in the base value. If this parcel subs equently becomes taxable, the ba se value is to be adjusted upward by the same amount that was originally subtracted . For example, assume a land parcel had a base value of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000). One (1) year later the parcel has a value of nineteen thousand dollars ($19,000), so the base value is reduced to nineteen thousand dollars ($19,000). Three (3) years later, an improvement valued at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) was added. The land at this later date had a value of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000). Both land and improvements were purchased by an exempt entity. The base would be reduced by twenty nineteen thousand dollars ($ 2019,000). Five (5) years later, the land an d improvement becomes taxable. The base value is to be adjusted upwards by twenty nineteen thousand dollars ($ 2019,000). (4-5-00) (8-6-14)T e. Adjustments to base values when property is re moved. Base values are to be adjusted downward for real, personal, and operating property removed from th e RAA. Property shall be considered removed only under the conditions described in the following subsections. (4-5-00) i. For real property, all of the improvement is physically removed from the RAA, provided that there is no replacement of said improvement during the year the original improvement was removed. If said improvement is replaced during the year of removal, the reduction in base value will be calculated by subtracting the value of the new improvement from the current base value of the original improvement, provided that such reduction is not less than zero (0). (4-5-00) ii. For personal property, all of the personal property associated with one (1) parcel is physically removed from the RAA or any of the personal property associated with a parcel becomes exempt. In the case of exemption applying to personal property, the downward adju stment will first be applied to the increment value and STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1405 Property Tax Administrative Rules Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 133 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8then, if the remaining taxable value of the parcel is less than the most current base value, to the base value. Assume, for example that a parcel consists entirely of personal prop erty with a base value of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) and an increment value of ninety thousand dollars ($90, 000). The next year the property receives a one hundred thousand ($100,000) personal property exemption. The incr ement value is reduced to zero and the base value is reduced to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) . (4-5-00) (8-6-14)T iii. For operating property, any of the property under a given ownership is removed from the RAA. (4-5-00) f. Adjustments to base value for annexation. When property is annexed into an RAA, the base value in the RAA shall be adjusted upwards to reflect the value of the annexed property as of January 1 of the year in which the annexation takes effect. As an example, assume that parcels with current taxable value of one million dollars ($1,000,000) are annexed into an RAA with an existing base value of two million dollars ($2,000,000). The base value of the RAA is adjusted upwards to three million dollars ($3,000,000). (8-6-14)T fg. Adjustments to increment values. In addition to the adjustment illustrated in subsection (02)(e)(ii) of this rule, Ddecreases in total parcel value below the initial base value decrease the base value for the parcel. This leads to greater increment value if the parcel increases in value in future years. For example, if a parcel with a initial base value of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) decreases in value to ninety-five thousand dollars ($95,000), but later increases to ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000), an increment value of three thousand dollars ($3,000) is generated. If the same parcel increases in value to one hu ndred two thousand dollars ($102,000) after the decrease to ninety-five thousand dollars ($95,000), the increment value would be seven thousand dollars ($7,000). (4-5-00) (8-6-14)T gh. Apportioning operating property values. For operating property, the original base value shall be apportioned to the RAA on the same basis as is used to apportion operating property to taxing districts and units. The operating property base value shall be adjusted as required under Section 50-2903, Idaho Code. (4-5-00) 03. Levy Computation for Taxing Districts Encompassing RAAs Within Urban Renewal Districts . Beginning in 2008, levies shall be computed in one (1) of two (2) ways as follows: (5-8-09) a. For taxing district or taxing unit funds other than those meeting the criteria listed in Subsection 804.05 of this rule, the property tax levy shall be computed by dividing the dollar amount certified for the property tax portion of the budget of the fund by the market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property within the taxing district or unit, including the value of each par cel on the current base assessment roll (base value), but excluding the increment value. For example, if the taxable value of property within a taxing district or unit is one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) but fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) of that value is increment value, the levy of the taxing district must be computed by dividing the property tax portion of the district's or unit's budget by eighty-five million dollars ($85,000,000). (5-8-09) b. For taxing district or taxing unit funds meeting the criteria listed in Subsection 804.05 of this rule, the property tax levy shall be computed by dividing the dollar amount certified for the property tax portion of the budget of the fund by the market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property within the taxing district or unit, including the increment value. Given the values in th e example in Paragraph 804.03.a. of this rule, the levy would be computed by dividing the property tax portion of the fund by one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000). (5-8-09) 04. Modification of an Urban Renewal Plan . When an authorized municipality passes an ordinance modifying an urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing provision, the current value of property in the RAA shall be determined as if the modification had not occurred. All modifications to urban renewal areas and RAAs must comply with the provisions of Rule 225 of these rules. (4-5-00) a. Modification by consolidation of RAAs. If such modification involves combination or consolidation of two (2) or more RAAs, the base value shall be determined by adding together independently determined current base values for each of the areas to be combined or cons olidated. The current taxable value of property in an area not previously included in any RAA shall be added to determine the total current base value for the consolidated RAA. (4-5-00)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1405 Property Tax Administrative Rules Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 134 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8b. Modification by annexation. (5-8-09) i. If an RAA is modified by annexation, the curren t taxable value of property in the area annexed shall be added to the most current base value determined for the RAA prior to the annexation. (5-8-09) ii. For levies described in Paragraphs 804.05.b., c., or d. of this rule approved prior to December 31, 2007, and included within the boundaries of a revenue a llocation area by a change in the boundaries of either the revenue allocation area or the area subject to the levy by the taxing district or unit fund after December 31, 2007, the property tax levy shall be computed by dividing the dollar amount certified for the property tax portion of the budget of the fund by the market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property within the taxing district or unit, including the increment value. The exam ple below shows the value to be used for setting levies for various funds within an urban renewal district \"A\" that annexes area \"B\" within a school district. Area (B) was annexed after December 31, 2007. Therefore, the Area (B ) increment was added back to the base for all funds shown except the tort fund. The Area (A) increment value was added back to the base for the bond and override funds which were certified or passed after December 31, 2007. (5-8-09) (8-6-14)T 05. Criteria for Determining Whether Levies for F unds Are to Be Computed Using Base Value or Market Value for Assessment Purposes . Beginning in 2008, levies to be certified for taxing district or unit funds meeting the following criteria or used for any of the following purposes will be computed as described in Paragraph 804.03.b. of this rule. (5-8-09) a. Refunds or credits pursuant to Section 63-1305, Idaho Code, and any school district judgment pursuant to Section 33-802(1), Idaho Code, provided the refunds, credits, or judgments were pursuant to actions taken no earlier than January 1, 2008; (5-8-09) b. V oter approved overrides of the limits provided in Section 63-802, Idaho Code, provided such overrides are for a period not to exceed two (2) years and were passed after December 31, 2007, or earlier as provided in the criteria found in Paragraph 804.05.e.; (5-8-09) c.

CALCULATION OF TAX ON GASEOUS FUELS (RULE 110). Section 63-2424, Idaho Code. 01. In General . In all cases in which any tax under Chapter 24, Title 63, Idaho Code, must be calculated for any special fuel that is a gaseous fuel, the fo llowing equivalency formulas sh all be used to calculate the amount of tax due. The following applies to gaseous special fuels: (6-23-94) ( ) a. One (1) therm of natural gas will be the equivalent of one (1) gallon of liquid. A gaseous special fuel is a special fuel that is a gas at sixty (60) degrees Fahrenheit and fourteen and seven-tenths (14.7) pounds per square inch absolute. (6-23-94) ( ) b. Four and one-fourth (4 1/4) pounds of propane will be the equivalent of one (1) gallon of liquid. A gaseous special fuel may be sold at volumes or weights other than those listed in this section, but, must be converted to the volumes and weights used in this section for repor ting purposes to ensure that the gaseous special fuels are taxed at the energy equivalent to a gallon of gasoline. (6-23-94) ( ) 02. Equivalent s BTU's . Special fuels tax on gaseous fuels will be computed based upon the equivalent BTU' s per gallon of gaseous fuels. The following values will be used in a formula establishing the rate: The following equivalents will be used when calculating amounts of gaseous special fuel sold and corresponding tax amounts for motor fuels tax reporting purposes. Gaseous special fuel dist ributors are required to report the volumes and tax as required on the fuel distributor form. Gasoline 127,000 BTU's per gallon Propane 92,000 BTU's per gallon Natural Gas 100,000 BTU's per gallon Natural gas 100,000 BTU x current tax rate = tax per therm Gasoline 127,000 BTU Propane 92,000 BTU x current tax rate = tax per 4 1/4 pounds Gasoline 127,000 BTU Motor FuelBTUs per liquid gallonTax per liquid gallonVolume per Gasoline Gallon Equivalent (GGE)Tax per GGEVolume per Diesel Gallon Equivalent (DGE)Tax per DGE Gasoline 127,000 1 TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0105-1402 Motor Fuels Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 140 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8(6-23-94) ( ) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 311. IFTA LICENSE BOND (RULE 311). Section 63-2442A, Idaho Code. 01. General . The State Tax Commission (Commission) may require an International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) licensee to post a bond following the requir ements of the IFTA Agreement in order to maintain his license. A bond may be required when he files returns or remits taxes, separately or in combination, after the due date at least three times within a th ree year period. When a bond is required, the licensee must post the bond within thirty (30) days from the date of the request. When no bond is posted within the thirty (30) days, the license is automatically revoked and it must be surrendered to the Commission. An assessment may be made for any unreported tax liability based on actual records or an estimate. ( ) 02. Reinstating Revoked Licenses . An applicant may be required to post a bond when he has previously had his IFTA license revoked or is related to a person who has previously had his IFTA license revoked. An applicant is related to a person who has previously had his IFTA license revoked when: ( ) a. The applicant is owned at least twenty-five pe rcent (25%) by a person or persons who has previously had his IFTA license revoked. ( ) b. The applicant is operated or controlled by a person or persons who has previously had his IFTA license revoked. Operation and control includes, but is not limited to, an officer or director or other person authorized by the applicant to engage in the business or commercial activity of the applicant. ( ) 03. Amount and Type of Bond .

The action is authorized pursuant to Section 54-2105, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than August 20, 2014. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Board of Veterinary Medicine issues certifications to qualified veterinary technician applicants. Current rule provides several ways a certified veterinary technician (CVT) applicant can demonstrate completion of the educational requirements for certification. Two of the existing methods for an applicant to satisfy these requirements are to submit evidence of graduation from a veterinary technology program equivalent to a program approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association or, if a foreign graduate, graduation from a program of veterinary medicine from a foreign school approved by the Board. The Board has determined that it lacks the expertise and means to adequately evaluate whether a non-accredited CVT progra m is equivalent to an accredited A VMA program or to approve foreign schools of veterinary medicine. To ensure uniformity in entry-level knowledge of certified veterinary technicians in Idaho, IDAPA 46.01.01.100 is being amended to delete these provisions. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: NA NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 14-539, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than August 20, 2014. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The rule defines when an insurer has knowledge that an individual has died and when the period for determining if benefits are unclaimed begins to run. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: Many life insurance policy and annuity benefits go unclaim ed because the beneficiary is unaware of the policy or contract. The unclaimed property laws are in place to provid e a centralized location for holders of unclaimed property to deposit the property and for the rightful owner to search for and discover property. Several life insurance and annuity companies have taken the position that they do not have to transfer unclaimed policy and contract benefits under the Idaho unclaimed property laws because they do not know of the policy holder's death until they receive certification of death or because the time period for abandonment does not run until they receive such certification. In the meantime, the insurers hold and in vest the policy benefits for their own account and do not take any action to locate a beneficiary. This is contrary to the public policy on which the unclaimed property laws are based. A temporary rule is necessary to define when the compa ny knows of a death and to specify when the period of abandonment begins to run. The temporary rule will result in the inclusion of benefits long past their payable date on the list of unclaimed property and provide an immediate benefit to Idahoans who are unaware that the policies and contracts exist. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: No general funds are used for the unclaimed property pr ogram. Additional unclaimed property will be located due to the rule change and held for the rightful owners pursuant to title 14, chapter 5, Idaho Code. A limited amount of interest is earned on unclaimed property held by the Tr easurer and retained in the general fund. The addition of unclaimed life insurance benefits under this rule will not generate sufficient income to produce a fiscal impact. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because of the need for temporary rulemaking. The Office of the Treasurer will request and consider comments on the proposed rule. The temporary rule is a compromise position between the proposal of the Uniform Law Commission requiring insurers check the Social Secur ity Administration Master Death File and the insurer's position that they can hold and invest the policy benefits for their own account until they receive a death certificate. The Treasurer believes the compromise is reasonable for both the public and the insurers and appropriate for a temporary rule.OFFICE OF THE STATE TREASURER Docket No. 54-0301-1401 Idaho Unclaimed Property Administrative Rules Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 150 August 6, 2014 - Vol. 14-8INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: NA ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the temporary and propos ed rule, contact Audra Fink, Program Specialist, at (208) 332-2978.

The action is authorized by Chapters 44 and 58, Title 39, Idaho Code. In addition, 40 CFR 271.21(e) and Section 39-4404, Idaho Code, require DEQ to adopt amendments to federal law as proposed under this docket. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before August 20, 2014. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Idaho's Rules and Standards for Hazardous Waste are updated annually to maintain consistency with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's (EPA's) federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA). This proposed rule updates the federal regulations incorporated by reference to include those revised as of July 1, 2014, and makes technical corrections as recommended in the most recent EPA Incorporation By Reference Guidance. Groups interested in hazardous waste and handlers of hazardous waste including generators, transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlin ed. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2014 for adoption of a pe nding rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2015 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorpora tion by reference is necessary: Idaho has historically adopted both required and optiona l federal regulations so that Idaho's hazardous waste rules are the same as federal requirements. Optional federal regulations usually allow more flexibility to the regulated community; required federal regulations are necessary to maintain program primacy. Adoption by reference allows DEQ to keep its rules up to date with federal regulation changes and minimizes the EPA Region 10 effort needed to keep Idaho's authorization current. Adoption by referen ce also simplifies compliance for the regulated community. Information for obtaining a copy of the federal regulations is included in the rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Negotiated rulemaking was not conducted. DEQ determined that negotiated rulemaking is not feasible due to the simple nature of this rulemaking and because DEQ has no discretion with respect to adopting EPA's federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA). Whenever possible, DEQ incorporates federal regulations by reference to ensure that the stat e rules are consistent with federal regulations. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: This proposed rule does not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government, nor is it broader in scope or more stringent than federal regulations. FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: Not applicable.
