After all he has done to destroy us? How could you allow him to stick a needle into you, saying he's helping you?' - A poll last week showed less than 25% black Americans plan to get the shot - Black Americans are particularly wary of the vaccination, despite the fact that they've suffered a disproportionate share of the US's coronavirus deaths - The vaccine roll out began across the United States Monday, with intensive care nurse Sandra Lindsay in New York among the first to receive the Pfizer shot Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan has called the [coronavirus](/news/coronavirus/index.html) vaccine 'a free shot of toxic waste' in a speech urging his followers not to take it. Farrakhan, 87, was speaking virtually at the National Afrikan/Black Leadership Summit on Saturday when he made the comments. The vaccine roll out began across the United States Monday, with intensive care nurse Sandra Lindsay in New York among the first to receive the [Pfizer](/news/pfizer/index.html) shot on the day the death toll from the virus hit 300,000. But Farrakhan, whose allegedly anti-Semitic, anti-white and anti-gay comments have previously prompted the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center to label him an extremist, said: 'We are so frightened over this Covid, now they're getting us ready for this vaccine. 'Do you believe satan is concerned about vaccinating you? You trust him? After all he has done to destroy us? How could you allow him to stick a needle into you, saying he's helping you? 'Those of you who are health professionals, they want you to take it first. You notice they're offering you money now? This devil...offers you $1,000 or $1,500 to take a shot. They give you free shots of toxic waste.' A poll released last week already shows less than a quarter of black Americans plan to get vaccinated. Black Americans are particularly wary of the shot, despite the fact that they've suffered a disproportionate share of the US's coronavirus deaths. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, pictured, has called the coronavirus vaccine 'a free shot of toxic waste' in a speech urging his followers not to take it According to the latest AP and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research [ survey,](http://www.apnorc.org/) levels of trust in a vaccine are about the same on the potential eve of one's approval as they were in May. A black or Latinx person is nearly three times more likely to die of COVID-19 than a white person, and about four times more likely to be hospitalized for the infection. A long and dark history of distrust in medicine precedes the current pandemic. US doctors conducted horrific experiments and research on black Americans without their full consent, including the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment, as recently as the 1970s. Black Americans were the least likely to say they will get a COVID-19 vaccine, with just 24% saying they will get a shot. Less than half of all Americans surveyed planned to geta shot The largest vaccination campaign in US history is now underway with an intensive care nurse Sandra Lindsay in New York among the first to receive a COVID-19 shot this morning as the death toll from the virus neared 300,000 But public health officials need to win over the trust of black Americans who are also more likely to work essential jobs and be exposed to coronavirus if 70 to 80 percent of the U.S. needs to be vaccinated to get back to some semblance of 'normal,' as Dr Anthony Fauci has suggested. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Monday: 'We know that lack of trust is a major cause for reluctance, especially in communities of color. And that lack of trust is not without good reason, as the Tuskegee studies occurred in our lifetimes.' Adams, who is black, added: 'To encourage diverse enrollment in clinical trials, we must first acknowledge this real history of mistreatment and exploitation of minorities by the medical community and the government.' Surgeon General Jerome Adams, right, said Monday: 'We know that lack of trust is a major cause for reluctance, especially in communities of color. And that lack of trust is not without good reason, as the Tuskegee studies occurred in our lifetimes' On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci admitted: 'People, understandably, are skeptical about the speed, but we have to keep emphasizing speed means the science was extraordinary that got us here.' The CDC are said to be rolling out a badge of honor for when you get your vaccine shot. Nurse Lindsay received a button which read: 'Crushing COVID-19, got my vaccine.' Other designs read: 'I got my COVID-19 vaccine!' On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci admitted: 'People, understandably, are skeptical about the speed, but we have to keep emphasizing speed means the science was extraordinary that got us here' A CVS spokesperson told [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wear-sticker-covid-19-vaccine-cdc-thinks/story?id=74716320): 'We think \"I got vaccinated\" could be the new \"I voted\" - at least until the pandemic is over - and we're exploring the idea as one of many ways to encourage others to get vaccinated.' Controversial minister Farrakhan was last year barred from Facebook for violating their ban on 'dangerous individuals.' After being banned from the platform he then referenced 'Satanic Jews' in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism, misogyny and homophobia. In the speech Saturday Farrakhan also referred to white people as 'devils', adding: 'Tell the cracker: I ain't coming to your school.' On July 4 he told his followers the vaccine was a plot by Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates to 'depopulate the earth.' He said then: 'I say to my brothers and sisters in Africa, if they come up with a vaccine, be careful. Don't let them vaccinate you with their history of treachery through vaccines, through medication. Do not take their medication.' 'Dr. Fauci, Bill Gates and Melinda \u2014 you want to depopulate the Earth. What the hell gave you that right? Who are you to sit down with your billion to talk about who can live, and who should die?', he added. He confirmed Saturday that YouTube removed the video.
