Infections by Region in the World (Weekly) * December 22, 2021 PAXLOVID EUA (US)December Xocova EUA (Japan)November 24, 2022 S-268019 Submission (Japan) March by WHO17Background totheEarly Development of COVID- 19Vaccines intheUS 1.Operation Warp Speed in the US Aggressive investment in promising candidates for the purpose of accelerating the development of vaccines, therapeutic drugs, and diagnostic drugs 2.Focused on building a national system for emergencies such as pandemics even in normal times Recognition of national security issues, such as the threat of bioterrorism, in addition to public health U.S. government organizations* dedicated to promoting research and development for preparedness and to building a crisis management system Established the EUA legal framework and approval standards as a country at an early stage, and formulated and promoted development plans with FDA and industry working together Cross -border collaboration between all stakeholders, including governments, academia, regulatory authorities, and the pharmaceutical industry, made early development and provision possible * DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency): an internal agency of the US Department of Defense, BARDA (Biomedical Ad vanced Research and Development Authority): an internal agency of the US Department of Health and Human Services18 Insufficient preparation in normal times for emergencies such as pandemics Continuous support for technological development from the perspective of national security is required Creation of a system or mechanism designed for emergency response Existence such as emergency use authorizations (EUA) in the US Insufficient framework for conducting large - scale clinical trials Substantial risks for reviewers and companies Litigation risk Loss of business opportunities due to the convergence of the target infectious disease Insufficient education regarding vaccination (discussion of risk -benefit)Barriers due to conventional approaches/systems in Japan Problems revealed by this pandemicBackground behind Japan's Delay in Vaccine Development19What We Learned from the Pandemic Infectious disease control is a major public health issue, and it is necessary to build a true global partnership , not only among pharmaceutical companies, but also among all stakeholders, including governments, academia, and societyIt is difficult to predict when, where, and what infectious disease will cause a pandemic Considering global society, it is not enough just to implement local country measures against infectious diseasesAnyone can become infected, develop symptoms and die20Threats of Infectious Diseases in the World Three major infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis) Prevalent in LMICs Kill more than 2.5 million people each year Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) 20 diseases, such as dengue fever, rabies, and Chagas' disease, which are prevalent mainly in tropical regions and for which no cures have been developed Antimicrobial Resistance Mutations in pathogenic bacteria make existing antibiotics less effective or ineffectiveThere are many infectious disease threats globally beyond COVID -19 Major global threats2121Threats of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) Countermeasure on AMR is a \"issue that must be addressed on a global scale\"2014 2019 20502050 2019 2014700,000 people 1.27 million people Estimated over 10million people Deaths due to AMR bacteria (annual) *O'Neill J., \"Tackling drug -resistant infections globally: final report London: on Antimicrobial Res istance (2016) **Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, \"Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance in 2019: a systematic analysis\", The Lancet (2022)AMR, called a \"silent pandemic\", is a serious problem, as it is difficult to detect and spreads relatively AMR is estimated to have killed approximately 700,000 people *in 2014 and 1.27 million people **in 2019 It is estimated that if effective AMR measures are not taken in the future, approximately 10 million people *will die annually by the year 2050, causing an economic impact of $100 trillion

Antibiotic stewardship Promotion of switching to generics InvestmentRevenue Unable to sustain research and development because the investment cannot be recovered AstraZeneca sold small molecule antimicrobial business to Pfizer (2016) Sanofi transferred ID department and 100 employees to Evotec (2018) Novartis withdraws from antimicrobial research (2018)Big Pharma withdraws from antimicrobial market Bankruptcy or acquisition of biotech playersSocial needsDysfunctional business environment23Do Not Repeat the Social Disruption Caused by Infectious Diseases Accurate prediction of pandemics is difficult (COVID -19, flu, etc.) While the spread of COVID -19 has certainly raised public awareness of infectious diseases, preparation for the next pandemic remains insufficientThe need to strengthen preparedness for new pandemics \"now\" Infectious disease control is an important issue closely related to national security Industry, government, and academia can work together to strengthen preparedness A framework is needed to prepare for emergencies arising from infectious diseases -Incentives that enable sustained progress in research and development and stable production and supply -Construction of a clinical trial system that can respond quickly to emergencies -Development of laws that can flexibly adapt to both emergencies and normal times, and development of alternative evaluation criteria24 Construction of a New Clinical Trial System and Development of Infrastructure for Emergencies In anticipation of emergencies, it is necessary to build a clinical trial system and develop infrastructure, including online medical consultation, in order to secure subjects early and promote clinical trialsIssues and measures in the Xocova Phase 2/3 trial There were few subjects for clinical trials at medical institutions Due to the special environment of a pandemic, isolation at accommodation facilities, homes and others It was difficult to secure subjects during both the \"recession\" and the \"wave\" periods of infection Recession period: September to the end of December 2021 (after the 5th wave converges): Target new infections decreased Wave period: From January 2022 (6th and 7th waves): The medical system was under strain, and it was difficult to secure medical resources Conducted clinical trials at home/hotels and clinical trials in Asia (Korea/Vietnam) Completed the clinical trial with the cooperation of various stakeholders such as clinical trial doctors, local governments, and private companies25Maintaining a Production System in Preparation for Emergency Operations In order to demonstrate sufficient manufacturing capacity in an emergency, it is necessary to operate the factory in an economically and functionally viable manner during normal timesThe dilemma of maintaining production capacity Mass production of vaccines, therapeutic drugs, etc. in a short period of time as an emergency measure for pandemic outbreaks It is difficult to rapidly produce a sufficient amount of vaccines and therapeutic drugs from dormant factories (humans and facilities) Excessive costs to maintain production facilities for private companies after the emergency has passed and returned to normal26Flexible and Bold Pharmaceutical Regulatory Actions in the US under the Emergency The EUA allows FDA to help strengthen the nation's public health protections against public health emergencies FDA may authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency when certain criteria are met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives On the other hand, since it is \"unapproved\" after the declaration is lifted, the basis for authorization will be lost, and companies are recommended to accumulate data even after obtaining authorization and to get full approval promptly Accelerated decision making based on consideration of risk and benefit to protect the country from the COVID -19 pandemic EUAs issued by FDA Vaccine: 4 products Therapeutics: 14 products In vitro Diagnostic Agent: 414 products Full approval/Cancellation of EUA due to change in prevalent strains Vaccine: 2 products approved Therapeutics: 2 products approved, 2 product under review, 3 products revoked In vitro Diagnostic Agent: 32 products revoked Accumulation of evidenceEmergency Use Authorization (EUA)27Action in Japan to Overcome the Challenges Surfaced during the Pandemic Established SCARDA within AMED Extensive information collection and analysis on vaccine development Strategic research fundingEstablishment of Emergency Approval System A system to give rapid regulatory approval to promising medical products, such as therapeutics and vaccines, during a pandemic, prior to a full \"normal\" package becoming available In terms of national security, various actions are in progress in Japan It is very important to continue to promote these actions through collaboration between government, academia and the pharmaceutical industryEstablished a new method for validation of COVID -19 vaccines Agreement on a study design comparing to approved vaccine with neutralizing antibody titer endpoint Promoting development of purely domestic vaccinesCreation of new emergency -ready systemsPreparation in normal times in anticipation of
