Though the current debate surrounding vaccines is often polarizing, it is still imperative for everyone to think critically about the state of vaccine requirements and legislation, as well as the various effects it could have on our country's posterity. Vaccines have seemingly received an exempted status when it comes to acknowledgement of possible side effects. Though side effects of over-the-counter medication are heavily advertised and displayed, parents are often ill-informed when it comes to the detrimental and recognized side effects of vaccines. A \"vaccine injury\" is the legal term for a disability, illness, or condition brought on by a vaccination. It is an interesting turn of phrase, considering death is legally regarded as a vaccine injury. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, it is recommended that an infant receives the Hepatitis B, Rotavirus, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Haemophilus Influenzae Type B, Pneumococcal, Inactivated Poliovirus, Influenza, Measles/Mumps/Rubella, Varicella, and Hepatitis A vaccines all before their first birthday. A few side effects of these ten vaccines include: anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, chronic arthritis, thrombocytopenic purpura, and death. These are, of course, just a few immediate conditions periodically manifested after vaccine administration. On the Center of Disease Controls website, a colorful vaccine checklist is provided as a resource for parents. The list outlines the recommended time frame for children receiving vaccinations. Next to each vaccine there is a convenient checkbox for those who wish to make their child's vaccination schedule feel more like a scavenger hunt. Little emphasis is made on parents creating a plan of action made in conjunction with their doctor based on personal beliefs, concerns, or up-to-date research. Vaccines go beyond the guise of public health. In a perfect world, children would be safe and healthy without the need for consistent and gratuitous medical intervention. However, it is unclear if we will reach a point where medical decisions are comfortably determined between parents and doctors. This is especially true with the recent Senate Bill 277 (SB277) being signed into law in California this past June. SB277, which goes into full effect August 2016, removes many vaccine requirement exemptions for families wishing to enter California public or private schools. This includes the Personal Beliefs Exemption (commonly referred to as the PBE), which has been an ally to thousands of California parents who wish to choose some or no vaccines for their children. Now more than ever, vaccines are a public issue. Education equality is a civil rights matter. Though the demographic of those now lacking access to education is different, they should not be ignored. California is only the beginning; it is anticipated that the intertwining of vaccination rights and access to education will continue throughout the nation. The California Chiropractic Association has made its vaccine position clear: parents possess the right to choose when it comes to medical interventions and decisions made on behalf of their children. Acknowledging that there is no vaccine without risk, the CCA is supportive of alternative courses of action regarding vaccinations. This position is especially true at DeMoss Chiropractic, where we believe in the parents' right to choose which vaccines, if any, are appropriate for their child and that these choices should not limit a child's access to education. Above all, we believe in informed choices. This is why we frequently host vaccine workshops open to the public. Visit our [Workshops page](https://demosschiropractic.com/workshop/) for more information. Join us as the vaccine debate continues at [Cal Jam](http://caljam.org/general-public/), March 18th-20th 2016 as Dr. Sherri Tenpenny and Dr. Andrew Wakefield take the stage to speak on their research regarding vaccine risk and injury. Cal Jam is an annual event which exists to awaken, educate, and empower an ever expanding community of people who seek the truth regarding health and sustainability.
