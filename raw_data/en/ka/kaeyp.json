Besides the normal worries and tensions of a normal life, even the positive events in life bring with them some stress and anxiety. Getting married, joining a new job, birth of a baby - all of them are happy moments, but they also cause stress, albeit a positive kind of stress. Any kind of stress leaves its imprint on your mind and body: even if positive, stress is still that, stress. You must adopt some strategy to de-stress your mind and body to remain physically fit and mentally agile. There are various alternative techniques that you can use to relieve stress, such as yoga, meditation, acupuncture, massage, etc. You may try a combination of some of these strategies to find the one you feel most comfortable with. Acupuncture is one such alternative method that helps in detoxifying the body from the ill effects of stress. Acupuncture can relieve the physical symptoms of stress that tends to accumulate in your body - in the neck, shoulders, back, etc. -- causing pain and tension. Headache is another affliction resulting from stress. People who are under high levels of stress often have high blood pressure. Taking the help of acupuncture for stress relief can help you find reprieve from physical symptoms, such as tense muscles, muscular pains, high blood pressure, etc. Acupuncture leaves the body feeling calm and relaxed. An added benefit of acupuncture is that it improves the circulation of the blood throughout the body. 1. How It Works Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese healing art. Acupuncturists believe that energy flows through the body system through channels called meridians. This energy is referred to as Qi or Chi. Stress causes an imbalance in the body's energy and causes it to flow improperly. The Qi can become blocked and stagnant. It must be unblocked and enabled to flow freely in order to restore harmonious balance in the body. Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles at very precise pressure points throughout the body. The needles stimulate the body's natural healing processes in its energy system. By stimulating the proper acupressure points, the Qi can flow freely, thereby alleviating stress induced mental and physical symptoms. 2. Is It Safe? Acupuncture is perfectly safe when performed by an experienced licensed practitioner. Acupuncturists are trained in the proper methods of treatment and all instruments are sterilized to prevent any risk of infection. The Food and Drug Administration approves non-toxic needles made for single use application. These needles are meant to be used only for acupuncture treatments. The majority of people who undergo acupuncture feel no pain at all. A small percentage may feel very minimal pain. Bleeding rarely occurs. A typical acupuncture session may last for 30 to 60 minutes. The patient generally becomes very relaxed during the treatment and may even fall asleep. Regular acupuncture treatments can help strengthen your body so you're better able to deal with the day-to-day stresses of life. Acupuncture can also leave you feeling refreshed and energized. Regular acupuncture treatments can help heal stress related health conditions and improve the body's immunity to defend against potential illnesses. In fact, in some cases, acupuncture that is being used to treat one condition can actually help detect another, more severe illness that had not been previously identified. In such cases, acupuncture aids in early diagnosis and treatment. In another capacity, acupuncture, by alleviating stress and strengthening the body, can serve as a form of preventive measure against illness. 3. The Mind-Body Connection Acupuncture treats the mind and body as a whole system. Conventional medicine has come to accept that the mind affects the body. Stress is a perfect example of the interrelated connection between the body and mind - any perceived threat triggers a fight or flight response in your mind as well the body. The holistic approaches, like acupuncture for stress and anxiety relief, are most suitable for treating stress related health conditions. Remember, acupuncture is just one method of relieving stress. It's also important to learn positive and productive ways to cope with stress on a daily basis, thereby making the stress work for you rather than against you. Find your own combination of de-stressing methods that work for you, and use them often to enjoy a happier and healthier life.
