Ms. Youssouf then turn the meeting over to Mr. Telano for Audits Update. Mr. Telano reported the following: Other Audit Activity During Fiscal Year 2018, the Office of Internal Audits implemented a program to educate individuals throughout the healthcare system about the importance of internal controls and the Internal Audit function. Presentations have been conducted in the Central Office and at the facilities. The focus of the program is to define internal control - procedures designed to prevent fraud and identify errors before they become problems - and advise how they can be applied to everyday life both professionally and personally. External Audits 1. Implementation of the Electronic Medical Record System (Epic) a t NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst NYC Office of the Comptroll er The NYC Comptroller's Office initiated an audit of the Epic Electronic Medical Record System implementation at Elmhurst. Per the audit notification letter, the objective of the audit was to determine whether the implemented Epic system at Elmhurst was fully functional and performing as designed and planned. Onsite fieldwork began on March 21, 2017. The Auditors were provided access to the Epic test environment in order to begin their evaluation of the system. The final draft report was received on January 12, 2018. The report stated that: Elmhurst Hospital Center's Epic EMR, which became operational i n April 2016, is generally perfor ming as designed and planned. NYC Health + Hospital's Enterprise Information Technology Services (EITS) has a sufficiently strong computing environment (hardwar e, software, communications infrast ructure) to run Epic EMR, as we ll as the technical resources to help maintain the Epic EMR for continued daytoday operations. Only one audit finding was noted: Although EITS maintains a 24hour, 7daysaweek, agencywide h elpdesk facility to support users in need of technical assistan ce, its data indicates that the average time frames in which it resolve d higher priority service restora tion issues affecting the Epic EMR at Elmhurst Hospital Center significantly exceeded its own targets . EITS takes more than two times longer than its own targets to address \"Medium\", \"High\", and \"Critical\" service restoration requests . The response, submitted by Dr. Katz on January 25, 2018, stated agreement with the finding and the recommendation to take certain steps to reduce the wait time. The final report was issued on January 31, 2018. 2. Nurses' Qualifications - Offi ce of the State Comptroller The survey process began at the Corporate Human Resources Department on 5/2/17. Testing began at Bellevue on 5/16/17, as the Auditors reviewed 30 nurses' files. They then moved on to perform testwork at the At Home Healthcare Agency on 5/24/17. Testwork continued at Gouverneur, Kings County and Lincoln Hospital. An exit conference was held on 10/31/17 to discuss the audit findings. The following issues were discussed: 1. Lack of background information and fingerprinting for nurses hired through temporary agencies. 2. Missing employment documents, such as I9 forms, evaluations and background checks in the human resources files of nurses hired at the five facilities reviewed. 3. Inconsistencies in the titles and salaries of the nurses employed by At Home Healthcare. 10 A final draft report will be issued in the near future, at which time NYC Health + Hospitals will be required to provide responses within 30 days. 3. Controls Over Equipment - Offi ce of the State Comptroller The Office of the State Comptroller commenced their audit of Controls over Equipment on the day of the entrance conference. After meeting with Corporate Finance, the Auditors visited NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue to review their processes related to equipment. They also met with EITS and Corporate Operations to discuss their controls in effect over their equipment procurement and maintenance processes. Their testing began on January 23, 2018 at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue. Completed Internal Audits 1. Outpatient Billing and Collections - Elmhurst (Fi nal Report Iss ued 12/8/17) The objectives of the audit were to evaluate the internal controls regarding the management of the billing and collection process for outpatient visits. 2. Scheduled II Controlled Substances (Narcotics) - Sea View (Fina l Report Issued 1/15/18) The objectives of the audit were to evaluate internal controls and processes in place as they relate to Scheduled II Controlled Substances (Narcotics) which include drugs that have a high potential for abuse such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), methadone (Dolophine), oxycodone (OxyContin, Percocet) and fentanyl. Our unannounced inventory count of all Narcotics in the Pharmacy and the substocks on the 8 patient units found no discrepancies. However, we did note that the Pharmacy Department needs to improve their documentation related to the ordering and distribution of narcotics. Ms. Youssouf then directed the meeting to Ms. Patsos for a Compliance Update. Ms. Patsos reported the following: 1. Operating Procedure 501 Corpor ate Compliance and Ethics Progra m The OCC is pleased to announce that on January 5, 2018, OP 501 was finalized and formally promulgated by the System, and was subsequently posted on the System's OCC intranet page and on the System's public Policies and Procedures website page. In an effort to inform and educate Covered Persons regarding OP 501, on January 19, 2018, OCC distributed, through a System wide email communications, a memorandum and PowerPoint presentation to NYC Health + Hospitals Workforce Members (including those System Agents that fall under the category of Workforce Members) regarding OP 501 and the Program. In addition on Monday, January 22, 2018, all other Covered Persons (e.g., Business Partners and nonWorkforce Member Agents) were sent the same memorandum and the aforementioned accompanying attachment. 2. Compliance Certifications Legal Background Pursuant to Social Services Law 363d and its implementing mandatory provider compliance program regulations found at 18 NYCRR, Part 521, the System is required, as a condition of participation in the Medicaid program, to implement an effective compliance program, and certify each year to the existence of such compliance program. Deficit reduction Act of 2005 Certifications Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the \"DRA\"), the system is required to establish and disseminate written policies and procedures that inform its Workforce Members (e.g., employees, affiliate employees, personnel, volunteers, students, trainees, appointees, members of the medical staff, and members of the governing body) about NYC Health + Hospitals' internal policies covering fraud, waste, and abuse. The DRA also requires that each System facility that has an employee handbook, include a specific discussion of the laws, the right of employees to be protected as whistleblowers, and the entity's compliance policies in such handbook. These requirements must be met each year no later than September 30th. 3. Monitoring Excluded Providers 11 To maintain an active enrollment status in the Medicare program, the System must certify that it does not employ or contract with individuals or entities that are \"excluded from participation in any Federal health care programs for the provision of items and services covered under the program. To adhere to these regulations, and consistent with the recommendations of the NYS Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (\"OMIG\") and the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\"), each month the OCC reviews the exclusion status of NYC Health + Hospitals' Workforce Members, vendors and New York State Department of Health Delivery Reform Incentive Payment (\"DISRIP\") Program Partners. Exclusion and Sanction Screening Report December 1, 2017 throug h January 20, 2018 Since the OCC last reported excluded provider activities at the December 2017 Audit Committee meeting, there have been no new excluded or disciplined providers identified. 4. Privacy Incidents and Related Re ports - Fourth Quarter Reports During the period of October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, thirtythree privacy complaints were entered into the ID Experts RADAR Incident Tracking System. Of the thirtythree complaints entered in the tracking system, eleven were found after investigation to be violations of NYC Health + Hospitals HIPAA Privacy Operating Procedures, specifically OP 24015 \"HIPPA Privacy Safeguards Policy and OP 24028 \"HIPAA Policy on Uses and Disclosures for Treatment, Payment and Healthcare Operations, seven were determined to be unsubstantiated, seven were found not to be a violation of NYC Health + Hospitals HIPAA Privacy and Security Operating Procedures, and eight are still under investigation. Of the eleven incidents confirmed as violations, seven were determined to be breaches. 5. Compliance Reports - Fourth Quarter Summary of 4th Quarter Reports For the 4th quarter of CY2017 (October 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017), there were ninetysix compliance reports of which one was classified as Priority \"A\"; twentynine were classified as Priority \"B\"; and sixtysix were classified as Priority \"C\" reports. For purposes here, the term \"reports\" means compliance based inquiries and compliance based complaints. Review of Priority \"A\" Report On October 27, 2017, the OCC received a letter from a Reporter alleging mistreatment and misconduct in the psychiatric treatment of her son at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue. On October 27, 2017, the OCC Chief Corporate Compliance Officer referred the matter to Mr. Hicks by email and telephone for Bellevue's review and response. The OCC was advised by Christopher Roberson, Associate Director of Public Affairs at Bellevue that a review of the allegations found that the medical services provided were appropriate to the patient's condition and that there was no factual basis for the claims presented. Mr. Roberson advised that a final report is being prepared for Mr. Hicks and will be submitted shortly. Review of Retaliation Report On December 3, 2017, the OCC Helpline received an anonymous call from a Reporter who alleged that a supervisor at NYC Health + Hospitals/Queens was arbitrary and discriminatory in her management of the department. More specifically, the reporter alleged that she was unfairly denied promotion and required to provide proof of her vacation plans before her leave for approval. The OCC was advised by the Queens human resources department that their review of the matter revealed an additional workforce member had similar complaints concerning the same supervisor. As a result, human resources has sought to remove the supervisor temporarily from her position and has requested that Central Payroll assign someone to the facility to assume the supervisor's role because \"the work cannot be supported by anyone else currently in the department.\" Human resources expects that the inquiry should be completed within the next two weeks. 6. Updating Information Governance/ HIPAA Privacy and Security Oper ating Procedures Review of Privacy Ops As discussed at the December 2017 Audit Committee meeting, the OCC conducted a comprehensive review of its privacy and security Ops. Based on this review, the OCC reported that the following privacy topics, although already embodied in the System's policies and procedures, have been updated and, subject to legal counsel review, are expected to be presented to the President for approval on or by February 28, 2018. 7. Transition of Privacy Functions from Facilities to OCC 12 Historically, HIPAA privacyrelated duties and functions were handled within each facility by the respective Facility Privacy Officers, in addition to their other facility duties and responsibilities. In an effort to centralize and streamline the HIPAA reporting and investigation process, however, in December 2017, the OCC began transitioning the privacyrelated duties and functions from the Facility Privacy Officers to the OCC's Compliance Officers. These duties and functions include, without limitation, documenting and investigating all allegations of HIPAA violations at their facility, engaging in mitigation efforts following a breach of PHI at their facility, and providing initial and ongoing HIPAA education and training to their facilities Workforce Members. 8. Review and Updating of Compli ance Policies and Procedures The OCC is currently reviewing its compliance policies and procedures to determine whether modification is necessary to meet applicable law, compliance best practice standards, and the System's transformation and evolving vision. In addition to finalizing OP 501, the following Ops have undergone final legal review, and are expected to be ready for the President's signature by early Mach 2018. OP 502 (The Prohibition of Activities that Violate the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and/or Result in the Imposition of Civil Monetary Penalties); OP 503 (Compliance with the Federal and State False Claims Acts, and Federal and State Laws related to the Commission of Health Care Fraud); and OP 506 (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act) 9. Status Update - HHC ACO, Inc . Compliance Activities HHC ACO, Inc. Application for New York State ACO Certificate of Authority As reported at the December 2017 Audit Committee meeting, on October 5, 2017, HHC ACO submitted an application to the New York State Department of Health (DOH) seeking approval for an \"all payer\" ACO that includes Medicaid, commercial insurance and Medicare Advantage patients. The application is still pending. Currently, HHC ACO only provides care to Medicare feeforservice patients. If the application is approved by DOH, this expanded ACO will cover much larger patient population. HHC ACO's Compliance Plan The OCC recently revised the draft HHC ACO Compliance Plan, and circulated it the HHC ACO Board of Directors on December 29, 2017. The Compliance Plan outlines how the HHC ACO will satisfy applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including without limitation, the five MSSP compliance plan elements. The HHC ACO Compliance Plan addresses, without limitation, the following Topics: Development of HHC ACO Compliance Plan; Required Elements of an Effective ACO Compliance Program; MSSP Regulatory Requirements; Overview of the New York Accountable Care Organizations; Background of HHC ACO, Inc.; HHC ACO, Inc.

Compliance Issues and NonRetaliation Policy (The executive session was held.) There being no other business, the meeting was adjourned at 12:20 P.M. Information Technology Committee - February 8, 2018 As Reported by Emily Youssouf Committee Members Present: Emily Youssouf, Josephine Bolus, Barbara Lowe, Dr. Mitchell Katz 13 Emily Youssouf called the meeting to order at 10:20 AM. She welcomed the new Chief Information Officer (CIO) Kevin Lynch. Mr. Lynch thanked her. The minutes of the November 8, 2017 meeting were adopted. CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER REPORT Mr. Lynch presented a highlevel report since he has only been on the job 20 days, which included highlights and updates on the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program. Specifically, he discussed the Contact Center and how it was consolidated from 11 centers and phone numbers into four locations and one phone number. Mr. Lynch provided an update on the GO program to design, build, implement and sustain the Epic electronic medical record (EMR). He is working with the team and vendors to clarify the current timetable and develop an actionable plan for implementation of next golive in November 2018 and final implementation in April 2020. He agreed with Committee members that a single, consistent name should be given to the program. Mr. Lynch also provided an update on Phase 1 of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or Project Evolve program involved Supply Chain and Finance. Wave 4 of Phase 1 is scheduled to go live in March. He has been attending governance meetings and the project is on track. Phase 2, which is Payroll, Time & Labor, and Absence Management (Time Capture), is scheduled to go live in January 2019. Mr. Lynch is actively working on a governance model so that timelines make sense and can be achieved. He assured the Committee of more openness about this and all projects, so Committee members and anyone else can see progress and have a better understanding of EITS operations. Dr. Mitchell Katz tasked Mr. Lynch with figuring out a solution to the problem of doctors making long distance calls. He said they resolved a similar problem working together in Los Angeles and he is confident that same can be done here at NYC Health + Hospitals. INFORMATION ITEM 1: IT OBSERVATIONS AND FUTURE PLANS Mr. Lynch then presented his IT Observations and Future Plans. Under Governance, he will develop a strategic direction with leadership using the Health Information Technology Governance Model. EITS will collaborate with Supply Chain and provide a dashboard of projects to the Committee. Under Project Management, Mr. Lynch goal is that all health information technology projects will be enterprise wide in nature, to be used consistently across all NYC Health + Hospitals clinical and administrative locations. There might be an exception (such as legislative issues) but they will be the exception. There must also be prioritization of projects and he will work with the Committee to keep them abreast of developments sooner rather than later. Mr. Lynch explained that during a review of EITS Inventory Resources he looked at People, Landscape of all clinical and administrative locations, IT systems, and Projects. His goal is to develop a path towards selfsustainability, which Dr. Katz encouraged. Dr. Katz clarify that we may need specialists at times, but it is better to have NYC Health + Hospitals employees doing our work since we gain in the long run. Mr. Lynch assured the Committee that the plan is to serve in the most safe and efficient way. Some hard decisions about not putting money into legacy systems and going full force into the new Enterprise standard systems are needed and the Committee will be kept abreast. Ms. Youssouf said we look forward to hearing from Mr. Lynch often and pledged the Committee's full support. There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:00 AM.

Systemwide initiatives with focus on Patient Blood Management and Test Utilization will launch at the end of Jan. 2018. A multi disciplinary, evidenced based approach will be utilized, optimizing patient safety and outcomes through measurable improvements. II. Women's Health Report Women's Infant and Children (WIC) program The WIC program is changing from its WIC Information Statewide Information System (WICSIS) which is a closed system to NYWIC - an internet based system. This project requires strong communication and collaboration mainly between the WIC program staff, H+H EITS staff and purchasing. To ensure that key stakeholders are fully informed about this project, a meeting was arranged with WIC staff from Albany, Central Office EITS, Central Office staff, and key WIC administrators. This meeting proved to be productive and well appreciated by all. Robin Hood Campaign Health Leads outreach staff working in 5 H+H facilities (BHC, ELM, KCHC, LMH and Morrisania) in order to identify New Yorkers who are eligible but not yet enrolled in WIC. Breastfeeding Program The babyfriendly hospital initiative is a global effort to implement practices that protect, promote and support breastfeeding. Nine of our hospitals have earned their baby friendly designation: Bellevue, Coney Island, Harlem, Jacobi, Lincoln, Metropolitan, NCB, Queens, and Woodhull. Infant SAFE Sleep Program Mothers identified in the prenatal period as not being able to afford a crib are informed that they will be given a portable crib upon discharge. Since program began, in July 2015, a total of 1572 cribs have been distributed. III. Accreditation & Regulatory Services 2018 Joint Commission Surveys a. In January, The Joint Commission conducted Unannounced Triennial Surveys of the Detox programs at NYC Health + Hospitals/Jacobi and NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County. Observations were identified which the facilities are in the process of addressing. Both programs remain fully accredited. 15 b. In the next few months, Triennial Joint Commission Unannounced Surveys are expected at NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island, NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County, NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln and NYC Health + Hospitals/SeaView. These organizations have been and are continuing their ongoing readiness preparations for survey. Unannounced Mock Survey Preparation Site Visits a. TJC surveys mock survey revisits were conducted at NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney and NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County to provide additional support and education to staff, and is ongoing for all facilities due for survey. b. NYSDOH Article 28 Survey An unannounced mock survey was conducted at NYC Health + Hospitals/Gotham - Cumberland, to assist them in preparing for an anticipated NYSDOH Article 28 survey. Additional surveys are being scheduled for other Gotham sites. c. Candida Auris Unannounced site visits/mock surveys were conducted to assess the readiness of each organization in preparation for the NYSDOH site visits on Candida Auris. The review focused on the facilities' ability to respond to Candida Auris fungal infections, processes and procedures around infection control prevention and staff compliance with above. IV. Influenza campaign Efforts to improve the NYC Health + Hospitals staff vaccination rate for the 20172018 flu season began long before there were reports of the higher impact of influenza compared to any flu season within the past few years. These efforts included engagement of labor unions to collaborate regarding provaccination messaging, sitebased flu focus groups to learn of perceived barrier to improved vaccination rates and flu posters that reflected messaging that resonated most with our staff, including the importance of protecting high risk groups such as children < 5 years of age, pregnant women, older adults and those with chronic illnesses. The results of these efforts are substantially improved vaccination rates for January 2018 compared to January 2017. For example, the best performing site in 2017 had 75% vaccination compared to 92% this year, which is a positive trend that holds across the system. We continue to encourage vaccination and now require a written declination to be signed by staff who remain unvaccinated. The unvaccination reasons will inform our education efforts for improving flu education. We have also developed job title specific poster for labor and delivery, dietary, transport and environmental services staff areas since these represent opportunities to improve vaccination rates. (posters attached to email). There is a second wave of flu vaccination evets now that Governor Cuomo has declared a NYS Health Emergency due to flu. This year's influenza infection rate has been greater than any time in the past ten years and NYC Health + Hospitals has responded two weeks ago with a modified activation of our Emergency Operation Center. Weekly calls are now held systemwide to survey flu impact by site, review inventory of vaccine and antiviral flu medications, sick call effects on site staffing and to refine surge plans. There are daily calls with specific facilities regarding their specific needs and exploring possible support to be provided by central office. The system has two mobile health vehicles being prepared for service to augment our response. Medical & Professional Affairs staff has been in contact several times weekly with colleagues at CDC, NYS DOH, NYC DOHMH and GNYHA to insure consistency of our response with expert recommendation for diagnosis, treatment, postexposure prophylaxis and environmental cleaning protocols. V. Behavioral Health Integration of Behavioral Health & Primary Care: OBH continues to work with Ambulatory Care and One City Health to expand the collaborative care program. The collaborative will expand from depression to include anxiety and screening for substance abuse disorders. There is also training in progress to increase the ability to prescribe Buprenorphine in Primary Care settings. Efforts are underway to expand the collaborative care model to maternal health and pediatrics. In collaboration with One City Health, work has begun to implement colocated primary care in behavioral health in five sites: Bellevue, Elmhurst, Lincoln, Kings, and Cumberland. 16 Maternal Depression Screening: Currently providing screening for depression and referral for treatment if positive screen in maternal health as well as primary care in all acute care facilities. The model is also being expanded to include the Gotham ambulatory care sites. Currently screening occurs in wellbaby programs in Gouverneur and Bellevue and there is a plan on expand depression screening to all sites. In response to the current Opioid epidemic, OBH is actively working on substance use issues, Through OBH, H+H is a major part of the Mayor's initiative, Healing NYC - focused programs that address the current opioid crisis in NYC. Interventions focus on the following: judicious prescribing practices in emergency departments; increasing access to buprenorphine in primary care and emergency departments; increased distribution of naloxone kits to reduce fatal overdose; and establishment of addiction consultation teams. The Family Justice Center sites provide colocated mental health services at the domestic violence centers. All sites are now open: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten Island. OBH is working with all facilities to advance safety for patients and staff. A program of debriefing after an incident or aggressive episode has been implemented and focuses on reducing violence and assaults in the acute care areas. There is also a major focus on ensuring a safe environment for patients through a comprehensive risk assessment for ligature risk and other environmental safety concerns. We are in the process of developing a systemwide environmental risk assessment. VI. Pharmacy Collaboration with Supply Chain to create a conservation plan to manage the Critical IV fluids shortage. The office of Pharmacy services led efforts to increase awareness and implement an IV fluids conservation plan to address the current shortage in IV fluids. November 2017 A memo for conservation strategies was sent to all facilities A system wide call was initiated increase awareness amongst stakeholder An local, state and national advocacy campaign was initiated with Acurity the Group purchasing organization to make aware the current critical state of IV fluids Major conservation strategies include both reserving partial additive bags which are in greatest shortage by means of substituting the IVPB orders to IV push where appropriate Initial enterprise IV push policy has been designed, approved, and disseminated for facility addendum to existing IV push policies. (significant conservation will result) Additional strategies include IV to oral switched Established weekly surveillance of supply chain trackers as to the amount of IV fluids on hand, amount needed , amount being shipped, and areas that need conservation EPIC and QMED electronic medical records are implementing changes to assist prescriber ordering of IV push Facility based Nursing education is ongoing to support the implementation Updates January 2017 NYC H+H M&PAs Office of Pharmacy Services was featured on ABC news describing the conservation strategies that have been successful in managing the current shortage crisis Pharmacy Epic ordersets team to oversee, clinical content of order sets. As Healthcare rapidly evolves, New York Health and Hospitals recognizes the need for content within our EMR to remain current with Evidence Based clinical best practices while retaining a high level of usability for our clinicians. We are beginning the standardizing of our clinical content within systemwide order sets. Prior to pulling together SME's from every specialty across all facilities, experts are being brought to the table to assist in providing the foundational guidance needed to ensure a smooth framework for the work ahead of us. We have also begun Wave 2 of the Order Set optimization. November 2017 17 Multidisciplinary foundational decision making groups convened to conduct initial order set decisions Decisions on standards for clinical content developed in the following areas: o VTE Prophylaxis o Admission o Code Status o Mild, Moderate, Severe Pain o Embedding of links, calculators, tools o Use of defaults o Use of abbreviations o Vaccinations o Nicotine replacement 10 Order Sets will go live with upgrade pending review of the appropriate clinical council: o Blood Administration Order Set o Mass Transfusion Protocol (MTP) Order Set o Pediatric Blood Administration Order Set o Blood Transfusion Reaction Order Set o Periop Blood Administration Order Set o Intraop Blood Administration Order Set o Duramorph Postop Order Set o Discharge to Home Order Set o Anticoagulation Order Set o Electrolyte Replacement Order Set Updates January 2017 5 blood order sets have gone live: o Blood Administration Order Set o Mass Transfusion Protocol (MTP) Order Set o Pediatric Blood Administration Order Set o Blood Transfusion Reaction Order Set o Periop Blood Administration Order Set o Intraop Blood Administration Order Set Order set governance, strategy and process is being established to assure a provider driven patient centered approach. o Governance establishing a single point of entry for all requests upfront enduser standard design and approval o Strategy Establish a design strategy that includes standard, simple modular approach that facilitates end users can use Design strategy that is developed and generated by end users with expertise in epic clinical workflow o Process Provides a visual illustration of the process of moving order sets from initial content conception, review, and approval to technical build, simulation, education, and implementation Develops the framework for how order sets are moved through the system Judicious opioid prescribing update: November 2017 Pharmacist are monitoring for duplicate therapy of opioids in the inpatient setting as a means to avoid overdose 18 In developing order sets The enterprise Pharmacy and Therapeutics committee has taken the unorthodox stance to approve the use of more expensive non opioids analgesic such as IV acetaminophen and Celebrex for Trauma hip fractures and pre and post op total hip and knee surgical procedures respectively in order to avert/spare the risk of opioid use in these vulnerable populations Albeit the cost is more however this strategy should reduce future overall opioid use in these populations.

CHIEF NURSE EXECUTIVE Ms. Monefa Anderson presented the Chief Nurse Executive report on behalf of Kim Mendez, reported the committee of the following: The following report will highlight the work and achievements during the months of December 2017 and January 2018. Work continues to focus on both system transformation strategic goals as well as Nursing and Office of Patient Centered Care high priority initiatives. 19 System Nurse Practice Council (SNPC) Following the successful kickoff of our November 1, 2017 Shared Governance Retreat , the System Nurse Practice Council has received positive feedback and will be holding a followup Shared Governance Workshop on February 7, 2018. The workshop will provide an opportunity for facility designated Shared Governance nursing team members to work on laying the groundwork, beginning team and structural design and sharing learned experiences. \"BSN in 10\" The \"BSN in 10\" law will require registered nurses (RNs) to complete a bachelor of science degree in nursing (BSN) within 10 years of initial license; however, it does not apply to currently licensed RNs and exempts the following: Students entering a generic baccalaureate program Students currently enrolled, with an application pending, in an RN educational program, as of the law's effective date Unlicensed graduate nurses who are eligible for National Council Licensure Examination, as of the law's effective date. Although the bill has been signed, the Governor has agreed to delaying the effective date of the law until the temporary commission created by the law issues recommendations that address barriers to achieving a BSN in 10 years (GNYHA, 2017). Nurse Practitioners' Ability to Issue DNR and Other Life Sustaining Treatment Orders The nurse practitioner law amends the Public Health Law with regard to the issuance of do not resuscitate (DNR) orders for residents of mental hygiene facilities, nonhospital DNR orders, and orders carrying out decisions made by surrogates under the Family Health Care Decisions Act in hospitals and residential health care facilities. The amendments permit the \"attending\" nurse practitioner to issue DNR orders, orders pertaining to routine and major medical, as well as lifesustaining treatment for a patient, when the requisite clinical and other criteria have been met. The law becomes effective May 29, 2018 (GNYHA, 2017).

Total plan enrollment as of January 1, 2018 was 509, 551. Breakdown of plan enrollment by line of business is as follows: The open enrollment period for MetroPlus Gold, our product for NYC employees, was in October and membership grew substantially and now stands at over 11,000, the highest ever. Between last January and this January Gold membership grew by nearly 40% and has more than doubled since January of 2016, the first month Gold was available to all city employees. We are particularly proud of the over 1,500 Police Department and the over 900 Department of Education employees who have enrolled in MetroPlus Gold. MetroPlus continues to be a strong partner in the City's hurricane response effort. MetroPlus is one of the services located at the service center on 116th Street in Manhattan. While the center was initially to close at the end of December it is operating for the month of January three days a week. Through the end of December, we have received 232 applications representing membership for 401 people. NYC Health + Hospitals financial counselors now can use the MetroPlus portal to allow them to make PCP assignments to their facility at the point of enrollment. This will better serve our members by allowing them to have their preferred PCP at the time of enrollment and avoid the auto assignment process. We built this new capability since the New York State of Health Exchange enrollment system does not allow the enrollee to choose a specific provider within a facility. We continue to work with facilities that have questions about the new system. Our disenrollment rate for Medicaid has continued to decline throughout the year reaching a yearlong low of under 3.3% in December. The rate peaked at close to 4% last February. The rate reflects how many people left our Medicaid program each month for any reason compared with the full Medicaid population and is the broadest measure of our ability to retain members. A major component of our efforts on disenrollment has been the Finity rewards program. To date over 4,300 people have claimed rewards and nearly 23,000 have registered to participate in the program. The disenrollment rates for individual hospitals vary from a low of 3.04% at Metropolitan to a high of 4.42% at Kings County. MetroPlus has received the State benchmarks for Quality of Care measures and received 100/100 points for those measures (same as last year), placing as top Plan in NYS. We are awaiting final results on Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) and Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI). Combination of all three components will then determine Plan's tier ranking for the 2017 Quality Incentive. MetroPlus has expanded our relationship with Advantage Care Physicians (ACP) to include an additional twenty locations and over 250 new providers to the Plan's network. ACP will have 28 total locations in our service area, providing access to Primary Care and over twenty different specialties. MetroPlus was previously contracted with just a few of the ACP locations in Brooklyn, but this will expand access for Plan members in Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island. Medicaid 371,222 Child Health Plus 16,811 MetroPlus 72,069 1,202 728 22 In 2017 Integrated Case Management completed over 5,000 home and hospital visits. MetroPlus also hired a dedicated housing specialist to work with members and assist in placing them into appropriate housing. ACTION ITEM: Maureen McClusky, Senior Vice President, PostAcute Care/LTC and Khoi MD, PostAcute Care/LTC presented a resolution to the committee: Authorizing New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (the \"System\") to execute an agreement with PharmScript, LLC (PharmScript) to provide pharmacy services for the System's five postacute care facilities (Carter, Coler, Gouverneur, McKinney, and Sea View) with an initial term of three years with two oneyear options to renew solely exercisable by the System and with total amount over the combined fiveyear term not to exceed $16,723,402 to pay PharmScript for patients with no insurance. After discussion and motion duly made and seconded the resolution was approved for consideration of the Board. There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned 10:20 AM. 23 MITCHELL H. KATZ, MD NYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS February 22, 2018 This is our second Board meeting together and I feel inspired b y all the great people I have me t at NYC Health + Hospitals. We are a large system, so it may take me a while to get to all our facilities, and get there again and again, but I will do so because I deeply believe that th e important work of NYC Health + Hospitals happens at the hospitals, skillednursing facilities, the clinics, and in the home. The job of Central O ffice is to provide th e necessary support to facilitate care in the best way possible. Thus far I have had the privilege of visiting Metropolitan, Jac obi, Lincoln, Bellevue, Harlem, Renaissance/Sydenham and just this morning, Gouverneur. I have met with organized labor including those representing our nurses, our doctors, our clerks, our technicians, and a v ariety of other critical suppor t staff. Everywhere I have found mission driven people who want to do the best for our pati ents but are frustrated with bu reaucracy, inadequate clinical s taffing, antiquated computer systems, and the uncertainty that comes from knowing that we ha ve a large budget gap. The pe ople in our system want to roll up their sleeves, to be hear d, to be respected, and to mak e a difference. I asked people to plea se email me directly their thoughts, and have been deluged by great sugg estions from the front lines on how we can improve the patien t experience, and how we can in crease revenue to NYC Health + Hospitals so that we can move from the current budget cris is to a stable economic place. We are showing that we are capable of becoming a more nimble and responsive organizati on. When it turned out that th ere was no pediatric Tamiflu in community pharmacies, Dr. Allen and her staff arranged for pediatric dose packets to make sure all our children would be treated. We are currently implementing the ability of patients to receive 90 days of medi cations for chronic illnesses so that they do not need to return to the clinic for refills. Perhaps the most important attribute of an organization like NY C Health + Hospitals is hope. By demonstrating that we can take on difficult system issues and fix them, we will unleash a great current of energy and wisdom from the frontlines to make the changes happen. I couldn't be more excited. Federal Update On February 9, Congress enacted and the President signed into l aw a short term spending plan funding the Federal government through March 23 of t his year. Of critical significa nce to NYC Health + Ho spitals is the plan's elimination of two years of reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share (DSH) pa yments totaling 5 billion do llars for FY 2018 and FY 2019. Had the reductions taken effect, New York State was projected t o lose $340 million in 2018, nearly the entirety of which would have been cut from NYC Heal th + Hospitals. We will cont inue to work with the Mayor's office, our congressional delegation, labor part ners and community allies to achieve a lo nger term resolution regardi ng this critical source of funding for the uninsured. The spending plan includes a two year extension of Community He alth Center funding which benefits our Federally Qualified Health center (FQHC) N YC Health + Hospitals/ Gotham H ealth. Also included is a fo ur year extension of the Children's Health Insurance Prog ram (CHIP), coupled with the si x years that CHIP was extended in an earlier continuing resolution. CHIP is now extend ed through Fiscal Year (FY) 2027. State Update The State legislature continues t o debate the provisions of the Governor's proposed Executive Budget. NYC Health + Hospitals is advocating with our elected officia ls to protect H ealth + Hospitals from potential spending cuts and increased funding for safety net hospitals including our own. Even though Congress delayed the DSH cuts for two years, we will still impress upon our legislators the need to address the DSH distri bution methodology to avoid be aring the entire burden of DSH cuts in future years. City Update On Wednesday, March 28, at 1pm, I will be testifying before the New York City Council Committee on Hospitals about NYC Health + Hospitals' priorities over the next year. OneCity Health Update OneCity Health has launched a $5 million Innovation Fund that a llows NYC Health + Hospit als and DSRIP community partners to submit applications for potential funding going bey ond targeted DSRIP program s to design and implement programs for reducing avoidable hospitalizations, improving com munity health outcomes, and addressing social 24 determinants of health. OneCity Health expects to fund up to te n awards in total. The awards, which will be announced in late March, are expected to be in the range of $250,000 - $1,00 0,000 per selected application. OneCity Health continues to prov ide technical assistance to par tners to help them prepare f or a valuebased payment environment. OneCity Health began a 12month technical assistance program for community primary care partners. Through individualized coaching, new tools and protocols and sharing of best practices, OneCity Health is assisting community primary care partners to improve capacity, build linkages to ot her OneCity Health partners to address social support needs, promote teambased care and develop data reporting and monitori ng capabilities. OneCity Health and its partner , Community Service Society of New York (CSS), continue to provide technical assistance to build community based organization (CBO) partners ' capacity for valuebased con tracting. Fifty one partners completed the selfassessments and are now attending a series o f Learning Collaboratives on t opics such as developing a value proposition and partnering with managed care organization s. OneCity Health launched online N owPow trainings for all NYC Hea lth + Hospitals staff and OneCity Health partners in February. NowPow is a technology platform that allows users to identify social services resource s, refer patients, and track engagement. OneCity Health is continuing its efforts to advance coordinated , accessible behavioral health and primary care services to meet a variety of patient needs by supporting NYC Health + Hosp itals and OneCity Health pri mary care partners in the implementation of Collaborative Care. In February, OneCity Heal th launched a training series on Collaborative Care, which aims to incorporate behavioral health specialists into primary care teams, in collaboration w ith the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. NYC Health + Hospitals/Gouverneur Celebrates Expansion of 60 New Skilled Nursing Facility Beds to Serve Lower East Side community Earlier today NYC Health + Hospi tals hosted a ribbon cutting at NYC Health + Hospitals/Gouverneur to celebrate 60 new skilled nursing facility beds for seniors a nd clinically com plex patients while showcasing our expansion o f highperforming postacute ca re services and additional communitybased shortterm rehabilitation services for New Yorkers.

First Lady Chirlane McCray and NYC Health + Hospitals/Correctional Health Services to Expand Work on Needs of Incarcerated Women Earlier this month First Lady of the City of New York Chirlane McCray announced a set of new i nitiatives designed to break the cycle of incarceration for w omen in New York City. The City will expand programming to support family connections and resilience, enhance critical behavioral health services and create a network of reentry services that help women and their families stabilize and p revent future returns to jail. Building off the strong foundati on created by ThriveNYC and the Behavioral Health and Criminal Justice Task Force, NYC Health + Hospitals/Correctional Health Services will expand its work to improve access to high quality therapeutic services for incarcerated individuals by implementing several evidenced riven strategies that addres s the unique needs of women in jails, including: connecting dedicated counselors to women a t risk of intimate partner violence for safety planning and therapy; creating counselling programs that focus on promoting healthy coping for stress and trauma to address anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and in somnia; and using an intensive treatment model to better manage cooccurring serious medical and mental illness in the women's infirmary. Health System to Adopt New SystemWide Care Management Program NYC Health + Hospitals has announ ced plans to adopt a systemwi de care management program designed to improve access to care and health outcomes for thousands of New Yorkers most at risk of frequent, pre ventable hospitalizations and emergency room visits. The new c are management model will targe t intensive navigational resources to patients with greatest need, regardless of insurance or immigration status. T he program will feature dedi cated care coordinators from various disciplines who will follo w a proactive outreach strate gy to steer patients across the spectrum of health care services, as well as work with c ommunity partners to address so cial determinants of health, like housing and access to healthy food. The new program will also feature enhanced coordinated care str ategies from the ActionHealthNYC program that were particularly helpful in reaching uninsured New Yorkers, includi ng providing them le gal assistance, enro lling them in health insurance, and making sure they sign up for a city ID card unde r the IDNYC program. The new care management structure will be implemented in phases sta rting at NYC Health + Hospital s/Bellevue this month and is e xpected to be in place across the health system by the end o f 2018 when it is expected to ser ve an estimated 32,000 adult patients who have overlapping medical, behavioral heal th, and social needs. NYC Health + Hospitals Consolidates Psychiatric Evaluation Court Clinics NYC Health + Hospitals has announ ced plans to consolidate under Correctional Health Services (CHS) the management of its four forensic psychiatric evaluation court clinics. The cou rtordered forensic psychiatric evaluations largely comprise fitnesstostandtrial examinations (also known as \"730\" exams) which, if ordered, must be completed by at least two qualified psychiatrists or psych ologists and submitted to the j udge before the defendant can proceed with his/her case. As the large majority of these eval uations are conducted for indiv iduals who are incarcerated and awaiting trial, delays in the evaluation process can lead to l onger lengths of stay, pending resolution of their cases. Our consolidation will standardize and modernize the clinics, h elping to streamline the foren sic psychiatric evaluation process. By centralizing the over sight of these c linics, we'll not only help streamline the for ensic psychiatric evaluation process, but we'll also tap the g reat expertise of our Correcti onal Health Services team who al ready are uniquely focused on minimizing the health impact of incarceration with the potentia l to reduce lengths of stay in jail. NYC Health + Hospitals Mental Health Teams Now Serving at All Five NYC Family Justice Centers to Help Domestic Violence Survivors First Lady Chirlane McCray, Commi ssioner Cecile Noel of the May or's Office to Combat Domestic Violence and NYC Health + Hospitals recently announced the expansion of Mental Health Tea ms at all five NYC Family Justice Centers (FJC).

The Mental Health Teams are an expansion of a program first piloted at the Bronx Family Justice Center in 2 015 to deliver onsite clinica l psychiatric services to survivors; a collaborative effort of ThriveNYC , the Mayor's Office to Combat D omestic Violence, NYC Health + Hospitals, the Department of Psychiat ry at Columbia Univers ity Medical Center, and sponsored by the Chap man Perelman Foundation. 26 The Mental Health Teams will prov ide onsite clinical psychiatri c and psychological assessment s for clients within the FJC collaborative framework. Each tea m will work with clients to de velop individualized treatme nt plans, whic h may include individual therapy, group therap y, psychoeducation and medicati on management. Clients will be able to attend workshops where they will learn adaptive techniques for dealing with trau ma. As of December 2017, mor e than 250 survivors of domestic violence have already re ceived mental health services at the City's five FJCs.

Law enforcement officials have determined that the October 31 and December 11 events were terrorist attac ks. The troubling confluence of events, and the highly professional response to them by nurses from Bellevue's Emergen cy Department, Surgical Intensive Care Unit, and Perioperative Services units in responding to them, was the cat alyst for departing from cus tomary practice of naming a single nurse honoree for rece ipt of the Daisy Awards. Honored were 82 nurses from the Emergency Department, 33 nurses from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, and 67 nurses from Perioperative Services.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY REHABILITATE EXTERIOR FA\u00c7ADE AND RE-ROOFING OF THE MLK PAVILION AT NYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS / HARLEM OVERVIEW: NYC Health + Hospitals is seeking to reconstruc t the exterior fa\u00e7ade of the Martin Luther King (MLK) Pavilion, and, in addition, re-roof the MLK Pavilion at NYC Health + Hospitals / Harlem. The exterior fa\u00e7ade rehabilitation project was designed, estimated and bid in accordance with the NYC Health + Hospitals Operating Procedur e 100-5, and the re-roofing project will be bid in accordance with OP 100-5. The combined project cost is not-to-exceed $15,965,345. NEED: The Martin Luther King (MLK) Pavilion was c onstructed in 1968. Currently, this building is listed as unsafe and an extensive side walk s hed will need to be installed and maintained until the rehabilitation work can be co mpleted. The MLK Building is a steel framed building with concrete floors. The exterior wall is faced with blue glazed brick and accented with thin marble panels stacking on each other at the column li nes. The east fa\u00e7ade is devoid of windows and is just face brick. The building has a lower se ction of 6 floors that o ccupies almost the entire foot print of the lot. The 7 to 18th floors are located in a central \"tower\" of the building set back from the lower portion of the building on all four sides. The subject building has a history of various repair campaigns related to problems with brick work on the east wall and marble stone cladding at the column lines around the rest of the building. Completion of the exterior fa\u00e7ade reconstruction will remove the listed uns afe condition and will meet the requirements of Local Law 11. In addition, the roof of the MLK Pavilion has not been replaced for over 20 years. The facility has done a number of extensive repairs, but t he 56,500 sq. ft. roof has been deteriorated to a state where it must be replaced. As the building is to start the reconstruction of the exterior fa\u00e7ade, this is an opportune time to also replace the roof. SCOPE: The scope of work for the combined project includes the following: Provide site and roof protection Replace marble panels Mitigate window leakage Perform localized masonry repairs Remove all membrane base flashings, pitch pockets, drain flashings, and walkways, and install new roof Bid construction work as required by NYC H ealth + Hospitals Operating Procedure 100-5.
