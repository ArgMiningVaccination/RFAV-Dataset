All are natural and healthy and actually effective. Every time spring rolls around, I'm dreading the yellow-coated everything we get here in Georgia! Thankfully, I've got some trusty homeopathic, natural, essential oil and supplement remedies that get me through the season and keep me and my family healthy. Allerzyme I have found this supplement to be SO helpful! As soon as my nose starts to itch and my eyes start to burn, I take two capsules. It has relieved the itching and burning every time! During the spring and fall, I take one to two capsules a day so I don't have flare-ups. It is officially for the relief of occasional symptoms such as fullness, pressure, bloating, gas, pain, and/or minor cramping that may occur after Fennel, Lemongrass, Anise - Patchouli How To Use Take 1 capsule three times daily just prior to all meals or as needed. Indications: Do not give this product to children under 12 years of age except under the supervision of a doctor. SniffleEase This oil blend is actually formulated for kids and already diluted with a carrier oil, but I like to use it for myself because I love the scent, and I can use it straight out of the bottle (quick and easy to grab and use). So when my nose starts running or itching, I rub a few drops on my nose, sinuses, and underneath my nose. Not only do I get to enjoy the aroma (earth outdoors scent), I do find almost instant relief from the itching. I keep this oil around for when my kids start to get the sniffles or get colds. I rub it on their spines, chests, and sometimes their sinuses. I've found that it is still a big strong to have underneath their eyes, especially for small kids, but every child is different so see how your kids respond first. Ingredients: Carrier oil, Eucalyptus blue oil, Palo santo wood oil, Lavender oil, Dorado Azul seed oil, Ravintsara leaf oil, Myrtle oil, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, Marjoram leaf oil, Pine leaf oil, Eucalyptus citriodora oil, Cypress) oil, Eucalyptus Radiata leaf oil, Black spruce leaf oil, Peppermint oil Breathe Again I love this roll-on because it's preformulated for healthy breathing AND comes as a roll-on so it's super easy to use! I use this like I use the SniffleEase - as soon as my nose starts itching and/or running, I grab it and roll it on the bridge of my nose, underneath the nose, and on my sinuses. With a refreshing and rejuvenating aroma, it is the perfect companion for early mornings, long days, and tough workouts. This blend combines Peppermint, Myrtle, and Copaiba with four different types of Eucalyptus\u2014including Eucalyptus Blue\u2014to create a powerful, invigorating experience. For My Kids I'll also use it on my chest any time I'm coming down with a cold or another respiratory thing. I use it on my kids' spines when they are coming down with colds, but the aroma is very strong so I don't use it on their chests as the aroma makes their eyes water and burn. SniffleEase is better for them, but I do find it helps them stay healthy when used on the spine. Ingredients: Fractionated coconut/palm oil, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, Bay laurel oil, Rosehip seed oil, Peppermint oil, Eucalyptus Radiata leaf oil, Copaiba resin oil, Myrtle oil, Blue cypress wood oil, Eucalyptus bicostata oil Spring Diffuser Recipes Diffusing essential oils is a great way to clear and purify the air in your home to make springtime easier and more enjoyable!

They are cheap and can be purchased at any home improvement store and even at Amazon, like the one below. I've had friends who've forgotten to change their air filters, and they end up with chronic colds and allergies and aren't sure why. Then they change the filters and start to feel much better! I recommend this one - Filtrete MicroAllergen Defense. It's designed to remove pollen, dust, lint, and pet dander. HEPA Air Purifier These little machines are amazing, and the filters only need to be changed twice a year or every 6-8 months! Many people report that their asthma and allergies improve with these running in their homes. They are designed to remove 99.97% of airborne particles and allergens, including: - Pet dander - Dust mites - Pollen - Smoke - Mold - Bacteria I highly recommend [this one](https://amzn.to/2VQTHnv), as it covers a 180-square-foot room and has excellent reviews on Amazon. Lavender, Lemon, and Peppermint Capsules These capsules are the number one thing people on my essential oils team say keeps their allergies at bay! They work for me, too. They are super easy to make. All you need is: - 3 drops [lavender essential oil](https://mymerrymessylife.com/lavendereo) - 3 drops [peppermint essential oil](https://mymerrymessylife.com/pepperminteo) - 3 drops [lemon essential oil](https://mymerrymessylife.com/lemoneo) - Package of [Veggie Capsules](https://amzn.to/2VeRduO) Fill the capsule with the recipe. Take one in the morning and one at night for as long as you need it! A Note About Essential Oils There are a bunch of different brands on the market, and it can be hard to know which ones are better than others. The one brand I've consistently gotten results from and used since 2014 is [Young Living Essential Oils](https://mymerrymessylife.com/starterbundledesertmist). I highly recommend them and can stand behind not only the quality of their products but also their company mission, culture, and vision! I have been to several of their farms in person and have seen first-hand their quality and purity standards hard at work.
