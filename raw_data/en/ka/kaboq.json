While I mostly write about bikes and things related to biking, I'm a scientist, with a background in the evolution of antibiotic resistance and a PhD in Bioinformatics. I've mostly sat on the sidelines through the pandemic, because there are usually other folks with credentials more closely aligned with public health and epidemic tracking publishing really great pieces. This time, I've sat and waited and I've finally decided I needed to write something of my own. As both a researcher and a mother of 3 young children I've been following the progress of the pediatric covid vaccines closely. I was gutted and confused when Pfizer announced that the 2-4yo vaccine had failed to meet the criteria they had set out. This post comes out of what I've learned over the last few weeks as I sought to understand more about what had happened with the very limited information available. If you follow me for bike content I encourage you to read this one anyway in the hopes it will help you feel more confident about what is happening right now with the vaccines for children under 5. If you are just here for the vaccine content, welcome, I hope you find the post useful. Why do we need a vaccine for kids under 5? I thought young kids don't get very sick with COVID! - Children under 5 have [a higher risk of hospitalization from COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7036e2.htm)than children ages 5-11 - They are frequently exposed via daycare and preschool, as well as through siblings attending school - They are not able to participate in other forms of protection like masks and distancing as well as older children - Children under 5 experience long term complications of COVID infection, just as older age groups do. This may take the form of [Long Covid](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html), a suite of ongoing symptoms that follow COVID infection, or in the triggering of other ailments, such as [diabetes](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2788283). Children under 5 have their entire lives ahead of them. It is rare for a child under 5 to die of *anything*. If they develop long term complications of COVID they may carry those with them for the rest of their lives. These are compelling reasons that we need a vaccine for young children. What is happening with the vaccine for kids under 5? I heard it failed! Now the FDA might approve it anyway? What's going on? First, some general information about where we are with vaccine trials for young kids: - Pfizer and Moderna are both testing vaccine for children under 5 currently (those trials began enrolling in late spring/early summer of 2021 and are now at the stage where most participants are weeks to months past dose 2). - These trials are designed to test whether the immune response generated by the vaccine in these age groups is \"non-inferior\" to the response that 16-25 yo adults had to 2 doses of the adult version of the vaccine. This refers to a specific way of assessing the results that we'll talk about below. - They are not designed to test how effective the vaccine is at preventing symptomatic infections, although data are collected to look for symptomatic infections in trial participants and if enough cases occur for a statistical assessment of how protective the vaccine was, that assessment is done. - This happened in the Pfizer 5-11* yo trial, where the vaccine was estimated to be ~90% protective against infections with primarily the Delta variant that was widely circulating at the time. *You'll see these age ranges written as \"5-<12 yo\" in official documentation about the trials because it's the most precise way to define the age groups. I'm going to go with the simpler and slightly less precise version (ex. 5-11 yo) here because it's less messy and means the same thing to most people. Let's talk a bit about three important things you need to know about to understand these trials: Age deescalation, immunobridging, and non-inferiority. Age de-escalation refers to the strategy of testing things in adult age groups first, then moving down through the pediatric age groups. The vaccine or treatment being studied can only be approved for a particular age group if it has already been approved for the groups older than that group (or if approval for the older age groups is being granted at the same time). Thus, the vaccines were tested in those 16 and older (for Pfizer, 18 for Moderna) first, then in teenagers, then in those under 12. The goal is to protect the younger and more vulnerable age groups by making sure things are tested in older and less vulnerable groups first. There are some issues with this, especially in the face of an active pandemic, but that is a discussion for [another place](https://centerforvaccineethicsandpolicy.net/2021/01/17/women-and-children-last-shaking-up-exclusion-criteria-for-vaccine-trials/). It's the framework that was used for these trials and it's important to understand because it explains a lot about why certain decisions were made. The adult trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine enrolled tens of thousands of participants in order to assess safety and efficacy of the vaccines. They measured how well the vaccine performed by looking at both the immune response (primarily by determining the number of neutralizing antibodies produced after receiving the vaccine) and efficacy (by observing how many people in the vaccine and placebo groups caught COVID during the study period. The pediatric clinical trials are structured to evaluate safety and efficacy in a much smaller cohort than the original adult studies. This is both because from a practical standpoint it's much harder to enroll enough children for a study large enough to directly measure efficacy and because the fact that we've already studied the vaccines in adults and learned a lot about how antibody levels and efficacy relate to one another so we know that if we get a lot of antibodies being produced after vaccination it will translate into good protection from infection and severe outcomes, without the need to measure that part directly. The particular way in which the antibody response of the participants in the pediatric trials are compared to the antibody response in adults is through a \"non-inferiority analysis\" and the goal is to show that the immune response in children is equivalent to or better than (not inferior to) the response shown by adults in a previous clinical trial. There are two analyses performed to demonstrate non-inferiority in the pediatric vaccine trials. The first analysis compares the amount of neutralizing antibodies produced in response to the vaccine. A second analysis examines the difference in the seroresponse rate (how many of the participants who got the vaccine produced antibodes) between the pediatric and adult groups. The researchers develop a set of criteria for evaluating non-inferiority as a part of their research plan before beginning their study. The first of these is a decision boundary, a value below the result from the adult group, that the results from the pediatric group must meet or exceed for the results to be considered successful (shown in red in the figure below). If the researchers specified in their research plan that results would be acceptable when the point estimate and the confidence interval (a measure of how uncertain that estimate is) were both completely above that decision boundary, then scenarios A-C in the figure below would pass. A stricter version might require that the point estimate of the pediatric group must be equal to or greater than the point estimate from the adult group AND the confidence interval must be fully above the decision boundary, in which case only scenarios A and B would pass. We'll talk more later on about the specific criteria used for the Pfizer pediatric trials. Now, let's spend a little time talking about side effects of the mRNA vaccines that we've learned about from their use in other age groups. - The most common side effects following mRNA vaccination are things like fever, fatigue, and sore arm. For the adult versions of the vaccine, these side effects are more common than they are following most other vaccines that adults receive such as the flu vaccine. For the lower-dose version given to 5-11 year olds they are much less common, more in line with rates following other childhood vaccines, such as MMRV and DTaP. These side effects are not serious, mostly respond well to OTC medications like Tylenol, and are of short duration (usually 24-48 hours or less). - Last year reports of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, following vaccination of teenage boys and young men with the mRNA vaccines surfaced. These reports were investigated by healthcare regulatory agencies and others in multiple countries all over the world. From those studies we now know a few things about vaccine-induced myocarditis: - First, it is most common in boys and men between the ages of ~15-24, with peak incidence in the 16-18 year old group. Estimates of frequency in this group range from ~1/6000-1/10000 following the second dose of mRNA vaccine. Rates in most studies are slightly higher following vaccination with Moderna than Pfizer, which may mean that a higher dose of mRNA makes myocarditis more likely (the Moderna vaccine used in teens and adults contains 100g of mRNA while the Pfizer vaccine used for teens and adults contains 30g of mRNA). This age and sex bias in who experiences vaccine-induced myocarditis is consistent with the age and sex distribution seen in other forms of myocarditis, such as myocarditis induced by viral infections (including COVID). - Second, vaccine-induced myocarditis is milder than other forms of myocarditis, and appears to be very unlikely to cause long term issues. This is important, because other forms of myocarditis sometimes carry long term health implications. It's still possible this might be true for vaccine-induced myocarditis, but so far the data are reassuring. For a good summary of what we know about vaccine-induced myocarditis in teens check out [this article](https://www.tctmd.com/news/myocarditis-after-covid-vaccination-rare-resolves-quickly-studies-confirm). - When the Pfizer application for EUA of the 5-11 year old 10g vaccine dose was being reviewed, a major concern was that myocarditis would also happen in this population. Because it is such a rare side effect it's essentially impossible to catch it at the clinical trial stage. It's something we must look for after the vaccine is used more widely. The EUA was granted using a risk benefit analysis that found that the vaccines would still be beneficial to 5-11 year olds even if myocarditis occurred at the high end of the rates documented in teens. Following that, side effects have been very closely tracked to watch for incidence of myocarditis in this age group during widespread use. - Many doctors and researchers felt that myocarditis was not likely to happen nearly as often in the 5-11 yo age group as it had in teens, for two primary reasons. First, because the lower dose used in the younger age group should be less likely to trigger side effects of all types, and second, because other forms of myocarditis follow a particular age and sex distribution where they are most common in teenage boys and young men and very rare in children under 12. - The results from the first 3 months of this vaccine being in widespread use in the 5-11 year old age group are extremely reassuring. Only 12 cases of myocarditis were detected in 8.7 million doses of the vaccine administered, a rate of about 1 case in 320,000 children vaccinated. More about this can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-01-05/02-COVID-Su-508.pdf). - The very low rate of myocarditis in 5-11 year olds, combined with the data on how mild vaccine induced myocarditis are very reassuring when evaluating the safety of the mRNA vaccines for younger age groups. - Finally, it's important to know that COVID induces myocarditis [much more often](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/heart-condition-risk-higher-after-covid-19-illness-than-vaccines-uk-study-2021-12-14/)than the mRNA vaccines do. So what's the big picture for safety of the mRNA vaccines? We now have data from vaccinating more than a billion people with the mRNA covid vaccines and the only safety concerns that have emerged are myocarditis in teenage boys and young men, and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) immediately after the shot is administered. We watch people for 15-30 min after their vaccination to watch for anaphylaxis reactions so that they can be treated immediately if they occur, and we know that they occur in [fewer than 1 person out of every 200,000](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776557). This is far more safety data than we typically have for a vaccine that is less than 2 years old and represents an excellent safety record. Now we can get back to talking more specifically about the trials each manufacturer is conducting on vaccines for the youngest children. - In children under age 6, Moderna is testing a dose of 25g (1/4 of their adult dose; g = microgram, 1/1,000,000th of a gram, these are the unit used to measure the amount of mRNA found in each dose of the vaccine). Their trial is divided into two groups: 6-23 months old and 2-5 years old. They are also still running a trial for children age 6-11 years and have not yet gotten approval for their vaccine for teens age 12-17 years despite having applied for EUA for that age group months ago. - Moderna was asked by the FDA to expand the size of their trials for children under 12 last summer after the myocarditis side effect was detected in teens who had received the 30g Pfizer vaccine. - In January 2022 an article reported that one of the Moderna site leads had stated that Moderna was nearing completion of their trial for children under 6 and would submit data within a few weeks. - Shortly after, it was reported that the FDA had asked them to expand their trial by an additional \"few hundred\" participants. No explanation for this expansion has been given and it means a delay of at least 3 months while those additional children are recruited, dosed, and their samples analyzed. - The delay in approval for Moderna's teen vaccine is due to concerns over myocarditis potentially being more common following the Moderna vaccine than the Pfizer one. Moderna is gathering data to help address this, some of which were presented at the most recent ACIP meeting. Hopefully we'll see progress on that EUA soon. - Pfizer is testing a dose of 3g (1/10th of their adult dose) in children under 5, divided into two groups: 6-23 months old and 2-4 years old. This is just under 1/3 of the dose used in the successful trial for the 5-11 year old age group. - As with Moderna, Pfizer was asked to expand their pediatric trials last year due to concerns about myocarditis following vaccination in teens. They have not been asked to add to their trial enrollment since that time. - Initial expectations were that Pfizer would submit for EUA for the 2-4 yo group in late Nov or early Dec, and for 6-23 mo group in January or February. Instead in mid Dec they released a statement saying that a review of their data had found that the immune response in 2-4 yo had failed to reach \"non-inferiority\" when compared to the response of 16-25 yo who received 2 doses of the 30g Pfizer vaccine. They further stated that there were no safety concerns in either 4 yo age group, and that non-inferiority WAS achieved for the 6-23 mo immune response. - No information about the scale of this miss were given. A failure to reach non-inferiority can happen in a variety of ways and both the reference group being used and the decision boundary being used for non-inferiority matter. In this case we know the reference group (16-25 yo adults) but not the decision boundary or the scale by which non-inferiority was missed. - Due to the age de-escalation requirements of the trials these results meant that Pfizer could not apply for EUA for the 6-23 mo age group even though the immune response for that group met non-inferiority. - At that point Pfizer had 3(4ish) options: - First, end the trial. This was pretty much not going to happen but it's worth noting that this is what happens for plenty of vaccines that fail to meet their specified endpoints. - Second, add another dose of the same amount to see if that improved the response enough (as we know it provides a substantial improvement in immune response at other age ranges). This is something they could start doing very shortly after making the decision to do so, and with the same set of trial participants they had already enrolled. This makes it a very fast and convenient option. (An additional option is that they could also have done a 3rd dose with a higher dose version of the vaccine (5g or 10g, for example) but that would have been logistically more challenging and made the vaccines series more complex to administer). - Finally, they could have ended the trial for the 3g dose and restarted with a higher dose (5g or 10g). This would have been both logistically more challenging and slower than adding a dose. They would have needed to recruit an entirely new set of trial participants. Additionally, with the Delta wave having infected many children, and Omicron taking off and infecting many more, it would likely have been much more challenging to recruit trial participants that had not already been infected with COVID than it was previously. However, if the 2-4 yo group had been well below the decision boundary for non-inferiority it's the route we might have expected Pfizer to take. They didn't. - They selected option 2, and moved forward with plans to vaccinate both groups with a 3rd dose of 3g at least 2 months after the second dose. This moved the expected date for submission of data for EUA to ~April and the earliest time we might expect an EUA to be approved to ~May, with rumblings that it could be later. And then something changed. In late January, Dr. Fauci mentioned the potential for approval of the Pfizer vaccine in ~February. Then walked it back cryptically. Then at the end of January it came out publicly that the FDA had asked Pfizer to submit for an EUA for 6mo-4 yo and that they would do so within the next couple of days, with VRBPAC and ACIP meeting taking place later in the month. This made many parents and pediatricians cautiously excited. But it also created a lot of confusion, coming as it did with essentially zero additional information about what had changed. So what did change? We don't know for sure, but but there are two pretty obvious factors: - First, the Omicron wave hit hard, and children under 5 are being hospitalized at much higher rates than most people expected. I live in King County, WA and over the course of the Omicron wave here approximately half of our youth hospitalizations have been in children under 5 even though only 27% of our youth are under 5. Although Omicron may be milder on a population level compared to Delta, it is still causing severe disease for a substantial number of young children and it's becoming increasingly difficult to ignore that they need the protection of a vaccine, even if the vaccine available is not *as* good at protecting them as some future version we might be able to make will be. Theoretical future protection doesn't help kids who are getting infected *right now*. - Second, as a result of the massive wave of infections caused by Omicron Pfizer now has \"real world\" data to assess how many infections the vaccines are preventing in children under 5. My figures are from King County data but the general pattern of dramatically increased infections over the last 6-8 weeks holds true across the US and much of the world. And it means that there have now been quite a few infections among the children in the trials so that Pfizer can directly assess efficacy just as was done in the adult trials. The FDA asked Pfizer to submit for EUA now, rather than when the 3rd dose has been administered to all trial recipients. That submission was made on Feb 1, 2022 and the VRBPAC (the outside expert advisory panel that advises the FDA) meeting where those data will become public knowledge will take place on Feb 15. Now we're going to get into making some educated guesses about what the data Pfizer just submitted to the FDA shows (that we will get to see in a few days, just before VRBPAC meets to discuss it). I want to be clear that this is me making inferences from the pieces of data that we DO have about what I think the data Pfizer presents are most likely to show. This is NOT a guarantee of what those data will show, and there is certainly room for me to be wrong on some of these. I will explain both what I expect it to show and why this is what I expect to see and you can judge whether you think these are reasonable inferences or not. I'm also going to talk about why some of the takes out there about what the data are going to show, especially those suggesting that the vaccine will be ineffective for the 2-4 yo age group, are likely wrong. First inference: We know that the immune response of 2-4 yo to the 3 g dose of the vaccine was not as strong as the immune response of 16-25 yo to the 30g dose of the vaccine. Data about how much they missed that bar by are not yet publicly available but we can make an inference about what we might expect based on other information that we have. First, we know that children 6-23 mo did have an immune response to the 3g dose as strong as the one of 16-25 yo to the 30g dose. And we know that 5-11 yo given 10 g doses also had an immune response as strong as 16-25yo to the 30 g dose. We also know that in the dosing trials the immune response in the few dozen children 2-4 yo given the 3g dose was strong enough that Pfizer felt confident moving forward with that dose for the rest of the trial. Pfizer has many, many flaws. But they are not in the business of wasting money on things they don't think will work and they would not have moved forward with this dose if they hadn't expected it to provide a strong enough response in this age group. This makes it much more likely that the immune response in 2-4 yo is actually fairly close to the immune response of 16-25 yo, but just not quite close enough to meet the non-inferiority criteria. This is much more likely than that the immune response was very low to the point of being unprotective. How far the response was off by is going to be important in whether the expert panels recommend approval of the vaccine. Given that the FDA asked Pfizer to submit for EUA, with some idea of what these data looked like, I suspect the gap between the original success criteria and the results for 2-4 yo is actually not that large. Additionally, since the endpoint analyses called out in the clinical trial research plan are the same for all the pediatric groups being tested (Primary Outcome Measures section, items 9-11) [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04816643](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04816643)), we can look to the 5-11 year old analysis for the criteria being used to assess non-inferiority. In this VRBPAC analysis from last fall, the analysis used the ratio of the geometric means (a type of average) and the confidence interval of the 5-11 year olds mean to determine success. The success criteria here make this a stricter analysis than some non-inferiority trials. The ratio of the means needed to be 1.0 or greater, meaning the 5-11 year olds had to show an equal or higher antibody titer, on average, than the 16-25 cohort to immunobridge. Additionally, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval had to be above 0.67. If we return to our figure from before, the criteria used for these trials say that only A and B would be successes, and I'm inferring that the results from the 2-4 yo age group are very similar to C. Second inference: It's worth taking some time to think about the group that was used for the non-inferiority comparison, other groups we've used COVID vaccines on, and what protection we've seen in those groups. People aged 16-25 yo had the strongest immune response to the 30g Pfizer vaccine of any adult age group. Each successively older age group had a lower immune response. But we know that the vaccines are still very protective, especially against severe outcomes, in adults over the age of 25! My educated guess is that we'll find out the immune response of 2-4 yo is similar to that of 26-35 yo or 36-45 yo, groups that get excellent protection from the Pfizer vaccine. Finally, going back to the land of things we know without the need for me to infer things, the [NYT has reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/health/pfizer-kids-vaccine-omicron.html) from an anonymous source that the real world reduction in infections found in the trials is 50% for 6-23 mo and 57% for 2-4 yo. There isn't a lot of context given for these numbers, but they are most likely to reflect protection against symptomatic infection primarily during the Omicron wave given the timing and design of the study and the sheer number of infections generated in the Omicron wave to date. These numbers initially don't seem very impressive compared to the 95% protection against symptomatic illness that was the top-line result of the original Pfizer vaccine trials in adults. In comparison to the protection that the adult Pfizer vaccine provides against symptomatic illness with Omicron, however, [which is estimated to be ~30-40% at 2-3 months out from the second dose](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1045329/Vaccine_surveillance_report_week_1_2022.pdf), they look quite good. They also make it unlikely that the 3g dose is providing any less protection for 2-4 yo than it is for 6-23 mo. If the data Pfizer has submitted to the FDA support these numbers without excessively wide confidence intervals then they are good evidence for approving this vaccine even before the 3rd dose data are available. Blocking a portion of symptomatic infections is important, but we also want to know if the pediatric Pfizer vaccine protects against severe outcomes like hospitalization, MIS-C, and death. We won't get direct data on this from the current trials, but we can look at the protection that other groups who have received the vaccines have gotten to see what we might expect in terms of the performance of these vaccines against severe outcomes. Here, the picture is very, very good. Studies have shown that teenagers who are vaccinated against COVID are [much less likely to be hospitalized](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2786490) than their unvaccinated peers. They are also [approximately 90%](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7102e1.htm) [less likely](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2787495) to experience MIS-C, a very serious complication that sometimes occurs in the weeks following mild COVID infection in children and leads to ICU stays and sometimes death. Adults who have had two doses of the Pfizer vaccine are similarly [very well protected against severe outcomes](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2115481), [even in the face of Omicron](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2119270). We have every reason to expect this protection to severe outcomes to also be true for the under 5 vaccines, because the intensity of the immune response necessary for protection against severe outcomes is much lower than for protection against severe disease. There are some takes out there that suggest that what is happening right now is that the FDA is pursuing the authorization of a vaccine that is flatly \"not effective\" to serve political ends. The authors of these takes seem convinced that regardless of what the data presented by Pfizer show, the FDA and CDC are going to approve 2 doses of the vaccine on the hope (with no data) that a 3rd dose will fix things and lead to an effective vaccine in the end. IMO this is wrong on many levels. It is at odds with pretty much all of the information we have available so far. Immune responses aren't like light switches. It's not an on/off. They run along a continuum and the evidence we have is that this one is pretty close to the place in the continuum we were looking for. Likely well into the range of protection that most adults have from 2 doses of the adult Pfizer vaccine! It also runs counter to what we can expect from the FDA and CDC and the expert panels that advise them, based on what we've seen from those groups in their vaccine reviews to date. The chances that they will approve a 2 dose series they believe to be ineffective based only on the hope that a 3rd dose will be successful is very low. I do not expect them to approve unless there is solid evidence that the 2 doses will be quite effective on their own while we wait for data on the 3rd dose (and I also expect they will have the chance to see some early 3rd dose data). I don't want to paint the picture that I think the 3g Pfizer vaccine is the perfect vaccine. I don't. I'm annoyed we aren't getting to see the data from the Moderna under 6 yo trials and that there has been no transparency about why they were asked to expand their trial in January. I also strongly suspect that the actual optimal dose for 2-4 yo is a bit higher than 3g. The 3g Pfizer vaccine isn't the perfect vaccine (if it were we wouldn't be having this discussion and it would already have been approved), but it's very likely a VERY GOOD vaccine that will eventually be even better with a 3rd dose, and I'm very confident it is also a VERY SAFE vaccine. It is almost certainly much much better than our children under 5 continuing to be infected with the coronavirus with no vaccine-induced immunity. It has been suggested that if the Pfizer vaccine isn't the perfect vaccine, at least not with only 2 doses, we should just wait. Wait for the 3rd dose data to be available. Wait for the Moderna trial to complete. Wait until we're sure we're giving our kids the best. But waiting has a cost. That cost is being paid in childrens' lives and their well-being. It's an emotional cost being paid by the parents who have to send their children off to daycare and school unprotected, and by those sitting with their hospitalized child. It's a financial cost being paid by families unable to work while their children are sick, and by the parents of hospitalized children who will accrue staggering bills to prevent them from dying. These costs weigh the most heavily on those with the least resources and the most at stake. Some folks may be able to keep their child isolated enough to wait for the very best version of the vaccine. Most families don't have that option. We cannot afford to let the possibility of something better on the horizon get in the way of a good thing we can do much sooner. If the data suggest 2 doses of the 3g Pfizer vaccine is safe and will provide good protection, it should get the EUA and we should start getting doses in arms. My 2.5 year old will be in line as soon as it's available to us. A huge THANK YOU to the many friends who helped me edit and refine this post. Especially to the new friend who helped with writing up the explanations of immunobridging and non-inferiority. The process of making this post was very different from what my bike posts go through, because the consequences if I get something wrong here are so much higher than if I get something wrong in a biking related post. This post is so much better as a result of the help you all have given me. "}
