The Wisconsin Partnership Program expresses its continued gratitude for this gift to benefit the people of Wisconsin. cover photos: A new four-year scholarship program supports the enrollment and retention of racially and ethnically diverse medical students at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health. A COVID-19 Response Grant to the African American Breastfeeding Network for the project \"We Rise\" is helping doulas adapt their practice to better care for Black mothers and babies during the pandemic. The COVID-19 Response grant program provides funding to UW-Madison researchers to support innovative scientific, medical and public health approaches to understand, prevent, treat and lessen the impact of COVID-19. This year the Wisconsin Partnership Program's 2020 Annual Report comes at a time when our country, state and university are responding to the challenges of two unprecedented public health crises - the COVID-19 pandemic and the historic public health crisis of racism . As these challenges emerged, the Wisconsin Partnership Program and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health paid attention and took action . We have responded in rapid and innovative ways through grant programs and partnerships . Our work is far from finished, and we continue to address both problems, in addition to the other healthcare and public health needs of the people of our state . Early in the pandemic, the WIsconsin Partnership Program developed a grant program to help researchers and communities lessen the impact of COVID-19 . Grants were awarded to UW-Madison researchers to develop improved testing, treatments and vaccines, as well as to community organizations that are addressing the pandemic's impact on the health of our state's communities and its most vulnerable populations . Addressing health disparities has been at the core of the Wisconsin Partnership Program's mission since its inception . New grants awarded in 2019 support initiatives to address the impact of systemic racism on the health of Black communities, advance early childhood development for children of color, and improve African American maternal and child health . In addition, a new education grant is providing support for the recruitment of medical students who have been historically underrepresented in medicine . This is a critical time in our nation's history . We know that addressing and eradicating racism will take work and ongoing intentional effort . Like other public health imperatives, this is going to be a marathon, not a sprint, and we are in it for the long game . Lastly, I am pleased to report that in accordance with the Order of the Commissioner of Insurance, the five-year financial and program audits of the Wisconsin Partnership Program were successfully completed by independent accounting firms, Plante Moran and KPMG, respectively . The results of the procedures performed by KPMG were very positive, and no exceptions were noted . Additionally, Plante Moran issued an unqualified opinion on the Statement of Cash Receipts and Disbursements for the period under examination . Both reports provide assurance that the Wisconsin Partnership Program is exercising its stewardship responsibility carefully . Thank you to all our partners across the state for your tireless dedication to improving health and advancing health equity . This work is incredibly important as we strive to attain our vision of healthy lives for all in Wisconsin . Sincerely, Robert N .

Clinical and Translational Research Grants $73.5 M (29%) 2 Wisconsin Partnership Program Annual Report July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020 OVERVIEWOVERVIEW Responding to the Dual Public Health Crises of COVID-19 and Racism This past year brought unprecedented challenges to our state and communities, resulting from the dual public health crises of COVID-19 and racism . The Wisconsin Partnership Program and its grantees have taken steps to address both . COVID-19 Response The Wisconsin Partnership Program developed a swift, flexible and strategic response to the COVID-19 pandemic . Since May 2020, the Wisconsin Partnership Program has funded 24 grants totaling $2 .9 million to UW-Madison researchers and community organizations across Wisconsin . These grants support a broad range of initiatives, including innovative projects to help address the immediate health needs of vulnerable populations in Wisconsin's urban and rural communities, and awards to UW-Madison researchers to support scientific, medical and public health approaches to lessening the impact of COVID-19 In addition, several of our campus partners, including a strategic partnership with the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) has supported an ICTR-WPP COVID-19 Response Grant program, the Neighborhood Health Partnership program and more . The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), the Wisconsin Health Services Fellowship Program, have also mobilized to address COVID-19 . You can learn more about these projects and the Wisconsin Partnership Program's full response to COVID-19 at med.wisc.edu/wisconsin-partnership-program/covid-19/ The Public Health Crisis of Racism The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the health disparities and systemic racism facing many individuals, families and communities in Wisconsin . The virus has disproportionately impacted historically marginalized populations in illness and death rates, as well as through economic impacts, including job loss and food and housing insecurity . The acts of racial injustices that have occurred throughout the country have further amplified the urgent need to address the health impacts of systemic racism . The Wisconsin Partnership Program has a long-standing commitment to eliminating health disparities and advancing health equity . We understand that racism and social connectivity, along with other social determinants, are undeniable factors that influence a person's potential to fully achieve health and well-being . We are committed to supporting work that addresses health disparities caused by social factors, including racism . Like the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize that racism is a public health crisis . Addressing and overcoming it will require steadfast commitment, innovation and application of both scientific and community knowledge to improve health and achieve health equity . The African American Breastfeeding Network is using a COVID-19 Response Grant from the Wisconsin Partnership Program to support doulas serving Black families in Milwaukee, Kenosha and Racine counties. These communities currently have the highest maternal infant mortality rates in the state. Wisconsin Partnership Program Annual Report July 1, 2017-June 30, 2018 3Research: Responding to the Pandemic The Wisconsin Partnership Program quickly mobilized to develop a grant program to help UW-Madison researchers respond to the coronavirus pandemic . \"We recognized that there is a tremendous expertise and knowledge at the SMPH and across campus, including international leaders in viral research and other fields,\" said Richard Moss, PhD, Chair of the Partnership Program's Partnership Education and Research Committee . \"We thought it important to open up funds to build upon existing technologies developed here and apply these to COVID .\"That approach resulted in 12 grants awarded to UW-Madison faculty, including researchers at the School of Medicine and Public Health, College of Engineering, UW-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine, and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences . Cameron Currie, PhD, professor in the UW-Madison College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Department of Bacteriology, is using one of these grants for the project COVID-19 and the Nasal Microbiome: Potential Marker of Disease Outcomes and Novel Antivirals . He and his team, including SMPH investigators Drs . James Gern, David Andes and Nasia Safdar, are studying a community of micro-organisms in the upper airway . The team is searching for nasal-tract microbes that show anti-viral activity and will test their safety in mice . The project, if successful, has the potential to improve the process for developing treatments for viral infections . The study is also analyzing nasal swabs from the UW BioBank of COVID-19 specimens . Dr . Currie and his team will study the data to identify any correlations between features of the biome and severity of illness . Understanding these patterns could help researchers further understand COVID-19 and the different courses it takes .

Wello and its partners, Casa ALBA Melanie - Hispanic Resource Center and four local farmers markets, have created a multifaceted approach to protect access to fresh foods and support the area's farming community . \"Due to the COVID-19 crisis, more of our neighbors have found themselves unemployed and experiencing food insecurity,\" said Natalie Bomstad, Executive Director of Wello . \"Farmers markets are an important part of the food insecurity equation . This project aims to safeguard fresh food access by working collaboratively with our local farmers markets to ensure people can continue to use their FoodShare (EBT) dollars to purchase fresh, nutritious food . This supports families in accessing healthy food in a time of increased need and provides some financial sustainability to our local farmers .\" In addition, the project ensures that the farmers markets remain safe and accessible by providing personal protective equipment for vendors, handwashing stations and signage to promote physical distancing . The region's four farmers markets - Downtown Green Bay, Inc ., OnBroadway, Inc ., Market on Military and Oneida Market - serve a combined total of more than 21,000 people each week . \"The success of this project is built upon the strong partnerships that exist within our community,\" says Bomstad . \"By working together, we've been able to safeguard the nutritional health and well-being of our community's more vulnerable neighbors and contribute to our region's agricultural and economic well-being as well .\" View the full story at med.wisc.edu/wisconsin-partnership-program/meet-our- partners/wello/ Education: Promoting Diversity in Medical Education A new four-year scholarship program established by the Partnership Education and Research Committee will support the enrollment and retention of racially and ethnically diverse medical students at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) . The scholarship will support African American, Latin American, Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian students, who have been historically underrepresented in medicine . Funds will be provided to two or more medical students matriculating at the SMPH for up to $40,000 per year .\"Assuring a diverse physician workforce is a necessary component of the mission of the SMPH to improve the health of the people of Wisconsin through service, scholarship, science and social responsibility,\" said Jonathan Temte, MD, PhD, MS, associate dean for public health and community engagement and principal investigator of this initiative . Dr . Temte is working with the Native American Center for Health Professions (NACHP), the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the SMPH Office of Admissions to identify UW SMPH students from diverse backgrounds, who have financial needs, as potential scholarship recipients . The first two scholarship have been awarded to recipients who identify as Native American and participated in an SMPH pipeline program . A recent study published in the Journal of the National Medical Association concluded that increasing physician diversity in all specialties is essential to improving healthcare for underserved communities . In addition, students from diverse and historically underrepresented backgrounds who become providers may be more likely to practice in underserved areas, and some evidence suggests that racial and ethnic concordance between patients and providers can improve patient satisfaction and outcomes . With this scholarship, the Wisconsin Partnership Program and the UW SMPH are working to create and sustain a physician workforce that reflects and keeps pace with Wisconsin's diverse population, and ultimately improves health outcomes for all Wisconsinites .Photo by Michael P .

To date, the Wisconsin Partnership Program has evaluated these investments and demonstrated their impact through the following indicators: Return on investment through leveraged funding from external funders Dissemination and publication of project findings Documented activities, outcomes and accomplishments of individual grants Outcomes specific to grant programs, such as the career development of new faculty through the New Investigator Grant Program or the promotion of team science through the Collaborative Health Sciences Program . These are published annually in the outcome reports of concluded grants . However, it is more challenging to measure the impact of community-based interventions that may be more qualitative in nature and are designed to influence and achieve long- term systems change . In order to do this successfully, the Wisconsin Partnership Program has enlisted the nationally recognized evaluation firm of Mathematica, in collaboration with UBUNTU Research and Evaluation . This team is developing a rigorous evaluation plan to help the Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) understand the impact of its community grant programs . The Mathematica-UBUNTU team brings experience in rigorous evaluation design, qualitative and quantitative data collection and analytics methods, and community engagement . In addition, UBUNTU brings deep knowledge of health equity and the social determinants of heath in the context of systems change . The firms have worked with funders, universities, government agencies and businesses throughout the country . Their clients include the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Missouri Foundation and WK Kellogg, to name a few . To help the Wisconsin Partnership Program answer the overarching question, \"How are we having an impact on the health, well-being and health equity of the people of Wisconsin?,\" the evaluation plan must answer following questions: 1 . What is the evidence base around the effectiveness of community-driven strategies in addressing health and health equity? 2 . How well are the Partnership Program's community grant strategy and grants aligned to this evidence base? 3 . In what ways can the community grant program better align with effective strategies within the parameters of the Partnership Program? 4 . Based on identified evidence base, what is the community grant program portfolio missing in order to more effectively impact health equity? 5 . What evidence are the community grants generating to demonstrate contributions to improvements in health and health equity at the community level? This new evaluation plan will strengthen the OAC's ability to understand, measure and report the progress and impact of its community grant awards, and in doing so, will help ensure continued transparency in its approach to grantmaking . In addition, answers to the above evaluation questions will inform the Wisconsin Partnership Program's community grant programs to ensure they align with the Partnership Program's goals and mission to improve health and advance health equity in Wisconsin . Grantees have leveraged more than $621 million from funders and organizations outside the UW System to sustain or expand their work Grantees have produced more than 9000 peer-reviewed publications to create and disseminate knowledge.

One of the challenges associated with treating this and other cancers is knowing how individual patients are likely to respond to different drugs . In a project led by Shigeki Miyamoto, PhD, professor, Department of Oncology, researchers developed a suite of new capabilities to quantify patient tumor cell therapy response . This will allow them to determine how cells respond to common therapies and seek more funding to test the predictive capabilities of this approach . In the future, patients could see more effective treatment as a result of this and derivative work . Read the Outcome Report for this project on our Funded Projects webpage . Catalyze System Change Colorectal cancer is Wisconsin's most preventable, yet least prevented cancer, because many patients who fall within screening guidelines are not screened . Fortunately, many lives can be saved if screening rates are improved, because treatment is often successful if colon cancer is found early . Jennifer Weiss, MD, MS, associate professor of gastroenterology, is leading a project to improve screening rates in Wisconsin . The study focuses on understanding and leveraging the strategies of clinics with high screening rates to help improve those with lower screening rates . According to Dr . Weiss, strategies gleaned from successful clinics will help researchers learn how to reduce screening barriers elsewhere . Advance Health Equity A COVID-19 Response Grant to the African American Breastfeeding Network is helping black birth workers (doulas) adapt their practice amid COVID-19 . The project, WeRISE: Black Birth Workers Response to COVID-19, provides supportive measures for doulas and the pregnant women and families they serve, with the goal to promote healthy birth outcomes and prevent the spread of COVID-19 . The project is specifically targeted to doulas and families living in Racine, Kenosha and Milwaukee, in neighborhoods that experience high rates of infant and maternal mortality . The project's team is training more doulas, updating their programming to a digital platform and providing safety precautions against COVID-19, including an emergency kit for new mothers .Build Capacity and Leadership The Wisconsin Partnership Program has established a four-year scholarship to support the enrollment and retention of racially and ethnically diverse medical students at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health . Funds will be provided to two or more medical students matriculating at the SMPH for up to $40,000 per year . The scholarship was established with the goal to increase enrollment at the SMPH from communities that are underrepresented in medicine . By supporting the recruitment and retention of medical students from underrepresented communities in Wisconsin, the scholarship program hopes to help create and sustain a physician workforce that reflects and keeps pace with Wisconsin's diverse population . See page 4 for details .The Wisconsin Partnership Program's investments in research, education and community partnerships focus on four main goals. These goals address what we believe are the critical elements to achieving greater health in Wisconsin. The selected grant highlights below show how we are reaching our goals. Achieving Our Goals : Grant Highlights Wisconsin Partnership Program Annual Report July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020 17 Financial Overview The financial resources that support the Wisconsin Partnership Program grants were provided by the conversion of Blue Cross Blue Shield United of Wisconsin and include funds generated from investment earnings . All funds are in custody of and managed by the Wisconsin Foundation and Alumni Association (WFAA) . Every month, funds are transferred to the SMPH to reimburse expenditures in accordance with the Order of the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the five-year expenditure plans . Investments Current investments consist of participation in the WFAA Callable Pool . The primary investment objective of the Callable Pool is to preserve the capital and provide liquidity when dollars are called . The Callable Pool is invested in high-quality, short-term fixed income securities . Noncurrent investments consist of participation in the WFAA Endowment portfolio . The primary investment objective of the Endowment portfolio is to maximize long-term real returns commensurate with stated risk tolerance, thereby maximizing long-term purchasing power of the funds, net of distributions for current spending needs . Endowment fund distributions to the spendable funds are based on the WFAA spending policy, which is applied to the market value of the endowment funds . WFAA Institutional Advancement Fee The WFAA assesses an Institutional Advancement Fee of 1 percent on all funds participating in its endowment pool, including Wisconsin Partnership Program funds, as a primary source of revenue for WFAA operations . This assessment, and its usage, is determined by the WFAA and is not controlled by the Wisconsin Partnership Program . The Institutional Advancement Fee for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were $3,597,260 and $3,639,740, respectively, and are shown under expenses on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Assets on page 19 . The WFAA decreases the Institutional Advancement Fee to 0 .7 percent on cumulative fund amounts above $250 million per qualified relationship . Partnership Program funds exceed the established level, and savings from this fee reduction are fully allocated to the Oversight and Advisory Committee for public health initiatives . These savings were $329,178 and $341,922 for fiscal years ending June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively . Grants Payable Grants payable amounts are recorded as of the date of approval by the Oversight and Advisory committee or Partnership Education and Research Committee . The liability reflects the total amount of the grant award, less any payments made on or before June 30, 2020 . Any subsequent modifications to grant awards are recorded as adjustments of grant expenses in the year the adjustment occurs . Net Assets Temporarily Restricted: Funds consist of interest and investment income earned by the funds invested in the callable or endowment portfolios at the Foundation and the cumulative net gains or losses related to the permanently restricted funds that are invested within the endowment portfolio . These funds are available to support program expenditures . Permanently Restricted: The portion of the gift proceeds originally allocated to permanently endow the Wisconsin Partnership Program . These funds have been invested in the endowment portfolio of the Foundation and the corpus is not available to support program expenditures . OAC Review and Assessment of the Allocated Percentage of Funds As outlined in its founding documents, the Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) annually reviews and assesses the allocation percentage for public health initiatives and for education and research initiatives . The OAC took up this matter on October 15, 2020 . It was moved to retain the allocation of 35 percent for public health initiatives and 65 percent for education and research initiatives, and the motion was unanimously passed . Distribution from Wisconsin United for Health Foundation In October 2018, the Wisconsin United for Health Foundation, Inc . passed a resolution to initiate a process to dissolve given that it had fulfilled its obligations as specified in the Commissioner of Insurance Order and the Agreement Between the Wisconsin United for Health Foundation, Inc ., the UW Foundation, and the UW System Board of Regents . In August 2019, half of the remaining assets held by the Wisconsin United for Health Foundation, Inc ., $1,788,525, were distributed to the WFAA (UW Foundation) and added to Wisconsin Partnership Program endowment . The other half of the funds went to the Medical College of Wisconsin . Supplanting Policy Based on the non-supplanting determination made by the Senior Associate Dean for Finance, the Dean of the School of Medicine and Public Health has attested to compliance with the supplanting prohibition in this Annual Report . The UW-Madison Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration also has attested that UW-Madison and the UW System have complied with the supplanting prohibition . Financial Statements The following financial reports consolidate activities of the Wisconsin Foundation and Alumni Association and the School of Medicine and Public Health for the fiscal year ending June 2020 and June 2019 . The fiscal year 2019 financial statements have been restated to correct grant expenditure amounts that reflected cash basis expenditures versus total awards made during the year . The correction increased FY19 grant expenses on the Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Assets by $5,706,410 . The net asset amount in the Statement of Net Assets was unchanged . 18 Wisconsin Partnership Program Annual Report July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020 FINANCIAL OVERVIEWStatement of Net Assets June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 Assets UW SMPH Cash $ (1,545,561) OAC $ 21,534,527 Payable 22,160,043 19,323,377 Temporarily Restricted Permanently Restricted 283,616,267 281,827,742 Total Net Assets 326,910,859 348,144,927 Total Liabilities and Net Assets $ 370,605,429 $ 383,362,761 Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Assets Year ended June 30, 2020Year ended June 30, 2019 Revenues Gifts Received $ 1,788,525 $ - Interest Income 166,932 174,218 Change in Fair Value of Endowed Funds 3,527,932 16,419,850 Total Revenues 5,483,389 16,594,068 Expenses WFAA in Net Assets (9,842,000) Net Assets - Beginning of year 348,144,927 357,986,927 Net Assets - End of year $ 326,910,859 $ 348,144,927 Wisconsin Partnership Program Annual Report July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020 19 Grant Award Commitments for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 Net Grant Awards(1)Inception to date DisbursementsOutstanding Grant Commitments Public Health Initiatives Grants awarded from Inception to FY2019 $ 76,797,872 $ 21,534,527 Medical Education and Research Initiatives Grants awarded from Inception to FY2019 $ 147,094,491 247,114,813 $ 203,420,243 $ 43,694,570 (1) Reflects grants awarded less any lapsed awards returned to the Wisconsin Partnership Program Statement of Cash Receipts and Disbursements (UW School of Medicine and Public Health) FY2020 FY2019 Balance, July 1 $ (2,726,107) $ (1,655,073) Cash Receipts Payments received from the UW Foundation 16,153,185 16,991,878 Total Receipts 16,153,185 16,991,878 Cash Disbursements 5,369,210 5,286,318 Education Research Initiatives 11,691,869 670,114 Contracts Other 18,062,912 (1,071,034) Balance, June 30 (1,545,561) (2,726,107) 20 Wisconsin Partnership Program Annual Report July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020 Policies and Procedures The Wisconsin Partnership Program, and its Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) and Partnership Education and Research Committee (PERC) conduct their operations, grantmaking processes and stewardship responsibility in accordance with program requirements, the Insurance Commissioner's Order and Grant Agreement, as well as federal, state and local laws .
