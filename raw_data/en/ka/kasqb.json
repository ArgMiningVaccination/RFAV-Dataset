Through the Divine Spirit you were able to bring the Healing Qualities into my being and cancer to remove the images, fears, housed within the tumor. I was able to learn the wisdom behind why the tumor had returned and was able to make life changes and increase Divine proximity to the Divine Healing Energy to create health. Today I am cured of the tumor. I am so grateful for your support and inspiration having made new positive changes in my life with my family and children. I have opened to more love and positivity, and realized that my life is precious and valuable. I still can't believe how amazing and powerful a journey this has been.
