By People of the State of Washington.Background: Overview of Firearms Laws . Both federal and state law regulate the poss ession and transfer of fire- arms. Firearms dealers (dealers) are required to have li-censes in order to sell firearms. Under state law, a dealerincludes anyone engaged in the business of selling fire-arms who has or is required to have a federal dealer's li-cense. A person is not require d to have a dealer's license if the person makes only occasional sales, exchanges, orpurchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personalcollection or for a hobby, or sells all or part of his or herpersonal collection of firearms. Federal and state law prohibit certain persons from possessing firearms, including persons convicted of felo- nies and certain misdemeanor domestic violence offenses,minors, and persons who have been involuntarily commit-ted for mental health treatment. Dealers must comply with both federal and state back ground check requirements be- fore transferring firearms to persons who do not have a federal firearms license (unlic ensed persons). Neither fed- eral nor state law requires background checks for firearms transfers by unlicensed persons. However, it is a class Cfelony for a person to transfer a firearm to another personwhom the transferor has reas onable cause to believe is in- eligible to possess a firearm. Federal Background Check Requirements. Under the federal Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a dealermust, with few exceptions, conduct a background checkfor all firearm sales or transfers to unlicensed persons todetermine whether the purchas er is prohibited from pos- sessing a firearm. This background check is conductedthrough the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). A NICS check typically re turns an immediate re- sponse. However, if the NICS system response is delayed, the dealer may deliver the firearm to the purchaser threebusiness days after initiating the NICS check if the dealer has not received a notification from NICS that the purchas-er is ineligible to possess a firearm. With some exceptions, it is unlawful to transfer a fire- arm to an unlicensed person who resides in a differentstate than the transferor. On e exception allows dealers to transfer rifles and shotguns to a person who is not a resi-dent of the state in which the de aler is located if the transfer complies with all legal requirements applicable in bothstates. State Background Check Requirements. The firearms chapter requires a dealer to conduct a background check for the sale or transfer of a pistol, but not for the sale ortransfer of a rifle or shotg un. A purchaser must fill out an application containing specifie d information relating to the purchaser and the pistol being purchased. The dealer con-tacts the local sheriff or police department to conduct the NICS check and a state background check for all pistolsales or transfers where the purchaser does not have a validconcealed pistol license (CPL). If the purchaser has a validCPL, the dealer will conduct any required NICS check,and the local law enforcement agency will conduct the re-quired state background check. The state background check includes a check of the Washington State Patrol databases, the Department of Li-censing (DOL) firearms database, and state and local men-tal health agencies. A dealer may not deliver a pi stol to a prospective pur- chaser until one of the following occurs: the purchaser produces a valid CPL; the dealer is notified by the chief of police or sheriff that the purchaser is eligible to possess the firearm and the application is approved; or five business days have elapsed since the application was received by the law enforcement agency (up to 60 days if the person does not have a Washington driver's license or identification card or has not resided in the state for the previous 90 days). A dealer must deliver the pistol to the purchaser fol- lowing the specified time pe riods unless the law enforce- ment agency has notified the dealer of an investigativehold. A record of the pistol transfer must be retained by the dealer for six years, a copy of which must be submitted to the DOL, which maintains this information in its fire-arms database. Non-residents may purchase rifles and shotguns in Washington, and Washington residents may purchase ri-fles and shotguns in another state, as long as the transac-tion complies with federa l law and the purchaser is eligible to purchase or possess the firearm under the lawsof Washington and the other state. Other Provisions. The DOL Firearms Unit maintains the state firearms database, which includes records of pis-tol transfers. In addition, the DOL Firearms Unit providesforms, information, and traini ng to law enforcement agen- cies, firearms dealers, and the public relating to state fire- arms licensing requirements and regulations. The state retail sales and use tax generally applies to the sale of firearms. There is a sales tax exemption for ca-sual and isolated sales by sellers who are not engaged inbusiness. A firearm sale by a private individual wouldthus not be subject to the sal es tax, but the transaction would be subject to the state u se tax. In addition, a fire- arms dealer who facilitates the sale of a firearm is requiredto collect use tax from the buyer. Summary: Background Check Requirements . All fire- arms sales or transfers are subject to background checksunless specifically exempted by federal or state law. Thisrequirement applies to all sales or transfers in whole or inpart in Washington, includi ng sales and transfers through a dealer, at gun shows, online, and between unlicensed per- sons. \"Transfer\" means the in tended delivery of a firearmI 594 2to another person without consideration of payment or promise of payment, including gifts and loans. Any sale or transfer of a firearm where neither party is a dealer must be completed through a dealer according tothe following requirements: The seller or transferor must deliver the firearm to the dealer. The seller or transferor may remove the fire-arm from the dealer's premises while the background check is being conducted, but the firearm must be returned to the dealer prio r to completing the transac- tion. The purchaser or transferee must complete and sign all federal, state, and local forms needed for process-ing the background check. The dealer must process the transaction by complying with all federal and state laws that would apply if the dealer were selling or transferring the firearm from the dealer's inventory. If the purchaser or transferee is ineligible to possess a firearm, the dealer must return the firearm to the seller or transferor. The dealer may charge a fee for facilitating a sale or transfer that reflects the fair market value of the adminis-trative costs incurred. A dealer may not deliver a firearm to a purchaser or transferee, except as otherwise authorized, until the earlierof: the completion of all required background checks if the purchaser or transferee is not ineligible under federal or state law to possess a firearm; or ten business days have passed since the dealer requested the background check, except this period is 60 days for a pistol transfer if the purchaser or trans- feree does not have a va lid Washington driver's license or identification card or has not been a resi- dent for the previous 90 days. Exemptions . The following are ex empt from the back- ground check requirements established in the initiative: gifts between family members; sales or transfers of antique firearms; sales or transfers by or to law enforcement and correc- tions agencies, and if in connection with official duties, law enforcement and corrections officers, mili-tary members, and federal officials; receipt of a firearm by a gunsmith for service or repair, or return of the firearm to its owner; temporary transfers where the transfer: is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to the transfer ee, if the transfer lasts only as long as needed and the transferee is not prohibited from possessing firearms; is between spouses or domestic partners; occurs at an establis hed shooting range autho- rized by the local governing body and the firearm is kept at all times at the range; occurs at a lawful organized firearm competition or performance and the firearm is possessed exclusively at the competition or performance; is to a person under 18 years of age for lawful hunting, sporting, or educational purposes while under direct supervision of a responsible adult; or occurs while legally hunting if the transferee has completed all required training, holds all required licenses or permits, and is not prohibited from possessing a firearm; acquisition of a firearm, other than a pistol, by inheri- tance; or acquisition of a pistol by inheritance within the preceding 60 days, after which time the person must either transfer the pi stol or notify the DOL that the person is retaining the pistol. Pistol Deliveries by Dealers . The period after which a pistol may be delivered even if the background check has not been completed is changed to 10 days. The require- ment that a pistol be secu rely wrapped and unloaded when delivered is eliminated. Penalties . A person who knowingly violates the back- ground check requirements established in the initiative isguilty of a gross misdemeanor for a first offense, and aclass C felony for each subseq uent offense. Each firearm sold or transferred in viola tion of the initiative's back- ground check requirements is a separate offense. A classC felony conviction for this offense is included in the defi-nition of \"serious offense\" for purposes of the crime of un-lawful possession of a firearm. Other Provisions . A resident of Washington who pur- chases a rifle or shotgun in an other state is subject to the background check requirements of the initiative if any partof the transaction occurs in Washington, including onlinesales. A resident of another state who purchases a rifle orshotgun in Washington is subjec t to the state's procedures and background check requirements. The DOL is given authority to adopt rules to imple- ment the initiative. The DOL must report any violation ofthe firearms chapter by a dealer to the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco, Firearms & Explos ives. In addition, the DOL may, after notice and a hearing, revoke the license of anydealer who violates the firearms chapter. The retail sales tax does not apply to the sale or trans- fer of a firearm between two unlicensed persons if theyhave complied with all required background checks. Adealer who facilitates the sale or transfer of a firearm be- tween unlicensed persons is not obligated to collect a usetax on the transaction. Effective: December 4, 2014I 1351 3I 1351 C 2 L 15 Concerning K-12 education. By People of the State of Washington.Background: In 2009, Engrossed Substitute House Bill 2261 (ESHB 2261) revised the definition of the state pro- gram of Basic Education and established new methods fordistributing state funds to sc hool districts to support this program. The new \"prototypical school\" funding formula was based on allocations for assumed class sizes and the administrative, classified, and instructional staff of varioustypes assumed to be needed in a prototypical elementary,middle, and high school of a pa rticular size. The formula also includes funding assumptions about nonstaff costs,district-wide support, central administration, and specialprograms. The 2009 legislation described the structuralcomponents of the new formula, but did not provide nu-meric values for the various formula elements. In 2010, Substitute House Bill 2776 (SHB 2776) placed into statute numeric values for the formula that were intended to represent, as closely as possible, a trans- lation of the 2009-2010 budgeted levels of state fundingfor Basic Education. These \"baseline\" values were devel-oped by the Funding Formula Technical Working Groupestablished in ESHB 2261. Substitute House Bill 2776 also added four enhance- ments to the program: (1) reduction to 17 students perteacher of the average class size for grades kindergartenthrough 3 by the 2017-18 school year, beginning withschools where more than 50 pe rcent of students were eli- gible for free and reduced-price meals in the prior schoolyear (high poverty schools) ; (2) continued phase-in of funding for full-day kindergarten until statewide imple-mentation is achieved in the 2017-18 school year; (3) in-creased funding for materials, supplies and operatingcosts to a specified value ad justed for inflation by the 2015-16 school year; and (4) full implementation of thenew pupil transportation funding formula by the 2013-2015 biennium. The enhancem ent values enacted by the legislature were based, in s ubstantial part, on recommen- dations from the Quality Education Council's (QEC) Jan-uary 2010 report to the Legislature. In addition, the QEC's January 2010 report contained recommendations and provisio nal discussion values that were not enacted by the Legislature. The provisional dis-cussion values included values for increased staffing lev-els in grades 4 through 12. Summary: Initiative 1351 may be known and cited as the Lower Class Sizes for a Quality Education Act. Findings and Intent . Findings are made regarding the benefits of reducing class siz es. The initiative's purpose is to address the Washington Supreme Court's decision inMcCleary v. the State of Washington by reducing class siz- es and increasing staff ratios.Minimum Allocations for Class Size . The statutory prototypical school funding formula is changed effectiveSeptember 1, 2018. The class sizes for grades 4 through12 reflect the provisional discussion values included in theQEC's 2010 report. Numeric values for average class size, which form the basis of allocations for classroom teachers in the fundingformula, are changed as follows: Additionally, allocations for average class size in high poverty schools are specified in statute. The following ta- ble compares the class size for high poverty schools pro-vided for in the omnibus appropriations act for school year2014-15 with the Initiative1351 class size for high poverty schools. Funding for the specified average class size is provid- ed only to the extent of, and proportionate to, the schoolTable 1: Grade Level Current Statutory Class SizeI-1351 Class Size Grades K-3 25.23/17.001 1. The 2010 legislation also specified that between the 2011- 2012 and 2017-2018 school years the general education aver-age class size for grades kindergarten through 3 must be reduced to 17.0, beginning with schools with the highest per- centage of free and reduced-price meals in the prior school year (SHB Educa- tion26.57 19.00 Skill Centers 22.76 16.00 Table 2: Grade Level Omnibus Appropri- ations Act Class Size for High Pov- erty Schools for School Year 2014- 15I-1351 Class Size for High Poverty Schools average class size, up to the funded level. School district s that demonstrate capital fa- cility needs that prevent them from reducing actual classsize to funded levels may use funding provided for mini-mum class size allocations fo r school-based personnel who provide direct services to students, but must annually re-port this expenditure by school and grade level. The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction must adopt rules to im plement these provisions. Minimum Allocations for Building-Level Staff . The statutory full-time equivalent (FTE) staff allocations for each level of prototypical school are increased to the fol- lowing: Table 3: Staff Type Elementary School Building- Level Staff Allocation (FTEs) (400 students) Current AllocationI-1351 Allocation Principals, Building Administrators1.253 1.30 Teacher Librarians 0.663 1.0 School Nurses 0.076 0.585 School Social Workers0.042 0.311 School Psychologists 0.017 0.104 Guidance Counselors 0.493 0.50 Teaching Assistance 0.936 2.0 Office Support, Non- instructional Aides2.012 3.0 Custodians 1.657 1.7 Student and Staff Safety0.079 0.0 Parent Involvement Coordinators 0.0/0.08251 1.01. The 2013 Omnibus Appropriations Act (Chapter 4, Laws of 2013 (Third Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5034)) included enhancements to the minimum building level staff allocations for gu idance counselors and parent involvement coordinators. Funding was provided for a minimum allocation of 0.0825 FTE parent involvement coordinators for the prototypical elementary school and a minimum allocation of 1.216 FTE and 2.009 FTE guidance counselors for the prototypical middle and high schools, respectively.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2017 HB 1004 C 59 L 15 Clarifying provisions that allow for the tasting of alcohol by students under twenty-one years of age. By Representatives Springer, Manweller, Moeller, Walsh, Blake, Buys, Reykdal, Wilcox , Condotta, Fey, Gregerson and Sawyer. House Committee on Commerce & Gaming Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: The Liquor Control Board (LCB) may is- sue a special permit to a co mmunity or technical college allowing certain students to lawfully taste alcohol provid-ed they are at least 18 years old, yet still under age 21, and enrolled in a class that is part of a culinary, wine technol- ogy, beer technology, or sp irituous technology-related de- gree program. The issuance of the permit requires that the following criteria be met: the permit applicant must be a qualifying community or technical college student; the alcohol is tasted bu t not consumed by the student; the tasting of the alcoho l is for the purpose of educa- tional training as part of the class curriculum and is approved by the educational provider; the service and tasting of alcoholic beverages is supervised by a faculty or staff member who is 21 years of age or older and who possesses the requisite alcohol servers permit issued by the LCB; and an enrolled student permitted to taste an alcoholic beverage may not purchase the alcoholic beverage. The LCB must waive any permit fees that might oth- erwise be applicable. Viticulture and enology are the two disciplines of wine production. Viticulture is the science, production, and study of grapes and their culture. Enology is the scienceand study of all aspects of wine and winemaking exceptvine-growing and grape-harvestin g. Viticulture and enol- ogy degree programs generally offer students the opportu-nity to study and research wine-grape growing andwinemaking. The term \"somme lier\" is generally used to describe a restaurant employ ee who has extensive knowl- edge regarding wines and who orders and maintains thewines sold in the restaurant. Summary: The range of educational institutions that may receive the special permit from the LCB allowing the tast-ing of alcohol by underage students enrolled in specifiedculinary or alcoholic beverage technology classes is ex-panded to include regional and state universities. In addi- tion, the types of degree prog rams eligible for the special alcohol tasting permit is expa nded to include sommelier, wine business, enology, and viticulture degree programs. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1010 C 10 L 15 Concerning referral of medical cases to occupational ther- apists. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by and Buys). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health Care Background: An occupational therap ist is a person li- censed by the Board of Occupational Therapy Practice topractice occupational therapy. \"Occupational therapy\" is the scientifically based use of purposeful activity that maximizes independence, prev ents disability, and main- tains the health of individuals who are limited by physicalinjury or illness, psychosocia l dysfunction, developmentalHouse 97 0 Senate 45 0 House 94 4 Senate 38 6HB 1011 7or learning disabilities, or th e aging process. It includes evaluation, treatment, and cons ultation. Examples of the practice of occupational therapy include: using specifically desi gned activities and exercises to enhance neurodevelopment al, cognitive, perceptual motor, sensory integrative, and psychomotor func- tioning; administering and interp reting tests such as manual muscle and sensory integration; teaching daily living skills; developing pre-vocational skills and play and avoca- tional activities; designing, fabricating, or applying selected orthotic and prosthetic devices or selected adaptive equip- ment; adapting environments for persons with disabilities; and wound care management. An occupational therapist may treat a medical case only upon referral of a phys ician, osteopathic physician, podiatric physician and surgeon, naturopath, chiropractor,physician assistant, psychologist, or advanced registerednurse practitioner. If an occupational therapist evaluates apatient and finds that the patient's case is medical, he orshe must refer the case to a physician for appropriate med- ical direction if direction is lacking. A case is not a medi-cal case if there is an absence of pathology or if apathology has stabiliz ed and the occupational therapist is only treating the client 's functional deficits. Summary: An occupational therapist may treat a medical case upon referral of an optometrist. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1011 C 11 L 15 Assigning counties to two climate zones for purposes of the state building code. By Representatives Short, Takko, Springer, Buys, Kretz, Shea, Gregerson and Condotta. House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: The State Building Code . The State Build- ing Code (SBC) provides statewide minimum perfor-mance standards and requirements for construction andconstruction materials, consistent with accepted standardsof engineering, fire, and life safety. The SBC is comprisedof model codes, including build ing, residential, fire, and plumbing codes, adopted by re ference in statute, as well as rules developed and adopted by the State Building CodeCouncil (Council). The Counci l is responsible for adopt- ing, amending, and maintaining as appropriate the modelcodes adopted by reference. The Council reviews updatededitions of model codes on a three-year cycle. The Washington State Energy Code . The Council is charged with adopting rules to be known as the Washing- ton State Energy Code (WSEC), as part of the SBC. TheWSEC for residential buildin gs is the maximum and min- imum energy code for residential construction in eachcounty, city, and town, while the WSEC for commercial or nonresidential buildings is the minimum energy code forcommercial construction. The WSEC must take into account regional climatic conditions. Statute assigns each of Washington's 39 coun-ties to one of two climate zones: climate zone 1 or climatezone 2. The following counti es are assigned by statute to climate zone 2: Adams, Chelan, Douglas, Ferry, Grant,Kittitas, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Ste- vens, and Whitman counties. All other counties are as-signed to climate zone 1. Effective July 1, 2013, th e Council adopted the 2012 edition of the Internationa l Energy Conservation Code (IECC) with amendments as the energy code for residen-tial and commercial buildings in Washington. The 2012 International Energy Conservation Code . The International Energy Co nservation Code (IECC) is a model code developed and pub lished by the International Code Council, Inc. The IE CC regulates the design and construction of buildings for the effective use and conser- vation of energy over the useful life of each building. Neweditions of the IECC are developed and published on athree-year cycle. The 2012 IECC model code divides the United States into eight climate zones (1 through 8, with sub-designa- tions A, B, and C). Climate zone assignments are used todetermine whether different IECC requirements are appli- cable within a specific jurisdiction or region. Under the2012 IECC model code, Washington is divided amongthree climate zones: 4C, 5B, and 6B. In general, countieslocated west of the Cascade Mountain Range are assignedto zone 4C, and counties lo cated east of the Cascade Mountain Range, with the ex ception of four counties, are assigned to zone 5B. Four counties, Ferry, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, and Stevens, are assigned to zone 6B. In adopting the 2012 IECC as Washington's energy code for residential and commercial buildings, the Councilamended the model code's climate zone assignments. In-stead of assigning Washington counties to three climate zones, the Council adopted rules assigning each county toone of two zones. The following counties are assigned byrule to climate zone 5B: Ad ams, Asotin, Benton, Chelan, Columbia, Douglas, Ferry, Franklin, Klickitat, Walla Walla, Whitman, andYakima. All other counties in Washington are assigned by rule to zone 4C.House 96 0 Senate 49 0HB 1013 8Summary: The State Building Code Act specifies that the state's climate zones for bu ilding purposes are designated in statute. The assignment of a county to a climate zonemay not be changed by adoption of a model code or rule. The state's climate zones, as designated in statute, are modified in several ways. Fi rst, the two climate zones are no longer numbered or identif ied as \"climate zone 1\" and \"climate zone 2.\" The two zones are instead distinguishedby specifying that one zone is comprised of specific coun- ties, while the other zone is comprised of all other coun- ties. Second, the statutory climate zone assignments of nine counties are changed. The following counties areadded to the zone with specif ically listed counties (former- ly, climate zone Walla, and Yakima. Finally, statute provides that the Council is not prohib- ited from adopting the same rules or standards for each cli-mate zone.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1013 C 179 L 15 Authorizing regular meetings of county legislative author- ities to be held at alternat e locations with in the county. By Representatives Appleton , Johnson, Hansen, Takko, Gregerson and Fey. House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: Washington counties provide regional ser- vices to all residents within their jurisdiction, including administering elections and furnishing judicial services,and a broader array of services to residents in unincorpo-rated areas. County legislative authorities must hold regular meet- ings at the county seat to transact any business required orpermitted by law. Although th e term \"regular meeting\" is not defined in statutory provisions governing counties, theMunicipal Research and Services Center defines \"regularmeeting\" as one that is held according to a schedule adopt- ed by the applicable pu blic governing body. The location requirements for special meetings are less restrictive and authorize county legislative authorities to hold special meetings (mee tings that are not held ac- cording to an adopted schedule) at any location within the county if the agenda item or it ems are of unique interest or concern to the citizens of the area in the county in which the special meeting is to be held. Summary: County legislative authorities may hold regu- lar meetings at alternate lo cations outside of the countyseat, but within the county, if the legislative authority de- termines that holding a mee ting at an alternate location would be in the interest of supporting greater citizen en- gagement in local government. This alternate location op-tion may be exercised once per calendar quarter. At least 30 days before ho lding a regular meeting out- side of the county seat, the county legislative authoritymust give notice of the meetin g. At a minimum, the notice must be: (1) posted on the county's website; (2) publishedin a newspaper of general circulation in the county; and (3)sent via electronic mail (e-mail) to residents of the county who have chosen to re ceive notice by e-mail. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1021 C 2 L 15 E 1 Creating a silver alert system. By House Committee on Public Safety (originally spon- sored by Representatives Appleton, Orwall, Robinson,Bergquist, Cody, Hudgins, Senn, Santos and Fey). House Committee on Public Safety Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: The America's Missing Broadcast Emer- gency Response (AMBER) Alert system is a system inwhich broadcasters, cable systems, and law enforcementagencies voluntarily cooperate to assist in finding abduct- ed children. The Washington State Patrol (WSP) is the lead agency for the AMBER Al ert plan in Washington. An AMBER Alert may be activated directly by a local law en-forcement agency that has ei ther an approved local AM- BER Alert plan or a mutual aid agreement with an agencythat has an approved plan or directly by the WSP if the lo- cal law enforcement agency does not have an approvedplan. Once the WSP receives notification of an AMBER Alert, the WSP then notifies the Washington State Emer- gency Management Division, which issues an alert to ra-dio and television media through the Emergency AlertSystem (EAS). Upon receiv ing the necessary information, radio and television media th en broadcast the information about the abduction provided through the EAS. This in- formation typically includes a picture or description of the missing child, details of the ab duction, the name and a pic- ture or description of the su spected abductor, and informa- tion about the vehicle used by the abductor. The WSP alsonotifies the Department of Transportation (DOT) of theAMBER Alert, and the DOT places the information onhighway traffic signs (electronic reader boards).House 98 0 Senate 46 0House 80 17 Senate 45 0 (Senate amended)House 80 16 (House concurred)SHB 1043 9An AMBER Alert may only be initiated in abduction cases that meet criteria specified in the AMBER Alertplan. The main criteria are: the child is under the age of 18 years and is known to be abducted (not a runaway); the child is believed to be in danger of death or seri- ous bodily injury; and there is enough descrip tive information available to believe that an AMBER Alert activation will assist in recovery of the child.An approved plan must meet the criteria of the WSP's statewide AMBER Alert plan, and specify local law en-forcement agency procedures to investigate a child abduc-tion case, approve AMBER Alert activations, coordinatecommunity response, and direct the recovery of a child. The Department of Justice AMBER Alert Coordinator andthe National Center for Miss ing and Exploited Children have provided guidelines fo r the states when establishing criteria for issuing an alert. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) governs the national broadcasting of Amber Alert notifications. Some states have also started local Silver Alert pro- grams for adults with cognit ive impairments who are lost. Silver Alerts are designed to alert the public and law en- forcement agencies in helpin g to look for and identify missing adults. These programs often are targeted foradults with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or other cogni-tive impairments. A Silver Alert is not approved and maynot be broadcast in the same fashion as an AMBER Alert. The WSP is responsible for operating a Missing Chil- dren and Endangered Person (MCEP) Clearinghouse. TheMCEP Clearinghouse plan involves the voluntary cooper-ation between local, state, tribal, and other law enforce- ment agencies, state govern ment agencies, radio and television stations, and cable and satellite systems to en- hance the public's ability to assist in recovering endan- gered missing persons who do not qualify for inclusion inan AMBER Alert. In an instance where a missing person does not qualify for an alert under the AMBER Alert system, an Endan-gered Missing Person Advisory (EMPA) alert may be ac-tiviated. An EMPA is initiated by law enforcementagencies using the following criteria: a person is missing under unexplained, involuntary, or suspicious circumstances; the person is believed to be in danger because of age, health, or mental or physical disability, in combina-tion with environmental or weather conditions, or is believed to be unable to re turn to safety without assis- tance; there is enough descrip tive information that could assist in the safe recovery of the missing person; and the incident has been re ported to and investigated by a law enforcement agency.Once a report is received regarding an endangered missing person and all criteria are met, the investigating agency may begin to initiate an EMPA alert through itscentral-computerized enforcement system, notify theWSP's Missing Person Unit, an d enter all information into the National Crime Information Center and the Washing-ton Crime Information Center. After an EMPA is activat- ed, all Washington law enforc ement agencies are notified, as well as all portal partners (such as broadcasters, the me-dia, and other subscribers). School districts, the Depart- ment of Social and Health Services, and the general publicare also notified through a media release. A missing endangered person is defined as a person with a developmental disability or a vulnerable adult, be- lieved to be in danger because of age, health, or mental orphysical disability, in combin ation with environmental or weather conditions, or is belie ved to be unable to return safely without assistance. Summary: An EMPA must include a Silver Alert desig- nation that will be used on variable message signs and textof highway advisory radio messages to assist in the recov-ery of a missing endangered person age 60 or older. The definition for a missing endang ered person is expanded to include a person who has been diagnosed as having Alz-heimer's or dementia. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 27, 2015 SHB 1043 C 13 L 15 Concerning self-service storage facilities. By House Committee on Busi ness & Financial Services (originally sponsored by Representatives Ryu and Parker). House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: Self-storage facilities, in which a building or property owner rents space to a person for storage ofgoods, are governed by Washington law. Renters, knownas \"occupants,\" are obligated to pay rent for the space, usu- ally monthly. When renting a space, the occupant must begiven an opportunity to provide the address of another per-son to whom lien and sale notices may be sent. Liens for Unpaid Rent . When rent or other charges are unpaid for 14 days, the storage facility owner has the right to terminate the rental or l ease agreement and place a lien on the personal property stored in the unit. The ownermust notify the renter in writing with a \"preliminary liennotice,\" by first-class mail, of the amount du e and that a lien may be placed on the stored property if the amountHouse 95 3 House 88 4 Senate 43 0SHB 1045 10due remains unpaid for another 14 days or more. The pre- liminary lien notice must be sent to both the occupant'sprimary mailing address and sp ecified alternative address, if any. If, after a date specified in the preliminary lien notice, the outstanding balance is not paid, the owner must notifythe renter, by certified mail, th at the stored property, other than personal papers and eff ects, will be sold or disposed of on a date at least 14 days later, but not less than 42 daysafter the date rent was first p ast due. This notice is called a \"notice of final lien sale\" or \"final notice of disposition.\" Boats and Motor Vehicles . In addition to other per- sonal property, occupants may store motor vehicles andboats at a self-storage facility. If the occupant defaults onrent for storage of such vehicles, the storage facility ownermay still take a lien, but the lien has a lower priority thanany other lien specified on the vehicle's or boat's title. Summary: \"Verified mail\" is defined as any method of mailing through the United St ates Postal Service that pro- vides evidence of mailing. A storage facility owner may send a preliminary lien notice to an occupant in defau lt either by first-class mail to both the occupant's last known address and specified alter- native address or by electronic mail (e-mail). A storage fa-cility owner may also send a notice of final lien sale orfinal notice of disposition by personal service, verifiedmail, or e-mail to the occupant's last known mailing ad-dress and alternative address or e-mail address. If the owner wishes to send either the preliminary lien notice or the notice of final lien sale or disposition by e-mail: the occupant must expressly agree to e-mail notifica- tions; the rental agreement mu st state in bold type that notices will be sent by e-mail; the owner must provide the occupant with the e-mail address from which notices will be sent and direct the occupant to change his or her e-mail settings to allow e-mails from that address to avoid any filtration sys-tems; and the owner must notify th e occupant of any change of e-mail address before the change occurs. If an e-mail notice of final lien sale or disposition does not receive a response or confirmation of receipt, then theowner must also send the notice by verified mail. The tim- ing of the final lien sale is counted from the last date ofsending. No less than 60 days after default, any motor vehicles and boats belonging to the occupant may be towed fromthe self-storage facility in lieu of a lien sale. The final liensale or final notice of disposition sent to the occupant mustset this out and the owner mu st, prior to towing, provide the occupant the name and co ntact information of the tow- ing company used. The owner is not liable for damage af- ter towing.If a rental agreement contains a condition on the use of the storage unit that sets forth a limit on the value of per-sonal property stored in the occupant's space, that limit is the maximum value of the stor ed property for the limited purpose of the storage fa cility owner's liability. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1045 C 60 L 15 Concerning the practice of East Asian medicine. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored and Riccelli). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health Care Background: East Asian medicine practitioners are li- censed by the Department of Health (DOH), and the Sec-retary of Health acts as their disciplining authority. EastAsian medicine is a health care service that uses EastAsian medicine diagnosis and treatment to promote healthand treat organic or functional di sorders. It includes: acu- puncture; the use of electrical, mechanical, or magneticdevices stimulate acupuncture points dietary advice and healtheducation based on East Asia n medical theory; breathing, relaxation, and East Asian exercise techniques; qi gong;East Asian massage and Tui na; and superficial heat andcold therapies. East Asian medicine practitio ners are required to pre- pare and submit to the DOH a written plan for consulta-tion, emergency transfer, and referral to other health careproviders. The practitioner must submit the plan with theinitial licensure application an d then annually at the time the practitioner renews his or her license. Among otherthings, the plan requires the pr actitioner to attest that in an emergency, he or she will initiate the emergency medicalsystem by dialing 911, request an ambulance, and providepatient support until emerge ncy response arrives. The DOH may withhold a license if the plan does not meet the standards in DOH rules. In addition to the written plan, an East Asian medicine practitioner who sees a patient with a potentially serious disorder must immediately re quest a consultation or recent diagnosis from a primary care provider. If the patient re-fuses, he or she must sign a waiver acknowledging the risks associated with the failu re to pursue treatment from a primary care provider.House 96 1 Senate 48 1HB 1047 11Summary: Advisory Committee The East Asian Medi- cine Advisory Committee (Comm ittee) is established. It consists of five members, all of whom must be Washing-ton residents. Four members must be East Asian medicinepractitioners who have at least five years' experience andwho have been actively engaged in practice within twoyears of appointment. One member must be a member of the public with an interest in the rights of health services consumers. Members serve three-year terms and may notserve more than two consecutive full terms. Committee members are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Secretary of Health. The Committee ischarged with advising and making recommendations to the DOH on standards for the practice of East Asian med-icine. It must meet at least once a year. Committee mem-bers are immune from civil or criminal liability for the DOH's disciplinary proceedings or other official acts per-formed in good faith. Co mmittee members are entitled to reimbursement for travel expe nses and may be compensat- ed up to $50 per day for attending an official meeting orperforming other statutorily prescribed duties. Written Referral Plan . The requirement that an East Asian medicine practitioner develop a written plan forconsultation, emergency transfer, and referral to other pro-viders is eliminated. In an emergency, an East Asian med- icine practitioner must initia te the emergency medical system by calling 911, requ est an ambulance, and provide patient support until emergency response arrives.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1047 C 61 L 15 Concerning state agencies con tinuity of operations plan- ning requirements. By Representatives Goodman, Haler, Moscoso, Appleton, Klippert, Muri, Hurst, S. Hu nt, Hayes, Johnson, MacEwen and Gregerson; by request of Military Depart-ment. House Committee on Public Safety House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Washington Military Department, un- der the direction of the Adjutant General, administers thestate's comprehensive prog ram of emergency manage- ment. The Adjutant General is responsible for developing a comprehensive, all-hazard emergency plan for the statethat includes an analysis of natural, technological, or hu- man-caused hazards and procedures to coordinate localand state resources in respondi ng to such hazards. In theevent of a disaster beyond local control, the Governor, through the Adjutant Genera l, may assume operational control over all or any part of emergency managementfunctions in the state. In 2013 Governor Inslee required each individual agency, board, commission, an d council to develop a Con- tinuity of Operations Plan (COOP) in order for state exec-utive branch organizations to provide essential functions and services during an emergency or disaster. The COOPplan of each agency must not only ensure the agency'sability to deliver essential fu nctions and services to the cit- izens of the state during any disaster or emergency, butagencies must coordinate actions to ensure that essentialfunctions that overlap with ot her agencies continue with- out interruption. Summary: The Adjutant General is responsible to the Governor for helping to develop and manage a programfor interagency coordination an d prioritization of continu- ity of operations planning by state agencies. Each stateagency must develop a COOP that is updated and exer-cised annually in compliance with the program for inter- agency coordination of continuity of operation planning. Continuity of operations plan ning is the internal effort of an organization to assure that the capability exists to continue essential functions and services in response to acomprehensive array of potential emergencies or disasters.

By Representatives Fagan, by request of Attorney General. House Committee on Public Safety House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Background: Sexually Violent Predator Commitment Proceedings . A sexually violent predator (SVP) is a per- son who has been convicted of, found not guilty by reasonof insanity of, or found to be incompetent to stand trial for a crime of sexual violence and who suffers from a mentalabnormality or personality di sorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if notconfined in a secure facility. A prosecutor may file a petition to civilly commit a person as a SVP. After the filing of a petition, the courtfirst must determine whether there is probable cause to be-lieve the person is a SVP. If there is probable cause, a fulltrial is held to determine whether the person is a SVP. At the trial, the burden is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the pe rson is a SVP. If the person requests a 12-person jury, the jury must be unanimous intheir decision. If the person is found to be a SVP, he or she is committed to the custody of the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) for control, care, and treat- ment at the Special Commitment Center (SCC) on McNeilIsland. Annual Examinations . Every year, the DSHS con- ducts an examination of each committed person's mentalcondition and prepares a report as to whether the person continues to meet the definition of a SVP and whether con- ditional release to a less rest rictive alternative (LRA) is in the person's best interest an d conditions can be imposed to adequately protect the comm unity. The committed person may retain, or have appointed, if indigent, an evaluator to conduct an examination. Review Proceedings . If the DSHS determines after the annual exam ination that: (1) th e person's condition has so changed that he or she no longer meets the definition of a SVP, or (2) conditional release to a LRA is in the person'sbest interest and conditions can be imposed to adequately protect the community, the DS HS must authorize the per- son to petition the court for a full trial to consider eitherunconditional discharge or conditional release to a LRA. The committed person may al so petition the court for release without the approval of the DSHS. The DSHSmust send annual written notice of the right to petition thecourt, along with a waiver of rights. If the committed per- son does not waive the right, the court must set a showcause hearing to determine if probable cause exists to war- rant a hearing on whether the person's condition has changed. If, at the hearing, the co mmitted person demonstrates probable cause to believe that his or her condition has so changed that he or she no lo nger meets the definition of a SVP or that release to a LRA would be in the person's bestinterest and conditions would adequately protect the com- munity, the court must order a full trial, at which the bur-den is on the state. However, a trial may not be orderedunless there is current evidence from a licensed profes-sional that: (1) the committe d person has undergone a per- manent physiological change, such as paralysis, stroke, or dementia, which renders him or her unable to commit asexually violent act; or (2) treatment has brought aboutchange in mental condition su ch that the person meets the standard for conditional relea se to a LRA or unconditional release. Less Restrictive Alternative Release . Before releas- ing a person to a LRA, the court must make these addition- al findings: the person will be trea ted by a qualified treatment provider; the treatment provider has presented a specific course of treatment and has agreed to assume responsibility for such treatment and will report violations immedi-House 97 0 Senate 45 0ESHB 1060 13ately to the court, the prosecutor, the supervising community corrections offi cer, and the Superinten- dent of the SCC; housing exists in Washington that is sufficiently secure to protect the community, and the person or agency providing housing to the conditionally released person has agreed in writing to accept the person, to provide the level of security required by the court, and to immediatel y report to the court, the prosecutor, the supervising community correctionsofficer, and the Superintendent of the SCC if the per- son leaves the housing without authorization; the person is willing to comply with the treatment provider and all requiremen ts imposed by the treat- ment provider and by the court; and the person will be under the supervision of the Department of Corrections and is willing to comply with supervision. Summary: Annual Examinations . The DSHS, at the re- quest of the committed person, must allow a record of the annual review interview to be preserved by audio record- ing and must make the record ing available to the commit- ted person. The evaluator mu st indicate in the report whether the committed person participated in the inter- view and examination. In a proceeding to dete rmine whether a committed person will be released to a LRA or unconditionally dis- charged, any reports and testimony by an expert on behalfof the committed person is ex cluded if the committed per- son did not participate in th e most recent interview and evaluation complete d by the DSHS. The annual review requirem ent is suspended while a committed person is awaiting trial fo r unconditional re- lease. If the person is reco mmitted, the next annual review must be done within one y ear of the recommitment order. Definition of Treatment . \"Treatment\" is defined as sex offender specific treatment offered at the SCC or aspecific course of sex offender treatment by a sex offendertreatment provider. Less Restrictive Alternative Release . Prior to autho- rizing release of a sexually violent predator to a less re-strictive alternative, the co urt is required to consider release to the person's count y of commitment. A person's county of commitment is the county of the court that or-dered the person's commitment. It is appropriate to release a person to the person's coun ty of commitment unless the court determines that return to the county of commitment would be inappropriate considering the following factors: any court-issued protection orders; victim safety concerns; the availability of appropriate treatment or facilities that would adequately protect the community; negative influences on the person; or the location of family or other persons or organiza- tions offering support. When the DSHS or the court assists in developing a placement of a person, effort must be made to avoid dis-proportionate effect on a single county. If the person is not released to his or her county of commitment, the DSHSmust provide written notice and an explanation to the law and justice council of th e county of placement. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2015 (Sections 1 and 2) July 24, 2015 ESHB 1060 C 15 L 15 Directing state investments of existing litter tax revenues under chapter 82.19 RCW in material waste managementefforts without increasing the tax rate. By House Committee on Environment (originally spon- sored by Representatives Fitzgibbon, Short, Farrell, Pike,Gregerson, Jinkins and Fey). House Committee on Environment House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Senate Committee on Energy, Environment & Telecomca- tions Background: The Waste Reduction, Recycling, and Lit- ter Control Act (Act) prohibits littering and establishesstatewide programs to prevent and clean up litter, reducewaste, and increase recycling. These programs are fundedby a 0.00015 percent litter ta x on manufacturers', whole- salers', and retailers' gross proceeds on 13 categories ofconsumer products. The prod ucts subject to the litter tax include human food, pet food, groceries, cigarettes, tobac-co products, wine, beer, malt beverages, soft drinks, car-bonated water, household pape r products, cleaning agents, toiletries, nondrug drugstor e assorted products, and glass, metal, plastic, and synthetic fiber containers. Allowed Uses of Litter Ta x Revenues: Waste Reduc- tion, Recycling, and Litter Control Act Programs . The programs funded by the litter tax under the Act include lit- ter collection efforts by stat e agencies including the De- partment of Ecology (ECY) and state assistance of localgovernment waste reduction and recycling programs.Also established by the Act is the ECY Youth Corps pro-gram, which employs teens to collect litter from highways,parks, and other public areas. In most years, litter tax revenues have been directed into a Waste Reduction, Recy cling, and Litter Control Ac- count (Account), from which revenues are distributed tofund the Act's programs as follows:House 93 5 Senate 46 0 (Senate amended)House 87 6 (House concurred)ESHB 1060 14 fifty percent is allocated to litter collection efforts by several state agencies, including the departments of Ecology, Transportation, Corrections, Revenue, and Natural Resources. This 50 percent allocation of thelitter tax is also used to c over the ECY's costs of coor- dinating statewide litter contro l efforts, to conduct a statewide litter survey, and to conduct statewide pub-lic awareness programs; twenty percent is alloca ted to local city and county waste reduction, recyclin g, and litter control pro- grams, which are administered by the ECY as the Community Litter Cleanup Program; and thirty percent is allocate d to the ECY for waste reduc- tion and recycling efforts. 2013 Amendments to Litter Tax Allowed Uses and Waste Reduction, Recycling, and Litter Control Act Pro- grams . In 2013 legislation was enacted that distributes $5 million per fiscal year of litte r tax revenue to the State Parks Renewal and Stewardship Account until July 1,2017. This money is to be u sed to fund the operations and maintenance of state parks. In addition, several changes to the allowable uses of litter tax revenues in the Acco unt were made in the 2013- 15 Operating Budget, which apply only during the 2013-2015 biennium. Under these 2013 amendments, duringthe 2013-2015 biennium litter tax funds used for Act pro-grams must generally be prio ritized for recycling and litter programs for the products subjec t to the litter tax. In addi- tion, the following sp ecific uses of litter tax funds in the Account are authorized during the 2013-2015 biennium: Out of the 50 percent of Account money allocated for litter collection efforts by state agencies, the ECY Youth Corps was specifically authorized to befunded. Out of the 20 percent of Account money allocated to the ECY to fund local gove rnment activities, the ECY was also authorized to create a matching fund com- petitive grant program to local governments and non- profit organizations for litter reduction and recyclingpublic assistance programs related to the items sub- ject to the litter tax. Un spent funds from other Act programs were allowed to be spent on the matchingfund competitive grant program. The 30 percent of Acco unt money allocated to the ECY for waste reduction and recycling were allo-cated during the 2013-2015 biennium for the follow- ing activities: to implement waste reduction and recycling efforts, including coordination with other state agencies, local governments, and voluntary efforts; for technical assistance to local governments for commercial and residential recycling programs primarily for products subject to the litter tax; and to increase access to recycling programs, particu- larly for food packaging, plastic bags, and appro- priate techniques of discarding products. Summary: Scope of the Act's Programs . The encourage- ment of composting is added as a purpose of the Act. Stateand local government programs authorized by the Act mayinclude composting activities in addition to waste reduc- tion, recycling, and litter contro l efforts. In addition, the 2013-2015 biennium requirement that Act programs prior-itize the 13 categories of products subject to the litter taxis made permanent. The requ irement that the ECY period- ically conduct a statewide litter survey targeting litter composition, sources, demographics, and geographictrends is eliminated. Allocation of Litter Tax Funds . The changes to the specific allowable uses of litter tax funds in the Accountmade in the 2013 budget are, with some further changes,made permanent. Under the 30 percent allocation of Ac- count money to the ECY under the Act, three activities are authorized: implementing waste redu ction, recycling, and com- posting efforts, including coordination with other state agencies, local governments, and voluntary efforts; providing technical assistance to local governments for recycling and composting public education pro- grams; and increasing access to waste reduction, composting and recycling programs. The 2013-2015 biennium's funding of the ECY Youth Corps among the state agency litter collection activities funded as part of the 50 percent allocation of Accountmoney to the ECY is extended permanently. The 2013-15 biennium's matching fund competitive grant program is also extended permanently. The compet-itive grant program is funded from any unspent funds in the 20 percent of Account money that is also allocated tothe ECY for local government waste reduction, litter con-trol, composting, and recyc ling efforts. Composting is added as a subject of the ma tching fund competitive grant program, and the following restrictions and structural ele-ments are added to the grant program: Grants must be less than $60,000. Local governments must match 25 percent of eligible grant program expenses in cash or contributed ser-vices. A legislative appropriation is required in order for grant payments to be made. Grants must be managed under existing the ECY grant program guidelines. Grants received by nonprofit organizations are not subject to the state business and occupation tax.Votes on Final Passage: House 96 1HB 1061 15Effective: July 24, 2015 June 30, 2017 (Sections 3 and 6) HB 1061 C 25 L 15 E 3 Increasing the number of dist rict court judges in Skagit county. By Representatives Hayes, Lytton, Smith, Gregerson, Mo- eller and Buys; by request of Board For Judicial Adminis- tration. House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Background: The number of district court judges in each county is set by statute. Any change in the number of full-and part-time judges in a coun ty's district court is deter- mined by the Legislature after receiving a recommenda-tion from the Board for Judi cial Administration (BJA). The BJA's recommendation is ba sed on an objective work- load analysis developed annu ally by the Administrative Office of the Courts. The objective workload analysis takes into account available judicial resources and the caseload activity of the court. In order for an additional judicial position to become effective, the legislative auth ority of the affected county must approve the position an d agree to pay the expenses associated with the new positio n out of county funds and without reimbursement from the state. Skagit County has two elected district court judges. The BJA recommends an increase in the number of districtcourt judge positions in Skagit County.

Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 SHB 1063 C 62 L 15 Concerning cosmetology, hair design, barbering, esthetics, and manicuring. By House Committee on Busi ness & Financial Services (originally sponsored by Representatives Kirby, Blake andRyu).House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: The Department of Licensing (Depart- ment) regulates cosmetology, barbering, manicuring, and esthetics. A person must be licensed to practice these pro- fessions. A barber license allows the cutting, trimming,arranging, dressing, curling, shampooing, shaving, and mustache and beard design of the face, neck, and scalp. Acosmetology license allows a ll these practices and, in ad- dition, allows the following practices involving chemicals: permanent waving, chemical relaxing, straightening,bleaching, lightening, and co loring. The license also al- lows waxing and tweezing. Finally, the cosmetologist li- cense also allows some of the practices permitted formanicurists and estheticians. To receive a license, a per-son must meet training requi rements and pass an exam. Washington does not have a license that allows only barbering and the use of chemicals. To use chemicals, apractitioner must obtain a cosmetology license. To be eligible for a cosmet ology license, an applicant must demonstrate that he or she has at least 1,600 training hours in a school or 2,000 hours of apprenticeship. For barbers, the requirement is 1,000 hours in school or 1,200 hours of apprenticeship. A person with the equivalent license in another state may take the examination w ithout meeting the applicable training or apprenticeship re quirements. The Department prepares and administers the exams, establishes minimumsafety and sanitation standards, adopts rules, and other- wise administers the licensing provisions. The Cosmetol- ogy, Barbering, Esthetics, and Manicuring AdvisoryBoard (Board) advises the Depa rtment on matters relating to licensing of the relevant professions. The Board con-sists of representatives of eac h profession appointed by the Director of the Department. Summary: A new license is created for hair design, which includes cutting, styling, extensions, straightening, and coloring of hair. In orde r to obtain a hair design li- cense, the applicant must have 1,400 hours of training or1,750 hours of apprenticeship. The Department is grantedrule-making authority to es tablish minimum safety and sanitation standards for hair designers and hair designersare added to the Board that advises the state on matters ofcosmetology, barbering, est hetics, and manicuring. Online training of license applicants is permitted. Instructors in curriculum programs for cosmetology, hair design, barbering, manicuring, esthetics, or master es-thetics may forego 300 hours of training with evidence ofprior experience in those fields or all 500 hours with evi-dence of 500 hours of experience as an instructor in anoth-er state.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015Senate 47 0 House 94 4 Senate 45 0 House 93 5 Senate 49 0SHB 1068 16SHB 1068 C 247 L 15 Concerning sexual assault examination kits. By House Committee on Public Safety (originally spon- sored by Representatives House Committee on Public Safety House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Law & JusticeSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: After a person has been the victim of a sex- ual assault, the person may undergo a forensic examina- tion for the purpose of coll ecting any evidence that may have been left behind during the assault. Biological evi-dence such as saliva, blood, or semen may be collected.The doctor or nurse conductin g the examination preserves the evidence using a sexual assault examination kit, com-monly referred to as a rape kit. The sexual assault exam-ination kit contains tools that may be used by the doctor ornurse, such as swabs, combs, blood collection devices, and documentation forms. When the examination is complete, the evidence is packaged and steps are taken to preservethe chain of custody. In some cases, custody of the sexual assault examina- tion kit may be transferred to a law enforcement agency. When a law enforcement agency receives a sexual assaultexamination kit, the agency may submit it to a crime lab for analysis, but is under no specific deadline for submis- sion. Summary: When a law enforcemen t agency receives a sexual assault examination kit, and consent has been given for the rape kit to be analyzed as part of a sexual assaultinvestigation, the agency must submit a request for labora- tory analysis to the Washington State Patrol Crime Labo-ratory within 30 days of rece iving it. In addition, law enforcement must submit a requ est for laboratory analysis for all sexual assault examina tion kits collected from non- emancipated minors. The fa ilure of a law enforcement agency to meet the 30-day de adline is not a basis to ex- clude the evidence from a court proceeding or to overturna conviction or sentence, and it does not create a privateright of action against the agency. The Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory must, subject to available funding, gi ve priority to laboratory ex- amination of sexual assau lt examination kits for: active investigations and cases with impending court dates; active investigations wher e public safety is an imme- diate concern; violent investig ations, including tions, such as previously unsubmitted older sexual assault kits or recently co llected sexual assault kits that the submitting agency has determined to be lower priority based on their initial investigation. The Washington State Patrol is required to compile in- formation relating to the requ ests for laboratory examina- tion submitted by law enfo rcement and report the following informatio n annually to the Legislature and the Governor: (1) the number of requests for laboratory ex- amination made for sexual assault examination kits and the law enforcement agencies that su bmitted the requests; and (2) the progress made toward testing the sexual assaultexamination kits, including the status of requests for labo- ratory examination made by each law enforcement agen-cy. The requirement to comp ile information and report to the Legislature and Governor expires on June 30, 2018. A legislative task force is cr eated to study best practice models for managing all aspects of sexual assault exam-inations and for reducing the number of untested sexualassault examination kits in Wa shington that were collected prior to July 24, 2015. The caucus leaders from the Senate must appoint one member from each of the two largestcaucuses of the Senate. The caucus leaders from theHouse of Representatives must appoint one member fromeach of the two largest caucuses of the House of Represen-tatives. The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House must jointly appoint one member representing each of the following groups: the Washington State Patrol; the Washington Associa tion of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs; the Washington Associ ation of Prosecuting Attor- neys; the Washington Defender Association or the Wash- ington Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers; the Washington Association of Cities; the Washington Association of County Officials; the Washington Coalitio n of Sexual Assault Pro- grams; the Office of Crime Victims Advocacy; the Washington State Hospital Association; the Washington Forensic Investigations Council; a public institution of higher education; and a private institution of higher education. Two members representing survivors of sexual assault must also be appointed. Th e duties of the task force in- clude, but are not lim ited to the following: researching and determining the number of untested sexual assault examination k its in Washington state; researching the locations where the untested sexual assault examination kits are stored; researching, reviewin g, and making recommenda- tions regarding legislative policy options for reducingSHB 1069 17the number of untested sexual assault examination kits; researching the best practice models both in state and from other states for collaborative responses to vic-tims of sexual assault from the point the sexual assault examination kit is co llected to the conclusion of the investigation and providing recommendations regarding any existing gaps in Washington and resources that may be necessary to address those gaps; and researching, identifying, and making recommenda- tions for securing nonstate funding for testing the sexual assault examination kits, and reporting onprogress made toward securing such funding. The task force must meet pr ior to October 1, 2015 and submit a preliminary report to the Legislature and theGovernor prior to December 1, 2015. The task force mustmeet at least twice annually and provide an annual report on its findings and recommen dations to the Legislature and the Governor.

By House Committee on Public Safety (originally spon- sored by Representatives Moeller, Moscoso,Farrell and Fey). House Committee on Public Safety Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: Chain of custody for evidence at a crime scene usually starts with the collection of evidence doneby an investigator or tech nician. When collecting evi- dence from a crime scene for deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA) analysis, there are several main goals: to recon-struct the crime; to identify th e perpetrator; to preserve the evidence for analysis; and to collect the evidence in a way that will make it admissible in court. The Washington State Patrol (WSP) operates and maintains a DNA identification system to help with crim- inal investigations and to identify human remains or miss- ing persons. The WSP also provides DNA analysisservices to local law enforcem ent agencies, provides assis- tance to law enforcement officials and prosecutors in thepreparation and utilization of DNA evidence for presenta-tion in court, and provides expert testimony in court on DNA evidentiary issues. Most DNA testing is conductedby the Forensic Laboratory Services Bureau of the WSP. DNA Preservation . In a felony case, upon a motion of the defense counsel or the co urt, a sentencing court may order that biological material or evidence samples securedin connection with a particular criminal case be preservedin accordance with any court rule adopted for the preser-vation of evidence. In those cases, the court must specifythe samples to be maintained and the length of time the samples must be preserved. Outside of a motion made in court requesting the pres- ervation of DNA evidence the length of time that DNA bi-ological material is mainta ined in felony cases varies. Some local law enforcement agencies maintain and pre-serve evidence relating to a criminal case indefinitelywhile other local agencies preserve evidence up to the stat-ute of limitations for the crime. Statute of Limitations . Statutes of limitations are leg- islative declarations of the period after the commission ordiscovery of an offense within which actions may bebrought on certain claims, or during which certain crimesmay be prosecuted. Once a statute of limitations has ex-pired, prosecution is barred. Statutes of limitations vary according to the crime. In general, simple misdemeanors must be prosecuted within one year, gross misdemeanors must be prosecuted withintwo years, and felony offenses must be prosecuted withinthree years of the commission of the crime. However, thelimitation period may be varied by statute, and there is nolimitation on the time within which a prosecution mustcommence for the crimes of Murder, Homicide by Abuse, Vehicular Homicide, or the following crimes if death re-sults: Vehicular Assault, H it and Run injury-accident, and Arson. If no period of limitation is statutorily declared fora particular felony offense, no prosecution may be com-menced more than three years after its commission. Determinate Plus Sentences . Some offenders convict- ed of certain sex offenses are sentenced to a \"determinateplus\" sentence. Such an offe nder will receive a minimum term and a maximum term as imposed by the judge. Once the person reaches the end of his or her minimum sen-tence, the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board deter-mines if release and supervision are appropriate. Summary: A government entity must preserve DNA work product collected in an y felony case initially charged as a violent or sex offense. In such case, where a defen-dant has been: charged and convicted in connection with the case, the DNA work product must be maintained through- out the length of the defe ndant's sentence, including any period of community custody extending through final discharge; convicted and sentenced to a determinate plus sen- tence in connection with the case, the DNA workHouse 82 15 Senate 46 0 (Senate amended)House 83 14 (House concurred)HB 1077 18product must be maintained for 99 years or until the death of the defendant, whichever is sooner; and found not guilty, where no conviction has been made in connection with the ca se, the DNA work product must be maintained for 99 years or throughout the period of the statute of limitations, whichever period is sooner. In any case where the identity of the offender is not known and law enforcement has probable cause to believethe elements of a violent or sex offense has been commit-ted, the DNA work product se cured in connection with a the case, including any sexual assault examination kit,must be maintained for 99 years or throughout the periodof the statute of limitations, whichever period is shorter. Nothing precludes a trial court from ordering the de- struction of DNA contributed by a defendant who wascharged and subsequently ac quitted or whose conviction was overturned in connection with a violent or sex offense. In any case where the charg es are dismissed with prej- udice or the person is foun d not guilty, upon application from the person and upon meeting any criteria establishedin law or by rule, the WSP mu st expunge the person's col- lected DNA reference sample. The failure of a law enforcement agency to preserve DNA work product does not constitute grounds in any criminal proceeding for cha llenging the admissibility of other DNA work product that was preserved in a case, andany evidence offered may not be excluded by a court onthose grounds. The court may not set aside the convictionor sentence or order the reversal of a conviction on thegrounds that the DNA work prod uct is no longer available. If any DNA work product is destroyed with malicious in-tent, the court may impose sanctions. However, no privatecause of action may be brought against a law enforcementagency or contractor of a law enforcement agency for de-stroying DNA work product. DNA work product includes: (1) product generated during the process of scientific analysis of such material,except amplified DNA, material that had been subjected to DNA extraction, and DNA extracts from reference sam-ples; or (2) any material cata logued on a microscope slide, swab, in a sample tube, cutting, DNA extract, or some oth- er similar retention method us ed to isolate potential bio- logical evidence that has been collected by lawenforcement as part of its investigation and prepared forscientific analysis, whether or not it is submitted for scien-tific analysis and derived from the contents of a sexual as-sault examination kit, blood, semen, hair, saliva, skintissue, fingerprints, bones, teeth, or any other identifiablehuman biological material or physical evidence. For pur-poses of DNA preservation requirements under this act,DNA work product does not include a reference samplecollected unless it has been shown, through DNA compar- ison, to associate the source of the sample with the crimi-nal case for which it was collected.A governmental entity includes any general law en- forcement agency or any person or organization officiallyacting on behalf of the stat e or any political subdivision of the state involved in the coll ection, examination, tracking, packaging, storing, or disposition of biological materialcollected in connection with a criminal investigation relat- ing to a felony offense.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1077 C 63 L 15 Regulating credit for reinsurance. By Representatives Kirby, Ryu, McBride and Stanford; by request of Insura nce Commissioner. House Committee on Business & Financial Services Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance Background: Credit for Reinsurance . Reinsurance is an insurance product purchased by an insurance company to pass some of the risk assume d by the insurance company to the reinsurer. The insurer that transfers the risk to the reinsurer is the \"ced ing\" company. The reinsurer, or the \"assuming\" company, accepts the risk. The ceding insur- ance company's exposu re to financial loss is thereby re- duced. Credit for reinsuranc e is an accounting procedure that permits a ceding company to treat amounts due fromreinsurers as assets or reduc tions from liability. This im- proves the reported financial condition of the ceding insur-ance company in its annual statement. Credit forreinsurance is allowed only when specified standards aremet. Types of Insurers . A \"domestic in surance company\" is one organized under Washington law. A \"foreign insur-ance company\" is one organize d under the laws of another state. An \"alien insurance company\" is one organized un-der the laws of a nation other than the United States. Summary: The circumstances under which credit for re- insurance is allowed are modified. Managing Reinsurance Coverage . A ceding insurer must take steps to manage its reinsurance proportionate to its own risk, and it must take steps to diversify its reinsur- ance program. Licensed in Washington as an Insurer or Reinsurer . Credit for reinsurance (credit) is allowed when the assum- ing insurer is licensed to tran sact insurance or reinsurance in Washington. Accredited in Washington as a Reinsurer . Credit is al- lowed if the reinsurer: file s with the Insurance Commis- sioner (Commissioner) evidence that it is accredited inWashington as a reinsurer and if there is evidence of itsHouse 77 20 Senate 47 1 (Senate amended)House 91 3 (House concurred)ESHB 1078 19submission to Washington's ju risdiction and to the state's authority to examine its book s and records; is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state; files annually with the Commissioner a copy of its annual state- ment and a copy of its most recent audited financial state-ment; and demonstrates that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsura nce obligations and is other- wise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insur-ers. Domiciled in Other States . Credit is allowed if the re- insurer is domiciled in a state that employs standards sub-stantially similar to those applicable under Washington law and the reinsurer: main tains a surplus regarding poli- cy holders of not less than $20 million and submits to the Commissioner's authority to examine its books and re- cords. Trust Fund in Qualifie d Financial Institution . An in- surer may apply credit if th e reinsurer maintains a trust fund for the payment of claims that is: in a \"qualified Unit- ed States financial institution. \" To meet this requirement the trust must be in a financ ial institution organized under the laws of the United States; must be regulated and super- vised by federal or state authorities having regulatory au-thority over banks and tr ust companies; and been determined by either the Co mmissioner or the Securities Valuation Office of the Natio nal Association of Insurance Commissioners to meet the necessary standards of finan-cial condition and standing. The form of the trust must be approved by the com- missioner of the state where the trust is domiciled or by acommissioner of another stat e who has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the tr ust, and it must meet certain conditions specified in the act. Certified as a Reinsurer . Credit is allowed when the reinsurer has been certified by the Commissioner as a re- insurer. To be eligible for ce rtification, the reinsurer must: be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsur- ance in a qualified jurisdictio n, maintain minimum capital and surplus in an amount to be determined by the Commis- sioner pursuant to his or her rulemaking authority, agree tosubmit to Washington's jurisd iction and to meet applicable information filing requirements , and satisfy any other re- quirements deemed re levant by the Commissioner. An as- sociation including inco rporated and individual unincorporated underwriters ma y be certified as a reinsur- er if it meets certain additional statutory requirements. The Commissioner must create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions, unde r which a reinsurer would be eligible to be considered fo r certification. The Commis- sioner may suspend a reinsurer' s certification if the juris- diction where the insurer is domiciled ceases to be aqualified jurisdiction. Revocation or Suspension . Under certain conditions, the Commissioner may suspend or revoke a reinsurer's ac-creditation or certification if it ceases to meet the neces-sary requirements. The Co mmissioner must give the reinsurer notice and an opportunity for a hearing. Required Reinsurance . Credit may be allowed even when the reinsurer is not lice nsed or accredited in Wash- ington, is domiciled in anothe r state but does not meet the surplus requirements, does not meet the trust fund require- ments, or is not certified as a reinsurer, if the reinsurance risk is located in a jurisdic tion where reinsurance is re- quired by law. Submission of Jurisdiction . If the reinsurer is not li- censed, accredited, or certified to transact insurance or re-insurance in Washington, cr edit for reinsurance may be permitted if there are provisio ns in the reinsurance agree- ments that provide that the rein surer: must submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States; will comply with all requirements to place itself within the jurisdiction of the court; and will abide bythe final decision of the court or any appellate court. In ad- dition, the reinsurer must designate the Commissioner asits attorney who may accept service of process. Rulemaking . The Commissioner may adopt rules and regulations implementing the provisions of this act.

House Committee on Technology & Economic Develop- ment Senate Committee on Law & JusticeSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: State Security Breach Laws . In 2005 leg- islation was enacted creating pa rallel security breach laws. One set of laws applies to any person or business, and theother set of laws applies to all state and local agencies(agency). These laws require any person, business, or agency that owns or licenses computerized data that includes per-sonal information to notify po ssibly affected persons when security of the system is breached and unencrypted per- sonal information is (or is reasonably believed to have been) acquired by an unauthori zed person. A person, busi- ness, or agency is not required to disclose a technicalHouse 97 0 Senate 49 0ESHB 1078 20breach that does not seem reas onably likely to subject cus- tomers to a risk of criminal activity. Definitions. \"Breach of the security of the system\" means unauthorized acquisition of computerized data thatcompromises the security, conf identiality, or integrity of personal information maintained by the person, business,or agency. Good faith acquisi tion of personal information by an employee or agent of the business or agency is not abreach of security when the personal information is not used or subject to further unauthorized disclosure. \"Personal information\" is defined as an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted: social security number; driver's license number or Washington identification card number; or account number or credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account.\"Personal information\" do es not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records. Non-computerized or encrypted data are exempt.Notification Requirements. The notice required when security is breached must be either written, electronic, or substitute notice. If it is el ectronic, the notice provided must be consistent with fe deral law regarding electronic records, including consent, r ecord retention, and types of disclosures. Substitute notice is only allowed if the cost of providing direct notice exce eds $250,000, the number of persons to be notified exceeds 500,000, or there is insuffi- cient contact information to reach the customer. Substitute notice consists of all of the following: electronic mail (e-mail) notice when the person or business has an e-mail address for the subject per- sons; conspicuous posting of the notice on the website of the person or business, if the person or business main- tains one; and notification to major statewide media. There are no specific requirements for the content of the notification. Disclosure of a breach must be made in the most ex- pedient time possible and without reasonable delay. De-layed disclosure is allowed if disclosure would impede acriminal investigation. Enforcement. Any customer injured by a violation of the security breach laws may institute a civil action to re-cover damages. Consumer Protection Act . The Consumer Protection Act (CPA) prohibits unfair me thods of competition or un- fair or deceptive practices in the conduct of any trade orcommerce. The CPA may be en forced by private legal ac- tion or through a civil action by the Office of the Attorney General. Any person injured by a violation of the CPAmay seek actual damages, costs, and attorneys' fees. The court may triple the amount of damages awarded up to$25,000. Federal Health Insuran ce and Accountability Act . The Health Insurance Port ability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) establishes nationwide standards for theuse, disclosure, storage, and transfer of protected healthinformation. Entities covered by HIPAA must have a pa- tient's authorization to use or disclose health care informa- tion, unless there is a specified exception. An entitycovered under HIPAA must comply with the Health Tech-nology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)notification requirements in cases of a data breach. UnderHITECH, entities that access, ma intain, retain, modify, re- cord, store, destroy, or otherwise hold, use, or disclose un-secured protected health inform ation must, in the case of a breach of such information th at is discovered by the cov- ered entity, notify each indi vidual whose unsecured pro- tected health information has been, or is reasonablybelieved by the covered entity to have been, accessed, ac- quired, or disclosed as a result of such breach. Gramm-Leach Bliley Act . The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1949 (GLBA) requires financial institutions to givetheir customers privacy notices that explain the financial institution's information co llection and sharing practices. Financial institutions create d the Interagency Guidelines, which establish information security standards in cases ofa data breach, to comply w ith GLBA requirements. The Interagency Guidelines state th at when a financial institu- tion becomes aware of an incident of unauthorized accessto sensitive customer inform ation, the institution should conduct a reasonable investig ation to promptly determine the likelihood that the informat ion has been or will be mis- used. If the institution determin es that misuse of its infor- mation about a customer has occurred or is reasonablypossible, it should notify the affected customer as soon aspossible. Customer notice may be delayed if an appropri- ate law enforcement agency determines that notification will interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution with a written request for the delay. Summary: Parallel changes are made to the laws govern- ing notice of security breaches for persons, businesses, oragencies. Definitions . Protected personal information is no lon- ger limited to computerized and unencrypted data. Theterm \"customer\" is replaced with \"consumer\". \"Secured\" means encrypted in a manner that meets or exceeds the National Institute of Standa rds and Technology standard or otherwise modified so that the personal information is rendered unreadable, unu sable, or undecipherable. Notification Requirements . Notice is not required if the breach is not reasonably likely to subject consumers toa risk of harm. SHB 1088 21If required, notice must: be written and in plain language; include the name and contact information of the reporting person, business, or agency; list the type of person al information breached; and include toll-free telephone numbers to major credit reporting agencies if the breach exposed personal information. If a breach requires notification to more than 500 Washington residents, the fo llowing added notification re- quirements apply: submission of an electroni c version of the notification to the Attorney General; and provision of the number of consumers affected (or estimate if unknown). Notification of a breach of personal information to af- fected consumers must be provided no more than 45 daysafter the breach was discove red, unless an exception ap- plies. Enforcement . The Attorney General may bring an ac- tion in the name of the state, or as parens patriae on behalf of persons residing in the stat e for violations of this act by persons or businesses. Only the Office of the Attorney General may bring an action under the CPA. An individ-ual maintains the ability to ins titute a civil right of action to recover damages. Exemptions . Persons, businesses, and agencies cov- ered under the HIPAA and in compliance with the HIPAAnotification requirements ar e exempt from notification requirements. Financial inst itutions in compliance with notification requirements u nder the GLBA are also ex- empt from notification requir ements. If more than 500 residents are affected by the breach, persons, businesses,and agencies that qualify fo r a HIPAA exemption and fi- nancial institutions that qualify for the GLBA exemptionmust report the breach to the Office of the Attorney Gen-eral.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1088 C 165 L 15 Modifying per diem compensation for flood control zone district supervisors. By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representative Takko). House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: Special Purpose Districts . Special purpose districts (SPDs) are local governments separate from acity, town, or county government that are created to pro- vide a limited number of public facilities or services.Members of a SPD governing body may be elected or ap- pointed to office, or serve in ex officio capacities as the re- sult of holding other offices. Special purpose district supervisors or directors elect- ed to office may receive compensation, not to exceed cer-tain dollar threshold amounts, for each day or portion of aday spent in actual attendance at official meetings or inperformance of their duties. Different SPD statutes, in- cluding, for example, those governing port, water, sewer, diking, drainage, irrigation, and flood control districts, re-quire periodic adjustments for inflation to the dollar thresholds, generally by usin g the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers for Wash-ington. Flood Control Zone Districts . Flood control zone dis- tricts (zones) are a type of SPD created for the purpose of undertaking, operating, or maintaining flood control or storm water control projects, or groups of projects, that areof special benefit to specified areas of the county. Zonesare governed by a board of supervisors. In general, thecounty commissioners in a county where a zone is createdserve by virtue of their offices as the zone's board of super-visors. However, for zones containing more than 2,000residents, an election of supe rvisors other than the county commissioners may be held. In zones with elected superv isors, supervisors may re- ceive up to $70 for attendance at official meetings and foreach day or major part of a day performing necessary ser-vices in connection with their duties. The county commis- sioners fix the amount of co mpensation, if any, paid to initial supervisors during their initial terms of office, andthereafter, supervisors fix the amount of compensation. A supervisor may choose to waiv e any or all of their com- pensation by written waiver. The maximum amount of su pervisors' compensation that may be fixed by the county commissioners or super-visors is as follows: (1) pe r diem compensation for atten- dance of meetings and performance of official duties maynot exceed $70 per day; and (2) total compensation in one calendar year may not exceed $6,720. Adjustments for in-flation to these amounts are no t required or authorized. In addition to compensation, supervisors are entitled to reimbursement for reasonab le expenses incurred in the performance of their duties as a supervisor, including re-imbursements for food, lodgin g, and mileage on private vehicles. Consumer Price Index . The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in prices of all goods and ser-vices purchased for consumption by urban households. Itis used to illustrate the extent that prices have risen or the amount of inflation that has taken place. The CPI reflects spending patterns for each of two population groups: allurban consumers (CPI-U); and urban wage earners andclerical workers (CPI-W). The CPI is prepared and pub-House 97 0 Senate 47 0HB 1090 22lished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States De- partment of Labor. Summary: The maximum dollar amounts for supervi- sors' compensation are increa sed. Compensation for su- pervisors, as fixed by the county commissioners or thesupervisors, may not exceed $114 per day and $10,944 percalendar year. The per diem compensation rate for super-visors in office on January 1, 2015, is $114. The Office of Financial Management is required to ad- just for inflation the statutor y dollar thresholds for super- visor compensation every five years, beginning July 1, 2018. Adjustments for inflation must be based upon theCPI-W for Washington, and must be calculated and trans- mitted for publication to the Office of the Code Reviser atleast one month before the new threshold is to take effect.

By Representatives Kirby, Jinkins and Rodne; by request of Attorney General. House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Senate Committee on Law & JusticeSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Financial Fraud and Identity Theft Crimes Investigation and Pr osecution Program (Program) was created in 2008 within the Department of Commerce and is set to expire on July 1, 2015. The Program consistsof two regional financial fraud and identity theft crimetask forces: the Central Puge t Sound Task Force that in- cludes King and Pierce counties and the Spokane CountyTask Force. The task forces include re presentatives of local law enforcement agencies, county prosecutors, the Office of the Attorney General, financ ial institutions, and other law enforcement entities. The task forces employ law enforce- ment, investigation, and pros ecutorial staff dedicated to investigating and prosecuting financial fraud and identity theft crimes, with a focus on complex regional and multi- jurisdictional cases. The Program is funded th rough surcharges on filings with the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Program with- in the Department of Licensing.

By Representatives Van De Wege, Klippert, Carlyle, and Morris; by request of Attorney General. House Committee on Technology & Economic Develop- ment Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: Ticket Web Robots . Ticket bots or web ro- bots are software programs used to interfere with or dis-rupt the operation of ticket sales over the Internet or to buy up a substantial portion of th e available tickets for later private resale. Interference by ticket bots includes gaining unauthorized priority access to purchasing tickets and re-ducing access of the general public to online ticket sales atthe intended, original price. Commonly affected ticket sales include those for concer ts, sporting events, and other entertainment events. Consumer Protection Act . The Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA) declares that unfair and deceptive practices in trade or commerce are illegal. The CPA al- lows a person injured by an un fair or deceptive practice to bring a private cause of action for damages. The Office ofthe Attorney General may investigate and prosecuteclaims under the CPA on behalf of the state or individualsin the state. Under the CPA, \"person\" includes natural persons, corporations, trusts, unincorporated associations, and part-nerships.

A \"ticket seller\" is a person that makes admission tick- ets available at an initial presale or sale to the general pub-lic, either directly or indirectly. The use or sale of software with the purpose to inter- fere with or disrupt the opera tion of Internet ticket sales is found to be an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerceand an unfair method of co mpetition for the purposes of applying the CPA. The use or sale of applicable software is only a viola- tion of the CPA if the user or seller knows or should knowthat the purpose of the software is to interfere with or dis- rupt ticket sales over the Internet.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 E2SHB 1095 C 19 L 15 E 3 Promoting thermal energy efficiency. By House Committee on Appropriations (originally spon- sored by Representatives Morris and Hudgins). House Committee on Technol ogy & Economic Develop- ment House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Energy , Environment & Telecom- munications Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Energy Conservation in Design of Public Facilities . Public agencies must analyze the cost of ener- gy consumption for each majo r facility to be planned and constructed or renovated after September 8, 1975. A \"ma-jor facility\" is any publicly owned or leased building hav- ing 25,000 square feet or more of usable floor space. Alife-cycle cost analysis must be prepared during the design phase for each newly constructed or renovated majorfacility. The life-cycle cost an alysis includes an energy- consumption analysis of all energy systems of a major fa-cility that must be prepared by a professional engineer or licensed architect. The public agency must approve the major facility's life-cycle cost analysis before commence-ment of actual construction or renovation. Electric Utility Resource Planning . All investor- owned and consumer-owned el ectric utilities with more than 25,000 customers in Wash ington must develop an In- tegrated Resource Plan (IRP) . All other utilities in the state must file either an IRP or a less detailed resourceplan. The minimum required compon ents of an IRP include the following: an assessment of commercially available conserva- tion and efficiency resour ces, which may include high efficiency cogeneration (combined heat and power); an assessment of commerci ally available, utility scale renewable and nonrenewable generating technolo- gies; and a comparative evaluation of renewable and nonre- newable generating resources. The Utilities and Transportation Commission . The Utilities and Transportation Co mmission (UTC) regulates the rates, services, and practices of privately-owned utili-ties and transportation compan ies in Washington. Compa- nies providing the following goods or services areregulated by the UTC: electric ity, natural gas, certain tele- communications services, wa ter, solid waste collection, commercial ferry service, transportation of householdgoods, certain auto transportation services, and transporta-tion of petroleum through pipelines. The UTC is requiredto ensure that rates charged are \"fair, just and reasonable.\" District Thermal Energy Systems . The UTC has lim- ited regulatory authority over a district thermal energy sys- tem owned or operated by a thermal energy company. A\"district thermal energy syst em\" is any system that pro- vides thermal energy for space heating, space cooling, orprocess uses from a central plant and distributes thermalenergy to two or more buildin gs. A \"thermal energy com- pany\" is any private person, company, association, part-nership, joint venture, or corporation engaged indeveloping, producing, distri buting, or selling to, or for the public, thermal energy services for any beneficial useother than electricity generation. Air Operating Permits . The Department of Ecology and seven local air quality ag encies administer Washing- ton's air operating permit standards under the WashingtonClean Air Act. An air opera ting permit specifies certain requirements for air pollution sources, including permissi- ble emission levels. Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology . Federal major source boiler maximum achievable controltechnology (boiler MACT) rule s apply to boilers and pro- cess heaters in major sources. A \"major source\" is an in-dustrial, commercial, or ins titutional facility that emits 10 tons per year (tpy) or more of any single hazardous air pol-lutant or 25 tpy or more of total hazardous air pollutants.The boiler MACT rule s require affected boilers and pro- cess heaters to complete a on e-time energy assessment that identifies energy sa vings opportunities. Summary: Energy Conservation in Design of Public Fa- cilities . The list of facilities for which analysis of the cost of energy consumption is required is expanded to includecritical governmental facilities. A \"critical governmental facility\" is a publicly-owned building or district energysystem that is expected to:House 98 0 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 94 1 (House concurred)E2SHB 1095 24 be continuously occupied; maintain operations for at least 6,000 hours each year; have a peak electricity demand exceeding 500 kilo- watts (kW); and serve a critical public health or public safety function during a natural disaster or other emergency situationthat may result in a wi despread power outage. An energy-consumption analysis conducted as part of a life-cycle cost analysis fo r a major facility or critical governmental facility must include the identification and analysis of critical loads for each energy system and, for a critical government facility, a combined heat and powersystem feasibility assessment. Electric Utility Resource Planning . By December 31, 2016, an electric utility that has over 25,000 customers in Washington and that conduc ts an assessment which iden- tifies dispatchable opportuni ties for combined heat and power and must value combin ed heat and power as having both energy and capacity va lue for the purposes of setting the value of power under the federal Public Utility Regu- latory Policies Act, establishi ng rates for power purchase agreements, and integrat ed resource planning. Electric utilities with over 25,000 customers in Wash- ington are encouraged to offer a minimum term of 15 yearsfor new power purchase agreem ents for the electric output of combined heat and powe r systems beginning December 31, 2016. The Utilities and Transpor tation Commission (UTC) may authorize recovery of the actual cost of fuel incurred by an electrical company under a power purchase agree-ment for the electric output of a combined heat and powersystem. The governing body of a consumer-owned utility that offers a 15-year mini mum power purchase agreement for the electric output of combined heat and power may, every five years after signing the agreement, initiate a fuel cost adjustment process. An electric utility that is re quired to develop an inte- grated resource plan (IRP) may include combined heat andpower systems among the meas ures in a conservation sup- curve in the utility's asse ssment for dema nd side re- sources. The Department of Commerce must submit any re- ports it receives of existin g and potential combined heat and power facilities in IRPs to the Washington State Uni-versity Extension Energy Program (WSU Energy Pro-gram) for analysis. The WSU Energy Program maysubmit an annual report elec tronically to the appropriate legislative committees on th e planned and completed com- bined heat and power facilities in Washington. Thermal Energy Systems . The UTC has limited regu- latory authority over any th ermal energy system owned or operated by a thermal energy company or by a combined heat and power fac ility engaged in thermal energy ser- vices. The UTC retains the au thority to issue or enforceany order affecting combined heat and power facilities owned or operated by an electrical company that are sub-sidized by a regulated service. References to \"district\" thermal energy systems are re- moved. A \"thermal energy system\" is any system that pro-vides thermal energy for space heating, space cooling, orprocess uses from a central pl ant or combined heat and power facility, and that distributes the thermal energy totwo or more buildings. Air Operating Permits . The Department of Ecology (DOE) must establish a general air operating permit orpermit by rule for stationary natural gas engines used in a combined heat and power system. The general permit orpermit must establish emission limits for air contaminantsreleased by stationary natural gas engines and is to be ad- opted and implemented as th e permitting mechanism for the new construction of a co mbined heat and power sys- tem. Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology . An owner or operator of an industrial, commercial, or in-stitutional boiler or process heat er that is required to com- plete an energy assessment under federal major sourceboiler maximum achievable co ntrol technology (boiler MACT) rules must: by January 31, 2018, submit nonproprietary informa- tion reported in the energy assessment electronicallyto the DOE or to the air pollution control authority that issues the air operatin g permit for the source; and by January 31, 2018, submit a report electronically to the WSU Energy Program that identifies, if applica- ble, the economic, technical, and other barriers to implementing thermal energy efficiency opportuni- ties identified in the energy assessment. The reporting requirement does not apply if an owner or operator of a boiler or process heater is not required tocomplete an energy assessment under federal boilerMACT rules or if, prior to the reporting dates, the owneror operator is no longer re quired to complete the energy assessment. An owner or operator of a boiler or process heater who has not completed an energy assessment under federalboiler MACT rules must request a free combined heat andpower site qualification scr eening from the U.S. Depart- ment of Energy.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015House 98 0 House 95 2 Senate 44 0SHB 1105 25SHB 1105 C 3 L 15 Making 2015 supplemental operating appropriations. By House Committee on Appropriations (originally spon- sored by Representatives Hu nter, Ormsby, Sullivan and Gregerson; by request of Governor Inslee). House Committee on Appropriations Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The state government operates on a fiscal biennium that begins on July 1 of each odd-numberedyear. A two-year biennial operating budget is adopted ev-ery odd-numbered year. Supplemental budgets frequentlyare enacted in each of the fo llowing two years after adop- tion of the biennial budget. Appropriations are made inthe biennial and supplemental budgets for the operation ofstate government and its vari ous agencies and institutions, including higher education, as well as allocations for the funding of K-12 public schools. The 2013-15 Biennial Oper ating Budget was enacted in 2013 and a supplemental operating budget was adoptedin 2014. The 2013-15 Biennial Operating Budget, afterthe 2014 supplemental, approp riates $33.8 billion from the State Near General Fund (Sta te General Fund and the Ed- ucation Legacy Trust Account) plus the Opportunity Path- ways Account. The total budgeted amount, whichincludes state, federal, and other funds, is $67.6 billion. Under the state Constitution, 1 percent of general state revenues is deposited into the Budget Stabilization Ac-count (BSA) each fiscal year, as is extraordinary revenuegrowth. The Legislature ma y appropriate from the BSA by a constitutional (simple) majority of each chamber of the Legislature if: (1) forecasted state employment growthfor a fiscal year is less than 1 percent; (2) the Governor de- clares an emergency resulting from a catastrophic event;or (3) the balance in the account exceeds 10 percent ofgeneral state revenues for the fiscal year, but only for the portion that exceeds 10 percent of general state revenuesand only for educational cons truction. Other appropria- tions require a three-fifths affirmative vote by each cham-ber of the Legislature. Summary: Supplemental changes are made to the 2013- 15 Biennial Operating Budget relating to fund ing for fires and disasters, children and family services, mental healthservices, and the judgment against the state in Rekhter v. Washington Department of Social and Health Services . State Near General Fund plus Opportunity Pathways appropriations for the 2013-15 biennium are increased by $66.2 million. In addition, $77.2 million is appropriated from the BSA for fires and ot her disasters, including mo- bilization, response, and recove ry. The total budget is in- creased by $217.9 million. The Economic and Revenue Forecast Council must produce a revenue forecast in February 2015 instead ofMarch 2015.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: February 19, 2015 2EHB 1115 PARTIAL VETO C 3 L 15 E 3 Concerning the capital budget. By Representatives Dunshee, DeBolt, Gregerson, Morris and Reykdal; by request of Governor Inslee. House Committee on Capital Budget Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Washington operates on a biennial cycle for the operating, transportatio n, and capital budgets. The Legislature authorizes expenditures for capital projects inthe omnibus capital appropri ations act (capital budget). The biennial capital budget is passed in the odd-numbered years, and a supplemental bu dget making adjustments to the biennial budget is often passed during the even-num- bered years. The current capital budget covers the periodfrom July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2015. Historically, approximately half of the capital budget is financed by state genera l obligation bonds and the bal- ance is funded by dedicated accounts, trust revenue, andfederal funding sources. The capital budget includes appropriations for the ac- quisition, construction, and repa ir of capital assets such as state office buildings, prisons, juvenile rehabilitation cen- ters, residential habilitation ce nters, mental health facili- ties, military readiness center s, and higher education facilities. The capital budget also funds a variety of envi- ronmental and natural resource projects, parks and recre-ational facilities, public K-12 school construction, andgrant and loan programs that support housing, public in-frastructure, community service facilities, and art and his-torical projects. Summary: The act includes the 2015-17 Capital Budget and the 2015 Supplemental Capital Budget. It authorizesnew capital projects for 2015 -17 totaling $3.9 billion, of which $2.2 billion is financed from state general obliga-tion bonds and $1.7 billion is financed from other funds. Included are authorizations fo r state agencies to enter into alternative financing contract s totaling $225 million. The act also reappropriates $2.9 billion for uncompleted proj- ects approved in prior biennia. In addition, the act makes adjustments to the 2013-15 Capital Budget, including appropriation increases of $68.6million and appropriation decr eases of $182.5 million, for a net decrease of $113.9 million. Reappropriations arealso decreased by a net of $3.5 million.

Section 3241 appropriated $500,000 to the Department of Natural Re-sources to commission researc h and a report by the Wash- ington State Institute for Pu blic Policy on the transfer of federal lands to Washington st ate. Section 7044 required the Office of Financial Management to develop a master plan to address the storage and preservation requirements of the state's historical and cultural collections. VETO MESSAGE ON 2EHB 1115 June 30, 2015 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 3241 and 7044, Second Engrossed House Bill No. 1115 entitled: \"AN ACT capital pages 158-159, Depa rtment of Natural Resourc- es, Research on Transfer for Fe deral Lands to Washington State This proviso directs the Depart ment of Natural Resources to study the feasibility of acquiring certain federal lands for possible inclusion in the various trust lands managed by the Department. Although additional information about land acquisitions is always helpful, the negative effects of fo rest health, and the resulting fire danger, are well documented. Th e Department's primary responsi- bility is to support the trust bene ficiaries, and this study will not support its obligation to generate revenue for school construction. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 3241. Section 7044, pages 278-279, Office of Financial Manage- ment, Master Plan for Museums and Research Facilities This proviso requires the Offi ce of Financial Management (OFM) to develop a master plan to address the storage and pres- ervation requirements of the state' s historical coll ections by De- cember 31, 2015. While ensuring the preservation of our state'shistorical and cultural collections is a priority, this proviso does not provide funding or enough tim e for a thorough plan to be de- veloped. For these reasons, I hav e vetoed Section 7044. However, I have directed OFM to work with the Washington State Historical Society and the Eastern Washington Historical Society to address this issue.

By Representatives Takko, Morris, Springer and Fey.House Committee on Commerce & Gaming Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: No person may sell or distribute beer or wine without a license from the Liquor Control Board(Board), and licenses are divided into two categories:those for on-premises consumption and off-premisesconsumption. The Board issues many types of liquor li-censes permitting the service of beer and wine for on- premises consumption, including beer and/or wine restau-rants, taverns, night clubs, and breweries and microbrew-eries. In general, no person, even a licensee, may serve any alcoholic beverage free of charge. There are several ex-ceptions, including farmers markets, wineries, and grocerystores in which the licensee is specifically authorized toserve samples; however, but not all licensees have such anexception. Licensees permitted to serve samples are lim-ited to serving samples no larger than 2 ounces, up to a to-tal of 2 to 4 ounces per day, depending on the license.Some licenses do not have a limit. Summary: Any licensee authorized to serve wine or beer on tap for on-premises consumption may serve samples ofbeer and wine free of charge. Samples must be 2 ouncesor smaller, and licensees may provide a maximum of 4ounces of samples per customer per day. Licensed domestic wineries, grocery stores, beer and wine specialty shops, and qu alifying farmers markets that are already permitted for samp ling and tasting are exempt. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESHB 1126 C 199 L 15 Concerning department of ea rly learning fatality reviews. By House Committee on Early Learning & Human Ser- vices (originally sponsored by Representatives Kagi,MacEwen, Tarleton, Walsh, Goodman, Senn, Gregersonand Ryu). House Committee on Early Le arning & Human Services House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & HousingHouse 96 2 Senate 39 10 (Senate amended) House 96 2 Senate 44 1 House 93 5Senate 44 5 (Senate amended)House 93 3 (House concurred)SHB 1127 27Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Department of Early Learning (DEL) licenses child care centers an d family home providers in Washington. Licensing requirements are established instatute and in DEL rules. The stated purpose of licensingrequirements is to promote the health and safety of chil-dren attending child care programs. Licensure compo-nents include requirements such as child developmenttrainings, CPR and First Aid trainings, criminal back-ground checks, and health and safety checks. In 1996 the Legislature established the Office of the Family and Children's Ombuds (OFCO). The OFCO in-vestigates complaints about agency actions or inactions, specifically complaints that involve a child at risk of abuse, neglect, or other harm or a child or parent involvedwith child protection or child welfare services. The OFCOcollaborates with the Department of Health and SocialServices (DSHS) and the Children's Administration (CA)to conduct child fatality or near fatality reviews when the cause of the fatality is suspect ed to involve child abuse or neglect of a minor in the care of the DSHS or a supervising agency. The child fatality reviews offer a systematic eval- uation of the events and circ umstances surrounding a child fatality or near fatality inci dent. After completion of a child fatality review, both th e CA and the OFCO issue re- ports and recommendations to the Legislature. The childfatality review process is used to identify gaps in practice and make recommendations on improvements to promote the health and safety of child ren in the child welfare sys- tem. Summary: Child Fatality Review . The DEL must con- vene a child fatality review committee to conduct a review when a child fatality, or in some cases near fatality, occursin an early learning program or a licensed child care center or home. In the case of a near child fatality, the DEL mustconsult with the OFCO to dete rmine if a review should be conducted. The child fata lity review committee must be comprised of individuals with appropriate expertise, in-cluding but not limited to ex perts from outside the DEL with knowledge of early lear ning licensing requirements and program standards, a law enforcement officer with in-vestigative experience, a representative from a county orstate health department, and a child advocate with exper-tise in child fatalities. The D EL must invite one parent or guardian for membership on the committee who had achild die in a child care setting. The DEL must ensure thatthe committee is made up of individuals who had no pre-vious involvement in the case. While conducting the re-view, the DEL and the fata lity review committee must have access to all relevant r ecords regarding the child that have been produced or retained by the early learning pro-gram provider, licensed child care center provider, or li-censed family home provider. Nothing in the act creates a duty for the OFCO as related to children in the care of anearly learning program, a licensed child care, or a licensedchild care home. Child Fatality Review Report . When a child fatality or near fatality review is co nducted, the DEL must issue a report on the results of the re view within 180 days, unless an extension is granted by the Governor. The report mustbe submitted to the appropriate committees of the Legisla-ture and posted to a public website where all child fatality review reports must be posted and maintained. The DELmay redact confidential info rmation from the public re- port. The child fatality re view committee must develop recommendations to the DEL and the Legislature regard-ing changes in licensing requirements, practice, or policyto prevent fatalities and streng then safety and health pro- tections for children in child care. Civil Proceedings . The child fatality or near fatality review is subject to discovery in a civil or administrativeproceeding, but may not be admitted into evidence. Doc-uments prepared by the ch ild fatality review committee are inadmissible and may not be used in a civil or admin- istrative proceeding. Individuals responsible for conduct-ing the review, including me mbers of the child fatality review committee and DEL em ployees, may not be exam- ined in a civil or administrative proceeding regarding the following: (1) the work of the child fatality review com- mittee; (2) the incident under review; or (3) employee's or member's statements, deliberations, thoughts, analyses, orimpressions relating to the incident under review. A per-son is not unavailable as a witness merely because he orshe was interviewed by the child fatality review commit-tee, but as a witness the person may not be examined re-garding interactions with the child fatality review. Thecivil and administrative pro ceeding restrictions outlined do not apply in licensing or disciplinary proceedings aris-ing from allegations of wron gdoing in connection with a child fatality or near fatality review.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1127 C 68 L 15 Creating the agricultural labor skills and safety program. By House Committee on Labo r (originally sponsored by Representatives Chandler and Sells). Background: The Department of Labor and Industries (Agency) is responsible for regulating safety in the work-place. The Agency creates educational materials, such assafety videos, and makes those available on its website.Some materials, such as videos on tractor safety and heatexposure, focus on the agricultural industry. Five years ago, money was appropriated to implement an agricultural worker safety grant to provide agriculturalHouse 86 11 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 90 8 (House concurred)SHB 1132 28workers training related to farm skills, English as a second language, and other skills. Th e grant was administered by the Agency with the Departme nt of Agriculture. Funding for that grant program was not renewed. Summary: Subject to appropriated funds, the Depart- ment of Commerce (Department) must create and admin-ister the Agricultural Labor Skills and Safety GrantProgram. The Department must select one grant recipientthat has a community-based organization whose primarypurpose is to provide servic es to Washington agricultural workers. The Department must ensure that participation in training is voluntary. Tr aining is intended to improve the employability of workers living in Washington and to improve skills of those who wo rk on a permanent, local seasonal, or seasonal migrant basis, and who intend to re-turn to Washington to work in agriculture. The grant recipient must work with agricultural em- ployee and employer organizations to: design and implement th e skills program and provide health and safety training; develop a plan to increase the number of skilled agri- cultural workers through outreach; evaluate trainings and service delivery strategies for agricultural workers and employers; partner with an agricultural employee and an agricul- tural employer organization that has focused on agri- cultural labor and employme nt issues and services for at least 10 years and has experience in providingtraining to agricultural employees; and use a training delivery sy stem that is sensitive to the needs of agricultural em ployees and employers. The grant recipient may receive up to $1 million per year. The provisions creating the grant program expireJuly 1, 2018.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1132 C 66 L 15 Concerning the regulation of adult family homes. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Representatives Tharinger, Harris,Wylie, Appleton, Ortiz-Self, Hayes, Gregersonand Short). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health Care Background: Adult family homes are community-based facilities licensed to care for up to six individuals who need long-term care. These homes provide room, board,laundry, necessary supervision, and assistance with activ- ities of daily living, personal care, and nursing services. Adult family homes are lice nsed by the Department of Social and Health Services (Department). Adult family homes must meet facility st andards as well as require- ments for training resident managers and caregivers. Staffof adult family homes who ar e employed as long-term care workers must meet specific training requirements and, insome instances, become cer tified as home care aides. Fees for adult family homes are established in the op- erating budget. The annual renewal fee is currently $225per bed and the processing fee for initial licensure is$2,750. The Department, by rule, also applies the process-ing fee to applications involving a change of ownership orchange of location. Summary: The change of ownership fee for adult family homes that is established in rule is codified in statute. The fee amount is to be determin ed in the operating budget. The Department of Social and Health Services (De- partment) may allow a one-time waiver of all or part of li-censing, processing, and change-of-ownership fees for anadult family home if paymen t of the fee would present a hardship to the applicant. The Department may also ex- tend the timeframe for an ap plicant to complete adminis- tration and business planning class requirements. Theextension may be for up to four months. The Departmentmay issue the license prior to the completion of the class if the applicant has enrolled in or completed the class. The waiver and the extension appl y in situations in which an adult family home is being relicensed because of excep- tional circumstances, such as the death or incapacity of aprovider.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1138 C 67 L 15 Creating a task force on mental health and suicide preven- tion in higher education. By House Committee on Higher Education (originally sponsored by Representatives Or wall, Haler, Blake, Car- lyle, Committee on Higher Education Senate Committee on Higher EducationSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Suicide Statistics . According to the De- partment of Health, suicide is the second leading cause of death for Washington youth between the ages of 10 and 24.Suicide rates among Washington youth are higher than theHouse 90 8 Senate 49 0House 98 0 Senate 49 0SHB 1145 29national average. In 2012 and 2013, over 200 youth be- tween the ages of 18 and 24 died by suicide. In those sameyears, over 1,000 youth ages 18 to 24 required hospitaliza-tion due to a self-inflicted nonf atal injury. For each youth between the ages of 10 and 24 who dies by suicide, the av-erage cost is nearly $2,000,0 00 in future work loss and $5,000 in medical costs. The estimated cost for each non-fatal suicide attempt that resu lts in hospitalization is about $11,000 in medical costs and $24,000 in work loss. According to the National Ce nter for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah, vete rans face an elevated risk of suicide as compared to the ge neral population; nearly half of college students who are United States military veteranshave had thoughts of suicide. Nearly 8 percent of veteran college students reported a su icide attempt compared to a little over 1 percent of other college students. According to the National College Health Assessment Survey, sponsored by the American College Health Asso-ciation, almost 10 percent of college students reported that they had seriously considered attempting suicide and 1.5 percent of students reported that they had attempted sui- cide, within the last school year. Forefront . Forefront at the University of Washington focuses on introducing changes to suicide prevention by: educating and empowering individuals and communi- ties to advocate for and to implement suicide preven- tion strategies; training health professionals to develop and sharpen skills in the assessment, management, and treatment of suicide risk; supporting secondary schools and colleges imple- menting comprehensive plans to promote mentalhealth services; and guiding news media in responsible reporting on men- tal health and suicide that accurately portrays the real- ity of hope and recovery. Summary: A Task Force on Mental Health and Suicide Prevention at the Higher Education Institutions (Task Force) is created to determine what policies, resources,and technical assistance are n eeded to support the institu- tions in improving access to mental health services andimproving suicide prevention responses. Certain agenciesand experts must be members of the Task Force. Forefront at the University of Washington must staff the Task Forceand convene the initial meeting. The Task Force, in cooper ation with the public and private institutions, must obta in data related to mental health services, suicide prevention and response, anddeaths by suicide at the public and private institutions, in- cluding: protocols for responding to students in distress that cover intervention, treatment, reentry, and post-crisis intervention; data on on-campus use of student behavioral health services over the past five years; and information on the rela tionship between emotional distress and student withdrawal.

By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Haler and Fey). House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: Counties - Regular and Special Meetings of Legislative Authorities . Washington counties provide re- gional services to all residents within their jurisdiction, in-cluding administering elections and furnishing judicialservices, and a broader array of services to residents in un-incorporated areas. County legislative authorities must hold regular meet- ings at the county seat to tr ansact any business required or permitted by law. Although th e term \"regular meeting\" is not defined in statutory provisions governing counties, theMunicipal Research and Services Center defines \"regularmeeting\" as one that is held according to a schedule adopt- ed by the applicable public governing body. The location requirements for special meetings are less restrictive and authorize county legislative authorities to hold special meetings (m eetings that are not held ac- cording to an adopted schedul e) to transact the business of the county at any location with in the county if the agenda item or items are of unique interest or concern to the citi-zens in the area of the county in which the special meeting is to be held. Special meetings have spec ific notice and transaction requirements. The notices of special meetings must be: delivered at least 24 hours be fore the meeting to request-House 91 6 Senate 49 0SHB 1157 30ing newspapers and radio and television stations; posted on the agency's website; and prominently displayed at the main entrance of the entity's pr incipal location and, if ap- plicable, the meeting site. The notices must specify the time and place of the special meeting and the business tobe transacted. Final dispositio n actions may not be taken on any matter that is not specified in the notice. Neither regular nor specia l meeting provisions for counties include permissions, requirements, or other gov- erning conditions related to joint meetings of county leg- islative authorities in a single location. Attorney General Opinion . On November 14, 2014, the Attorney General of Wa shington issued an opinion stating that the legislative au thority of one county may not meet within another county's borders, to discuss joint, bi- county projects. The opinion also stated that the Legisla- ture could authorize these join t meetings, but that it has not yet done so. Summary: Any two or more county legislative authori- ties may hold a joint regular or special meeting in a partic- ipating county if the agenda item or items relate to actions or considerations of mutual in terest or concern to the par- ticipating legislative authoritie s. A joint regular meeting may only be held at the county seat of a participating coun- ty. A legislative authority pa rticipating in a joint regular meeting must, for purposes of the meeting, comply with notice requirements for specia l meetings. This special meeting notice requirement do es not apply to the legisla- tive authority of the county in which the joint regular meeting will be held. If the joint legislative authority meeting is a special meeting, the meeting may be he ld at the county seat or oth- er agreed upon location within the jurisdiction of a partic- ipating county. In the event of a joint regu lar meeting, each participat- ing county retains its authority to transact any business re- quired or permitted by law. In the event of a joint special meeting, each county retains it s authority to transact busi- ness of the county.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1157 C 1 L 15 E 2 Modifying the apportionment of quick title service fees collected by appointed subagents.

House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on TransportationBackground: Vehicle and vessel title changes may be made at a county auditor's office, offices of other agents orsubagents, or at the Department of Licensing (DOL). Theapplicant must complete a vehicle or vessel certificate ofownership application. Documentation and the requiredtaxes and fees are collected at the location and sent to theDOL. Quick titles are defined as a certificate of ownershipprinted at the time of applica tion and given to the applicant immediately. The application for a quick title of a vehicle must be submitted by the owner or the owner's representative to the DOL, participating county aud itor or other agent, or sub- agent appointed by the Director of the DOL, on a form fur-nished or approved by the DOL. The application mustcontain: a description of the vehicle, including make, model, vehicle identification number, type of body, and the odometer reading at the time of delivery of the vehi- cle, when required; the name and address of the person who is to be the registered owner of the vehicle and, if the vehicle is subject to a security inter est, the name and address of the secured party; and other information as may be required by the DOL.

By House Committee on Capita l Budget (originally spon- sored by Representatives Dunshee, Gregerson and De-Bolt; by request of Governor Inslee). House Committee on Capital Budget Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The State Finance Committee (Commit- tee), composed of the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor,and the State Treasurer, is responsible for supervising andcontrolling the issuance of a ll state bonds. The Committee periodically issues general obligation bonds to financeprojects authorized in the Ca pital Budget. No bonds may be authorized for sale withou t prior legislative appropria- tion of the net proceeds. General obligation bonds pled ge the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the state towards payment of debt ser-vice. Funding to pay for principal and interest on generalobligation bonds is appropriated from the State GeneralFund in the Operating Budget . When debt service pay- ments are due, the State Treasurer withdraws the amountsnecessary to make the payments and deposits them intobond retirement funds. A bond bill authorizes the Committee to issue general obligation bonds up to a specific amount to finance manyof the projects in the Capital Budget. It specifies theamount of bonds to be issued , the account or accounts into which bond sale proceeds are to be deposited, and identi-fies sources and timing of debt service payments. Legis-lation authorizing the issuan ce of bonds requires a 60 percent majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Summary: The Committee is authorized to issue up to $2,332,456,000 in state general obligation bonds to fi-nance projects in the 2015-17 Capital Budget and to payexpenses incurred in the issu ance and sale of the bonds. Proceeds from the sale of the bonds must be deposited into the State Building Co nstruction Account.

By Representatives Ormsby, Chandler, Sullivan and Tar- leton; by request of Select Committee on Pension Policy. House Committee on Appropriations Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The various plans of the Washington State Retirement System each contai n rules prescribing the cir- cumstances under which a retir ed employee may return to employment within a retireme nt- system-covered position and continue to receive retirement benefits. The 2011 Legislature passed Engrossed Substitute House Bill (ESHB) 1981 (Chapter 47, Laws of 2011, 1stsp.s), which made numerous changes to the rules underwhich a retired employee may return to employment fromthe Public Employees' Retireme nt System (PERS) and the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) in particular provi-sions allowing PERS and TRS Pl an 1 members to work for up to 1,500 hours per year for three years (or certain part-time equivalents) without susp ension of retirement bene- fits were eliminated. Prior to the passage of ESHB 1981, retirees from the Plans 2 or 3 of PERS, TRS, the School Employees' Retire- ment System (SERS), or the Pu blic Safety Employees' Re- tirement System (PSERS) who have been separated from service for one calendar month after their accrual date may work in a retirement-eligible position for up to 867 hours per calendar year without a reduction in pension benefits. An eligible position for purposes of the state retire- ment systems is generally on e in which retirement benefits can be earned by an employee, unless there is some indi-vidual restriction on benefits eligibility, such as alreadybeing retired, or the employee is stopped from member-ship due to prior service earned in another state-adminis-tered retirement plan. Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1981 removed the 867-hour option for PERS Plans 2/3 members who returnto work in other systems (e.g . TRS, SERS, etc.), meaning these retirees will experience an immediate suspension of benefits so long as they con tinue working. The PERS re-House 97 0 House 88 1 Senate 42 1House 96 2 House 96 2 Senate 43 1ESHB 1170 32tirees who return to work in PERS-covered positions may continue to work up to 867 hours per year without a sus- pension of benefits. Engro ssed Substitute House Bill 1981 also applied the 867-hour limit to PERS retirees workingin ineligible positions. The Department of Retirem ent Systems (DRS) reports that it is not administering the changes made to the PERSPlans 2 and 3 benefits as th ey apply to members who re- turn to work in other systems or return in ineligible posi- tions. Summary: The PERS retirees who re turn to work in po- sitions covered by other DR S-administered retirement systems will continue to rece ive retirement benefits for the first 867 hours of employment per calendar year. The ap-plication of the 867-hour retu rn-to-work rules to PERS re- tirees is to reti rees hired into retirement benefits-eligible positions.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESHB 1170 C 35 L 15 Granting port districts cert ain administrative powers.

By Representatives Stanford, Vi ck and Ryu; by request of Insurance Commissioner. House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance Background: In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 insurance regulators developed more tools to assess thesolvency of insurers and potential risks to which they may be exposed. These new assessment tools are contained inthe model act which implemen ts the Own Risk and Sol- vency Assessment (ORSA) and has been adopted by theNational Association of In surance Commissioners (NA- IC). It has also been made part of the NAIC accreditation requirements for state insurance agencies. Summary: Own Risk and Solvency Assessment . Risk Management Framework . An insurer must maintain a risk management framework to assi st the insurer with identify- ing, assessing, monitoring, ma naging, and reporting on its material and relevant risks. The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment, and it was developed as a process formaintaining a risk management framework. ORSA Summary Report . The ORSA Summary Report (Report) is a confidential hi gh-level ORSA summary of an insurer or insurance group. An insurer must regularly con- duct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to theORSA Guidance Manual (Manual), which was developedby the NAIC. The ORSA must be conducted annually but also at any time when there ar e significant changes to the risk profile of the insurer or the insurance group of whichthe insurer is a member. Upon the request of th e Insurance Commissioner (Commissioner), and no more than once per year, an insur-er must submit to the Commissioner a Report or a combi-nation of Reports that togeth er contain the information described in the Manual.House 96 2 Senate 45 0HB 1179 34The Report must include the signature of the insurer or the insurance group's chief risk officer or other executivehaving responsibility for the ov ersight of the insurer's en- terprise risk management process. Such person must attestto the best of his or her be lief and knowledge that the in- surer applies the enterprise risk management process de-scribed in the Report and that a copy of the Report hasbeen provided to the insurer's board of directors or appro-priate governing committee. Exemption from ORSA Requirements. An insurer may be exempt from the ORSA requirements if it meets certaincriteria. Even if exempt, the Commissioner may still re-quire an insurer to maintain a risk management frame- work, conduct an ORSA, and file a Report based uponunique circumstances. This may occur in circumstanceswhere the insurer meets one or more of the criteria of aninsurer deemed to be in ha zardous financial condition, as set out in rule, or if the insurer otherwise exhibits the char-acteristics of a troubled insu rer, as determined by the Commissioner. Confidential Treatment of Documents and Informa- tion. The Report and other ORSA-related documents (Documents) in the possession or control of the Commis- sioner that are obtained by, created by, or disclosed to theCommissioner or any other person are recognized as pro-prietary and as containing tr ade secrets. They are confi- dential, privileged, and not su bject to the Public Records Act. They are also not subject to subpoena or discoveryand are not admissible in evid ence in any private civil ac- tion. The Commissioner is au thorized to use such Docu- ments in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal actionbrought as a part of the Commissioner's official duties.The Commissioner must obta in the prior written consent of the insurer before making such Documents public. Persons who have received Documents are not permit- ted or required to testify in any private civil action con-cerning the Documents or an y confidential materials, or information. Sharing of ORSA-Related Documents . The Commis- sioner may share Documents with other state, federal, andinternational regulatory ag encies, including members of any supervisory college, the NAIC, the International As- sociation of Insurance Superv isors, the Bank for Interna- tional Settlements, and with any third-party consultants designated by the Commissio ner. The recipients must agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and privi- leged status of the Documents and verify in writing the le- gal authority to maintain confidentiality. The Commissioner must maintain Documents re- ceived from regulatory official s of foreign or other domes- tic jurisdictions as confidenti al or privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the Docu- ments. The Commissioner must en ter into written agreements with the NAIC or a third-party consultant governing thesharing and use of informatio n provided. The agreementmust provide that the recipien t agrees to maintain the con- fidentiality and privileged st atus of the Documents and verify the legal authority to ma intain confidentiality. The NAIC or a third-party consultant is prohibited from stor-ing the information shared. Intervention in Judicial or Administrative Action . The Commissioner must require prompt notice to be given toan insurer whose confidential information is in the posses- sion of the NAIC or a third-pa rty consultant when such in- formation is subject to a request or a subpoena fordisclosure or production. Th e Commissioner must also re- quire the NAIC to consent to intervention by an insurer in any judicial or administrative action in which the NAICmay be required to disclose confidential info rmation about the insurer. Sanctions . After notice and a hearing, the Commis- sioner must require any insurer who fails without cause tofile the required Report to pay a fine of $500 for each day's delay. The maximum fine is $100,000. The Commission-er may reduce the fine if th e insurer demonstrates that the fine would impose a financia l hardship to the insurer.

There are two radiology: diagnostic radiology and inter-ventional imaging technology to diag nose a patient's symptoms, monitor responses to treatment, and to screen for illnesses. Interventional radiology uses medical imaging technology to guide procedures to trea t conditions such as cancer, blockages in arteries and vein s, liver problems, and kidney problems. Types of medical imaging technologies include computed tomography, magne tic resonance imaging, pos- itron emission tomography, medicine,and x-rays. Radiology benefit managers generally perform man- agement activities related to benefits for imaging services on behalf of health carriers. These may include develop-ing guidelines on the use of radiology services, conducting prior authorization activities, privileging certain providers to order radiology services, and profiling a provider's useof services to confirm that they meet certain benchmarks. Summary: Each radiology benefit manager that is owned by a health carrier or acts as a subcontractor to a health car- rier must register with the Department of Revenue's Busi-ness Licensing Program. To register, a radiology benefitmanager must submit an applic ation with identifying in- formation and a registration fee of $200. Radiology ben-efit managers must renew th eir registrations annually. \"Radiology benefit managers\" are persons who con- tract with, or are owned by, insurers or third-party payorsto provide services to: (1) process claims for services and procedures performed by radiologists or advanced diag-nostic imaging services providers; or (2) pay or authorizepayments to radiology clinics, radiologists, or advanceddiagnostic imaging services providers for services or pro-cedures.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1184 C 77 L 15 Increasing the health professi ons participating in online access to the University of Washington health sciences li-brary.

By Representatives Zeiger, Cl ibborn, Orcutt, Fey, Mo Haler, Condotta and Wilson. House Committee on Transportation Background: The State Environmental Policy Act . The State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) establishes a re-view process for state agencies and local governments toidentify possible environmen tal impacts that may result from non-exempted government actions. The actions in-clude project actions involvi ng decisions on specific proj- ects, such as the issuance of a permit, and nonproject actions involving decisions on policies and plans, includ- ing the adoption of land use pl ans and regulations. The in- formation collected through the SEPA review process maybe used to change a proposal to mitigate likely impacts orto condition or deny a propo sal when adverse environmen- tal impacts are identified. Provisions of the SEPA generally require a project ap- plicant to complete an nmental checklist. An envi- ronmental checklist includes qu estions about the potential environmental impacts of the proposal. This checklist isthen reviewed by the lead ag ency to determine whether the proposal is likely to have a significant adverse environ- mental impact. This enviro nmental threshold determina- tion is made by the lead agency and is documented inHouse 96 0 Senate 45 2House 89 9 Senate 48 0HB 1222 37either a determination of non significance or a determina- tion of significance. A determination of significance requires the prepara- tion of an environmental impa ct statement (EIS) by the lead agency. The EIS must include detailed information about the environmental impact of the project and any ad-verse environmental effects that cannot be avoided if theproposal is implemented. The EIS must also include alter-natives, including mitigatio n, to the proposed action. Analysis of environmental co nsiderations for an EIS may be required only for listed \"e lements\" of the natural and built environment. Specific categorical exemp tions from the EIS and oth- er requirements for actions meeting specified criteria areestablished in the SEPA. Emergency Contracting . The Washington State De- partment of Transportation (WSDOT), in the event of anaccident, earthquake, or othe r emergency that damages or threatens a state highway, may obtain at least three bidsfrom prequalified contractors without publishing a call forbids and award a contract to the lowest responsible bidder.The WSDOT is required to no tify any association or orga- nization of contractors that has filed a request to receivenotification of the emergency project. Summary: The repair or replacement of a state bridge that is determined by the WSDOT to be structurally defi-cient under the definition described above is exempt fromcompliance with the SEPA, so long as the repair or re-placement occurs within the existing right-of-way except as needed to meet current en gineering standards or envi- ronmental permit requirements. The repair or replacement that occurs pursuant to this exemption may not result in additional lanes for automobiles. The repair or replacement of a structurally deficient bridge is included in the circumstances when the WSDOTmay use its existing emergency contracting procedures. A structurally deficient bridge is defined as a state bridge that is classified in poor condition under the state bridge condition rating system and is reported to the na- tional bridge inventory as having a deck, superstructure, orsubstructure rating of four or below.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: July 6, 2015HB 1222 C 16 L 15 Modifying certain firefigh ting apparatus length and weight limits. By Representatives McBride, Griffey, Clibborn, Orcutt, Van De Wege, Fey, Takko, Young, Sawyer and Bergquist. House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: \"Firefighting apparatus\" means a vehicle or combination of vehicles design ed for fire suppression and rescue or for fire prevention activities. A firefighting ap- paratus must comply with a ll federal and state operating and safety criteria. A firefighting apparatus under 24,000 pounds on a single axle or 43,000 pounds on a tandem axle may oper- ate without a Department of Transportation (DOT) permit. If a firefighting apparatus ex ceeds those weight limits an annual permit may be issued if the apparatus was in oper- ation prior to June 13, 2002. These larger apparatus areexempt from permit requiremen ts, but the operators of the exempt firefighting apparatus must obtain an annual per-mit from the DOT. The maximum weight of an apparatus is 50,000 pounds on a tandem axle and may not exceed 600 poundsper inch width of a tire. Th e weight limit must include the weight of: a full water tank , the equipment for operation, and the maximum number of personnel allowed on boardthe fire truck. A firefighting apparatus must obtain an annual permit to operate if: the weight exceeds 600 pounds per inch width of a tire; there are 24,000 pounds or more on a single axle; there are 43,000 pounds or more on a tandem axle set; there are 67,000 pounds or more gross vehicle weight depending on axle spacing; the weight limit per inch width of a tire is over the manufacturer's tire load rating; there is a tridem axle set; the apparatus is wider than 8 feet and 6 inches; the apparatus is higher than 14 feet; the apparatus is longer than 50 feet over all; the apparatus has more than a 15-foot front overhang; the apparatus exceeds the length of the wheel base; or the apparatus weight is 50,000 pounds on the tandem axle set with a full wate r tank, equipment, and the normal number of personnel assigned to be on board, or it exceeds 600 pounds per inch width of a tire. When applying for a permit, a current weight slip from a certified scale must be atta ched to the permit application form. Upon receiving an ap plication for a permit, the DOT must transmit it to the local jurisdictions in which thefirefighting apparatus will be operating, so that the localHouse 98 0 Senate 45 0SHB 1223 38jurisdictions can make a determ ination on the need for lo- cal travel and route restrictions within the operating area.The DOT must issue a permit within 20 days of receivinga permit application and must is sue the permit on an annu- al basis for the apparatus to operate on the state highway system along with any restric tions or limitations. A fire- fighting apparatus without the proper overweight permitsis prohibited from being operate d on city, county, or state roadways until a permit has been obtained. The Washington State Patrol (WSP) is authorized to conduct random spot checks of firefighting apparatus toensure compliance with overwe ight permit regulations. If a firefighting apparatus is found to be not in compliance,the WSP must issue a violation notice to the fire depart-ment, prohibiting the operation of the firefighting appara- tus upon the roadways. It is a traffic infraction to operate a firefighting appa- ratus on the roadways after a violation notice has been is-sued. For a first offense, th e penalty is $50; for a second offense, the penalty is less than $75; and for a third or sub- sequent offense, the penalty is no less than $100. No indi-vidual liability will be attached to an employee orvolunteer of the penalized fire department. Summary: The overall length of a fire apparatus length is increased from 50 feet to 65 feet before requiring a firedistrict or municipal department to obtain a permit to op-erate it, a weight limit is im posed on single drive axles of 31,000 pounds, and the weight limit per inch width of atire is increased from 60 0 pounds to 670 pounds.

By House Committee on Community Development, Housing & Tribal Affairs (ori ginally sponsored by Repre- sentatives Fey, Santos and Walk-inshaw). House Committee on Community Development, Housing & Tribal Affairs House Committee on FinanceSenate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Background: Hotel-Motel Tax. The state imposes an ex- cise tax on the sale of goods and services provided in the state, including the furnishing of lodging by a hotel, motel,rooming house, private campground, trailer park, and sim-ilar short-term accommodatio n. Cities and counties may impose an additiona l special local excise tax on lodging services, known as a local hotel-motel tax. One type of local hotel-motel tax allows cities and counties to levy up to 2 perc ent of a lodging charge, which is credited against the state tax rate of 6.5 percent. Coun- ties imposing this \"state shar ed hotel-motel tax\" also must provide a credit for a similar ta x imposed by any city with- in the county. Counties and c ities also may levy an addi- tional special hotel-motel tax that may be added onto the state tax rate. Revenue generated from the se local hotel-motel taxes generally are used for tourism promotion or the acquisi-tion and operation of tourism-related facilities. A county may issue general obligation and revenue bonds that arepayable from the special hotel-motel tax revenues. There are certain local exceptions on the application and use of the 2 percent state shared hotel-motel tax in cer-tain cities. Cities in King County, except the City of Bel- levue, are prohibited from imposi ng this tax. Currently, all revenues from the state shar ed hotel-motel tax in King County must be used in the following manner: Through 2015 all revenue must be used first to pay off the Kingdome stadium bonds. Once the debt onthose bonds is retired, the revenues are distributed into a special account dedi cated to art, culture and heritage, museums, and arts programs. From 2016-2020 all tax re venues must be deposited into the account created to finance the football sta- dium and exhibition center. That debt is anticipated to be retired in 2020. Beginning in 2021: at least 37.5 percent of the state shared hotel- motel tax revenues for King County must be dis- tributed to a special ar t, culture and heritage, museums and arts programs account; at least 37.5 percent of the state shared hotel- motel tax revenues must be distributed for afford- able workforce housing within 0.5 miles of atransit station or for homeless youth services; and the remainder must be used for capital and oper- ating programs that promote tourism. Workforce Housing and Homeless Services . For pur- poses of the state shared hote l-motel tax revenues, afford- able workforce housing m eans housing for households whose income is between 30 and 80 percent of the medianincome in the county where the housing is located. Ac- cording to the 2014 federal guid elines, the 30 to 80 percent range of the median income in King County is as follows: $18,550-$45,750 for a single person; and $26,450-$63,900 for a family of four. The King County Housing and Community Develop- ment Program (Program) provides financing for housingprojects through local housing authorities and nonprofitorganizations. The Program also provides services forHouse 97 0 Senate 48 0HB 1232 39homeless persons, includin g homeless youth and young adults. Community Preservation an d Development Authority . The Legislature may, by statute, authorize the creation ofa Community Preservation an d Development Authority (CPDA) that is proposed by residents, property owners,employers, and business owne rs of a community adverse- ly impacted by the construction and operation of publiclyfunded facilities. The comm unity proposal must identify a stable source of revenue that has a nexus with multiplepublicly funded facilities that have adversely impacted the community and that can be used to fund operating and cap- ital projects. The board of directors for a CPDA must include busi- ness representatives, residents, nonprofit and social ser-vice providers, persons with knowledge of the community,and local legislative representatives who serve as ex-offi-cio members. Board elections are held during annual localtown hall meetings. Among its powers, a CPDA has the authority to fund- raise, employ, enter into real estate contracts, invest, andincur debt. The CPDA may accept public funding; how- ever, it may not use funds to support a political candidateor party. The CPDA must establish its geographic boundaries and develop a strategic plan to restore and promote thehealth, safety, economic welf are, and cultural and historic identity of the impacted co mmunity. The CPDA may es- tablish funding mechanisms to support capital and operat- ing projects, including private and public funding, thataddress the negative impacts of multiple publicly funded projects on the community. Th e CPDA also must report to the Legislature and at its annu al town hall meeting on im- plementation of its strategic plan. State and local govern-ment agencies must consult with the CPDA regarding the siting and construction of fu ture major public facilities. The first and only CPDA was authorized in 2007 in the Seattle Pioneer Square an d International District com- munities. The CPDA is currently called \"Historic SouthDowntown.\" Summary: Counties and cities may issue general obliga- tion or revenue bonds for af fordable workforce housing within 0.5 miles of a transit station that are paid with hotel-motel tax revenues. Beginning in 2021, at least 37.5 percent of revenues from the state shared hotel-motel tax revenue for KingCounty must be used: for contracts, loans, or grants to nonprofit organiza- tions or housing authorities for affordable workforce housing within 0.5 miles of a transit station or forhomeless youth services, or to repay general obliga- tion or revenue bonds to finance those contracts loans, or grants; or to repay revenue bonds used to finance projects authorized by a CPDA that promote sustainable workplace opportunities near a community impactedby the construction or oper ation of tourism-related facilities. The debt service on revenue bonds issued by a county or city for purposes of fundin g affordable workforce hous- ing is limited to no more than 50 percent of the hotel-motel tax revenue on projects reas onably expect ed to spend funds within three years. Ten percent of the proceeds fromall revenue bonds issued for affordable workforce housing must be used to finance proj ects authorized by a CPDA to promote sustainable workpla ce opportunities near a com- munity impacted by the uction of tourism-related fa- Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1232 C 103 L 15 Concerning employer-purchas ed fishing guide licenses.

By House Committee on Education (originally sponsored by Representatives Pollet, Sa ntos, S. Hunt, Orwall, Senn, Lytton, Robinson, Walsh, Griffey, Goodman, Buys andTarleton). House Committee on Education Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education Background: Special Education . Each school district is required to provide an appropriate educational opportunityto children with disabilities, meaning those children who have been determined eligible for special education due to a disability. Two federal laws require school districts toprovide individualized education and support services tothese children. The Indivi duals with Disabilities Educa- tion Improvement Act (IDEA) requires that districts pro-vide to each public school child who receives special education an Individualized Education Program (IEP). AnIEP guides the delivery of sp ecial education supports and services designed to meet th e child's unique needs. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504 Plan requires thatdistricts provide to each qualified student with a disabilityregular or special education services and related servicesdesigned to meet the studen t's individual educational needs. Student Restraint or Isolation Laws . State law encour- ages parents and teachers to us e methods of correction and restraint that are not dangerou s to children. The physical discipline of a child is allowed when reasonable and mod-erate and inflicted by a parent, teacher, or guardian for pur-poses of restraining or corr ecting the child. The following actions are presumed unreason able when used to correct or restrain a child: throwing, kicking, burning, or cutting a child; striking a child with a closed fist; shaking a child under age 3; interfering with a child's breathing; threatening a child wi th a deadly weapon; or doing any other act that is likely to cause and which does cause bodily harm greater than transient pain orminor temporary marks.In 2013 legislation was enacted that placed certain re- quirements on the restraint or isolation (R or I) of students who have an IEP or Section 504 plan and who are partici-pating in school-sponsored instruction or activities. When school staff releases a student from R or I, the school must conduct follow-up procedures, includ- ing: reviewing the incident with the student and the student's parent or guardian to address the stu- dent's behavior; and reviewing the incident with the staff member involved to discuss whether proper procedures were followed. School employees, resour ce officers, or school secu- rity officers who use ch emical spray, mechanical restraint, or physical force on a student must inform the administrator and file a written report to the dis-trict office. The principal must make a reasonable effort to ver- bally inform the parent or guardian about the R or Iwithin 24 hours and provid e written notification post- marked within five days. Schools must provide this notification in a language other than English if the school customarily provides school-related informa- tion to parents in languages other than English. Schools that are required to develop an IEP must include within the plan procedures for notification ofa parent or guardian about incidents of R or I. Parents or guardians of children who have an IEP or Section 504 plan must be provided a copy of the district pol-icy on the use of R or I. Conditions for the Use of Restraint or Isolation . The Office of the Superintended of Public Instruction (OSPI) is required to establish, in rule, eligibility criteria for spe- cial education programs for ch ildren with disabilities, in- cluding the use of aversive interventions. By rule, the use of aversive interventions that involve \"isolation,\" meaning excludin g a student from his or her regular instructional area and isolating the student within a room or any other form of enclosure, are subject to thefollowing conditions: The isolation, including the duration of its use, must be addressed in the studen t's aversive intervention plan. The enclosure must be ventilated, lighted, and tem- perature controlled from in side or outside for pur- poses of human occupancy. The enclosure must perm it continuous visual moni- toring of the student fro m outside the enclosure. An adult responsible for supervising the student must remain in visual or auditory range of the student. Either the student must be capable of releasing him- self or herself from the en closure or the student mustHouse 98 0 Senate 48 0SHB 1240 41continuously remain within view of an adult responsi- ble for supervising the student. By rule, the use of aversive interventions that involve \"physical restraint,\" meanin g involving physically re- straining or immobilizing a st udent by binding or other- wise attaching the student's limbs together or by binding or otherwise attaching any part of the student's body to an ob- ject, are subject to the following conditions: The restraint must only be used when and to the extent it is reasonably necessary to protect the stu-dent, other persons, or property from serious harm. The restraint, including the duration of its use, must be addressed in the studen t's aversive intervention plan. The restraint must not interfere with the student's breathing. An adult responsible for supervising the student must remain in visual or aud itory range of the student. Either the student must be capable of releasing him- self or herself from the restraint or the student must continuously remain within view of an adult responsi- ble for supervising the student. Summary: Requirements related to restraint of students with IEPs or Section 504 plans are made applicable to allstudents. An IEP or Section 504 plan may not include theuse of R or I as a planned behavior intervention, unless astudent's individual needs re quire more specific advanced educational planning and the student's parent or guardianagrees. All other plans may refer to the district policy onR or I. It is stated that th ese requirements are not intended to limit the provision of a free appropriate public educa-tion under Part B of the IDEA or Section 504 of the Reha-bilitation Act. The R or I of any student is permitted only when rea- sonably necessary to control spontaneous behavior that poses an imminent likelihood of serious harm, meaning: there is evidence of a substantial risk that the student will inflict physical harm up on his or her own person, upon another, or upon the property of others; or the student has threatened the physical safety of another and has a history of one or more violent acts. When a student is placed in R or I, the student must be closely monitored to prevent ha rm to the student, and the R or I must be discontinued as soon as the likelihood of se- rious harm has dissipated. E ach school district must adopt a policy providing for the least amount of R or I appropri- ate to protect the safety of students and staff under suchcircumstances. Schools are required to follow-up after incidents of R or I: with the student and the parent or guardian, to review the appropriateness of the response; and with the staff member who administered the R or I, to review what training or support the staff member needs to help the studen t avoid similar incidents. Schools are required to report incidents of isolation, in addition to incidents of restra int, and reports must include any recommendations for changing the nature or amountof resources available to the student and staff members inorder to avoid further incidents. Beginning January 1,2016, and by January 1 annual ly, each district must sum- marize the written reports received by the schools and sub-mit the summaries to the OSPI. For each school, thedistrict summary must include the number of individualincidents of R or I, the number of students involved in theincidents, the number of inju ries to students and staff, and the types of R or I used. No later than 90 days after receipt, the OSPI must publish the data to its website. The OSPI may use the data to investigate the training, practices, andother efforts used by schools and districts to reduce the useof R or I. Excluding a student from his or her regular instruc- tional area is removed from th e definition of \"isolation.\" Isolation does not include the voluntary use by a student ofa quiet space for self-calming, or the temporary removal ofa student from his or her regu lar instructional area to an unlocked area for purposes of carrying out an appropriatepositive behavior intervention plan. The definition of \"re- straint\" is modified to includ e the use of devices to restrict a student's freedom of movement, but not the appropriateuse of a prescribed medical, orthopedic, or therapeutic de-vice when used as intended , such as to achieve proper body position, balance, or al ignment or to permit a student to safely participate in acti vities. The definition of \"re- straint device\" is modified to exclude a seat harness usedto safely transport students, and the term must not be con-strued as encouraging the use of these devices. For purposes of the OSPI rules on special education eligibility criteria, the term \"aversive interventions\" is changed to \"positive be havior interventions.\" Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015House 68 29 Senate House43 3 (Senate amended) (House refused to concur) Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 71 27 (House concurred)SHB 1252 42SHB 1252 C 18 L 15 Prescribing penalties for allowing or permitting unli- censed practice of massage therapy or reflexology. By House Committee on Public Safety (originally spon- sored by Representatives Wylie, Harris, Moeller, Jinkins,Vick and S. Hunt). House Committee on Public Safety House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Senate Committee on Health Care Background: Reflexology . Generally, reflexology is a health care service involving the application of pressure with fingers to the lower one- third of the extremities, feet, hands, and outer ears. It does not include the diagnosis of,or treatment for, specific di seases or joint manipulations. Massage . Generally, massage and massage therapy are health care services invo lving the external manipula- tion or pressure of soft tissue for therapeutic purposes.Massage therapy includes techniques such as tapping,compressions, friction, refl exology, Swedish gymnastics or movements, gliding, kneading, shaking, and facial orconnective tissue stretching, with or without the aids of su-perficial heat, cold, water, lubricants, or salts. Massagetherapy does not include diagnosi s or attempts to adjust or manipulate any articulations of the body, spine, or mobili- zation of these articulations by the use of a thrusting force, or genital manipulation. Practice of Reflexology and Massage . A person prac- ticing reflexology or massage or representing himself orherself as a reflexologist or massage practitioner is re-quired either to be certified as a reflexologist or licensed as a massage practitioner by the Department of Health(DOH). In order to be certified, the person must be at least18 years of age, have succ essfully completed a course of study, and have passed an ex amination administered or ap- proved by the DOH. An applicant may be certif ied without examination in limited situations. In additio n, there are exemptions from the certification requirement provided for: individuals giving massage or reflexology to mem- bers of his or her immediate family; licensed massage practitioners and other credentialed providers performing services within their scope ofpractice; individuals practicing massage or reflexology at an athletic department of: (1) any institution that ismaintained with public fu nds, including educational institutions; (2) a school or college approved by the DOH; or (3) a nonprofit organization holding a speci-fied liquor license; students enrolled in an approved reflexology or mas- sage school, program, or apprentice program provid-ing uncompensated, supervis ed services incidental to the school or program; and individuals who have co mpleted an approved somatic education training program. Reflexologists and massage practitioners are subject to the Uniform Disciplinary Act for health professions,and the Secretary of the DOH is the disciplining authority. Misdemeanor and Gross Misdemeanor Offenses . A misdemeanor offense is punishable by a sentence of up to90 days in jail, or a maximum fine of $1,000, or both im-prisonment and a fine. A gross misdemeanor offense ispunishable by a sentence of up to 364 days in jail or a max-imum fine of $5,000, or both imprisonment and a fine. Summary: It is unlawful for an owner of a massage busi- ness or reflexology business, where massage therapy or re- flexology takes place, to a llow the unlicensed practice of massage therapy or reflexology. A violation is a misde-meanor offense when the owner knowingly or with crimi-nal negligence allows or pe rmits the unlicensed practice of massage therapy or reflexology to be committed within his or her place of business. Ea ch subsequent violation is a gross misdemeanor offense.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1259 C 104 L 15 Allowing advanced registered nurse practitioners to sign and attest to certain documentation.

By Representatives Buys, Ly tton, Shea, Wilcox, Young, Holy and McCaslin. House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Agriculture, Water & Rural Eco- nomic Development Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: A commercial feed license is required of every person who manufactures, distributes, or is listed asa guarantor of a commercial animal feed. The license is is-sued by the Washington Stat e Department of Agriculture (WSDA). Commercial animal feed must be packagedwith a label stating the cont ents of the feed, the common names of ingredients, the net weight, and a guaranteedanalysis of the contents. Commercial animal feeds may not be sold if they in- clude ingredients that are not recognized as acceptable in-gredients or if they include ingredients that are seen as analteration of the feeds. The WSDA is responsible for de-ciding which ingredients are acceptable. In doing so, theyare required to consider federal regulations and the officialdefinitions and terms adopted for commercial feed by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAF-CO). The AAFCO is a voluntary membership association of local, state, and federal agencies that regulate the sale anddistribution of animal feeds. The AAFCO is not a regula-tory agency in and of itself, but an organization composed of regulatory agencies from across the country. To be eli-gible for sale in Washington, most feed ingredients mustmeet definitions established by the AAFCO. Hemp is currently not an allowable component of an- imal feed in Washington and is not defined as a feed ingre-dient by the AAFCO. House 96 0 Senate 49 0House 93 5 Senate 47 02E2SHB 1272 44Summary: The WSDA is required to evaluate whether hemp and hemp products should be allowed as a compo-nent of animal feed. In th at process, the WSDA may focus its efforts as appropriate and limit its scope to particularclasses of animals where curre nt research suggests that hemp has the most benefit on animal health, animal wel- fare, the resulting animal product, or the overall physicalenvironment. The WSDA must take the ap propriate administrative actions to allow hemp as a co mponent of commercial feed if it is determined in the evaluation that the addition ofhemp is appropriate. If the WSDA finds that hemp is not an appropriate addition to the list of allowable feed ingre-dients, then a report must be issued to the Legislature ex-plaining the WSDA's findings. The WSDA must complete th e evaluation by June 30, 2018. If that date cannot be satisfied, the WSDA must rec-ommend legislation to request an extension of the date. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 2E2SHB 1272 C 7 L 15 E 2 Concerning the crime of di sclosing intimate images. By House Committee on Gene ral Government & Informa- tion Technology (originally sponsored by Representatives Buys, Orwall and Pollet). House Committee on Public Safety House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: Revenge porn is the phrase commonly used to describe sexually explicit me dia that is publicly shared without the consent of the pictured individual. Revenge porn may be uploaded by ex-p artners with an intention to shame or embarrass the individual in the image, or byhackers. Thirteen states have enacted laws which specifi-cally target \"revenge porn.\" A class C felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. A gross misdemeanor is punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $5000 fine. Summary: A person commits the crime of Disclosing In- timate Images when the person knowingly discloses an in- timate image of another person and the person disclosing the image: obtained it under circumstances in which a reasonable person would know or understand that the image was to remain private; knows or should have known that the depicted person has not consented to the disclosure; and know or reasonably should know that disclosure would cause harm to the depicted person. A person who is under the age of 18 years old commits the crime of Disclosing Intimat e Images when the person: intentionally and malicio usly disclosed an intimate image of another person; obtained it under circumstances in which a reasonable person would know or understand that the image wasto remain private; and knows or should have known that the depicted person has not consented to the disclosure. The prohibitions do not apply to: images involving voluntary exposure in public or commercial settings; disclosures made in the pu blic interest including, but not limited to, reporting of unlawful conduct, or the lawful and common practices of law enforcement, criminal reporting, legal proceedings, or medical treatment; or an interactive computer service or a public or private mobile service, in regards to content provided by another person. \"Disclosing\" means transferring, publishing, dissemi- nating, or making a digital depiction available for distribu-tion or downloading thro ugh the facilities of a telecommunications network, or through other means oftransferring computer programs or data to a computer. \"Intimate image\" means any photograph, film, video- tape, digital image, or other record of another person whois identifiable from the imag e itself or from information displayed with or otherwise connected to the image, andthat was taken in a private se tting, is not a matter of public concern, and depicts: sexual activity, includin g sexual intercourse and mas- turbation; or a person's intimate body parts, whether nude or visi- ble through less than opaque clothing, including the genitals, pubic area, anus , or post-pubescent female nipple. It is an affirmative defense to a charge of Disclosing Intimate Images if the defendan t is a family member of a minor and did not intend harm or harassment in disclosingimages of the minor to the de fendant's family or friends. Disclosing intimate images is a gross misdemeanor on the first offense and a class C felony on the second or sub-sequent offense.Votes on Final Passage:House 97 0 Senate 49 0 House 98 0 Senate House48 0 (Senate amended) (House refused to concur) Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)SHB 1274 45Second Special Session Effective: September 26, 2015 SHB 1274 C 2 L 15 E 2 Implementing a value-based system for nursing home rates. By House Committee on Appropriations (originally spon- sored by Representatives Cody , Jinkins, Johnson, Harris and Tharinger). House Committee on Appropriations Background: The Washington State Medicaid (Medic- aid) program includes long-term care assistance and ser-vices provided to low-in come individuals. It is administered by the state in compliance with federal laws and regulations and is jointly financed by the federal and state government. The federal funds are matching funds,and are referred to as the Federal Financial Participation(FFP), or the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage(FMAP). The FMAP is calculated based on average percapita income and is usually between 50 and 51 percent forWashington. Typically, the st ate pays the remainder using the State General Fund. Clients may be served in theirown homes, in community r esidential settings, and in skilled nursing facilities. There are approximately 240 skilled nursing facilities licensed in Washington to serve about 10,000 Medicaid-eligible clients. Skilled nu rsing facilities are licensed by the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) andprovide 24-hour supervised nursing care, personal care,therapies, nutrition manageme nt, organized activities, so- cial services, laundry services, and room and board tothree or more residents. The Medicaid nursing home pay-ment system is administered by the DSHS. The Medicaidrates in Washington are unique to each facility and are generally based on the facility's allowable costs, occupan- cy rate, and client acuity (sometimes called the case mix).The biennial appropriations act sets a statewide weightedaverage Medicaid payment rate, sometimes referred to asthe budget dial. If the actu al statewide nursing facility payments exceed the budget dial, the DSHS is required to proportionally adjust downwa rd all nursing facility pay- ment rates to meet the budget dial. The nursing home rate methodology, including formu- la variables, allo wable costs, and accounting/auditing pro- cedures, is specified in statute. The rates are based oncalculations for six different components: direct care, therapy care, support services, operations, property, and a financing allowance. Rate ca lculations for the noncapital components (direct care, th erapy care, support services, and operations) are based on actual facility cost reportsand are typically updated biennially in a process known as rebasing. The capital components (property and financingallowance) are also based on actual facility cost reports, but are rebased annually. All rate components, with the exception of direct care, are subject to minimum occupan-cy adjustments. If a facilit y does not meet the minimum occupancy requirements, the rates are adjusted downward.Also, the nursing facility paym ent system periodically in- cludes add-on rate adjustments. Under federal law, states ha ve the ability to use pro- vider-specific revenue to fund a portion of their state share of Medicaid program costs. This is sometimes referred toas a Medicaid provider assessm ent or sometimes as a pro- vider tax or provider fee. States may use the proceedsfrom the assessment to make Medicaid provider paymentsand claim the federal matching share of those payments.Essentially, states use the proceeds from the provider taxto offset a portion of the st ate funds that would have been required to fund the Medicaid program. Federal regula-tions define the rules for the Medicaid provider assess- ment. Summary: The existing payment methodology for nurs- ing facilities is repealed, effec tive June 30, 2016. A new payment methodology for nurs ing facilities is established, effective July 1, 2016. A minimum staffing standard fornursing facilities is establishe d, effective July 1, 2016. The rebase of non-capital rate components is delayed from July 1, 2015, to July 1, 2016. The DSHS is directed to fa- cilitate a workgroup that w ill recommend modifications to the new payment methodology in a report to the Legisla-ture, due December 1, 2015. A separate nursing facility quality enhancement account is created in the custody of the State Treasurer. Funds r eceived through the reconcili- ation and settlement process mu st be placed into the new account, effective July 1, 2015. Funds received from pen-alties when facilities are out of compliance with the mini- mum staffing standard must be placed into the newaccount, effective July 1, 20 16. The Secretary of the DSHS may authorize expenditures from the new accountfor technical assistance for nursing facilities, specialized training for nursing facilities, or to increase quality en- hancement payments.

By House Committee on Gene ral Government & Informa- tion Technology (originally sponsored by Representatives Klippert, Goodman, Hayes, Orwall, Moscoso, Pettigrew, Zeiger, Kilduff and Fey). House Committee on Public Safety House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Senate Committee on Law & JusticeSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Ignition Interlocks . Pretrial Conditions of Release. As a condition of release from custody before ar- raignment or trial, a defendan t charged with a Driving Un- der the Influence (DUI) offense, who has a prior DUI-related offense, must be ordered to have a functioning ig-nition interlock device (IID) installed on his or her vehiclewith proof filed with the court within five business days of the date of release, or comply with the 24/7 Sobriety Pro- gram (Program), or both. A court must authorize the re- moval of the IID upon acquittal or dismissal of charges. Liability. If, as part of the person's judgment and sen- tence, a person is required to install an IID on all motor ve- hicles operated by the person and the person is under thejurisdiction of the municipality or county probation or su- pervision department, the probation or supervision depart-ment must verify the installa tion of an IID. The county probation or supervision depa rtment satisfies the require- ment to verify installation if it receives a written verifica- tion by an ignition interlock company stating that it has installed a device on a vehicle owned or operated by theperson. The municipality or county has no further obliga-tion to supervise the use of th e device by the person and is not civilly liable for any injuri es or damages caused by the person for failing to use a devi ce or for driving under the influence. Ignition Interlock License. Any person with a Wash- ington driver's license who is convicted of a DUI offense or has his or her license suspended or revoked for a DUI,Physical Control (PC), or Vehicular Homicide while underthe influence of alcohol or drugs offense, may apply for anignition interlock driver's lic ense (IIDL), which allows the licensee to lawfully operate a vehicle during the revoca-tion. Hearing and Appeal. Any licensee who obtains an IIDL is prohibited from thereafter asserting the statutoryright to a judicial appeal from the administrative decisionimposing the revocation. The Washington State Court ofAppeals ruled (in Nielsen v. Department of Licensing ) that the requirement that a driver waive his or her right to ap- peal a license suspension or revocation order from the De-partment of Licensing (DOL) in order to receive an IIDLis unconstitutional. Standards. The Washington State Patrol (WSP), by rule, requires that IIDs meet certain specifications and alsoprovides standards for the certific ation, installation, repair, and removal of IIDs. All IIDs must employ fuel cell tech-nology and, when reasonably available in the area, IIDs must include technology capab le of taking a photo identi- fication of the person giving the breath sample. Implied Consent . A driver is presumed to have given consent to a breath alcohol co ncentration (BAC) test if the driver is arrested for DUI. As such, any person who oper- ates a vehicle in Washington is deemed to have given con- sent to a test of his or her breath for the purposes ofdetermining the BAC, tetrah ydrocannabinol (THC) con- centration, or presence of any drug. However, due to tech-nology, THC and other drugs cannot be measured or testedwith a breath test. Missouri v. McNeely . The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution proh ibits unreasonable search and seizures. A blood draw is a search; however, a blooddraw is only constitutional when it is consensual, pursuant to a search warrant, or in exigent circumstances. In Mis- souri v. McNeely , the United States Supreme Court found that taking a person's blood without warrant violates a per- son's Fourth Amendment right and the exigency exception to the warrant requirement generally does not apply in these cases (since metabolization of alcohol in the bodydoes not by itself create an exigent circumstance). As a re-sult, routine blood draws from a person suspected of DUIwithout consent or a warrant are unconstitutional, unless there is some special complicat ing factor to justify exigen- cy. Tampering With an IID . If a person is restricted to driving only vehicles equipped with an IID, it is a gross misdemeanor offense for that person to tamper with thedevice. It is also a gross misdemeanor offense for a personto knowingly assist another person who is restricted to theuse of an IID equipped vehicl e to circumvent the device. Open Container Law . It is a violation of the open con- tainer law, to possess a bottle or other container containingan alcoholic beverage while in a vehicle upon a highway,if the container has been opened, the seal broken, or thecontents partially removed. Such containers must be keptin the trunk of the vehicle or in some other area of the ve-hicle not normally occupied by the driver or passengers ifthe vehicle does not have a trunk. A utility compartment or glove compartment is deemed to be within the area oc- cupied by the driver and passe ngers. The open container law does not address containers containing marijuana. Conditions of Probation . Whenever a defendant re- ceives a jail sentence for a DUI offense, the court must also impose as a mandatory cond ition of probation that the person: (1) not drive a vehicle in Washington without avalid driver's license and proof of liability insurance; (2) not drive or be in physical control of a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more or of aTHC concentration of 5.00 nanograms, within two hoursafter driving; and (3) not to refuse to submit to a breath or2E2SHB 1276 47blood test to determine alcohol or drug concentration upon request of a law enforcement officer. A violation of pro-bation can result in 30 days of incarceration and a 30-daysuspension of a person's driver's license. Prior Offense . A DUI or PC offense is punishable as a gross misdemeanor. It beco mes a class C felony if a per- son has four or more prior offenses within 10 years. A\"prior offense\" is defined in statute and includes but is not limited to such crimes as operating a vehicle, aircraft, wa-tercraft, or vessel while unde r the influence of alcohol or drugs. Abstract of Driving Record . The DOL maintains a driving record on every person licensed to operate a motorvehicle in Washington. These records or driver abstracts,contain information relating to a person's driving record which include: accident info rmation, driving status, and information about traffic citations. The DOL charges a fee to obtain a driver's abstract and is restricted to the following persons and uses: the individ- ual named in the abstract; employers or prospective em-ployers relating to driving as a condition of employment;volunteer organizations where driving is required; transit authorities for volunteer vanp ool drivers; insurance carri- ers for an individual covering the period of not more thanthe last three years; state coll eges, universities, agencies or units of local government that are authorized to self-insure for employment and risk management purposes; the Of-fice of Superintendent of Public Instruction for school busdrivers; and to city attorney s and county prosecuting attor- neys for impaired driving related offenses. Physical Control . The fact that a person charged with a PC violation is or has been entitled to use a drug does notconstitute a defense to any ch arge of violating the law. The 24/7 Sobriety Program . The pilot Program, estab- lished in 2014, is administered by the Washington Associ-ation of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs (WASPC). TheProgram is a 24-hour and seven-day a week sobriety pro-gram in which a participant su bmits to the testing of the participant's blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substanc-es in order to determine the presence of alcohol, marijua-na, or any controlled substanc e in the participant's body. Participants who violate the terms of the Program are sub- ject to sanctions from a written warning up to serving hisor her entire remaining sentence. The 24/7 Sobriety Account (Account) in the State Treasury, which is administered by the Criminal JusticeTraining Commission, defrays the costs of operating theProgram. The Account may receive funds from a variety of sources, including activa tion and users fees. Partici- pants' payment of fees are collected contemporaneously orin advance to fund the Program and may not be waived orreduced. Forensic Phlebotomists . Generally, forensic toxicolo- gy is known as the applicatio n of toxicology for the pur- pose of solving civil and crimin al cases. Toxicology is the study of substances such as drugs, toxins, and poisons thatare harmful to human beings. A phlebotomist is a person trained to draw blood from a person for clinical or medical testing, transfusions, dona-tions, or research. A toxicol ogist then has the responsibil- ity of detecting and identifying the presence of drugs and poisons in fluids, tissues, and organs. This is done using chemical and biomedical inst ruments capable of detecting small amounts of alcohol, drugs, or toxic material, posi-tively identifying them, and accurately measuring how much is present. Forensic drug testing is co mmonly used for workplace drug testing, testing certain athletes for sports, and law en-forcement investigatio ns such as DUI cases. The Department of Health (DOH) regulates health professionals in 83 health professions and 7,000 health or-ganizations and programs. The DOH investigates andprosecutes complaints agains t health care providers and facilities. The Secretary of the DOH and various boardsand commissions discipline heal th care providers that vio- late the law. The boards wo rk with the DOH to develop processes for receiving, investigating, and determining ap-propriate discipline for violatio ns. Action can only be tak- en against providers that are required to be licensed,certified, or registered with the DOH. Summary: Ignition Interlocks . Pretrial Conditions of Release. Upon a person's subsequent DUI offense, as a condition of release from custody at arraignment, the courtmust require that person to: (1) have an IID installed onall vehicles operated by that person; (2) comply with Pro-gram monitoring; (3) have an IID installed and comply with the Program; or (4) have an IID installed on all motor vehicles operated by the person, agree (by signing a swornstatement) not to operate any vehicle without an IID as re- quired by the court, and par ticipate in Program monitoring or alcohol monitoring at the expense of the person. The court must immediately notify the DOL when the IID restriction is imposed as a condition of release. TheDOL must add a notation to the person's driving record noting the restriction. Once an IID restriction is lifted, the court must immediately notify the DOL regarding the lift-ing of the restriction and th e DOL must immediately re- lease any notation on the person's driving record relatingto the IID restriction. When an IID restriction imposed as a condition of re- lease is cancelled, the court must provide the defendantwith a written order confirming release of the restriction.The written order must serve as proof of release of the re- striction until the DOL updates the driving record. It is a crime for a restricted driver to drive without an IID unlessthe notation on his or her driving record is a result from arestriction imposed as a condition of release and the re-striction was released by the court prior to driving. Liability. In a pre-trial case, as a condition of release, once a county probation or supervision department re-ceives a written verification by an IID company statingthat it has installed an IID device on a vehicle owned oroperated by an offender, the municipality or county has no2E2SHB 1276 48further obligation to supervis e the use of the IID by that person and is not civilly liable for any injuries or damagescaused by the person for failing to use a device or for driv-ing while intoxicated. Ignition Interlock License. Any person with any valid driver's license who is convicted of a DUI offense or hashis or her license suspended or revoked for a DUI-related offense, may apply for an IID L. In addition, any person convicted of Vehicular Homicide or Vehicular Assault,where recklessness or the disr egard for the safety of others is an element of the offense, may also apply for an IIDL when the charge was originally filed as a violation com-mitted while under the influe nce of alcohol or drugs. Hearing and Appeal. The prohibition against IID licensee appealing an administ rative decision imposing a license revocation is eliminated. Standards. All IIDs must have technology capable of providing the global positioni ng system (GPS) coordi- nates at the time of each test sequence. The coordinatesmust be displayed within the data log that is downloaded by the manufacturer and must be made available to theWSP to be used for circumve ntion and tampering investi- gations. Implied Consent . References to the testing of a per- son's breath for purposes of determining the THC concen-tration or the presence of any drugs are removed from theimplied consent statute. Missouri v. McNeely . The statutory references to mandatory blood draws are removed as they relate to im-plied consent and denial or revocation of a person's driv-er's license. For purposes of a DOL hearing due to a license revo- cation, the hearing must consider whether the arresting of-ficer has reasonable grounds to believe the person hasbeen driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while intoxicated and, if a test was administered,whether the arresting officer administered the breath orblood test pursuant to a search warrant, a valid waiver ofthe warrant requirement when exigent circumstances ex- ist, or under any other authority of law. Where a defendant is found in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence, the person may pe-tition the DOL hearing officer to apply an affirmative de-fense. It is an affirmative defense that must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant con-sumed a sufficient quantity of alcohol after the time of be-ing in actual physical control of the vehicle and before the administration of an analysis of the person's breath orblood to cause the defendant's BAC to be over the legallimit. Tampering With an IID . The elements for the crime of Tampering with or Circumventing an IID are expanded toinclude when a restricted driver: (1) uses or requests an-other person to use a filter or other device to circumvent the IID or to start or operat e the vehicle to allow the re-stricted driver to operate the vehicle; or (2) has, allows, di- rects, authorizes, or request s another person to tamper with, modify, blow, or otherwise exhale into the device inorder to circumvent the device to allow the restricted driv-er to operate the vehicle. Open Container Law . It is a traffic infraction for a per- son to: (1) keep marijuana in a vehicle when the vehicle is upon a highway, unless it is in the trunk of the vehicle, insome other area of the vehicle not normally occupied or di- rectly accessible by the driver or passengers if the vehicledoes not have a trunk, or unless the marijuana is in a pack-age, container, or receptacle that has not been opened, the seal broken, or contents partially removed; (2) consumemarijuana in a vehicle when the vehicle is upon the publichighway; or (3) place marijuana in a container specificallylabeled by the manufacturer of the container as containinga non-marijuana substance. There is a rebuttable pre-sumption that it is a traffic in fraction if the original con- tainer of marijuana is incorre ctly labeled and there is a subsequent violation to having marijuana in the vehicle. Conditions of Probation . The mandatory conditions of probation for a DUI offense are expanded to include therequirement that a defendant drive a motor vehicle with aninstalled functioning IID as required by the DOL. Prior Offense . The definition of a \"prior offense\" in the impaired driving statute is clarified to include a con-viction for operating an aircraft or watercraft vessel, in a careless or reckless manner, if the conviction was the re-sult of a charge that was originally filed as a violation ofthe offense while under the in fluence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. Abstract of Driving Record . The DOL may furnish an abstract of an individual's dr iving record to that individu- al's named attorney of record. Physical Control . As part of a DOL hearing, an affir- mative defense is established for a PC offense in an actionbeing brought for a license revocation that the personmoved the vehicle safely off the roadway prior to beingpursued by a law enforcement officer. The 24/7 Sobriety Program . Testing under the Pro- gram must take place at a location designated by the par-ticipating agency or, with concurrence of the WASPC, by an alternate method. Particip ation in the Program is limit- ed to persons charged with or convicted of a DUI or PC of-fense or a crime specifically defined as a prior impaireddriving offense in which the use of alcohol or drugs was acontributing factor in the commis sion of the crime. An of- fender that violates the term of the Program post-trial may be sanctioned to serve his or her remaining sentence im-posed by the court. A court may remove an offender fromthe Program at any time for noncompliance. The Account can be used fo r operational and adminis- tration expenses related to the Program. Cities and coun-ties may subsidize or pay any ap plicable fees related to theHB 1277 49Program and may accept donations, gifts, and other assis- tance to help defray the costs of the Program. Forensic Phlebotomists . The DOH must adopt rules specifying requirements for de legation, training, and su- pervision for medical assistant-phlebotomists who are alsolaw enforcement employees or correctional employeesand whose practice is limite d to collecting venipuncture samples for forensic testing or pursuant to a search war-rant. At a minimum, the rules must provide: (1) standards for the minimum number of venipuncture collections nec-essary to maintain endorsem ent for collecting blood sam- ples for forensic testing; and (2) standards for location, conditions, and supervision of venipuncture collections. In addition, until July 1, 20 20, the rules must: (1) re- quire each medical assistant- phlebotomist to perform fifty venipuncture collections during the first year of his or hercertification; (2) require annual ongoing training for main-taining certification as a me dical assistant-phlebotomist; and (3) require that venipunc ture blood samples collected for testing take place at a s ite that provides for antiseptic techniques and that all such sites are inspected annually by the DOH. It is not professional misconduct for a physician, os- teopathic physician, registered nurse, licensed practicalnurse, advanced registered nurse practitioner, physicianassistant, osteopathic physician assistant, advanced emer-gency medical technician or paramedic, health care assis-tant, medical assistant-certified, medical assistant-phlebotomist, or hospital or duly licensed clinical labora- tory employing or utilizing services of such licensed orcertified health care provider, to collect a blood samplewithout a person's consent when these professionals aredirected by a law enforcement officer to do so for the pur- pose of a blood test under the provisions of a search war-rant or exigent circumstances. The identifiedprofessionals are also not subjec t to civil or criminal liabil- ity for withdrawing blood; howe ver, this does not relieve these professionals from professional discipline arisingfrom the use of improper procedures or from failing to ex-ercise the required standard of care.Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Effective: September 26, 2015 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the fol- lowing provisions requiring: (1) the DOH to adopt rules specifying requirements for de legation, training, and su- pervision for medical assistant-phlebotomists who are alsolaw enforcement employees or correctional employees, and whose practice is limite d to collecting venipuncture samples for forensic testing or pursuant to a search war-rant; (2) at a minimum, that the rules must provide stan- dards for the minimum number of venipuncture collections necessary to mainta in endorsement for collect- ing blood samples for forensic testing as well as providestandards for location, conditio ns, and supervision of ve- nipuncture collections; and (3) until July 1, 2020, that the rules include: (a) requiring each medical assistant-phle-botomist to perform 50 venipuncture collections during the first year of his or her cer tification; (b) requiring annu- al ongoing training for main taining certification as a med- ical assistant-phlebotomist; and (c) requiring that venipuncture blood samples collected for testing take place at a site that provide s for antiseptic techniques and that all such sites are inspected annually by the DOH. VETO MESSAGE ON 2E2SHB 1276 June 30, 2015 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 25, Second Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1276 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to impaired driving.\" The Department of He alth has a Medical Assistant-phleboto- mist credential that is currentl y available to law enforcement and corrections personnel. Creating a new sub-category is therefore unnecessary. MA-phlebot omist training program s specific to law enforcement forensic needs can be developed wi thout a change in current law or rules and MA-phle botomist training is typically on- the-job, and can be completed in a few days. Section 25 also creates subst antial new responsibilities and costs as it requires th e Department to inspect every police station, jail, corrections facility, or other location where a law enforce-ment MA-phlebotomist may take blood samples. The section also sets new ongoing training and mi nimum procedure standards for law enforcement MA-phlebotomists that no other medical assis- tants have, and that must be re gulated by the Department. For these reasons, I am vetoing this section. For these reasons I have vetoed Section 25 of Second Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1276. With the exception of Secti on 25, Second Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1276 is approved.

A fee may be assessed on lodgingbusinesses of up to $2 per night of stay. Funding must beused for increasing tourism and convention business. Ex-amples include advertising, pu blicizing, or otherwise dis- tributing information to attr act and welcome tourists, and operating tourism destinatio n marketing organizations. to increase convention and tourism business. In 2009 tourism promotion areas in a county with a population of 1 million or more were authorized. A \"leg-islative authority\" for such a county is two or more juris- dictions acting under an inte rlocal agreement to jointly establish and operate a tourism promotion area. Summary: The requirement for jurisdictions within a county with a population of 1 million or more to act jointly for the purposes of establishing and operating a tourismpromotion area is eliminated for cities incorporated after January 1990 with a population greater than 89,000.

By Representatives Zeiger, Goodman, Klippert, Orwall, Appleton, Sawyer and Gregerson. House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: License Suspension for Failure to Pay Child Support . Federal law requires states to have proce- dures for the suspension or restriction of a person's driver'slicense, professional and occupational licenses, and recre-ational and sporting licenses if the person owes past childsupport. Under Washington's license suspension program, the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) may serve an obligated parent with a notice of noncompli-ance if the parent fails to pay his or her support when due.By rule, the DSHS generally uses this enforcement tool when a parent is six months or more behind in child sup-port. In order to avoid license su spension, the parent has 20 days from the date of the notic e to contact the DSHS to pay overdue amounts, enter into a payment agreement, request an adjudicative hearing, or mo ve to modify the child sup- port obligation. If a parent fails to come into compliance with the child support order, the DSHS may certify to theDepartment of Licensing (DOL) and any appropriate li-censing entity that the responsib le parent is not in compli- ance with a child support order. The DOL suspends theparent's driver's license un til the DSHS provides the DOL with a release stating that th e parent is in compliance with the child support order. Driving While Licensed Suspended or Revoked . It is a crime for a person to drive a motor vehicle in this state while that person's privilege to drive is suspended or re-voked. There are three degr ees of the crime of Driving While License Suspended or Revoked (DWLS), which aredependent on the reason the person's license was suspend- ed or revoked. First degree DWLS is a gross misdemeanor offense and involves driving when an order of license revocationis in effect for being a habitual traffic offender. Second de-gree DWLS, also a gross misdemeanor offense, generallyinvolves driving when the pers on's license is suspended or revoked based on a conviction of any of a number of rela-tively serious traffic offenses or based on administrativeaction taken by the DOL. Third degree DWLS (DWLS 3) is a misdemeanor of- fense and generally involves dr iving after a license is sus- pended or revoked for secondary reasons where there is noset suspension period, such as: (1) failure to respond to a notice of traffic infraction; (2) failure to appear at a re-quested hearing; (3) violatio n of a written promise to ap- pear in court; or (4) failure to comply with the terms of a notice of traffic infraction or citation, in addition to a vari-ety of other behaviors. The crime of DWLS 3 does not lista suspension based on failure to be in compliance with achild support order as a basi s for committing the third-de- gree offense. Summary: The crime of DWLS 3 applies to apply to driving while a license is suspended based on failure to bein compliance with a child support order. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1283 C 167 L 15 Concerning nonprofit organizations engaged in debt ad- justing. By House Committee on Busi ness & Financial Services (originally sponsored by Re presentatives Parker, Kirby and Vick). House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance Background: Debt Adjusting Act . Washington's Debt Adjusting Act (DAA) regulates the provision of debt ad- justing services, which are defined as managing, counsel-ing, settling, adjusti ng, pro-rating, or liquidating a debtor's indebtedness or receiving funds for distribution amongcreditors in payment of a debt or's obligations. A debt ad- juster is a person who engages in debt adjusting for com-pensation and includes creditor counselors and debtsettlement providers. The contract between the debt adjuster and the debtor must contain various disclosures, including the debt ad-juster's fees and must require the debt adjuster to notify theHouse 97 0 Senate 44 0 (Senate amended)House 95 0 (House concurred) House 94 3 Senate 29 18SHB 1285 52debtor if a creditor refuses to accept payment. The total fee for debt adjusting services is capped at 15 percent of the debtor's total debt; excess fees void the contract. Thefee retained by a debt adju ster from any one payment made by a debtor may not exceed 15 percent of the payment.Before retaining the fee, the debt adjuster must notify allcreditors that the debtor has engaged the debt adjuster'sservices. A debt adjuster may not receive any cash, bonus, re- ward, or other compensation from a person other than adebtor or a person acting on th e debtor's behalf in connec- tion with his or her activities as a debt adjuster. Violation of the DAA constitutes a misdemeanor of- fense, as well as an unfair or deceptive act or practice un-der the Consumer Protection Act. The Office of theAttorney General may investig ate debt adjusting business- es and examine their books and records. Exemptions from the DAA . Numerous entities are ex- empt from regulation under the DAA. Among them arenonprofit organizations enga ged in debt adjusting that charge debtors a fee of not more than $15 per month. Also exempt from the DAA are attorneys, escrow agents, accountants, investme nt advisors, banks, and con- sumer loan compani es, among others. Summary: The prohibition against receiving compensa- tion from any person other than the debtor excludes fairshare, defined to mean creditor contributions paid to non-profit debt adjusters by the creditors whose debtors re-ceive debt adjusting services and pay down their debtsaccordingly. Fair share does not include grants receivedfor services unrelated to debt adjusting. The fee retained by a debt adjuster from any one payment made by a debtormay not exceed 15 percent of the payment, not includingfair share. Nonprofit debt adjusters or nonprofit organizations exempt from regulation must submit a report to the De- partment of Financial Institutio ns (DFI) each year for two years beginning June 30, 2016. The report must containthe following information: the number and percentage of debtor clients who ter- minated or otherwise became inactive in debt adjust- ing services and what percentage of his or her debt each debtor settled; the total fees collected from Washington debtors; and the total fair share collected. The report must also cont ain the following informa- tion for each debtor client: the date of contracting; the number of debts included in the contract; the principal amount of each debt at the time the con- tract was signed; the source of each debtor's obligations (e.g., credit card, student loan, medical debt); whether each debt is active, terminated, or settled; the settlement amount of the debt, if any, and the number and percentage of debtors who settled certain portions of their debt; the total fees charged to the debtor; and the organization's Form 990 submitted to the Internal Revenue Service or a statement of the organization's compensation provided to high-earning employees. The DFI is required to summarize the information re- ceived, make the summary re port public, and submit it to the Legislature by December 2016 and again by December2017.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1285 C 37 L 15 Requiring critical congenital heart disease screening for newborns. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Representatives Riccelli, Tharinger,Stanford and Gregerson). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health Care Background: Newborn Screenings . Newborn infants born in any setting are screened for a variety of The State Board of Health may add disor-ders to the newborn screenings by rule. A blood sample is collected for all newborn infants within 48 hours of birth for testing by the Department ofHealth (DOH). A test may not be given to any newborninfant whose parents object on the basis of religion. If thetests indicate a suspicion of an abnormality, the DOH must report the test results to th e infant's attending physician, who must inform the DOH the date upon which the parentswere informed of the results. Critical Congenital Heart Disease . Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is a group of heart de-fects that can cause life-threatening symptoms; CCHD caninclude abnormal or absent heart chambers, holes in theheart, or abnormalities in the heart's function. The Recom- mended Uniform Screening Pa nel issued by the UnitedHouse 98 0 Senate House49 0 (Senate amended) (House refused to concur) Senate 48 0 (Senate receded)2ESHB 1299 53States Department of Health and Human Services includes CCHD. Summary: Prior to discharge of an infant born in a hos- pital, the hospital must pe rform CCHD screening using pulse oximetry according to recommended American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines , record the results in the newborn's medical record, and, if the test indicates a sus- picion of abnormality, refer the newborn for appropriate care and report the test results to the newborn's attending physician and parent or guardian. A health care provider attending a birth outside of a hospital must provide the same CCHD screening as thehospital between 24 and 48 hours after the birth. If thehealth care provider is unable to provide the screening due to lack of equipment, he or she must notify the parents orguardian in writing that: the health care provider was unable to perform the test; and the infant should be tested by another health care pro- vider between 24 and 48 hours after the birth. A parent who objects on religious grounds may opt out of the screening.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 2ESHB 1299 PARTIAL VETO C 10 L 15 E 1 Making transportation appropriations for the 2013-2015 and 2015-2017 fiscal biennia.

VETO MESSAGE ON 2ESHB 1299 June 11, 2015 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 102, page 2, lines 29-36, and page 3, lines 1-8; 103(1); 213(3); to transpor tation funding and appropria- tions.\" Section 102, page 2, lines 29-36, and page 3, lines 1-8, Utilities and Transportation Commissio n, State Agency Workgroup This proviso directs the Ut ilities and Transportation Commis- sion (UTC) to coordinate a state agency workgroup to identify is- sues related to consolidating ra il employee safety and regulatory functions within the UTC. Fundi ng for this activity would come from the Grade Crossing Protective Account, which is used to in- stall and maintain equipment to make grade crossi ngs safer. Be- cause this is not the appropriate fund source for coordinating a workgroup on the topic identified in the proviso, I have directedthe UTC to conduct this activity wi th other existing resources. For this reason, I have vetoed Sec tion 102, page 2, lines 29-36, and page 3, lines 1-8. Section 103(1), page 3, Office of Financial Management, Study of Fund Exchange This proviso directs the Office of Financial Management to per- form a study on the feasibility of establishing a fund exchange where federal funds are exchanged for state funds to reduce the administrative burden on local governments which use federalfunds. The funding is likely insuffic ient to provide a thorough re- port on the issues. In addition, the Joint Transportation Committee is a more appropriate entity to perform this analysis, not the Office of Financial Management. Ther efore, I have vetoed Section 103(1). Section 213(3), pages 18-19, De partment of Tr ansportation, Beaver Dams This proviso creates a complicated process for managing bea- ver dams on private property that pose a threat to Washington state highways, individual personal property, and public safety. The proposed process would require the Washington State Depart- ment of Transportation to notify private property owners of im- pending threats from beaver dam failure, to produce wildlife management plans, and to provide potential remedies that could create liability for the state. In addition, no funding is provided for this effort. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 213(3). Section 920(4), pages 105-106, Department of Transportation, Public TransportationHouse 97 0 Senate 48 0 House 78 19House 74 20 Senate 47 0HB 1302 54This proviso prevents the Washington State Department of Transportation from continuing work on regional mobility grantprojects previously authorized by the Legislature. The department needs authority to work on these projects to support local efforts to improve transit m obility and reduce congestion on our road- ways. The majority of the projects are not yet complete, and expen- ditures have already been made. Therefore, I have vetoed Section 920(4). Section 1005, page 113, lines 26-27, and Section 1005(2), page 114, Department of Transpor tation, Highway Improvements Program Due to changes in the timing of expenditures for highway im- provement projects and insufficient flexibility in the capital pro- gram budgets, this reduced appropriation would result in an estimated shortfall of $3. 5 million in expenditure authority in the Highway Improvements program. The Washington State Depart- ment of Transportation must hav e ongoing expenditure authority to keep projects within the tota l spending plan. Th erefore, I have vetoed Section 1005, page 113, lines 26-27, and Section 1005(2). Section 1005(4), 1005(5) and 1005(6), page 115, Department of Transportation, Proceeds from Bond Sales Section 605 provides the flexibil ity needed to retroactively as- sign bond proceeds received in th e 2015-17 biennium to associat- ed costs that occurred in the 2013-15 biennium. The reduced appropriations in Section 1005(4) , Section 1005(5), and Section 1005(6) negate the flexibility provided in Section 605. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 1005(4), Section 1005(5), and Sec- tion 1005(6). For these reasons I have vetoed Sections 102, page 2, lines 29- 36, and page 3, lines 1-8; 103(1); 213(3); 1005(6) of Sec-ond Engrossed Substitute House Bill No. 1299. With the exception of Sections 102, page 2, lines 29-36, and page 3, lines 1-8; 103(1); 1005(6), Second En- grossed Substitute House Bill No. 1299 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Jay Inslee Governor HB 1302 C 38 L 15 Clarifying the applicability of child abduction statutes to residential provisions ordered by a court. By Representatives Haler, Tarleton and Jinkins.House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: The crime of Custodial Interference gener- ally involves taking, enticing, retaining, detaining, or con- cealing a child away from a parent or other person who hasa lawful right to custody or tim e with the child, with the in- tent to deny that person access to the child. There are twodegrees to the crime of Custodial Interference, and forboth degrees, there are differen t elements to the crime de- pending on whether the perpet rator is a relative or parent of the child and whether or not a custody order or parent-ing plan has been established. Custodial Interference in th e first degree is committed by a parent if the parent ta kes a child with the intent todeny access to the other parent who has the right to time with the child under a court-ordered parenting plan, andthe parent: intends to hold the ch ild permanently or for a pro- tracted period; exposes the child to a substantial risk of illness or physical injury; or causes the child to be removed from the state of usual residence. Custodial Interference in th e second degree is com- mitted by a parent if: the parent takes a child with the intent to deny access to the other parent who has the right to time with the child under a court-ordered parenting plan; the parent has not comp lied with the residential pro- visions of the parenting plan after a finding of con- tempt; or the parent has engaged in a pattern of willful viola- tions of the court-ordered residential provisions. Under both first degree and second degree Custodial Interference committed by a pare nt, one element of the of- fense is that the parent from whom the child is taken must have a lawful right to time with the child under a court-or-dered \"parenting plan.\" In the case State v. Veliz , the Washington Supreme Court held that a domestic violence protection order containing residential provisions for achild does not constitute a court-ordered \"parenting plan\" for the purposes of Custodial Interference in the first de- gree. The court found that the Legislature used the term\"parenting plan\" as a term of ar t referring only to parenting plans established pursuant to a proceeding for the dissolu-tion or legal separation of a marriage or domestic partner-ship. Summary: Custodial Interference in the first degree when committed by a parent ap plies where the parent from whom the child is taken has th e right to time with the child under any court order making residential provisions forthe child. Custodial Interference in the second degree when committed by a parent applie s when the parent from whom a child is taken or kept has a lawful right to time with thechild pursuant to any court order making residential provi-sions for the child, unless the factual basis for the chargeis that the parent has not co mplied with the residential pro- visions of a parenting plan after a finding of contempt.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 House 97 0 Senate 45 0HB 1307 55HB 1307 C 39 L 15 Concerning enforcement standa rds for residential services and support providers. By Representatives Harris, Tharinger, Walkinshaw and Kagi; by request of Department of Social and Health Ser-vices. House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Health Care Background: Certified Residential Services and Support Providers . Certified Residential Service and Support Pro- viders (CRSSPs) are certified by the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and contracted by the DSHSto deliver client instruction and support services. These providers include group hom es, supported living services, community protection programs, crisis diversion bed ser-vices, and group training homes. Service providers mustprovide each client with inst ruction or support as identi- fied in a client's individual support plan. The areas of sup- port to the client may include: home living activities; community living activities; life-long learning activities social activities; employment; protection and advocacy activities; exceptional medical support needs; and exceptional behavioral support needs. Enforcement Mechanisms for Certified Residential Services and Support Providers . The Developmental Dis- ability Administration (DDA) applies enforcement mech- anisms to community pr otection programs. These mechanisms include decertifying the provider, refusing torenew the certification, imposi ng conditions on certifica- tion, suspending referrals, or requiring the provider to im- plement a plan of correction. If community protectionprogram providers fail to make the adjustments requiredby a plan of correction, th e DDA may impose civil penal- ties up to $150 per day. The Administrative Procedures Act applies to these enforcement actions. Summary: The enforcement mechanisms that the DDA may impose on the CRSSPs to apply to all the CRSSPs. The conditions that the DDA may impose on a CRSSP include making correc tions within a spec ific time, requir- ing training, and imposing limits on the type of client the provider may serve. The DDA is also authorized to sus-pend the provider from accep ting clients with specified needs by imposing a limited stop placement. If the DDA orders a stop pl acement, the provider may not accept new clients or clients with specific needs untilthe stop placement order is terminated. The DDA will ter- minate the stop placement order when the violations havebeen corrected and the provid er exhibits the capacity to maintain correction of the violations. After ordering a stop pla cement, the DDA must make an on-site visit to the provider within 15 working days ofthe provider notifying the DDA that a correction wasmade. For serious violations, the DDA must visit the pro-vider as soon as appropriate to ensure correction. Verifi- cation of all other violations may be made either by a DDAon-site visit or by credible written or photog raphic docu- mentation. The fines that the DDA may impose on providers are reduced to a maximum of $100 per day per violation. TheDDA may impose a maximum total violation amount of$3,000. Providers have the right to an informal dispute resolu- tion process to dispute any violation found or enforcementremedy imposed by the DDA. Except for imposition of civil penalties, the effective date of enforcement actions may not be delayed or suspended pending hearings or aninformal dispute resolution process. The DDA must develop rule s to implement these en- forcement actions by January 1, 2016. A separate residential services and support account is created and all receipts fro m civil penalties against a CRSSP must be deposited in th is account. Expenditures from the account are authorized only for promoting thequality of life and care of a CRSSP client.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1308 C 132 L 15 Addressing surplus lines of insurance. By Representatives Vick, Ki rby, Parker and Stanford. House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance Background: Surplus Lines Insurance . Generally, an in- surance company may not engage in the business of insur- ance in the state unless the insurance company isauthorized to do so by the Office of the Insurance Com- missioner (OIC). \"Surplus lin es\" insurance coverage is an exception. Surplus lines insura nce is coverage that cannot be procured from authorized insurance companies. Often,surplus lines policies cover risk s that do not fit normal un- derwriting patterns or do no t fit standard insurance poli- cies. Unlike insurance offere d by an authorized insurer, surplus lines insurance is no t subject to rate and policy form oversight. If coverage cannot be pu rchased from an authorized insurer, the coverage may be purchased from an unautho-House 98 0 Senate 48 0HB 1309 56rized insurer through a licensed surplus lines broker if: a diligent effort is made to find the coverage from autho- rized insurers; and the purpos e for using an unauthorized insurer is something other th an securing a lower premium rate than would be accepted by any authorized insurer. The surplus lines broker must execute an affidavit set- ting forth the facts regarding the required diligent effort and the purpose for using an un authorized insurer when in- surance is purchased from an unauthorized insurer. Theaffidavit must be filed with the OIC within 30 days afterthe purchase of the insurance. Licensing requirements regarding surplus lines bro- kers include background checks, including fingerprints;minimum bonding amounts; record-keeping; and report-ing. Because a surplus lines insurer is not an authorizedinsurance company, the Wash ington Insurance Guaranty Association, which pays claims as a result of the insolven- cy of an authorized insurer, does not cover claims of in- sureds of a surp lus lines insurer. Home State . An insured's \"home state,\" if the insured is a business, is the state where the insured maintains itsheadquarters. For an individual, it is his or her principalresidence or, if all of the insured risk is located outside ofWashington, the state to whic h the greatest percentage of the insured's taxable premium is allocated. Surplus Lines Premium Tax . A surplus lines broker must pay a tax of 2 percent on the premiums for surpluslines insurance transacted by the broker. The tax is credit-ed to the General Fund. If a surplus lines policy covers risks or exposures that are only partially located in this state, the tax is computed upon the proportion of the risksor exposures located in this state. For property and casualty insurance, if Washington is the insured's home state, the tax is computed upon the en- tire premium without regard to whether the policy covers risks or exposures that are located in this state. Risks lo-cated outside of the United States are not addressed. For all other lines of insurance, the tax is computed upon the proportion of the premium allocable to the risks or expo-sures located in Washington. Summary: The tax on the premiums for surplus lines property and casualty insura nce must be computed upon the entire premium for covered risks or exposures withinthe United States or its territories. The tax must be com-puted upon the entire premium, regardless of whether the risks or exposures are located in Washington. If the surplus lines insurance covers risks or exposures located outside of the United States and its territories, no tax is due or payable for the portion of the premium allo-cated for those risks and exposures.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015HB 1309 C 133 L 15 Concerning the sale of floating homes or floating on-water residences by brokers.

A real estate broker is required to obtaina license from the Department of Licensing (Department). A vessel dealer is a person engaged in the business of selling watercraft used or capab le of being used as a means of transportation on the wa ter, not including seaplanes. Vessel dealers must also obtain a license from the Depart-ment to sell vessels in Washington. Certain kinds of residential homes float on the water. There are two types of such homes. The first is a floatinghome, defined as a single-fami ly dwelling constructed on a float that is moored or anchored in the water. Suchhomes are not considered vessel s, even if they are capable of being towed. The second kind of floating domicile is afloating on-water residence, defined as a floating resi-dence with detachable utiliti es whose owner or occupant has held an ownership or leasehold interest in a marinaspace since at least June 30, 2014. Summary: The definition of real estate brokerage ser- vices is expanded to include dealing in floating homes and floating on-water residences.

By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Stambaugh, Jinkins, Nealey, Hurst,Kilduff, Reykdal, Wilson and Sawyer). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: Protective Orders . A person may file a pe- tition asking a judge to grant an order to protect him or herfrom another person whose behavior is abusive, threaten-ing, exploitive, or seriously alarming. There are multipletypes of protections orders, each intended for specific sit-uations. These include domestic violence protection or-ders, antiharrassment protection orders, sexual assaultprotection orders, and vulnerable adult protection orders. A vulnerable adult, or an interested person on behalf of a vulnerable adult, may br ing a petition for an order for protection of a vulnerable adult in cases of abandonment,abuse, financial expl oitation, or neglect. A petitioner may seek a temporary protection order without notice to the respondent in order to protect the pe-titioner until a hearing on the petition is held. The court may grant a temporary protection order for a vulnerableadult when it appears that th e respondent is committing, or is threatening, to abandon, abuse, exploit, or neglect thevulnerable adult. Mandatory Arrests . A peace officer must arrest with- out a warrant and take into custody individuals who the of-ficer has probable cause to believe has violated certainprovisions of a protective order or temporary protectiveorder issued relating to domes tic violence, stalking, sexual assault, legal separation, or child custody. Mandatory ar-rests relating to vulnerable ad ult protection orders are only for violations of a protection order, not a temporary pro-tection order. Provisions that require arrest include thosethat restrain a person, exclud e the person from a residence, workplace, school, or day care, or prohibit the person fromknowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining with- in, a specified distance of a location, if the person re-strained knows of the order. Summary: A peace officer must arrest without a warrant and take into custody any pers on the officer has a probable cause to believe has violated certain provisions of tempo-rary protection orders regarding the abuse of vulnerableadults. Provisions that require arrest for a violation ofsuch temporary protection orde rs include those that re- strain a person, exclude the person from a residence, work-place, school, or day care, or prohibit the person fromknowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining with- in, a specified distance of a location, if the person re-strained knows of the order. Violating certain provisions of temporary protection orders regarding the abuse of vulnerable adults is a gross misdemeanor. The provisions for which a violation wouldbe considered a gross misdemeanor are: (1) restraint pro-visions prohibiting acts or threats of violence or stalking;(2) provisions excluding th e person from a residence, workplace, school, or day care ; (3) provisions prohibiting a person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly re-maining within, a specified di stance of a location; (4) pro- visions prohibiting interfering with the protected party's efforts to remove a pet; and (5 ) provisions of a foreign pro- tection order specifically indi cating that a violation is a crime.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015House 97 0 Senate 45 0 House 97 0 Senate House49 0 (Senate amended) (House refused to concur) Senate 48 0 (Senate receded)HB 1317 58HB 1317 C 41 L 15 Revising the lien for collection of sewer charges by coun- ties. By Representatives Zeiger, Kilduff, Kirby, Wylie and Sawyer. House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: County Liens for De linquent Sewer and Water Bills . Counties operating a sewerage, water, or sew- erage and water system have a lien against property for de- linquent connection charges, service charges, interest, andpenalties. Interest may be fi xed by resolution at 8 percent per annum from the da te due until paid. Penalties of not more than 10 percent of the amount due on unpaid chargesmay also be imposed. Delinquent charges are certified to the county auditor periodically, and at that time, the lien attaches to the prem-ises to which services were available. The lien is for allcharges, interest, and penalties and is superior to all other liens and encumbrances, except general taxes and localand special assessments of the county. The county may file a forecl osure action in the superi- or court where the property is located 60 days after attach- ment of the lien. The lien is foreclosed in the same manneras real property tax liens. Co sts associated with the fore- closure action may be added to the lien. City and Town Liens for Delinquent Sewer and Water Bills . Cities and towns that operate sewer systems have a lien against property for delinquent and unpaid: sewerservice rates and charges, co nnection charges, penalties imposed for failure to connect private drains and sewerswith those of the city or town , and interest. Penalties for failure to connect may be in an amount equal to the charge that would be made for sewer service if the property was connected to the system. De linquent charges may bear in- terest in an amount up to 8 percent per annum, computedon a monthly basis, as provided by city or town ordinance. The sewerage lien is against the premises to which ser- vice was furnished or is available. It is superior to all otherliens and encumbrances, except general taxes and localand special assessments. Without any writing or reco rding of the sewerage lien with the county auditor, it is effective for up to six months of delinquent charges. The lien may be effective for more than six months of charges by filing a sewerage lien notice with the county auditor. Th e notice must be substantially in a prescribed form and recorded in the same manner forrecording of mechanics' liens. Alternative Lien Procedure - Cities and Towns . A city or town may by ordinance or resolution adopt an alterna-tive lien procedure. Under th e alternative lien procedure, a city or town may establish that, without writing or re-cording a sewerage lien with th e county auditor, the sew-erage lien is effective for a period of up to one year's delinquent service charges. As an additional means of enforcing sewerage liens, cities and towns may provide by ordinance for enforce-ment of the sewerage lien by cutting off water service from the property for which service charges are delinquent andunpaid. Mechanics' Liens - Recording . For mechanics' liens, a notice of claim of lien must be filed for recording in the county where the subject proper ty is located not later than 90 days after the person has ceased to furnish services.The notice of claim of lien must be in a prescribed form. Unless the claim of lien is filed within a 90-day period, no action to foreclose the li en will be maintained. The claim of lien must be provided to the property owner bycertified mail, registered mail, or personal service within 14 days of recording the claim of lien. Summary: In addition to all delinquent charges, interest, and penalties, county sewer a nd water liens include lien re- cording and release fees. In lieu of standard sewerag e lien procedures, counties are authorized to adopt by ordinance or resolution alterna-tive lien procedures available to cities and to wns. Under the alternative lien procedures: A county may establish that, without any writing or recording of a sewerage lien with the county auditor, the lien is effective for up to six months of delinquent charges. The lien may be effective for more than sixmonths of charges by filing a sewerage lien notice with the county auditor. The notice must be substan- tially in a prescribed, and recorded in the same man-ner provided by law for reco rding of mechanics' liens. The county may establish that, without writing or recording a sewerage lien with the county auditor, the sewerage lien is effective for a period of up to one year's delinquent service charges. The county may provide for enforcement of the sew- erage lien by cutting off wa ter service from the prop- erty to which service was furnished and charges are delinquent and unpaid.

By House Committee on Public Safety (originally spon- sored by Representatives Go odman and Moscoso; by re- quest of Department of Corrections). House Committee on Public Safety Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Background: In June of 2012 the United States Supreme Court held, in Miller v. Alabama, that the Eighth Amend- ment ban on cruel and unusual punishment forbids a sen-tencing scheme that mandates life in prison without the possibility of parole for juven ile homicide offenders. In 2013 legislation was enacted to comply with Miller v. Al- abama . Youth who commit Aggravated first degree Mur- der must be sentenced to a 25-year minimum sentence if the youth committed the crime before age 16 years old, ora minimum sentence between 25 years and life, if theyouth committed the crime at age 16 or 17 years old. Lifewithout parole is available within the discretion of the judge for youths who commit Aggravated first degreeMurder at age 16 or 17 year s old. In setting a minimum term, the court must take into account mitigating factors as provided in Miller v. Alabama . During the minimum term of total confinement, the offender is not eligible for community custody, earned re- lease time, furlough, home de tention, partial confinement, work crew, work release, any other form of early release, or any other form of authorized leave or absence from thecorrectional facility while not in the direct custody of a corrections officer. No later th an 180 days prior to the ex- piration of the offender's minimum sentence, the Depart-ment of Corrections (DOC) must conduct an examinationof the offender to assist in predicting the dangerousnessand likelihood that the offender will engage in future crim- inal behavior if released. The Indeterminate SentencingReview Board (ISRB) must order that the offender be re-leased unless it determines by a preponderance of evi-dence that, despite conditions, it is more likely than notthat the offender will commit new criminal law violationsif released. If the ISRB does not order that the offender be released, it must set a new minimum term not to exceedfive years for the offender prior to future review. If an of- fender is released after serving the minimum term of con-finement, the offender is s ubject to community custody under the supervision of the DOC and the authority of the ISRB for a period of time determined by the ISRB. Any offender convicted of one or more crimes com- mitted prior to his or her eighteenth birthday may petitionthe ISRB for early release after serving no less than 20years in total confinement, pr ovided that the offender has not had any new convictions subsequent to his or her eigh-teenth birthday, has not had a major violation in the 12 months prior to the petition, and is not serving a sentencefor Aggravated first degree Murder or a sex offense. Summary: The DOC must supervise any offender who is released by the ISRB and w ho was sentenced to commu- nity custody or subject to community custody under theterms of release. The DOC may release an offender from confinement when his or her release has been ordered by the ISRB, re-gardless of any mandatory sentence enhancements forfirearms, deadly weapons, or sexual motivation. An offender convicted of Aggravated first degree Murder prior to his or her eighteenth birthday may not earnearly release time during th e minimum term of confine- ment set by the court. A juvenile offender released by the ISRB, who has been convicted of Aggravated first degree Murder, may bereturned to confinement at the discretion of the ISRB when the offender has viol ated a condition of community custody. The ISRB shall set a new minimum term of in-carceration not to exceed five years. A juvenile offender released by the ISRB, other than those convicted of Aggravated first degree Murder or a sexoffense, may be returned to confinement at the discretion of the ISRB for up to the re mainder of the court-imposed term of incarceration when the offender has violated a condition of community custody. The offender may file a new petition for release five years from the date of return to confinement or at an earlier date set by the ISRB.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: April 29, 2015 SHB 1337 C 135 L 15 Increasing the flexibility for industrial development dis- trict levies for public port districts. By House Committee on Finance (originally sponsored by Representatives Takko, Nealey , Springer, Zeiger, Tarleton and Chandler). House Committee on Local Government House Committee on FinanceSenate Committee on Trade & Economic DevelopmentSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Port Districts . Ports districts (districts) are established to acquire, constr uct, maintain, operate, devel- op, and regulate: harbor im provements; rail, motor vehi- cle, water, air, or any combination of such transfer andterminal facilities; other commercial transportation, trans-fer, handling, storage and term inal facilities; and industrial improvements.House 98 0 Senate 46 0SHB 1337 60Powers of the district are exercised through a port commission (commission) consisting of three or fivemembers, as permitted. Comm issions establish long-term strategies for districts, and cr eate policies to guide the de- velopment, growth, and operatio n of the district. They are responsible for a district's annual budget, approving tax levy rates, and hiring district staff. Industrial Development Districts . A commission may create, and define the boundaries of, industrial develop-ment districts (IDD) within a po rt district. In doing so, the commission must find that th e creation of an IDD is proper and desirable in establishing and developing a system ofharbor improvements and indu strial development in the district. A comprehensive scheme of harbor improvements and industrial developments (comprehensive scheme) pro-vides for the development or redevelopment of marginal lands acquired within an IDD, and provides for the contin- uation of land uses that are public uses. Improvements ofproperty in an IDD and acqu isition of property must be made a part of the comprehensive scheme before any ex-penditures may be made on the improvements or propertyacquired. Port districts that have created IDDs may exercise nu- merous powers, including to: acquire property and pr operty rights by purchase or condemnation; develop and improve lands within the IDD; dredge, bulkhead, fill, grade, and protect property within the IDD; provide, maintain, and operate water, light, power and fire protection facilit ies and services, streets, roads, bridges, highways, waterways, tracks, rail andwater transfer and terminal facilities, and other harbor and industrial improvements; execute leases of lands; and establish local improvement districts within the IDDs, levy special assessments, and issue local improvement bonds.Property Taxes . Property taxes are imposed by state and local governments. The county assessor determinesthe assessed value for each pr operty and calculates prop- erty taxes based on the assessed valuation. The propertytax bill for an individual prop erty is determined by multi- plying the property's assessed value by the tax rate for each taxing district in whic h the property is located. The aggregate of all tax levies upon real and personal property by the state and all taxing districts may not ex-ceed 1 percent of the true and fair value of the property inany year. This limitation, however, does not prevent portdistricts from imposing levies at rates permitted by statute. Also, in general, the aggregat e levies of junior taxing dis- tricts and senior taxing districts, other than the state, maynot exceed $5.90 per $1,000 of assessed valuation. The term \"junior taxing district\" does not include port districts,and that this limitation does not apply to levies assessed by port districts at rates provided by statute. Industrial Developm ent District Levies . A port dis- trict that has adopted a comprehensive scheme may raiserevenue by an annual levy, not to exceed 45 cents per$1,000 of assessed value against the assessed valuation oftaxable property in the port district. A district's authorityto impose this le vy is subject to the following: First Six-Year Period . Any port district that has adopted a comprehensive scheme may raise revenue by an annual levy for a period of six years. Second Six-Year Period . A port district that has adopted a comprehensive scheme may raise revenue by an annual levy for a second six-year period after publishing notice of the inte nt to do so. However, if within 90 days of publis hing notice a petition con- taining sufficient signatures of voters registered in the port district is filed with the county auditor, the prop-osition to make the levies mu st be submitted to a vote at a special election and approved by the voters. Third Six-Year Period . A port district that has adopted a comprehensive scheme and borders thePacific Ocean may impose an annual levy for a third six-year period, if voters approve by a simple major- ity a ballot proposition auth orizing the additional lev- ies. Levy revenues must be used exclusively for the exer- cise of powers granted to the po rt district. In the event that a levy produces revenue in ex cess of the requirements to complete all projects of a district, the excess must be usedto retire general obligation bonded indebtedness. Reve- nues not expended in the year in which the levies weremade may be paid into a fund for future use, which may beaccumulated and carried over from year to year. Summary: Provisions authorizing po rt districts that have adopted a comprehensive schem e to impose annual levies for up to three six-year periods are repealed effective Jan-uary 1, 2026. Port districts are prohibited from levyingtaxes under the repealed provi sions for collection in 2026 and after. For taxes levied for collec tion in 2016 and after, port districts that have adopted a comprehensive scheme areauthorized to impose levies for up to three multiyear levy periods. Under the new provisions, port districts that have ad- opted a comprehensive scheme may raise revenue throughlevies for up to three multiyea r levy periods. A district's authority to raise revenue through multiyear levy periods is subject to the following: First and Second Multiyear Levy Periods . For both first and second multiyear levy periods: the multi- year levy periods do not have to be consecutive; the multiyear levy periods may not overlap; the aggregate revenue that may be collected over the two multiyearHB 1342 61levy periods may not exceed an amount calculated in accordance with statute; the levy rate in any year may not exceed 45 cents per $1,000 of assessed value; and the multiyear levy periods may not exceed 20 years from the date the initial levy is made in the applicable multiyear period. In addition, for second multiyear levy periods, the commission must publish notice of the intent to impose levies over a seco nd period, and if a petition is filed with the county aud itor within 90 days of pub- lication of the notice, subm it the proposition to voters at a special election. Third Multiyear Levy Period . A port district that has adopted a comprehensive scheme and borders the Pacific Ocean may impose a third levy for a period that may not exceed six years, if voters approve by asimple majority a ballot proposition authorizing the levy. The levy rate may not exceed 45 cents per $1,000 of assessed value. A port district that has imposed annual levies in a first six-year period pursuant to provisions repealed effectiveJanuary 1, 2026, may be eligib le to impose levies for a sec- ond or third multiyear levy period, provided that certaincriteria are satisfied. Similarly, a port district that has im-posed annual levies in a second six-year period may be el-igible to impose levies for a third multiyear levy period, provided that certain criteria are satisfied. With the exception of levies assessed by port districts in a third multiyear levy period, limitations for regularproperty taxes do not apply to port district levies for theIDDs.

By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Griffey, Blake, Lytton andG. Hunt). House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: Washington's Director of Fire Protection, a position also referred to as the Washington State Fire Mar-shal (Fire Marshal), is charged with providing training,certification, and coordinatio n duties related to protecting life, property, and the envi ronment from fire. The Fire Marshal is appointed by the Chief of the Washington StatePatrol (WSP), and the Fire Marshal's office operates as abureau within the WSP. Bu reau staff is located in its Olympia headquarters office, at the WSP Fire TrainingAcademy (Academy) in North Bend, Washington, and ineight field offices around the state. One of the Fire Marshal duti es is to develop and adopt a plan with a goal of providin g Fire Fighter I and wildland training to all firefighters in the state. The term \"FireFighter I\" is used to designate a specific level of training,knowledge, and skills that rela te to functioning safely and effectively as an integral member of a firefighting team.\"Wildland training\" refers to a type of training that pre-pares firefighters for fighting wildfires. Wildland training is encompassed within firefigh ter training provided at the Academy. The Fire Marshal reimburses firefighting entities for the costs incurred by these enti ties in providing their own training to firefighters. For example, wildland training re- imbursements must be provided by the WSP to fire protec-tion districts (fire districts) and city fire departments (firedepartments) if certain requirements are met. Additional-ly, the training plan of the Fire Marshal must include a re-imbursement for fire districts and fire departments of not less than $3 per hour of Fire Fighter I or wildland training.The reimbursements that th e WSP can provide per fire-House 75 23 Senate 48 0House 96 1 Senate 39 9HB 1389 62fighter for Fire Fighter I or wildland training may not ex- ceed 200 hours. Summary: The Director of Fire Protection (Fire Mar- shal), rather than developing and adopting a plan with a goal of providing Fire Fighter I and wildland training to allfirefighters in the state, must develop and adopt a plan forthe WSP Fire Training Academy (Academy) to deliver ba-sic firefighter training and tes ting to all city fire depart- ments (fire departments), fi re protection districts (fire districts), regional fire protection service authorities (RFAs), and other public fire agencies in the state. Theplan must specify that the delivery of training and testingservices will be provided to recipients in the following or-der of priority: volunteer departments; combination departments; and fire agencies that employ only career firefighters and fire officers. The plan must also specify that the delivery of training and testing services will be provided by personnel of the Academy, either at the Academ y's facilities in North Bend, Washington or regionally at local fire agencies. In lieu of receiving training and testing services from the Academy, city fire depart ments, fire districts, RFAs, and other public fire agencies in the state may seek reim-bursement for their Firefighter I training expenses. Theamount of reimbursement must be calculated on a per cap-ita basis using a formula that considers, in part, the three- year statewide firefighter pe r capita average for the re- gional direct delivery of training by the Academy. Prior tothe implementation of these formula-based reimbursementprovisions, the amount of reimbursement for city fire de-partments, fire districts, RF As, and other public fire agen- cies must not be less than $3 for every one hour of provided Firefighter I training and may not exceed 200hours. Subject to approval by the Fire Marshal, and in accor- dance with the firefighter training and testing plan, Acad-emy facilities and programs must be made available at no cost to fire service youth programs. The goal of makingthese facilities and programs av ailable is to increase en- rollment of volunteer firefighters and to improve gender,cultural, and ethnic diversity within the fire service. Definitions related to th e development and adoption of a firefighter training and testing plan by the Fire Mar-shal are established as follows: \"Basic firefighter training and testing\" means training and testing for firefighters that is up to and includes the requirements of Firefight er I, as identified by the National Fire Protection Association Standard 1001. \"Combination department\" means a fire department with emergency service personnel comprising lessthan 85 percent of either volunteer or career member- ship. \"Delivery of training\" includes all resources, person- nel, and equipment necessary to deliver training at the Academy or regionally at local fire agencies. \"V olunteer department\" means a fire department with volunteer emergency service personnel comprising 85 percent or greater of its department membership. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1389 C 181 L 15 Addressing the scope of state fire service mobilization and ensuring compliance with exis ting state and federal disas- ter response policies. By Representatives Goodman, Griffey, Klippert, Van De Wege, Tarleton, Chandler, Morris, Lytton, Hayes andMoscoso. House Committee on Public Safety House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Generally, during an emergency when a lo- cal jurisdiction needs assistan ce beyond the capabilities of local resources and mutual agreements, a request may bemade for a state mobilization. A mobilization means that resources beyond those available through existing ag reements will be requested and, when available, sent in response to an emergency or disaster situation that ha s exceeded the capabilities of available local resources. During a large scale emergency,mobilization includes the redistribution of regional orstatewide firefighting resources to either direct emergency incident assignments or to an assignment in communities where firefighting resources are needed. The Chief of the Washington State Patrol (WSP) has the authority to mobilize juri sdictions under the Washing- ton State Fire Services Mobiliz ation Plan. The purpose of the mobilization plan is to provide a mechanism and pro- cess to quickly notify, assemble, and deploy fire servicepersonnel and equipment to an y local fire jurisdiction in Washington that has expended or will expend all available local and mutual aid resour ces in attempting to manage fires, disasters, or other ev ents that jeopardize the ability of a jurisdiction to provide fo r the protection of life and property. The State Fire Marshal in the WSP serves as thestate fire resources coordina tor when a state mobilization plan is mobilized. State fire mobilization pl ans are generally needed: because of the possibility of the occurrence of disas- trous fires or other disasters of unprecedented size and destructiveness;House 97 0 Senate 49 0HB 1392 63 to insure that the stat e is adequately prepared to respond to a fire or disaster; to provide for redistribution of personnel, equipment, and other logistical resources from around the statewhen a wild land fire or other emergency exceeds the firefighting capacity of local jurisdictions; to establish a mechanism and a procedure to provide for reimbursement to stat e agencies and local agen- cies that respond to help others in time of need or to a host fire district that ex periences expenses beyond its allocated available resource s in that district; and to protect the public peace, health, safety, lives, and property of the people of Washington.The WSP in consultation with the Office of Financial Management and the Washingt on Military Department is responsible for developing pr ocedures to facilitate reim- bursement to state agencies and local jurisdictions from appropriate federal and stat e funds when state agencies and jurisdictions are mobilized by the Chief of the WSPunder the Washington Fire Services Mobilization plan. When a mobilization is decl ared by the Chief of the WSP, all firefighting resources, including those of the host fire protection authorities, ar e deemed mobilized. Begin- ning from the time th e mobilization is declared, all non- host fire protection authoritie s providing firefighting re- sources in response to a mob ilization declaration are eligi- ble for expense reimbursement. All state and localagencies that participate in a fire service mobilization gen- erally receive reimbursement through the state's Disaster Response Account (Account). The Account is a dedicated account in the State Trea- sury. Money may be placed in the Account from legisla-tive appropriations and transf ers, federal appropriations, and other lawful sources. Expenditures from the Account are used to support state agency and local government di-saster response and recovery efforts. There have been 156mobilization events since the inception of the Washington Fire Services Mobilization Plan in 1994: 154 of the events were fire-related and two of the events were non-fire events (the 1999 World Trad e Organization riots and the 2008 Rosalia Motorcycle Rally). Summary: The Legislature recogniz es the role that fire service personnel play in responding to fires as well as oth-er various types of disasters. It is the intent of the Legis-lature that state fire service mobilizations be allowed in all incidents to which fire service personnel typically re-spond, so long as the mobili zations meet the requirements identified in the Washington St ate Fire Service Mobiliza- tion Plan. It is the intent of the Legislature to review theuse of fire mobilizations for emergencies and disastersother than fire suppression to determine if this policy should continue or be modified. The term \"mobilizatio n\" is redefined to mean that all risk resources regularly provid ed by fire departments, fire districts, and regional fire protection service authoritiesbeyond those available thro ugh existing agreements will be requested and, when availa ble, sent in response to an emergency or disaster situation that has exceeded the ca-pabilities of available local reso urces. During a large scale emergency, mobilization includ es the redistribution of re- gional or statewide risk resources to either direct emergen-cy incident assignments or to assignments in communitieswhere resources are needed. Fire department resourcesmay not be mobilized to assist law enforcement with po-lice activities during a civil protest or demonstration.However, fire departments, fire districts, and regional fire protection service authorities may provide medical care oraid and firefighting when mobilized for any purpose. \"All risk resources\" means those resources regularly provided by fire departments, fire districts, and regional fire protection service authorities required to respond tonatural or man-made incident s, including but not limited to, wild land fires, lands lides, earthquakes, floods, and contagious diseases.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1392 C 183 L 15 Concerning the administrative rate the recreation and con- servation funding board may retain to administer the grantprograms established in chapter 79A.15 RCW. By Representatives Stanford, Tharinger, Dunshee and Mc- Bride; by request of Recreation and Conservation Office. House Committee on Capital Budget Senate Committee on Na tural Resources & Parks Background: The Recreation and Conservation Office (RCO) administers several gr ant programs for numerous boards and councils to creat e outdoor recreational oppor- tunities, protect the state's w ildlife habitat and farmland, and assist salmon recovery efforts. One such grant pro-gram is the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Program(WWRP) that was established in 1990 to acquire as soonas possible the most signific ant lands for wildlife conser- vation and outdoor recreation pu rposes. In addition to ac- quiring recreation and habita t lands, the program also develops recreation areas for growing populations, pre-serves farmlands, and restores and develops state lands. The grants are selected thro ugh a competitive process and funds are awarded by the Recreation and Conserva-tion Funding Board (RCFB). The RCO must submit a pri-oritized list of projects to the Legislature in its biennialbudget request. The projects are prioritized by eight advi-sory committees that review an d rank the applications sub- mitted to the RCFB. In ad dition to supp orting the RCFBHouse 98 0 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 97 1 (House concurred)ESHB 1410 64and the advisory committees, the RCO develops the grant program policies and prepares and supports the materialsand electronic applications. The RCO communicates withpotential applicants and provide technical assistance.These reviews applications for completeness and preparesand manage grant agreements for each project. These en- sures compliance and provides public access to and disclo-sure of grant records. Before 2004 no administra tive funds were allowed to be retained from WWRP appropriations. In 2005 a 3 per-cent fee was established for the administration of the WWRP. The amount available for administration variesdepending on the total appropriations, which have rangedfrom $42 million in 2011-13 to $100 million in 2007-09. An analysis conducted by the RCO shows that the actualcost to administer the program is about 4.3 percent. The RCO is authorized to re tain portions of appropri- ated funds to administer other grant programs as well.Those administrative fees vary depending on the program. For instance, the Aquatic Lands Enhancement Account program allows up to 5 percen t to be used for administra- tive costs. The Youth Athletic Facilities program allowsup to 4.12 percen t and the Nonhighway and Off-road Ve- hicle Activities program allows up to 10 percent to be re- tained for administrative costs. Summary: The RCO is authorized to retain a portion of the funds appropriated for the WWRP for administrativecosts. The portion must be based on either (a) the actualadministration costs averaged ov er the previous five bien- nia as a percentage of the new appropriation, or (b) theamount specified in the approp riationss, if any. The per- centage of the appropriation must be approved by the Of-fice of Financial Manageme nt and submitted along with the prioritized list of projects.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESHB 1410 C 136 L 15 Modifying provisions governi ng the competitive bidding process of water-sewer districts. By House Committee on Loca l Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Takko, Muri, Kilduff, Zei-ger, Manweller, Pike, Stanford and Condotta). House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: Special purpose dist ricts are limited pur- pose local governments separate from a city, town, orcounty government. Water-sewer districts (districts), atype of special purpose district, are created to further pub-lic health and safety and to furnish water, sewerage, and drainage services to person s within and without the dis- trict. Contract and Competitive Bidding . All work ordered by a district that has an estimated cost in excess of $20,000must be let by contract and competitive bidding. Any pur- chases by the district of materials, supplies, or equipmentthat has an estimated cost in excess of $40,000 must be let by contract. Purchases with an estimated cost of $50,000 or more must be made by competitive bidding. Competi- tive bidding requirements may be waived if an applicable exemption applies to the pu rchase or public work. Before a district contract requiring competitive bid- ding is awarded, notice invitin g sealed bid proposals must be published. Bids submitted to the district must be ac- companied by a deposit in an amount not less than 5 per- cent of the amount of the bid. The contract must beawarded to the lowest responsible bidder. When a contract is let, the successful bidder's deposit is retained until the contract is entered into for the workand a performance bond for the full amount of the contract price is furnished to the distri ct in accordance with the bid. If the bidder fails to enter into a contract and furnish a per- formance bond, the deposit is forfeited to the district. Summary: The estimated cost thr eshold for work ordered by a district, over which it must be let by contract andcompetitive bidding, is increased from $20,000 to $50,000.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 EHB 1422 C 168 L 15 Concerning misrepresentation of a floral product busi- ness's geographic location and advertising requirementsfor floral product businesses. By Representatives Scott, Griffey and Condotta.House Committee on Business & Financial Services Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: In 1999 legislation was enacted prohibiting florists from misrepresenting their geographic location.Where there is no conspicuous disclosure of the the actuallocation of the business, a floral business may not misrep-resent its location by: listing a local telephone number in a local telephone directory if the calls to the number are routinely for-warded or otherwise transf erred outside of the calling area covered by the directory; or listing a business name in a local telephone directory if the name misrepresents the business's geographic location.House 72 25 Senate 47 2 (Senate amended)House 73 24 (House concurred)House 97 0 Senate 41 5ESHB 1424 65A violation of these provisions is an unfair or decep- tive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method ofcompetition in violation of the Consumer Protection Act(CPA). Under the CPA, any pe rson who is injured in his or her business or property by a violation may bring a civilaction in superior court to enjo in further violations, to re- cover actual damages, as well as costs and attorneys' fees. A business in violation of the CPA by the use of unfairmethods of competition and un fair or deceptive acts or practices is subject to a civil penalty of up to $2,000. Summary: Businesses that provide floral or ornamental products or services are not permitted to list a local tele-phone number in an adverti sement or listing unless the true physical address, includin g the city, is identified. If such a business lists a fictitio us or assumed business name in any advertisement or listing that misrepresents the geo-graphical location of the busin ess, it must also identify the true location of the business including the city and state. If a business violates any of these prohibitions, the ex- clusive maximum punishment is a fine of $250. The pro-hibitions do not apply to a publisher of a telephonedirectory or other publication, a provider of directory as-sistance, an Internet website that aggregates business in- formation, or an Internet service provider.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESHB 1424 C 249 L 15 Concerning suicide prevention. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Representa tives Orwall, Kagi, Jinkins, Gregerson, Goodman, Santos, Fey and Sawyer). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health Care Background: The following health professions must complete training in suicide assessment, treatment, andmanagement every six years as part of their continuing ed-ucation requirements: counselors and certified advisors; chemical dependency professionals; marriage and family therapists, mental health coun- selors, and social workers; occupational therapy practitioners; and psychologists. The following health professions must complete one- time training in suicide assessment, treatment, and man-agement: chiropractors; naturopaths; licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, and practitioners; physicians; osteopathic physicians; physician assistants; osteopathic physician assistants; physical therapists; and physical therapist assistants. A disciplining authority may, by rule, specify the min- imum training and experience that is sufficient to exempt a professional from the training requirements. A disciplin-ing authority may also exempt a professional if he or shehas only brief or limited patient contact. The disciplining authorities governing the professions subject to the training requir ements must work collabora- tively to develop and maintain a model list of training pro-grams. When updating the list, the disciplining authoritiesmust, to the extent practicable , endeavor to include train- ing that includes content speci fic to veterans. The disci- plining authorities must consu lt with the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs (WDV A) when identify-ing content specific to veterans. Beginning July 1, 2015, school nurses, school social workers, school psychologists, and school counselorsmust complete training in yo uth suicide screening and re- ferral as a condition for certifica tion. The training must be at least three hours in length and be consistent with stan- dards adopted by the Professional Educator StandardsBoard osteopathic phy-sicians, physician assistants, osteopathic physicianassistants, physical therapists, and physical therapy assis-tants is delayed until January 1, 2016. The delay does not affect the acceptability of tr aining completed between June 12, 2014, and January 1, 2016. Certified registerednurse anesthetists and medica l school graduates with lim- ited training licenses are exempt from the training require-ment. A disciplining authority may not grant a blanket ex- emption to broad categories or specialties within a profes- sion based on training and experience. By June 30, 2016, the Department of Health (DOH) must adopt rules establishing minimum standards fortraining programs on the mo del list. The minimum stan- dards must require that six-hour trainings include contentspecific to veterans and the assessment of issues related toimminent harm via lethal means or self-injurious behav-iors. When adopting th e rules, the DOH must: consult with the affected disciplining authorities, public and private institu tions of higher education, experts in suicide assessment , treatment, and manage- ment, the WDV A, and affect ed professional associa- tions; andHouse 94 3 Senate 44 5 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)HB 1431 66 consider standards related to the Best Practices Regis- try of the American Foundation for Suicide Preven- tion and the Suicide Prevention Resource Center. The DOH must provide the tr aining standards to the PESB and may provide technical assistance in the reviewand evaluation of education training programs. Beginning July 1, 2017, the model list must contain only trainings that meet th e minimum standards and any three-hour trainings that met the training requirements on or before July 26, 2015. The trainings on the list must in- clude six-hour trainings in suicide assessment, treatment,and management and three-hour trainings that includeonly screening and referral el ements. A person or entity providing the training may pe tition the DOH for inclusion on the model list; the DOH must add trainings to the listthat meet the minimum standards. Approved educatortraining programs may also be included on the model list. Beginning July 1, 2017, the health professions subject to the training requirement must complete trainings thatare on the model list. This does not affect the validity oftraining completed prior to July 1, 2017.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1431 C 150 L 15 Modifying exemptions relating to real estate appraisals. By Representatives Bergqu ist, Holy and S. Hunt. House Committee on State Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: The Public Records Act (PRA) requires state and local agencies to make their written recordsavailable to the public for inspection and copying upon re- quest, unless the information f its into one of the various specific exemptions. The stat ed policy of the PRA favors disclosure and requires narrow application of the listed ex-emptions. Real property appraisals regarding the acquisition of property made for or by an agency are exempt from disclo-sure. The exemption lasts until the prospective sale orproject is abandoned or all pr operty related to the appraisal has been sold or acquired. The exemption does not apply to appraisals regarding the ac quisition of property for the purpose of providin g relocation housing. Summary: Documents related to an agency's real estate transactions are exempt from disclosure if the documentsare prepared for determining a site or acquisition of prop- erty by lease or purchase when public knowledge of suchconsideration would likely caus e an increase in the prop-erty price. Documents prepar ed to consider the minimum selling price of property offered to be sold or leased is ex- empt when public knowledge would likely cause a de-crease in the price. These exemptions include recordsprepared for the executive session of an agency's govern-ing body.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESHB 1440 C 222 L 15 Prohibiting the use of a cell si te simulator device without a warrant. By House Committee on Public Safety (originally spon- sored by Representatives Tayl or, Goodman, Pollet, Scott, Condotta, Shea, G. Hunt, Young, Moscoso, Smith, Ryu,Jinkins, Magendanz, Farrell and McCaslin). House Committee on Public Safety Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: Generally, a cell site simulator is a device the can impersonate a wireless service provider's (i.e., cel-lular phone company's) ce ll tower, prompting mobile phones and other wireless devices to communicate withthe simulators instead of w ith the legitimate cell towers. Such devices are able to intercept conversations and cantrack cell phone signals inside vehicles, homes, and insu-lated buildings. A pen register is a device attached to a telephone line that records the phone number s dialed from that telephone line. A trap and trace device is a device attached to a tele- phone line that records the te lephone numbers of all calls coming into that telephone li ne. Federal and state law reg- ulate the installation and use of both of these devices. A pen register or trap and trace device may be in- stalled and used by law enfo rcement agencies pursuant to an authorizing court order or in certain emergency situa-tions. Court Authorization . A law enforcement officer may apply to the superior court for a court order authorizing theinstallation and use of a pen re gister or a trap and trace device. The court must author ize the installation and use of the device if the court find s: (1) that the information likely to be gained is relevant to an ongoing criminal in- vestigation; and (2) there is probable cause to believe that the device will lead to eviden ce of a crime, contraband, fruits of crime, items criminally possessed, weapons, orthings by means of which a crime has been committed orreasonably appears about to be committed. The court order must specify the identity of the person registered to the affected line, the identity of the subject of the criminal investigation, the number and physical loca-House 95 2 Senate 47 1 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)House 78 20 Senate 47 1ESHB 1440 67tion of the affected line, and a statement of the offense to which the information likely to be obtained relates. The court order is valid for a period not to exceed 60 days. A 60-day extension may be ordered based upon anew application and a court fi nding that there is probabil- ity that the informa tion sought is more likely to be ob- tained under the extension th an under the original order. No extension beyond the firs t extension may be granted unless: (1) there is a showing that there is a high probabil- ity that the informa tion sought is more likely to be ob- tained under a subsequent order; or (2) there areextraordinary circumstances shown, such as immediate danger of death or injury to an officer. The existence of thepen register or trap and trace device may not be disclosedby any person except by court order. If requested by the law enforcement officer and direct- ed by the court, providers of wire or electronic communi- cation services and other appropriate persons must providethe law enforcement officer auth orized to install a pen reg- ister or trap and trace device with all information, facili- ties, and technical assistance necessary to complete theinstallation. A person who provides assistance must bereasonably compensat ed for the person's services and is immune from civil or criminal liability for any informa- tion, facilities, or assistance provided in good faith reli- ance on a court order authorizing the installation. Emergency Situations . A pen register or trap and trace device may be installe d without prior court authori- zation if a law enforcement of ficer and a prosecuting attor- ney or deputy prosecuting atto rney jointly and reasonably determine that there is probab le cause to believe that: (a) an emergency exists involvin g immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury to any person; (b) the pen registeror trap and trace device needs to be installed before an au- thorizing court order can be obtained; and (c) grounds ex-ist upon which an authorizing court order could be entered.A court order approving the use of the pen register or trapand trace device in an emergency situation must be ob-tained within 48 hours after its installation. In the absence of an authorizing court order, the use of a pen register or trap and tr ace device must immediately terminate once the informatio n sought is obtained, when the application for the order is denied, or when 48 hours have elapsed since the installation, whichever is earlier. Ifa court order approving the installation is not obtained within 48 hours, any informa tion obtained from the instal- lation is not admissible as evidence in any legal proceed-ing. A law enforcement agency mu st file a monthly report with the Administrative Office of the Courts indicating the number of authorizations ma de by the agency without a court order, the date and tim e of each authorization, and whether a subsequent court au thorization was sought and granted. An officer who knowingly installs a pen registeror trap and trace device without court authorization andwho does not seek court auth orization within 48 hours is guilty of a gross misdemeanor. Privacy Act . The Privacy Act (Act) restricts the inter- ception or recording of private communications or conversations. As a general ru le, it is unlawful for any person to intercept or reco rd a private communication or conversation without first obta ining the consent of all per- sons participating in the communication or conversation. There are limited exceptions to this general rule that allow the communication or conversa tion to be intercepted and recorded when only one party consents. The Act allows acourt to order interceptions of communications without the consent of any party to th e communication only in cas- es involving danger to national security, human life, or im- minent arson or riot. Trap and trace devices are notconsidered private communications under the Act. Electronic communication means any transfer of signs, signals, writing, imag es, sounds, data, or intelli- gence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic, or photo-optical system, but does not include any wire or oral com-munication, any communicati on made through a tone-only paging device, or any communication from a tracking de-vice. The act does not regulate cell site simulators. Summary: The Act is expanded to regulate the use of cell site simulators. The regulations applicable to pen registers and trap and trace devices ar e also extended to regulate cell site simulators. No pers on may install or use a cell site simulator device without prio r court authorization except as specifically authorized un der the Act. A law enforce- ment officer must obtain a court order for the installationand use of a cell site simulator unless there is probablecause to believe an emergency exists. The court order must specify the following: the identity of who is sub scribed to the affected line; the identity of the subjec t of the criminal investiga- tion; the number and physical location of the affected line, the type of device, all cate gories of information to be collected from the targeted device, whether the cell site simulator device will incidentally collect infor- mation from any parties not specified in the court order, and any disruptions to access or use of a com- munications or Internet access network that may becreated; and a statement of the offe nse to which the information likely to be obtained relates. Law enforcement agencies authorized to use a cell site simulator device must: (1) take all steps necessary to limitthe collection of any informatio n or metadata to the target specified in the applicable co urt order; (2) take all steps necessary to permanently delete any information or meta- data collected from any party no t specified in the court or- der immediately following such collection, and not transmit or use such informa tion or metadata for any pur- pose; info rmation or metadata collectedSHB 1447 68from the target specified in th e court order within 30 days if there is no longer probab le cause to support the belief that such information or meta data is evidence of a crime. The state and its political su bdivisions, by means of a cell site simulator device, may not collect or use a person's electronic data or metadata without: (1) that person's in-formed consent; (2) a warrant, based upon probable cause,that describes with particularity the person, place, or thingto be searched or seized; or (3) acting in accordance witha legally recognized exceptio n to the warrant require- ments. A cell site simulator device is a device that transmits or receives radio waves for the purpose of conducting one or more of the following oper ations: (1) identifying, locat- ing, or tracking the movement s of a communications de- vice; (2) intercepting, obtaining, accessing, or forwardingthe communications, stored da ta, or metadata of a commu- nications device; (3) affectin g the hardware or software operations or functions of a communications device; (4) forcing transmissions from or connections to a communi- cations device; (5) denying a communications device ac-cess to other communications devices, communicationsprotocols, or services; or (6) spoofing or simulating a com- munications device, cell tower, cell site, or service. A cellsite simulator device includes, but is not limited to, an in-ternational mobile subscriber identity catcher or other in- vasive cell phone or telephone surveillance oreavesdropping device that mimics a cell phone tower andsends out signals to cause ce ll phones in the area to trans- mit their locations, identifying information, and communi- cations content, or as a passive interpretation device ordigital analyzer that does no t send signals to a communi- cations device under surveillan ce. A cell site simulator de- vice does not include devices used or installed by anelectric utility to measure elec trical usage, to provide ser- vices to customers, or to operate the electric grid. Electronic communication does not include any com- munication from a tracking devi ce, but solely to the extent the tracking device is owned by the applicable law en- forcement agency.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: May 11, 2015SHB 1447 C 44 L 15 Granting the director of the department of enterprise ser- vices the authority to fine contractors as a penalty for cer-tain behaviors. By House Committee on State Government (originally sponsored by Representatives Holy, S. Hunt and Apple- ton; by request of Department of Enterprise Services). House Committee on State Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: The Director (Director) of the Department of Enterprise Services (DES) has the authority to debar a contractor based on a finding of one or more of the follow-ing: conviction of a criminal offense as an incident to obtaining a public or private contract or subcontract, or in the performance of such contract; conviction under state or federal law for embezzle- ment, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruc- tion of records, receiving stolen property, or any otheroffense indicating a lack of business integrity or busi-ness honesty; conviction under state or federal antitrust laws arising out of the submission of bids or proposals; violation of contract provisions of a character regarded by the Director to justify debarment action, including deliberate failu re without good cause to perform the contract, a recent record of failure to per- form, or unsatisfactory performance with the terms of one or more contracts; violation of ethical standards; or any other serious or compelling cause to affect responsibility as a state contractor, including debar-ment by another governmental entity. A decision to debar must be issued by the Director in writing, must state the reasons for the action taken, and must inform the debarred contractor of his or her rights tojudicial or administrative review. Summary: Under the same procedures used to debar a contractor, the Director is auth orized to impose a fine on a contractor for cause as an a lternative to debarment. The DES must establish the fining process by rule.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015House 97 0 Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred) House 96 1 Senate 49 0ESHB 1449 69ESHB 1449 C 274 L 15 Concerning oil transportation safety. By House Committee on Envi ronment (originally spon- sored by Representatives Farrell, Carlyle, Fitzgibbon, Clibborn, Ryu,Goodman and Kilduff; by request of Governor Inslee). House Committee on Environment House Committee on FinanceSenate Committee on Energy , Environment & Telecom- munications Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The 2014 Supplemental Operating Budget included a proviso directing the Department of Ecology(ECY) to study program gaps and public safety risks asso- ciated with oil transport over water and by rail. The ECYwas directed to work with the Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC), the Emergency Management Divi-sion (EMD) of the State Military Department, and otherstakeholders in carrying out th e study. In December 2014 the ECY issued a draft stu dy featuring 43 recommended changes to federal, state, an d local oil-transportation poli- cies and programs; a final report was issued in March2015. Modes of Oil Transportation . Oil, including crude oil and refined petroleum products, is sometimes transportedby vessel, pipeline, or train between the point of ex-traction, processing facilities, and other destinations. The types of vessels used to transp ort oil include: oil tankers, tank barges towed by tugs, and articulated tug barges thatfeature a structural connection from the tug providing pro-pulsion for the barge. Oil tr ansported by rail is carried in individual tank cars; oil-carrying tank cars may comprisepart or all of the cargo of a train. Definition of Oil . For the purposes of state laws re- garding oil spill prevention, planning, and financial re- sponsibility, \"oil\" is defined as any kind or distillate of oil that is liquid at atmospheric temperature. Specific types of oil are explicitly included with in this definition. However, the definition does not explicitly list the following as types of oil: bitumen, which is a heav y oil that will not flow until heated or diluted; synthetic crude, which results from the processing of bitumen; and natural gas well condensate, which is a liquid hydro- carbon mixture recovered at natural gas well heads. Financial Assurance Requir ements for Facilities and Vessels . Facilities such as o il refineries and terminals must demonstrate the financia l ability to compensate thestate and local governments for damages arising from a worst-case spill. Likewise, barges and tank vessels that use state waters or ports must also document their finan-cial ability to pay for oil sp ill removal costs, natural-re- source damages, and rela ted expenses. Financial responsibility must be demons trated to the ECY in one of several ways, including provid ing evidence of insurance or surety bonding. Oil Spill Prevention Plans and Oil Spill Contingency Plans . The ECY administers an oil spill preparedness, pre- vention, and response program. State law directs oil refin-eries, terminals, pipelines, other facilities, and vessel operators involved in the bulk tr ansfer of oil to put in place oil spill contingency plans th at outline containment and re- mediation responses to potentia l oil spills. Contingency plans approved by the ECY must identify personnel, ma-terials, and equipment capable of promptly and properly removing oil with minimal environmental damage. Rail- road cars are not considered facilities for purposes of state spill contingency planning, bu t railroads do complete cer- tain oil spill response planning under federal law. Under federal and state spill planning statutes, the ECY alsomaintains geographic response plans to address potentialspills in specific state water bodies. Geographic response plans provide guidance to resp onders in the event of a spill, and are developed by the ECY in partnership withvarious state and federal agencies. In addition to, or as part of, state spill contingency plans, onshore fa cilities must submit oil spill prevention plans to the ECY . The ECY may only approve these plansif they incorporate measures providing for the best achiev- able protection of public health and the environment, which means that the plans mu st provide the highest level of protection through the best achievable technology andthe most protective staffing levels, training procedures,and operational methods. Best achievable protection isalso the standard established by the ECY rules that address operations of refineries, te rminals, and other facilities. Other Maritime Safety Prov isions: Oil Tanker Tug Escorts and the Emergency Response Towing Vessel . Tug escorts can be a tool to assist vessels in distress that havelost control of their power or steering. State law requires oil tankers of greater than 40,000 deadweight tons enteringPuget Sound to have one tug escort with a minimum horse-power equivalent to 5 percent of the deadweight tonnageof the vessel the tug is escort ing. The Board of Pilotage Commissioners (Pilotage Comm ission) has adopted rules regarding the scope of vessels subject to oil tanker tug es-cort requirements. Violation of oil tanker escort require-ments is a gross misdemeanor and may also trigger civilpenalties of up to $10,000 per day. Civil penalties may besought by a county prosecutor or the Washington AttorneyGeneral upon the request of the Pilotage Commission. Certain oil-bearing vessels operating in the Strait of Juan de Fuca must file with the ECY evidence of an emer- gency-response system that provides for the operation oftowing vessel capable of response to vessel oil spillESHB 1449 70threats. The emergency-respon se vessel must be stationed at Neah Bay on the Olympic Peninsula. Vessel operators are required to provide an advanced notice to the ECY that includ es time, location, and volume information prior to certain transfers of oil involving a vessel. The Puget Sound Partnership, with input from the ECY and other maritime stak eholders, has completed a vessel traffic risk assessment st udy of spill risks associated with the movement of vessels in Puget Sound under vari-ous scenarios. Emergency Response Planning . The federal Emer- gency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EP-CRA) requires the state to establish a State EmergencyResponse Commission (SERC) to supervise and coordi-nate the work of local emergency response planning com-mittees. The responsibilities of local committees includethe development and maintenance of emergency responseplans that identify the transportation routes of extremelyhazardous substances. Within the State Military Depart- ment, the Governor-appointed Emergency ManagementCouncil acts as the SERC. Barrel Tax and Uses of Oi l Spill Prevention Account and Oil Spill Response Accounts . Crude oil and petro- leum products that are transported by vessel on state wa-ters are subject to an oil spill administration tax(administration tax) and an oil spill response tax (response tax) at the time of the product's initial receipt by a marineterminal. A credit is allowed against taxes imposed on oil that is initially received in Washington, but subsequently exported from the state. The administration tax is 4 cents per 42-gallon barrel and is deposited in the Oil Spill Prevention Account (Pre- vention Account), while the response tax is 1 cent per bar-rel and is deposited in th e Oil Spill Response Account (Response Account). If the Office of Financial Manage-ment determines that there is in excess of $9 million in the Response Account, then the 1 cent response tax is no lon-ger levied until the Response Account balance falls below $8 million. The Response Account is used for the costs associated with the response to oil spill s into state waters that the ECY determines are likely to incur in excess of $50,000 in response costs. The Respon se Account is also for the emergency towing vessel stationed at Neah Bay. The Pre-vention Account is used for the administration and imple- mentation of several ECY Oil Spill Program activities. Utilities and Transportation Commission Regulation of Railroads . The UTC administers a railroad safety pro- gram. The activities of the program include: the approval of petitions to open, close, or reconfig- ure railroad crossings of public roads, except withincities of over 10,000 in population; and inspections of public road-railroad crossings to ensure state and federal standards are met.In addition, UTC inspectors operate under delegated authority from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)to support the FRA oversigh t of railroad compliance with the FRA safety regulations. The UTC inspectors are re-stricted from conducting inspections at crossings betweena private roadway and a railroad. The UTC inspectors arerestricted, without accompaniment by a FRA inspector,from accessing private property for hazardous materialtransport inspections. The UTC's railroad regulatory activities are funded by a fee on railroads set at 1.5 percent of a railroad's gross op-erating revenue from intrastate operations. Summary: Oil Definition . \"Oil\" is redefined for purpos- es of oil spill prevention, clea nup, and financial responsi- bility laws to mean any kind of oil that is liquid at 25 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphe re of pressure, including any distillate of that oil. This definition also explicitly covers the following types of oil: bitumen; synthetic crude; and natural gas well condensate. The definition of crude oil subject to the administra- tion tax and the response tax is also amended to explicitly include crude oil, bitumen, diluted bitumen, synthetic crude oil, and natural gas well condensate. Disclosure of Informatio n about Oil Transportation . Facilities that receive oil from railroad cars must provideadvanced notice to the ECY . The notice must include the route taken to the facility, the scheduled time, location,volume, gravity, and originatin g region of crude oil re- ceived. This advanced notice must be provided once perweek to the ECY for the receip ts scheduled for the follow- ing week. Pipelines must report to the ECY twice per year on the volume of crude oil they tran sported through the state and the originating state or province of the oil. Pipeline reports due July 31 must contain cr ude oil transport information from January 1 to June 30, while pipeline reports due Jan-uary 31 must contain oil transp ort data from July 1 to De- cember 31. The ECY may share this information with the EMD and with other government emergency response agencies. The ECY must also publish a quarterly report featuring in-formation from the railroad receipt notices, including place of origin, mode of transport, number of railroad carsdelivering oil, and the number and volume of spills during transport and delivery. Inform ation in the quarterly report must be aggregated on a statewide basis by route, by week,and by type of oil. Unaggregated individual notices of crude oil transfer submitted to the ECY that ar e financial, commercial, or proprietary in nature are ex empt from public disclosure under the Public Records Act. Financial Assurance Reports . Railroads that transport oil as bulk cargo must provid e information to the UTC re-ESHB 1449 71garding their ability to pay for a reasonable worst-case spill of oil, an amount that is to be calculated by multiply- ing the reasonable anticipated per-barrel cleanup costs by the reasonable worst case spill volume. This information is to be provided to the UTC as part of railroad's annual re-port, and the UTC may not u se this information to eco- nomically regulate or penalize a railroad. Oil Spill Plans . Railroads must su bmit oil spill contin- gency plans to the ECY in the same manner as terminals,refineries, and other covered facilities. However, state- owned railroads are not subject to this requirement andrailroads are not made subjec t to the oil spill prevention planning requirements placed on other facilities. The best achievable protection standard, which is cur- rently required in oil spill pr evention planning and in ves- sels' contingency plans, is also applied to equipmentincorporated into facilities' oil spill contingency plans. The ECY must periodically update the best achievableprotection standard for oil spill contingency plan equip- ment in a manner that mini mizes duplication and that is consistent with the updates to best achievable protection standards that apply to vessels. By December 31, 2015, the ECY must submit to the Legislature a review of geographic response plans thathave been completed under federal and state contingencyplanning requirements. In addition, in 2017, 2019, and 2021, the ECY must also submit a report to the Legislature on the state's progress towards completing geographic re-sponse plans. The ECY may hire independent contractorsto ensure completion of at l east half of needed statewide geographic response plans by December 1, 2017. Oil Spill Prevention and Response Taxes and Ac- counts . The administration tax and response tax on oil re- ceived by vessels are levied on oil received by facilities from rail tank cars. A one-tim e transfer of $2.25 million is made from the Response A ccount to the Prevention Ac- count by July 31, 2015. The Response Account may be used to respond to spills or threatened spills of oil that the ECY anticipates will cost in excess of $1,000. The Response Account may also be used to compensate emergency towing by any tug vessel, in addition to the costs of the emergency responsetowing vessel stationed at Neah Bay. Until June 30, 2019, the Prevention Account may be used for oil and hazardous material emergency responseplanning by local emergency response committees, whichthe Military Department may empl oy staff to support. The initial focus of planning must be on communities through which oil-bearing trains travel. Local committees must annually review their plans and submit them to the SERC every five years or whenever they are updated. The Military Department must report to the Governor and Legislature by March 1, 2018, on the progress oflocal emergency planning towards meeting EPCRA planning requirements. Before spending money in the Prevention Account, but without delaying respon se activities, the ECY must make reasonable efforts to obtain response cost fundingfrom responsible persons or other sources, including thefederal government. Oil-Bearing Vessel Maritime Safety Rules . The Pilot- age Commission may adopt ru les to require tug escorts and other safety measures in Grays Harbor that apply to oiltankers of greater than 40,000 deadweight tons, othertowed vessels capable of tran sporting over 10,000 gallons of bulk petroleum, and artic ulated tug-barges of all sizes. The Pilotage Commission's au thority to adopt tug escort and other maritime safety rules in Grays Harbor is contin- gent on a state agency or local government determining orissuing a final permit to site a facility in Grays Harbor that is required to hold a spill co ntingency plan, or approving or issuing a final permit to a facility to newly receive orprocess crude oil. Prior to rule-making for Grays Harbor, the Pilotage Commission must also collaborate with mar- itime professionals, the EC Y , and public agencies. The ECY must evaluate vessel traffic management and safety within and near th e mouth of the Columbia Riv- er. A draft evaluation and assessment of vessel trafficmanagement and safety, including tug escort require-ments, escort tug capabilities, and best achievable protec- tion, must be submitted to the Legislature by December15, 2017, with a final report to be completed by June 30,2018. Utilities and Transportation Commission Rail Safety Program . The UTC regulatory fee for railroads is in- creased from 1.5 to up to 2.5 percent of railroads' gross in-trastate operating revenues. Ho wever, regulatory fees for short-line railroads that do no t haul bulk crude oil remain at a rate of 1.5 percent of gross intrastate operating reve-nues. The UTC inspectors may enter private property to conduct hazardous materials inspections, investigations, and surveillance under the fe deral partnership that dele- gates inspection authority to state inspectors. The UTC must adopt safety standards for private road crossings of railroad tracks used to transport crude oil.These safety standards must include signage requirements and UTC inspection and crossing improvement prioritiza-tion criteria. The UTC may inspect private crossings andorder railroads to improve private crossings. Cities of over 10,000 people may elect to participate in the UTC public road-railroa d crossing safety inspection program. Cities of over 10, 000 people must provide a list of existing public crossings to the UTC within 30 days of July 1, 2015 and must also notify the UTC within 30 days of the opening, closing, or modification of a crossing. Other . The House Environm ent Committee and Sen- ate Energy, Environment and Technology CommitteeE2SHB 1450 72must hold one joint meeting before the start of the 2016 legislative session on oil sp ill prevention and response ac- tivities related to internatio nal crude oil transportation. The committees must invite representatives from certain governments and tribes affected by crude oil transporta-tion, and must provide an update on marine transport ofliquid bulk crude oil and associa ted risks, as well as coop- erative prevention and response activities. The ECY must provide grants to emergency respond- ers for oil and hazardous mate rials spill response and fire- fighting equipment. To determine grant allocations, theECY must consult with businesses and emergency re-sponders to evaluate local coordinating efforts and current resources and equipment. Grants must be prioritized in ar- eas with the greatest need fo r equipment, and to maximize the use of current equipment and resources. The completion of certain ac tivities under the bill are subject to appropriation, in cluding the oil-bearing vessel evaluations to be completed for the Columbia River, the ECY grants for hazardous mate rials and oil spill response resources to emergency responders, and the UTC's devel-opment of private rail crossing safety standards.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2015 E2SHB 1450 C 250 L 15 Concerning involuntary outpatient mental health treat- ment. By House Committee on Appropriations (originally spon- sored by Representatives Jink ins, Tharinger, Kagi and Stanford). House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Standards and Proced ures for Involuntary Mental Health Treatment . Under the Involuntary Treat- ment Act (ITA) a person may be committed by a court forinvoluntary mental health treatment if he or she, due to amental disorder, poses a likelihood of serious harm or isgravely disabled. \"Likelihood of serious harm\" means thata person poses a substantial risk of physical harm to self,others, or the property of others, as evidenced by certainbehavior, or that a person has threatened the physical safe-ty of another and has a history of one or more violent acts. \"Grave disability\" means that a person is in danger of se- rious physical harm due to a failure to provide for his orher own essential human needs, or that a person manifestsa severe deterioration in routine functioning, evidenced byrepeated and escalating loss of cognitive or volitional con- trol over his or her actions, and is not receiving the care es-sential for health or safety. The commitment cycle begins with an initial evalua- tion period of up to 72 hour s. Within the initial 72-hour evaluation period, the professional staff of the treatmentfacility providing the evalua tion may petition the court to have the person committed for further mental health treat- ment. Following a hearing, if the person is found to pose a likelihood of serious harm or be gravely disabled, thecourt may order the person to be involuntarily committed for up to 14 days of additio nal treatment. Upon subse- quent petitions and hearings, a court may order up to an additional 90 days of comm itment, followed by successive terms of up to 180 days of commitment. Less Restrictive Alternative Treatment . When enter- ing an order for up to 14, 90, or 180 days of treatment, ifthe court finds that the person poses a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled, but that treatment in a less re-strictive alternative (LRA) than detention is in the best in- terest of the person or others, the court must order anappropriate less restrictive co urse of treatment rather than inpatient treatment. The Depa rtment of Social and Health Services (DSHS) contracts with regional support networks(RSNs) to administer commun ity-based metal health ser- vices. Less restrictive altern ative treatment is for up to 90 days if ordered instead of a 14- or 90-day inpatient order,and is for up to 180 days if ordered instead of a 180-dayinpatient order. At the 1 80-day order stage, additional grounds exist under which a person may be committed for LRA treatment. These additio nal grounds do not require the petitioner to show that the person meets either the like- lihood of serious harm or grave disability standard andonly apply when the petition is for continued LRA treat- ment for someone currently committed under an LRA. The additional grounds for a petition for continued treat- ment under the LRA are that: the person has been involuntarily committed to deten- tion for mental health trea tment during the 36 months preceding the initial detentio n in the current commit- ment cycle, excluding a ny time spent in a mental health facility or in confinement as a result of a crim-inal conviction; the person is unlikely to voluntarily participate in out- patient treatment without an order for LRA treatment,in view of the person's treatment history or current behavior; and outpatient treatment that would be provided under an LRA order is necessary to prevent a relapse, decom- pensation, or deterioration that is likely to result in the person presenting a likelihood of serious harm orHouse 60 38 Senate House28 21 (Senate amended) (House refused to concur) Senate 46 0 (Senate amended)House 95 1 (House concurred)E2SHB 1450 73the person becoming gravely disabled within a rea- sonably short period of time. An LRA order may be modified or revoked if the per- son is failing to adhere to th e terms and conditions of his or her release, is substantially deteriorating or decompen- sating, or poses a likelihood of serious harm. Summary: Commitment Based on a Finding of \"In Need of Assisted Outpatient Mental Health Treatment .\". In ad- dition to likelihood of serious harm and grave disability, aperson may be committed for involuntary mental healthtreatment under the ITA if that person is \"in need of assist-ed outpatient mental health treatment\" (in need of AOT).Commitment for a 72-hour eval uation, if based solely on the person being in need of AOT, may only be for an out-patient evaluation. Simila rly, commitment for further treatment, if based solely on the person being in need of AOT, may only be for an LRA order, and may not be forinpatient treatment. A person is in need of AOT if the person, as a result of a mental disorder: has been involuntarily committed to detention for involuntary mental health treatment at least twiceduring the preceding 36 months, or, if currently com- mitted, the person has be en involuntarily committed to detention at least once during the 36 months pre-ceding the initial detention in the current commitment cycle; is unlikely to voluntarily participate in outpatient treatment without an LRA order, in view of treatment history or current behavior; is unlikely to survive saf ely in the community with- out supervision; is likely to benefit from LRA treatment; and requires outpatient trea tment that would be provided under an LRA order to prevent a relapse, decompen- sation, or deterioration that is likely to result in the person presenting a likelihood of serious harm or theperson becoming gravely disabled within a reason- ably short period of time. The 36-month calculation ex cludes any time spent in a mental health facility or in confinement as a result of acriminal conviction. An LRA order based on a person being in need of AOT must terminate early when , in the opinion of the pro- fessional person in charge of the LRA treatment provider: (1) the person is prepared to accept voluntary treatment; or(2) the outpatient treatment or dered is no longer necessary to prevent relapse, decompensa tion, or deterioration that is likely to result in the person presenting a likelihood of se- rious harm or the person becoming gravely disabled with-in a reasonably short period of time. Less Restrictive Alternative Treatment . Less restric- tive alternative treatment serv ices and surrounding orders are specified.Less Restrictive Altern ative Treatment Services . Less restrictive alternative treatment is a program of individu-alized treatment in a less restrictive setting that is admin-istered by a provider licensed or certified to provide orcoordinate the full scope of LRA services and who hasagreed to assume responsibility . Less restrictive alterna- tive treatment must include, at a minimum: assignment of a care coordinator; an intake evaluation with the LRA provider; a psychiatric evaluation; medication management; a schedule of regular contacts with the provider of LRA treatment services for the duration of the order; a transition plan addres sing access to continued ser- vices at the expiration of the order; and an individual crisis plan. Less restrictive alternative treatment may also in- clude: psychotherapy, nursing, substance abuse counsel-ing, residential treatment, and support for housing, benefits, education, and employment. A petition for an LRA commitment must set forth a proposed plan for LRA services . In entering an LRA or- der, the court must identify the services the person com-mitted to the LRA will rece ive. The court may order additional evaluation of the pers on if necessary to identify appropriate services. Regional support network contracts must require the RSN to provide specified services to persons ordered bythe court to LRA treatment who: (1) are enrolled in Med-icaid and meet RSN access to car e standards; or (2) are not enrolled in Medicaid and do not have other insurance topay for services, if the RSN has adequate available re- sources to provide the service s. Additionally, contracts must establish caseload guid elines for care coordinators and guidelines for response times during and immediately following periods of hospita lization or incarceration. Duration of LRA Orders . When entering an LRA or- der for a person eligible for up to 180 days of involuntary mental health treatment, a co urt may enter an order for up to one year of treatment, rath er than for up to 180 days, if the person's previous commitment term was for inpatienttreatment in a state hospital. Subsequent orders are for upto 180 days. Enforcement of LRA Orders and Early Release . Facil- ities and agencies overseeing treatment and designatedmental health professionals (DMHPs) are authorized totake responsive actions to enforce compliance with an LRA or conditional release orde r. Responsive actions may include, but are not limited to: counseling, advising, or admonishing the person as to their rights and responsib ilities under the order and offering compliance incentives; increasing the intensity of services through more fre- quent provider contacts, referral for assessment for assertive community services, or by other means;E2SHB 1471 74 requesting a court hearing for review and modifica- tion of the order; causing the person to be transported by a peace offi- cer, DMHP, or other means to the facility providingservices or to another facility for up to 12 hours to determine whether modifica tion, revocation, or com- mitment proceedings are appropriate. Detention isintended to occur only afte r a pattern of noncompli- ance or failure of reasonable attempts at engagement and is only permitted upon a clinical determination that temporary detentio n is appropriate; and initiating revocation proceedings. In deciding whether to initia te modification or revoca- tion of an LRA, a DMHP or overseeing facility or agency must consider relevant info rmation from credible witness- es, including family and others with significant contactand history of involvement w ith the person. Additionally, the court must consider the person's symptoms and behav- ior in light of all available evidence concerning the per- son's historical behavior. If inpatient treatment is soughtfor a person committed to an LRA based on a finding of in need of AOT, the inpatient tr eatment must be initiated un- der a new petition for in voluntary treatment. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 April 1, 2016 (Sections 2, 15, and 19) E2SHB 1471 C 251 L 15 Mitigating barriers to patient access to care resulting from health insurance contracting practices. By House Committee on Appropriations (originally spon- sored by Representatives Cody, Schmick, Kretz, Moeller, Jinkins and Tharing- er). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Health Care Background: Health carriers may enter into contracts with health care providers un der which the providers agree to accept a specified reimburs ement rate for their services. Health carriers may require prior authorization for certainhealth procedures. Prior au thorization is the requirement that a health care provider seek approval of a drug, proce-dure, or test before seeking reimbursement from a healthcarrier. A health carrier may not retrospectively deny cov-erage for care that had prior authorization unless the priorauthorization was based upon a material misrepresentationby the provider.A health carrier may not re quire a provider to extend the carrier's Medicaid rates, or some percentage above the carrier's Medicaid rates, to a commercial plan or line ofbusiness, unless the provider has expressly agreed in writ- ing to the extension. The re quirement that the provider ex- pressly agree to the extension does not prohibit the carrierfrom using its Medicaid rates, or some percentage aboveits Medicaid rates, as a b ase when negotiating payment rates with a provider. A health carrier must provide at least 60 days' notice to a health care provider of any proposed material amend-ments to the provider's contract. A material amendment isan amendment to a contract th at would result in requiring the provider to participate in a health plan, product, or line of business with a lower fee schedule in order to continueto participate in a health pl an, product, or line of business with a higher fee schedule. During the 60-day period, theprovider may reject the material amendment without af-fecting the terms of the exis ting contract. The material amendment must be clearly de fined in a notice to the pro- vider before the notice period begins. The notice must in-form the provider that he or she may choose to reject the terms of the material amendment through written or elec-tronic means at any time duri ng the notice period and that such rejection will not affect the terms of the existing con- tract. The health carrier's failu re to comply with the notice requirements voids the effectiveness of the materialamendment. Summary: A health carrier or a health plan offered to public employees may not require prior authorization foran evaluation and management visit or an initial treatmentvisit with a contracting provider in a new episode of chiro-practic, physical therapy, occu pational therapy, East Asian medicine, massage therapy, or speech and hearing thera- pies. This prohibition does no t affect the ability of a health plan to require a referral or prescription for these therapies.A \"new episode of care\" mean s treatment for a new or re- current condition for which the enrollee has not been treat- ed by the provider within the previous 90 days and is not currently undergoing any activ e treatment. A contracting provider does not include a provider employed within anintegrated delivery system. A health carrier or a health plan offered to public em- ployees may not require a provider to provide a discountfrom his or her usual and cust omary rates for non-covered services. The health carrier or health plan offered to public em- ployees must post on its webs ite (or the Health Care Au- thority's website for health plans offered to public employees), and disclose upon request, the prior authori- zation standards, criteria, a nd information used for medi- cal necessity decisions.

Generally, all vehicles that are operated on publichighways, including trailers, are subject to vehicle regis- tration, annual registration re newal, various taxes and fees due at registration and registration renewal, and licenseplate replacement when a trailer changes ownership. In addition to other taxes an d fees that are due annual- ly, a single-axle trailer that is used for private noncommer- cial use has an initial regist ration and annual renewal fee of $15. This fee is distributed as follows: 22.36 percent tothe State Patrol Highway A ccount; 1.375 percent to the Puget Sound tothe Partnership Account; and 59.495 percent to the Motor Ve-hicle Fund. In addition to other taxes and fees that are normally due annually, trailers that ar e over 2,000 pounds and travel trailers have an initial regist ration and renewal fee of $30. Of each initial or renewal vehi cle license fee: $20.35 must be deposited in the State Patrol Highway Account; $2.02of each initial vehicle license fee to the Puget Sound Ferry Operations Account; 93 cents of each renewal vehicle li-cense fee must be deposited in the Puget Sound Ferry Op- erations Account; and the re maining proceeds must be deposited to the Mo tor Vehicle Fund. The majority of the trailers pay a license plate technol- ogy fee of 25 cents and a license service fee of 50 cents atthe time of initial and renewal registrations. A boat trailer registration has a $3 aquatic weed fee, which is depositedin the Aquatic Weeds Account. A recreational trailer has a $3 recreational vehicle san itary-disposal fee, which is deposited into the Recreational Vehicle Account. According to the Department of Licensing (DOL), in fiscal year 2014 there were 547,870 private-use trailers,and 86,544 within that numb er were private-use trailers over 2,000 pounds that paid a $30 registration fee. A registered owner of a vehicle that is at least 30 years old may apply for a collector license plate. The collectorvehicle must be operated primarily as a collector vehiclethat is used in club activitie s, exhibitions, tours, parades, and occasional pleasure drivin g. Collector plates are valid for the life of the vehicle. Summary: The registered owner of a trailer that has a scale weight of 2,000 pounds or less and is used only for intermittent personal use ma y apply for a permanent li- cense tab and registration for a fee of $187.50. An \"inter-mittent-use trailer\" means a tr ailer in good working order that is used only for participa tion in club activities, exhibi- tions, tours, parades, and occasional pleasure use. \"Occa-sional pleasure use\" means use of a trailer that is notgenerally or daily, but seasonally or sporadically, and notmore than once a week on average. An intermittent-usetrailer cannot be held for rent to the public or used for com- mercial or business purposes. The applicant must purchase an initia l registration for the intermittent-use tr ailer and pay the special license plate fee of $187.50. An intermittent-use tra iler is exempt from registration renewals. The lic ense plate with the intermit- tent tab must be displayed on the rear of the trailer. In lieu of displaying a standard-issue license plate, the applicant may apply to display an actual Washington-is-sued license plate designated for general use in the year of the intermittent use trailer's manufacture. If the owner of the trailer sells, transfers, or conveys the trailer to another person or entity, the license plate with the intermittent tab must be removed prior to the transfer to the new owner and the new owner must obtain a newregistration and appropriate license plate. A person that is in violation of the intermittent-use trailer license tab statutes is subject to a traffic infraction of a maximum fine of $150 including all other assessmentsand fees. An intermittent-use license tab is not allowed to be on a personalized plate or be on a special license plate for per- sons with disabilities. Travel trailers that are at least 30 years old are eligible vehicles to use a collector vehicle license plate.House 82 16 Senate 47 2 (Senate amended)House 95 0 (House concurred)E2SHB 1485 76The $187.50 is distributed State Patrol Highway Accoun t; $2.02 of each initial fee to the Puget Sound Ferry Opera tions Account; and the re- mainder to the Motor Vehicle Fund. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2017 E2SHB 1485 C 252 L 15 Concerning family medicine residencies in health profes- sional shortage areas. By House Committee on Appropriations (originally sored by Representatives Haler, Cody, Schmick, Shea,Zeiger, Tarleton, Tharinger and Riccelli). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness House Committee on Appropriations Senate Committee on Health Care Background: The Family Medicine Residency Network . The Family Medicine Resi dency Network (FMRN) was established in 1975 to help train resident physicians infamily medicine. The FMRN provides financial supportto residents in programs aff iliated with the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine and establishes po-sitions for appropriate faculty to staff the programs. The Dean of the UW School of must implement the develop-ment and expansion of reside ncy programs in cooperation with the medical profession, hospitals, and clinics located throughout Washington. The Chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the UW School of Medicine determines where affiliated programs exist, giving co nsideration to communities in the state where the population, hospital facilities, numberof physicians, and interest in medical education indicate the potential success of the residency program. The amount of state funding for a residency program is limited to no more than 50 percent of the total cost of the program. No more than 25 percent of the state fundingmay be used for faculty and staff at the UW School ofMedicine associated with affiliated residency programs.No funds may be used to su bsidize the costs of patient care. The Family Practice Educ ation Advisory Board . In 1975 the Family Practice Education Advisory Board (FPEAB) was created to advise the UW School of Medi-cine in the implementation of the FMRN, including the se- lection of areas where affiliated residency programs willexist, the allocation of state funds, and procedures for re- view and evaluation of th e programs. The FPEAB con- sisted of the following eight members: the Dean of the UW School of Medicine (who served as chair); the Chair of the Department of Family Medicine; two public members appointed by the Governor; a member appointed by the Washington State Medi- cal Association; a member appointed by the Washington State Acad- emy of Family Physicians; a hospital administrato r appointed by the Governor; and a director representing the directors of community- based family practice residency programs, appointed by the Governor.The Dean of the UW School of Medicine and the Chair of the Department of Family Medicine were perma-nent members of the FPEAB. The remaining initial mem-bers of the FPEAB were appointed to staggered terms.Subsequent members served four-year terms and couldserve two consecutive terms. The FPEAB was eliminated in 2010, but continues to meet informally. The Health Professional Loan Repayment Program . The Health Professional Loan Repayment Program pro-vides conditional scholarships and loan repayment tohealth professionals working in shortage areas. To be eli- gible, a professional must commit to providing primarycare in a shortage area for at least two years. Collection of Demographi c Information from Physi- cians and Physician Assistants . The Medical Quality As- surance Commission (MQAC) must request physiciansand physician assistants to su bmit information about their current professional practice at the time of license renew-al. This information may in clude practice setting, medical specialty, board certification, or other relevant data deter- mined by the MQAC. Physicia ns and physician assistants are not required to submit the information as a condition of license renewal. Summary: The Legislature states its intent to increase the number of family medicine ph ysicians in shortage areas by providing a fiscal incentive for hospitals and clinics todevelop or expand residency programs. The Legislaturealso states its intent to en courage family medicine resi- dents to work in shortage ar eas by funding the Health Pro- fessional Loan Repayment and Scholarship Program. The medical schools administering the FMRN are ex- panded to include the Paci fic Northwest University of Health Sciences and any other medical school accreditedby the Liaison Committee of Medical Education or the Commission on Osteopathi c College Accreditation that locates its entire four-year medical program in Washing- ton. The schools of medicine must support the develop-ment of high-quality, accredited, affiliated residencyprograms and must prioritize support for health profes-sional shortage areas. The schools of medicine must alsocoordinate with the Office of Student Financial AssistanceHouse 97 0 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)2E2SHB 1491 77to notify prospective family medicine students and resi- dents of their eligibility for the Health Professional Loan Repayment Program. No more than 10 percent of the statefunding for the FMRN may be used for administrative or overhead costs. The FMRN, in collaboration with theschools of medicine, must ad minister the state funds ap- propriated for the program. Each family medicine residency program must annu- ally report the following info rmation to the Department of Health (DOH): the location of the residency program and whether the program, or any portion of the program, is located in a health professional shortage area; the number of residents in the program and the num- ber who attended an in-state versus an out-of-statemedical school; and the number of graduates of the residency program who work within health pr ofessional shortage areas. The DOH must aggregate the information received from the family medicine programs and report it to theLegislature every two years beginning November 1, 2016.The report must include information on how the geograph-ic distribution of residency programs changes over timeand, if the information is re adily available, a comparison of the number of residents in family medicine versus spe-cialty areas. The FPEAB is re-established and re-named the Fami- ly Medicine Education Advisory Board (FMEAB). TheFMEAB must consider and ma ke recommendations on the selection of areas where affilia ted residency programs will exist, the allocation of state funds, and procedures for re- view and evaluation of the programs. The FMEAB con-sists of the following members: one member of the House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the House; one member of the Senate appointed by the President of the Senate; one member appointed by each of the deans of the schools of medicine participating in the FMRN (whoserve as co-chairs); two citizen members, one from east of the Cascade Mountains and one from w est of the Cascade Moun- tains, appointed by the Governor; a member appointed by the Washington State Medi- cal Association; a member appointed by the Washington Osteopathic Medical Association; a member appointed by the Washington State Acad- emy of Family Physicians; a hospital administrator appointed by the Washington State Hospital Association; and a director representing the directors of community- based family practice residency programs, appointed by the FMRN.The persons appointed by the deans of the schools of medicine are permanent members of the FMEAB. The re-maining initial members of the FMEAB are appointed tostaggered terms. Subsequent members serve four-yearterms and may serve two consecutive terms. The Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery (BOMS) must request physicians and physician assistantsto submit information about their current professional practice at the time of license renewal. This information may include practice setting, medical specialty, board cer- tification, or other relevant data determined by the BOMS.Physicians and physician ass istants must submit requested demographic information to the MQAC. Osteopathic physicians and osteopathic physician assistants must sub-mit requested demographic information to the BOMS.

House Committee on Early Le arning & Human Services House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 EducationSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Early Achievers Program . In 2007 the quality rating and improvemen t system for the early care and education system in Wash ington was created, called Early Achievers. The Early Achievers program establish-es a common set of expectations and standards that define,measure, and improve the qua lity of early learning and child care settings. The Department of Early Learning(DEL) completed statewide implementation of the EarlyAchievers program in July 2013. There are five levels in the Early Achievers program. Licensed or certified child care programs enter the pro-gram at level 1. Participants advance to level 2 when they officially enroll in the Early Achievers program. At level 2, participants are required to complete several activities such as a self-assessment and trainings. For levels 3-5 par-ticipants are evaluated and earn points in the following ar- eas: child outcomes; fac ility curriculum and learning environment and interaction; professional development and training; and family engagement and partnership. Atlevels 3, 4, and 5, Early Achievers program participantsHouse 98 0 Senate 44 0 (Senate amended)House 95 0 (House concurred)2E2SHB 1491 78are evaluated and assigned a rating. The Early Achievers program provides participants with coaching, training op- portunities, professional development scholarships andgrants, technical assistance, and consultation. Working Connections Child Care . The Working Con- nections Child Care (WCCC) program offers subsidies to child care providers serving families at or below 200 per-cent of the federal poverty level. The state pays part of the cost of child care. The parent s or caregivers are responsi- ble for making a copayment to the child care provider.Both child care centers and family home providers are ableto receive WCCC subsidy paym ents. Children of families receiving the WCCC benefits ar e required to be less than 13 years of age or less than 19 years of age and have a ver-ified special need or be under court supervision. The DELsets child care subsidy po licy and provides the WCCC program oversight for child care licensing. The Depart-ment of Social and Health Services helps families applyfor WCCC, determines eligib ility and parent or caregiver copayments, authorizes child care, and issues payment toproviders. Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program . The Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program(ECEAP) is the Washington State Preschool Program. The ECEAP serves families at or below 110 percent of thefederal poverty level. Although the ECEAP prioritizeschildren who are 4 years old, children who are 3 years oldare also eligible for the prog ram. In add ition to preschool programming, the ECEAP pr ovides family support and health services. The stated goal of the ECEAP is to help ensure children enter kindergarten ready to succeed. Ap-proved ECEAPs receive state-funded support through theDEL. Public or private nonsectarian organizations, in-cluding but not limited to, schoo l districts, community and technical colleges, local gove rnments, and nonprofit orga- nizations, are eligible to pa rticipate as an ECEAP provid- er. In 2010, the funding program was implemented thatallows for phased in implem entation of the ECEAP, with full statewide implementation to be achieved in the 2018- 19 school year. In 2013 an outline for the expansion of the ECEAP through the 2013-15 biennium was enacted. The ECEAPexpansion is subject to amounts appropriated, and re-quired the DEL to develop an ECEAP expansion plan bySeptember 30, 2013. In add ition, the Washington State In- stitute for Public Policy (W SIPP) was required to com- plete a meta-analysis and retrospective outcomeevaluation of the ECEAP. The meta-analysis was provid-ed to the Legislature in January 2014 and the outcomeevaluation was provided to the Legislature in December 2014. The outcome evaluation found that the ECEAP hasa positive impact on third, fourth, and fifth grade testscores. Early Learning Advisory Council . In 2007 the Early Learning Advisory Council (ELAC) was created to advisethe DEL on statewide early learning needs and progress.In 2010 the ELAC delivered a statewide early learningplan. Following the completio n of the statewide early learning plan, the role of the ELAC was revised to advise the DEL on issues that would build a comprehensive sys-tem of quality early learning programs and services forWashington's children and fam ilies by assessing needs and the availability of services, a ligning resources, developing plans for data collection, developing plans for professionaldevelopment of early childhood educators, and establish-ing key performance measures. Summary: Early Achievers Program . The Early Achiev- ers program provides a foundatio n of quality for the early care and education system in Washington. The DEL is au- thorized to require all licensed or certified child care cen-ters and homes, and early learning programs serving non-school age children and receivin g state funds, to partici- pate in the Early Achievers program. However, the DELmust accept nationally accredited programs with standardsthat meet or exceed the Early Achievers program stan-dards as a qualification for Early Achievers program rat-ings. The stated objectives for the Early Achieversprogram include: improving short- and long-term educational outcomes for children; providing parents clear and accessible information on the quality of early learning programs; increasing school readiness; closing the disparities in access to quality care; providing professional development and coaching; and establishing a common set of expectations and stan- dards that define, measure , and improve the quality of early learning. There are five levels in the Early Achievers program. Participants are expected to actively engage and continu- ally advance in the program. By August 1, 2015, the DEL must publish on its website Early Achievers program rat-ing levels for child care progra ms that receive a state sub- sidy, the ECEAP, and Head St art programs in Washington. The rating levels must be published in a manner that is eas- ily accessible to parents and caregivers and takes into ac-count their linguistic needs. Tribal child care facilities and early learning programs may choose to be exempt fromposting their rating on the D EL website if they provide proper notification to parents and guardians on the avail-ability of their program rati ng. Additionally, the DEL is required to create a single source of information for par-ents and caregivers to access details on a provider's ratinglevel, licensing history, and other indicators of quality andsafety that will help parents and caregivers make informed choices. The DEL must create a professional development pathway for the Early Achiev ers program participants to obtain a high school diploma or higher education creden-tial in an academic field related to early care and educa-tion. The professional deve lopment pathway must include2E2SHB 1491 79opportunities for scholarships and to assist the Ear- ly Achievers program participan ts with the costs associat- ed with obtaining an educat ional degree. The DEL must also, in collaboration with tribal governments and commu- nity and statewide partners, implement protocols to maxi-mize and encourage participation in the Early Achieversprogram for culturally diverse and low-income providers. DEL Licensing Standards . By November 1, 2016, the DEL must implement a single set of health and safety li- censing standards for child care and preschool programs.The DEL must streamline a nd eliminate duplication be- tween the Early Achievers program standards and thenewly developed health and safety standards. Privateschools that operate early learning programs and do not re-ceive state subsidy payments must be subject only to thehealth and safety licensing standards. Additionally, the DEL must exempt before- and after-school programs thatserve only school-age childre n and operate in the same fa- cilities used by public or private schools from facility- based licensing standards. Early Achievers Program: Data Collection & Evalua- tion. The Education Data Cent er (EDC) must collect lon- gitudinal, student-level data on all children attending an ECEAP provider. Upon completion of an electronic atten-dance system, the EDC must al so collect longitudinal, stu- dent-level data on all children attending a WCCCprogram. The DEL, in coll aboration with the statewide child care resource and referral organization, and the EarlyAchievers Review Subcommittee (Subcommittee) mustdevelop an annual progress report regarding providers'progress in the Early Achievers program. Additionally,the WSIPP must conduct an analysis that examines rela-tionships between the Early Achievers program qualityrating levels and outcomes for participating children. The stated purpose of the data collection and evaluation is toimprove the educational outc omes for young learners in response to Early Achievers longitudinal data. A legislative Early Achievers Joint Select Committee (Committee) is created to re view the demand and avail- ability of child care providers, early learning programs,and family, friend, and neighbor caregivers by geographicregion. By December 1, 2018, the Committee must pro- vide recommendations on the sufficiency of funding forthe Early Achievers program, the need for targeted fund-ing for specific geographic re gions or major ethnic popu- lations, and whether to modify the deadlines for the Early Achievers program mandate. Working Connections Child Care . The DEL must es- tablish and implement policie s in the WCCC program that promote stability, quality, and co ntinuity of care for chil- dren from low-income households. Effective January 1,2016, unless an earlier date is provided in the budget, au- thorizations for the WCCC program must be effective fora 12-month enrollment period, and the child may not bedeemed ineligible due to a cha nge in circumstance. An ex- isting WCCC provider serving non-school age childrenmust enroll in the Early Achi evers program by August 1, 2016, complete level 2 activitie s by August 1, 2017, and rate at a level 3 or higher by December 31, 2019. EffectiveJuly 1, 2016, a new WCCC pr ovider serving non-school age children must enroll in the Early Achievers programwithin 30 days, complete level 2 activities within 12 months of enrollment, and rate at a level 3 or higher within 30 months of enrollment. If a WCCC provider fails to rate at a level 3 or higher by the required deadline, the providermust complete remedial activ ities with the DEL and rate at a level 3 or higher within six months. Additionally, theDEL must implement tiered reimbursement for the Early Achievers program participan ts in the WCCC program rating at a level 3 or higher. Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program . An existing ECEAP provider must enroll in the EarlyAchievers program by October 1, 2015, and rate at a level4 or higher by March 1, 2016. Effective October 1, 2015,a new ECEAP provider must enroll in the Early Achieversprogram within 30 days and rate at a level 4 or higher with-in 12 months of enrollment. If an ECEAP provider fails to rate at a level 4 or higher by the required deadline, the pro- vider must complete remedial activities with the DEL and rate at a level 4 or higher within six months. Beginning inthe 2015-16 school year, the DEL must prioritize ECEAP providers located in low-in come neighborhoods within high-need geographical areas. Additionally, the full state-wide implementation of the ECEAP must be achieved bythe 2020-21 school year. Early Learning Advisory Council . The ELAC must convene the Subcommittee to provide feedback and guid- ance on strategies to improve th e quality of instruction and environment for early learning and provide input and rec- ommendations on the implem entation and refinement of the Early Achievers program. The DEL must consult with the Subcommittee on all substantial polic y changes to the Early Achievers program. The Subcommittee must in-clude representatives from diverse cultural and linguisticbackgrounds and representatives who work in a variety ofearly learning settings.

By House Committee on Labor (originally sponsored by Representatives Sells, Gregerson and Ormsby; by requestof Department of Labor & Industries). House Committee on Labor House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: V ocational Rehabilitation . One of the pri- mary purposes of the Industrial Insurance Act is to enable injured workers to become em ployable at gainful employ- ment. The Department of Labor and Industries (Depart-ment) pays, or directs self-insurers to pay, the costs ofvocational rehabilitation servic es when these services are necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to be- come employable at gainful employment. In 2007 a pilot program was created for improving vo- cational rehabilitation. Some of the significant provisions of the pilot program include: establishing time frames for the Department to approve vocational rehabilita tion plans and establish- ing accountability requiremen ts for injured workers; increasing benefits for training and other costs, such as books, tuition, and tool s (originally starting at $12,000, the benefits are adjusted based on changes in tuition at the state community colleges, and is cur-rently $17,599); allowing a vocational reha bilitation plan to last up to two years; giving eligible workers an option to receive funds equal to six months of time-loss benefits to pursue self-directed training (called Option 2); placing vocational profes sionals at pilot WorkSource locations for job placement services. The pilot program also creat ed a vocational rehabilita- tion subcommittee to provide recommendations to the De- partment and the Legislature. The pilot program expireson June 30, 2016. Preferred Worker Program . The Preferred Worker Program (PWP) provides fina ncial incentives to employ- ers who hire workers that have been injured in previousemployment. The worker must first be certified by the De- partment as a \"preferred worker .\" An employer hiring a preferred worker does not pay Accident Fund or MedicalAid premiums on the preferre d worker for as long as the worker is a certified \"prefe rred worker\" (which may not be more than 36 months). If the worker is injured on the job during the worker's certification period, the employer isnot liable for the costs of the new claim and it will not af- fect the employer's experience rating. Stay at Work . While the PWP provides benefits for subsequent employers of injured workers, the Stay atWork program provides financ ial incentives for employers to keep an injured worker on the job with the same em- ployer. The Stay at Work program includes benefits, suchas: reimbursement to an the employer for 50 percent of the employee's base wages up to 66 days, not to exceed $10,000 per claim w ithin a 24-month period; funds for training, instru ction, or materials, such as books, up to $1,000 per claim; funds for tools, up to $2,500 per claim; and funds for clothing, up to $400 per claim. Summary: The vocational rehabilita tion pilot program is modified and made permanent. Workers choosing Option2 are provided an amount equal to nine months of tempo-rary total disability compensatio n, rather than six months. Up to 10 percent of the worker's Option 2 funds may beused for vocational counse ling and job placement ser- vices. The total amount allowed fo r an individual worker's vocational plan may not exceed $17,500, and the annualadjustment based on the average percentage change incommunity college tuition may not exceed 2 percent per year, with certain exceptions. To encourage the employment of workers who have suffered permanent disability financial benefits similar to those in the Preferred Worker Program and Stay at WorkProgram are available to employers, including the em-ployer of injury, who employ injured workers receivingvocational services. In ad dition, a one-time payment equal to 10 percent of the worker's wages or $10,000,whichever is less, is available if the employer providescontinuous employment to th e worker without a reduction in the worker's base wages for at least 12 months. The fi-nancial benefits are available at the sole discretion of theDepartment. The benefits are available to state fund employers and available to a self-insured em ployer only in cases where the worker was employed by a state fund employer at thetime of injury. Other changes are made to the vocational rehabilita- tion program. For example, the Department must partnerwith the private vocational rehabilitation community, as well as with WorkSource, in a program to refer workers tovocational professionals. In addition, consequences of aworker failing to abid e by an accountability agreement, in- clude suspending the worker's opportunity to demonstrate good cause for refusing to su bmit to an examination, eval- uation, treatment, or practice. A vocational rehabilitation ad visory committee is cre- ated. The Department must conduct a study to determinethe impact on return-to-work outcomes, long-term disabil-SHB 1503 81ity, and claim costs. The Department must report back to the appropriate committees of the Legislature by Decem-ber 1, 2018. The Department may adopt rules governing the eligi- bility for and admission of bene fits available under the vo- cational rehabilitation program.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1503 C 201 L 15 Concerning medical liens. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored Jinkins, Ryu, Tharinger, DeBolt, Harris, Cody, Ricce lli, Walsh, Sawyer and Mo- eller). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: Medical Liens . A lien is a form of security interest over real or personal property to secure the pay-ment of a debt. Liens can be voluntary, such as mortgages,or involuntary, such as tax liens or mechanics' liens. and liens for doctor, nurse, hospital, and ambulanceservices. Every physician, surgeon, nurse, and practitioner who renders service to a person who has received a traumaticinjury is entitled to a lien upon any claim, right of action,or money to which the inju red person may be entitled against any tortfeasor for the value of the services ren-dered. To be entitled to a me dical lien, a claimant must file a record with the county audito r either within 20 days after the date of injury or receipt of care or, if settlement has notbeen made to the injured pe rson, then at any time before settlement and payment. Collection Agencies . Collection agencies must be li- censed by the Department of Licensing. Collection agen- cies must maintain records of their accounts and are required to file a surety bond or a cash deposit to ensure that they will faithfully and truly perform their duties.Collection agencies are also prohibited from certain acts,including: aiding an unlicensed person in engaging in business as a collection agency; collecting or attempting to collect a claim by the use of any means contrary to the postal laws and regula- tions of the United States Postal Department; publishing or threatening to publish any list of debt- ors; and calling or sending a text message or other electronic communication to a cellular telephone or other wire- less device more than twice in any day when the licensee knows or reasonably should know that thenumber belongs to a cellula r telephone or other wire- less device. Any person who knowingly operates as, or knowingly aids and abets, a collectio n agency without a license is punishable by a fine not exceeding $500, by imprisonmentnot exceeding one year, or both, and must return moneyscollected to the owners of the accounts on which the mon-eys were paid. Violation of certain provisions, including prohibited acts, is also deemed an unfair act or practice or unfair method of competition in the conduct of trade orcommerce for the purpose of applying the Consumer Pro- tection Act. Summary: Any person who seeks a medical lien must: (1) in any attempt to enforce the lien, either enforce the lien on his or her own behalf or use a licensed collectionagency; and (2) disclose his or her use of medical liens aspart of his or her billing an d collection practices. A person seeking to enforce a medical lien, other than the person originally entitled to the lien, is added to the definition of \"collection agency.\" A claimant or his or her assignee must prepare and ex- ecute a release of all lien rights for which payment hasbeen made and deliver the re lease to the patient no more than 30 days after payment or settlement and acceptance of the amount due. If a court finds that the deliverance ofthe release is unjustifiably de layed, then it must order de- liverance of the release and award the costs of the actionand any damages.

By House Committee on Finance (originally sponsored by Representatives Pettigrew, Santos, Magendanz, Condotta,Fitzgibbon and Ormsby). House Committee on Finance Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Hotel-Motel Taxes . \"Hotel-Motel\" taxes are special sales taxes on lodg ing rentals. Some hotel-mo- tel taxes are credited against the state sales tax rather thanbeing added to rental charges paid by customers. Thesetaxes only apply when a lodgin g unit is used for a contin-House 98 0 Senate 46 0 House 97 1 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 98 0 (House concurred)SHB 1527 82uous period of less than one month (longer use is consid- ered a rental of real property, rather than a \"license\" to usethe property). Convention and Trade Center Tax . A local \"conven- tion center\" tax applies to lodging within King County. The convention center tax was first effective on April 1, 1982. The tax is imposed by a King County Public Facil-ities District (PFD). This special sales and use tax appliesonly to the sale of lodging in hotels, motels, and similar fa- cilities in King County with at least 60 units. The tax rateis 7 percent within the city of Seattle and 2.8 percentthroughout the remainder of Ki ng County. In addition, the PFD may impose a 2 percent lodging tax on facilities withat least 60 units in Seattle that is credited against the statesales tax rate. The convention center tax is in addition to the retail sales tax. Thus, the combined tax rate for hotels and mo- tels with 60 or more units within Seattle is presently 15.6 percent. Hostel . A hostel is a budget-oriented, shared-room ac- commodation that accepts indi vidual travelers or groups for short-term stays, and that provides common areas and communal facilities. However, many hostels also provide some private rooms. In genera l, hostels are small with less than 60 units, shared or individual, but hostels can be sim-ilar in size to hotels. Summary: Hostels that primarily sell lodging services on an individual bed, shared ro om basis are exempt from the convention and trade center tax. In addition, the KingCounty PFD is no longer auth orized to levy the state- shared hotel motel tax on sales of lodging at a hostel.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: August 1, 2015 SHB 1527 C 184 L 15 Requiring the Washington state department of agriculture to approve the comparable recertification standards of pri-vate entities for the purposes of waiving the recertification requirements under the Washin gton pesticide control act. By House Committee on Agricu lture & Natural Resources (originally sponsored by Representatives Dent, Blake,Buys and Van De Wege). House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Agriculture, Water & Rural Eco- nomic Development Background: The Washington Pesticide Control Act (Act) is administered by the Washington State Departmentof Agriculture (WSDA). The Act requires that pesticides distributed or transported wi thin the state be registeredwith the WSDA and the Act imposes various license re- quirements related to wo rking with pesticides. Types of Licenses Issued Pursuant to the Act . The fol- lowing licenses are av ailable under the Act: Pesticide dealer license : A license is required to act in the capacity of a pesticide dealer or advertise as or assume to act as a pesticide dealer. Pesticide dealers are people who distribute certain toxic pesticides. Pesticide dealer manager license : Any licensed pes- ticide dealer must be mana ged by a licensed pesticide dealer manager. A pesticide dealer manager is theowner or supervisor of a pesticide distribution outlet holding a pesticide dealer license. Qualifications include having knowledge of pesticide laws andrules, pesticide hazards, an d the safe distribution, use, application, and disposal of pesticides, as demon- strated by passing a written examination. Structural pest inspector license : Structural pest inspectors conduct wo od-destroying-organism inspections. Qualifications for a license include hav- ing knowledge of applicab le laws and regulations, structural pest identification and damage, and condi- tions conductive to the de velopment of wood destroy- ing organisms, as demonstrated by passing a writtenexamination. Pest control consultant license : Pest control consul- tants offer or provide technical advice or recommen-dations to users of certain toxic pesticides, except pesticides for home and garden use. Qualifications include having knowledge of pesticide laws and regu-lations, pesticide hazards, and the safe distribution, use, application, and disposal of pesticides, as demonstrated by passing a written examination. Public pest control consultant license : A license is required of any person who is employed by a govern- mental agency or unit to act as a pest control consul-tant. Renewal of Licenses . The WSDA may renew any li- cense issued pursuant to the Ac t subject to recertification requirements. Every five years licensees must demon-strate that they meet the rece rtification standards to qualify for continuing licensure. Licensees must earn 40 recerti-fication credits every five year s or retake the examination. Recertification credits are earned by attending WSDA-ap-proved courses. However, at the end of a licensee's five-year recertifi- cation period, the WSDA may waive the recertification re-quirements if the licensee demonstrates that the licensee ismeeting comparable recertific ation standards through an- other state or jurisdiction or a government agency plan thatthe federal Environmental Protection Agency has ap- proved. Summary: The Washington State Department of Agricul- ture (WSDA) must waive the recertification requirementHouse 97 0 1531 83at the end of a licensee's five-year recertification period if the licensee demonstrates that the licensee meets compa-rable recertification standards through a private entity thatthe WSDA has approved. The WSDA is required to con-fer with private entities offeri ng continuing education pro- grams that include pest management credit accreditationand accumulation to develop an effective and efficient sys-tem to coordinate pest management credit accounting. The pest management credit accounting system must be consistent with the goals an d other requirements of the WSDA's pesticide license re certification programs. If the WSDA and the private entities agree on the system's sub- stantive provisions, the WSDA must develop an imple-mentation strategy for privat e entities pursuing pesticide credit reciprocity. The WSDA must submit a report to theLegislature by December 31, 2015, on the collaborativeefforts, the system, and the WSDA's implementation strat-egy.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1531 C 152 L 15 Removing expiration dates for training and certification exemptions for certain long-term care workers. By Representatives Tharinge r, Harris, Jinkins, Cody, Caldier, Kagi, Wylie and Senn; by request of Departmentof Social and Health Services.

There are a variety of dual credit programs , including: Tech Prep; Ad- vanced Placement (AP); College in the High School(CHS); Running Start (RS); International Baccalaureate (IB); Cambridge Internationa l; and Running Start for the Trades. College in the High School . The CHS programs pro- vide college level courses in high schools for qualified stu-dents in grades 11 and 12. Each CHS program is definedin a local contract between a high school and an institution of higher education. Costs to students vary with each in- stitution. The teacher employed by the participating insti- tution of higher education determines the number of credits and whether the course satisfies general or degreerequirements when no comparab le course is offered at the institution of higher education. The school district super- intendent determines the numb er of credits for a course when no comparable course is offered by the school dis-trict. Participating school districts must provide general in- formation about CHS to students in grades 10 through 12,as well as to parents and guardians. Running Start . Running Start students enroll in cours- es or programs offered by participating institutions of higher education. Students take RS courses on the campusof the institution of higher ed ucation and online. Some in- stitutions and school districts al so offer RS courses in the high school. High school students do not pay tuition forRS classes but may be char ged fees. The institution of higher education must provid e fee waivers for low-income students, including those who qualify for free or reduced- price lunch. Academic Acceleration Incentive Program . The Aca- demic Acceleration Incentive Program (Program) was cre- ated in 2013. School district s are encouraged to adopt an Academic Acceleration Policy (P olicy), pursuant to which students who meet the state standard on the high school state assessment are automatically enrolled in the nextmost rigorous advanced course offered by the high school.Students who are successful in that course are then auto- matically enrolled in the next most rigorous course, withthe objective that these students will eventually be auto- matically enrolled in dual credit courses. Districts that adopt such Policy are eligib le for funding from the Pro- gram. Half of the appropriated Program funds are allocated on a competitive basis as one-ti me grants for high schools to expand the availability of dual credit courses. The other half of the appropriated funds are allocated as an incentiveaward to school districts fo r each student who earned dual credit in specified courses offe red by a high school in the previous year. The funds ma y be used to support teacher training, curriculum, exam fees, and other costs of dualcredit courses. Students enrolled in RS do not generate anincentive award. Guaranteed Education Tuition Credits . Washington's prepaid college tuition progr am, named the GuaranteedEducation Tuition program, is governed by federal Inter- nal Revenue Service rules and Washington law. Parentscontribute after-tax money, the money grows tax-free, and all withdrawals are tax-free when used for tuition, room and board, and other qualifie d higher education expenses. The state guarantees that the va lue of the account will keep pace with the cost of reside nt undergraduate tuition and state-mandated fees at the most expensive public universi- ty in Washington. Summary: College in the High School . College in the High School is explicitly defined as a dual credit programlocated on a high school campus or in a high school envi-ronment in which a high school student is able to earn bothhigh school and postsecondary credit by completing post- secondary level courses with a passing grade. College inthe High School programs may include both academic andcareer and technical education. Subject to appropriation, funding may be allocated at an amount per college credit. The maximum annual num- ber of allocated credits pe r participating eleventh or twelfth grade students may no t exceed 10 credits. Fund- ing is prioritized in the following order: High schools that offered a Running Start in the High School program in the 2014-15 school year. (This pri- ority is only for the 2015-16 school year.) Students whose residence, or the high school in which they are enrolled, is located 20 driving miles or more from the nearest eligib le institution of higher education offering a RS program. High schools eligible for small school funding enhancement. Subject to appropriation, an d only after the priorities above are funded, a subsidy may be provided per collegecredit for eleventh and twel fth grade students who have been deemed eligible for fr ee or reduced-price lunch and are enrolled in CHS. The maximum number of subsidizedcredits per participating st udent may not exceed five credits. Districts wishing to particip ate in the subsidy program must apply to the Office of the Superintendant of PublicInstruction (OSPI) by July 1 of each year and report the preliminary estimate of subsid y-eligible students and the total number of projected credit hours. The OSPI must no-tify a district by September 1 of each year if the district'sstudents will receive the subs idy. If more districts apply than funding is available, th e OSPI must prioritize appli- cations according to the O SPI-developed prioritization factors. One such factor must be the number of dual creditopportunities available for lo w-income students in the district. The following applies with respect to both allocations and subsidies: Districts must remit any allocations or subsidies received to the participat ing institution of higher education. Those students for whom the allocationsHB 1547 85and subsidies have been received are not required to pay for the credits. The minimum allocation and subsidy is $65 per quar- ter credit. The OSPI, the Student AchievementCouncil (SAC), the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC), and the public bacca- laureate institutions must review funding levels forthe program every four years, beginning in 2017, and recommend changes. If specific funding is appropriated in the operating budget for the per credit allocations and per credit subsidies, the maximum per credit fee charged to any enrolled student may not ex ceed the amount of the per credit allocation or subsidy. Students in tenth grade ar e made eligible for CHS. However, the allocations and subsidies are only applicable to students in the eleventh an d twelfth grades. Participat- ing school districts must provide general information about the CHS program to a ll students in grades nine through 12. The OSPI must adopt ru les for administration of CHS. These rules must be jo intly developed by the OSPI, the SBCTC, the SAC, and the public baccalaureate insti-tutions. The Association of Washington School Principals must be consulted. The rules must outline quality and el-igibility standards that are informed by nationally recog- nized standards or models, must encourage the maximumuse of the program, and may not narrow or limit enroll-ment options. Running Start . Courses and programs offered as RS must also be open for registration to matriculated studentsat the participating institution of higher education and may not be a course consisting solely of high school studentsoffered at a high school campus. Academic Acceleration Incentive Program . Incentive award funds may be used for textbook fees and for trans-portation for RS students to and from the institution of higher education. The provis ion that explicitly excepted RS students from generating an incentive award is elimi- nated. Guaranteed Education Tuition Credits . Guaranteed Education Tuition credits may be redeemed to pay for CHS or RS fees. Recommendations for Improving Dual Credit Pro- grams . By September 15, 2016, the SAC, in collaboration with the SBCTC, the OSPI, and the public baccalaureateinstitutions, must make reco to the Legisla- ture for streamlining and impr oving dual credit programs. Particular attention should be paid to increasing participa- tion of low-income students and students who are current- ly underrepresented in RS, AP, IB, and CambridgeInternational programs.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1547 C 45 L 15 Authorizing funding and expe nditures for the hosting of the annual conference of the national association of statetreasurers.

The tax is imposed on the gross receipts from all business activities conductedwithin the state. Revenues are deposited in the State Gen- eral Fund. There are several rate categories, and a busi-ness may be subject to more than one B&O tax rate,depending on the types of activities conducted. Amusement and Recreational Services . \"Amusement and recreational services\" are in cluded in the definition of retail sale for the B&O tax and retail sales tax purposes. There is no specific definition of \"amusement and recre-ational services.\" There is, however, a list of activities thatare classified as \"amusement and recreation services\" in-cluding golf, pool, billiards, sk ating, bowling, ski lifts and tows, and day trips for sightseeing purposes when provid-ed to consumers. Sales of these retail services are subjectto retail sales or use tax. Physical Fitness Services . \"Physical fitness services\" are also included in the defi nition of retail sale for B&O and retail sales tax purposes. The term \"physical fitnessservices\" is not defined in statute but is referred to as a per-sonal service. The Department of Revenue by rule has de-fined \"physical fitness service s\" to include all exercise classes, use of exercise equipm ent, and personal training, and does not include instruc tional lessons. Instructional lessons can be distinguished from exercise classes in thateducation is the primary focu s in the former and exercise is the primary focus in the latter. Sales of these retail ser-vices are subject to retail sales tax. Opportunity to Dance . The \"opportunity to dance\" is defined as an establishment that provides a designated physical space where customers are allowed to dance.Charges for the \"opportunity to dance\" are exempt from retail sales tax.

In instances where sales tax was not collected for the retailsale of specified amusement or recreational services, usetax is no longer due from the buyer. The term \"physical fitness services\" is removed from the definition of \"retail sale.\" Instead, \"retail sale\" in- cludes the operation \"athletic or fitness facility.\" An\"athletic or fitness facility\" is defined as an indoor or out- door facility, or portion of a facility, that is predominantlyused for physical fitness activities. \"Physical fitness activ-ities\" are activities that involve physical exertion for thepurpose of improving or maintaining the general fitness,strength, flexibility, conditioning , or health of the partici- pant. With certain exceptions, all charges for the use of anathletic or fitness facility are retail sales, including anycharges associated with servi ces or amenities.

By House Committee on Commerce & Gaming (originally sponsored by Representa tives Kilduff and Muri). House Committee on Commerce & Gaming Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: In 1934, after the rep eal of prohibition, the Washington State Liquor Act (Act) was enacted. The Actincludes provisions allowing incorporated cities, towns, and unincorporated areas of counties to hold an election onthe question of whether the sale of liquor should be permit-ted. The only statutory method to repeal such prohibitionis by another public vote at a general election. Areas that are annexed into a city follo wing the enactment of a liquor prohibition are not subject to the prohibition. In 1975 the citizens of the City of Fircrest (Fircrest) voted on a ballot measure asking them to decide whetherto prohibit the sale of liquor by the drink within the city. The prohibition was adopted, and all liquor sales by the drink were terminated 90 days later. Subsequent to the en- actment of the prohibition, Fircrest annexed new territoryinto the city. The annexed areas are not subject to the city'sprohibition. Summary: Territory annexed into a city after the passage of a liquor prohibition by that city through a public vote isnot subject to any post-ann exation liquor prohibition en- acted by that city pursuant to a subsequent election.

By House Committee on Education (originally sponsored by Representatives Gregory, Bergquist, S. Hunt, Reykdal,Kilduff, Ortiz-Self and Pollet; by request of Governor In- slee). House Committee on Education Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education Background: A conditional scholarship is a loan that is forgiven in whole or in part in exchange for service as acertificated teacher at a K-12 public school. The state for-gives one year of loan obligation for every two years a re-cipient teaches in a Washington K-12 public school.When a recipient fails to con tinue with the required course of study or teaching obligation, the recipient must repaythe remaining loan principal with interest. The Retooling to Teach Mathematics and Sciences Conditional Scholarship Program requires a K-12 teacher,or certificated elementary ed ucator who is not employed in a position requiring an elementary education certificate,to pursue an endorsement in math or science to be eligible for the program. The conditio nal scholarship amount: is determined by the Washin gton Student Achievement Council, may not exceed $3,000 per year, and is applied tothe cost of tuition, fees, an d educational expenses. The Professional Educator Standards Board (PESB) must givepreference to scholarship applicants who are eligible vet-erans or National Guard members. In 2015 the name of the Retooling to Teach Mathemat- ics and Sciences Conditional Scholarship Program was changed to the Educator Re tooling Conditional Scholar- ship Program. The qualifying endorsements were also ex- panded to any endorsement in a subject or geographicendorsement shortage area, as defined by the PESB. Summary: A K-12 teacher, or certificated elementary ed- ucator who is not employed in a position requiring an ele-mentary education certificate, may qualify for theEducator Retooling Conditio nal Scholarship Program if he or she is pursuing an endorsement in a subject or geo-graphic endorsement shortage area, as defined by thePESB, including but not limite d to, mathematics, science, special education, bilingual education, English language learner (ELL), computer science education, or environ-mental and sustainability education. In addition to the veterans and National Guard prefer- ence, in awarding conditional scholarships to support ad-ditional bilingual educatio n or ELL endorsements, the PESB must also give preference to teachers assigned toschools required under state or federal accountability mea- sures to implement a plan fo r improvement and to teachers assigned to schools whose en rollment of ELL students hasincreased an average of more than 5 percent per year over the previous three years.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 SHB 1575 C 280 L 15 Regulating retainage bonds on public contracts. By House Committee on Capita l Budget (originally spon- sored by Representatives Buys, Dunshee, DeBolt andStanford). House Committee on Capital Budget Senate Committee on Ways & MeansSenate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance Background: A surety bond is a promise to pay one party a certain amount if a second pa rty fails to meet some obli- gation, such as fulfilling the terms of a contract. Retainage bonds are a type of bond that protects the obligee after a construction project is complete. They guarantee that the principal contractor will carry out allnecessary work to correct structural or other defects dis-covered immediately after co mpletion of the contract, even if full payment has been made to the principal. Typ- ically retainage ranges from 2 to 5 percent of the contract amount. For public improvement contracts, a contractor may submit a retainage bond in a form acceptable to a public body and from a bonding company meeting the publicbody's standards. The pub lic body must accept such a bond, unless it can demonstrate good cause for not accept-ing it. The Office of the Insurance Commissioner oversees the regulation of surety insura nce. A surety bond must be approved and accepted by a court, public official, or publicbody if it is proper and guaran teed by an authorized surety insurer. Summary: For public improvement contracts, a contrac- tor may submit a retainage bond in a form acceptable to a public body and from an authorized surety insurer. Thepublic body must accept the bond if it is proper and guar-anteed by the surety insurer. The ability of the public body to refuse to accept the bond for good cause is eliminated. A public body may require up to an A-minus rating for re-tainage bonds.Votes on Final Passage: House 70 27 House 63 32 House 54 44 Senate 37 8 House 98 0SHB 1586 89Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1586 C 281 L 15 Transferring a railroad right-o f-way to the Port of Royal Slope. By House Committee on Transp ortation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Manweller, Dent, Orcutt andWylie). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Royal Slope railroad is a 26-mile rail line running from Royal City to Othello. The rail line was originally operated by the Ch icago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad until 1980, when the company aban- doned its operations in the P acific Northwest. Currently, the abandoned rail line is owned by the state and managedby the Department of Transportation (WSDOT). Summary: The WSDOT must transfer the Royal Slope railroad right-of-way, and any supplies purchased as partof a recent rehabilitation project, to the Port of RoyalSlope (Port). This transfer must be made at no cost to thePort. The Port must maintain the right-of-way and con-tract with an operator; however, if there is no operator on the line for any continuous fi ve-year period , the right-of- way and any materials, equipment, and remaining suppliesmust revert to the WSDOT. Additionally, if the propertyis to revert to the WSDOT, it must be in at least substan- tially the same condition as wh en the right-of-way was ini- tially transferred. Finally, any operator agreement for therail line must not limit the stat e's ability to enter into a fran- chise agreement on the line, and any such franchise agree-ment must allow any operator on the line to continue to operate.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: May 18, 2015 HB 1595 C 48 L 15 Changing the definition of la bor hours for the purposes of the apprenticeship utilization statute. By Representatives Senn, Clibborn, Walsh and Ormsby.Background: Generally, public works projects of certain agencies that are estimated to cost $1 million or more must require that at least 15 perc ent of the labor hours be per-formed by apprentices enroll ed in approved apprentice- ship training programs. \"Labor hours\" is defined as the total hours of workers receiving an hourly wage who are directly employed on the site of the public works project. Some awarding agencies have looked to federal law for guidance on interpreting the phrase \"on the site\" of the project. Under the Davis-Bacon Act (the federal law thatrequires prevailing wages be paid on federally funded public works projects) the term \"on the site\" of the workgenerally means the physical place where the building orwork called for in the contra ct will remain, and any other site where a significant portio n of the building or work is constructed, provided that su ch site is established specifi- cally for the performance of the contract or project. On the other hand, Washingt on's prevailing wage laws require that laborers upon the public works project must be paid prevailing wages. The prevailing wage laws havebeen interpreted to extend beyond work performed direct-ly on the site of the project. Summary: The definition of \"labor hours\" in the appren- ticeship utilization statutes is changed to mean the total hours of workers employed \"u pon\" (rather than \"on the site\" of) the project. Therefor e, the hours worked by ap- prentices, when calc ulating apprenticesh ip utilization re- quirements, are not limited to just hours worked on site.

House Committee on Judiciary House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Background: Commitment of Persons Found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity . A person is not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) if he or she, at the time of the act under-lying the charge, was unable to perceive the nature and quality of the act or was un able to tell right from wrong with respect to the particular act because of a mental dis- ease or defect. A person found NGRI must be committedto the custody of the Department of Social and Health Ser-vices (DSHS) if the fact find er determines that the person is a substantial danger to other persons or presents a sub-stantial likelihood of committin g criminal acts jeopardiz- ing public safety or security unless kept under furthercontrol by the court or other persons or institutions. Senate 49 0 House 97 1 Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)House 97 1 Senate 49 0HB 1601 90The maximum term of commitment following an NGRI acquittal is equal to the maximum possible sentence for any offense with which the person was charged. Per-sons committed as NGRI underg o a mental condition eval- uation at least once every six months, and may petition forconditional release or final release by making an applica-tion to the Secretary of the DSHS or by making a direct pe-tition to the court. Placement of Persons Committed as NGRI in Secure Facilities . If the DSHS determines in writing that a person committed to its custody as NGRI presents an unreason- able safety risk that, based on behavior, clinical history,and facility security is not ma nageable in a state hospital setting, the DSHS may place th e person in any secure fa- cility operated by the DSHS or the Department of Correc- tions (DOC). The person remains in the legal custody ofthe DSHS, and the person's placement must be reviewed atleast every three months. A person placed in a secure fa-cility is entitled to appropri ate mental health treatment governed by a formalized tr eatment plan and retains the right to an examination of hi s or her mental condition ev- ery six months and the right to petition for conditional orfinal release. The authority of the DSHS to place a person in a se- cure facility expires June 30, 2015. Summary: The expiration on the authority granted to the DSHS to place a person committed as NGRI in a secureDSHS or DOC facility when that person has been deter-mined to present an unreasonable safety risk is removed. Before the DSHS places a person who is committed as NGRI in a secure facility, the Secretary of the DSHS mustgive consideration to reasonab le alternatives that would be effective to manage the person's behavior and must in-clude written documentation of the decision and reasoning in the patient's medical file.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1601 C 138 L 15 Concerning venue of actions by or against counties. By Representative Rodne.House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: Venue for Actions By or Against Counties . \"Venue\" refers to the court in which a case may be heard.All actions against any county may be commenced in the superior court of that county or in the superior court of ei-ther of the two nearest judicial districts. All actions by any county must be commenced in the superior court of thecounty in which the defendant resides, or in either of the two judicial districts nearest to the county bringing the ac- tion. Contracts Against Public Policy . Contract terms are generally enforceable based on the theory of freedom of contract. However, a contract or its terms may be void andunenforceable if the contract violates certain principles ofcontract law. For example, a contract may be unenforce- able if there is no considera tion, if it is unconscionable, or if it contravenes public policy. Contract terms are unenforceable on grounds of public policy when the interest in their enforcement is clearly outweighed by a public polic y against the enforcement of the terms. In order to dete rmine whether a contract vio- lates public policy, courts ask if the contract has a tenden- cy to be against the public go od or to be injurious to the public. Examples of contracts, or their terms, that are declared by statute to be void as agai nst public policy in Washing- ton include, but are not limited to, contracts that require: a bidder on a public building or construction contract to obtain or procure any surety bonds or insurancespecified in connection with the contract; and a party to a construction contract to indemnify against liability caused by the sole negligence of the personrequesting indemnification. Summary: Any provision in a public works contract with any county that requires a civil action be commenced in the superior court of that county is void and unenforceableas against public policy. This does not apply to any provi-sions that require a dispute be submitted to arbitration.

House Committee on Labor Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: A worker who, in the course of employ- ment, is injured or suffers disability from an occupational disease is entitled to certain be nefits. To prove an occupa- tional disease, the worker must show that the disease arosenaturally and proximately out of employment. For firefighters who are me mbers of the Law Enforce- ment Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System(LEOFF) and certain private sector firefighters, there is aHouse 96 2 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 96 2 (House concurred)House 97 0 Senate 42 2SHB 1610 91presumption that certain medical conditions are occupa- tional diseases. Tho se medical conditions are: respiratory disease, certain heart problems, specified cancers, and cer-tain infectious diseases. With respect to heart problems,the problems must be experienced within 72 hours of ex-posure to smoke, fumes, or toxic substances, or experi- enced within 24 hours of strenuous physical exertion dueto firefighting activities. The presumption of occupational disease may be re- butted by a preponderance of evidence, including: use of tobacco products, physical f itness and weight, lifestyle, hereditary factors, and ex posure from other employment or non-employment activities. In addition, the presump- tion does not apply to a firefighter who develops a heart orlung condition and who is a re gular user of tobacco prod- ucts or who has a history of tobacco use. Summary: Beginning August 1, 2015, the Department of Labor and Industries (Depar tment) must convene a work group to discuss creating defi nitions, policies, and proce- dures for mandatory reporting of hazardous exposures suf-fered by firefighters in th e course of employment. The work group must include representatives of fire- fighters unions, fire departme nts, fire chiefs, self-insured employers, and state fund public employers. The Department must repo rt recommendations for legislation or rule-making to the appropriate committees of the Legislature by January 1, 2016.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1610 C 7 L 15 Changing jury service provisions. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives McCaslin , Riccelli, Rodne, Orwall, Holy, Stokesbary, G. Hunt, Taylor and Shea). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: Juries . A jury is a body of persons tempo- rarily selected from the qualif ied inhabitants of a particu- lar district and invested with the power to present or indicta person for a public offense or try a question of fact. Ju-rors are randomly selected from a jury source list made upof the list of registered voters, licensed drivers, and identi-card holders in each county. A person is qualified to be ajuror if he or she is a Unites State citizen over the age of18, is a resident of the county of service, is able to commu-nicate in English, and has not been convicted of a felony. Jury Service . The court sets the length and number of jury terms within a 12-month period, subject to statutoryparameters for jury terms and service. The \"jury term\" is the peri od of time during which summoned jurors must be ava ilable to report for jury ser- vice. The jury term may be one or more days, not to ex-ceed one month. The term of \"juror service\" is the periodof time a juror is required to be present at the court facility. The period of juror service may not extend beyond the juryterm, and may not exceed two weeks, except to completea trial to which the juror was assigned during the two-week period. The statutorily stated policy of the state is to maximize the availability of residents of the state for jury service,and to minimize the burden resulting from jury service on prospective jurors and their families and employers. Thejury term and jury service should be set at as brief an inter-val as is practical given the size of the jury source list forthe judicial district. The optimal jury term is two weeks orless. Optimal juror service is one day or one trial, which- ever is longer. Excusal from Jury Service . The court may excuse a person from jury service upon a showing of undue hard-ship, extreme inconvenience, public necessity, or any rea-son deemed sufficient by the court for a period of time the court deems necessary. A pr ospective juror excused from juror service for a particular time may be assigned to an-other jury term. When the jury source list has been fully summoned and additional juro rs are needed, jurors who have already served may be summoned again for service.A juror who has previously served may be excused if he orshe served at least two weeks of juror service within the preceding 12 months. Summary: The maximum jury term and maximum peri- od of jury service are shorte ned in counties with a jury source list of at least 70,000 na mes. The jury term is short- ened from one or more days, not exceeding one month toone or more days, not exceeding two weeks. The term ofjury service is shortened from up to two weeks to up to one week. In all counties, the optimal jury term is shortened to one week or less. A juror who is summoned for jury ser-vice after having already se rved within the previous 12 months qualifies for excusal if he or she has served at leastone week of juror service during that preceding 12 months.

By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Rodne, Goodman and Jinkins). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: The Judicial Informatio n System (JIS) is a statewide information system for courts in Washington.The JIS contains information regarding family law actions and other civil cases, criminal history, pending criminalcharges, and outstanding warrants. The JIS also includesinformation relating to prot ection, no-contact, and re- straining orders, including tho se issued in proceedings in- volving domestic violence, sexual assault, harassment, family law, and vulnerable ad ults. Information related to these orders includes the name s of the parties, the cause number, the criminal histories of the parties, and any other relevant information necessary to assist courts. The statu-torily stated purpose for having this information available in the JIS is to prevent the issuance of competing protec-tion orders and to provide cour ts with needed information for issuance of protection orders. Rules regarding ex parte communications prohibit judges from receiving or seek ing factual information from outside of the record of a pending case except in limited situations, including when au thorized by law to do so. Courts are required or permitte d to consult the JIS in cer- tain circumstances, for exampl e, when entering orders for permanent parenting plans or child custody and when en-tering certain protection orders. Summary: Prior to entering certai n types of orders, the court may consult the JIS or related databases, if available,to review criminal history or to determine whether otherproceedings involving the parti es are pending. Specifical- ly, the court may consult the JIS or another database when granting any of the following orders: a temporary or final order establishing a parenting plan, making a residential determination concerning achild, or restricting a party's contact with a child; an order regarding a vulnerable child or adult, or a person who is an alleged incapacitated person in a guardianship proceeding, regardless of the type of order; an order granting letters of guardianship or appoint- ing an administrator of an estate; an order granting relief under the statutory provisions regarding civil commitment, sexually violent preda-tors, and other matters related to mental illness; an order granting relief in a juvenile proceeding; or an order of protection or criminal no-contact order for sexual assault, stalking, antiharassment, or domestic violence, or a foreign protection order. In the event that the court do es consult the JIS or a re- lated database, the court must disclose to the parties the fact that the database was consu lted. In addition, the court must disclose any matters that the court relied upon in ren- dering a decision and file a copy of the document relied upon within the court file. The document must be filed as a confidential document with any confidential contact or location information redacted.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1619 C 185 L 15 Providing a business and occu pation tax exemption for en- vironmental handling charges.

Stewardship programcollection sites must be regist ered with the product stew- ardship organization and must be located in every city with a population greater than 10,000, with at least one lo- cation per county, regardless of a county's population. Environmental Handling Charges . An environmental handling charge (EHC) must be added to the price of mer-cury-containing lights sold to re tailers in or into the state. The handling charge must cover the stewardship pro-gram's operational and administ rative costs, plus a reserve. Producers must remit environmental handling charge revenue to their stewardship program, unless a distributoror retailer has voluntarily agr eed to directly remit the en- vironmental handling charge to the stewardship program on behalf of the producer. Retailers who voluntarily agree to remit the handling charge to the stewardship organiza-tion may retain a portion of the handling charge as com- pensation for the costs asso ciated with collecting and remitting the handling charge. The stewardship program, using funds from the envi- ronmental handling charge, must pay $5,000 per partici-pating producer to the ECY to cover administration and enforcement costs. Summary: A B&O tax exemption is provided for receipts attributable to an EHC. The tax exemption is exempt from the tax preference performance statement and ex piration date requirements. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1620 C 254 L 15 Increasing the surcharge to fu nd biotoxin testing and mon- itoring. By Representatives Tharinger, Walkin shaw, Cody, Pollet and Jink- ins; by request of Department of Health. House Committee on Appropriations Senate Committee on Natural Resources & ParksSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: In 2009 the Legislature created the Biotox- in Account (Account) administered by the Department ofHealth (DOH). Revenue fro m the following surcharges, originally authorized by the Legislature in 2003 and col-lected by the Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), are deposited in the Acco unt, which include a: $3 surcharge on resident and non-resident adult shell- fish and seaweed licenses; $2 surcharge on annual resident and non-resident adult combination licenses; $2 surcharge on annual resident and non-resident razor clam licenses; and $1 surcharge on the three-day razor clam license. Moneys from the Account are used to fund biotoxin testing and monitoring by the DOH of beaches used forrecreational shellfishing and to fund monitoring by the Olympic Region Harmful Algal Bloom Program at theUniversity of Washington. Moneys in the Account may bespent only after appropriation. In addition to the statutory surcharges on recreational shellfish licenses, the DOH collects a biotoxin testing feeon commercial shellfish licen ses. The fees on commercial shellfish licenses are set in rule, and may be increased bythe DOH through the rulemaking process. Fee revenue isdeposited in the General Fund-Private/Local and may bespent only after appropriation. Summary: The biotoxin testing and monitoring sur- charge on recreational shellfish licenses is increased by $1per license. The total biotoxin testing and monitoring sur-charge after the $1 increase would be a: $4 surcharge on resident and non-resident adult shell- fish and seaweed licenses; $3 surcharge on annual resident and non-resident combination licenses; $3 surcharge on annual resident and non-resident razor clam licenses; and $2 surcharge on the three-day razor clam license. Revenue generated by the su rcharges may not be used to pay for the DFW's administrative costs. The surcharge on recreational shellfish licenses may not be increased by more than $1, and may only be in-creased when the DOH increases the corresponding fees inrule on commercial shellfish licenses.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015House 79 18 Senate 48 0 House 92 5 Senate 38 10 (Senate amended)House 90 7 (House concurred)HB 1622 94HB 1622 C 203 L 15 Expanding the products consid ered to be potentially non- hazardous as they apply to cottage food operations. By Representatives Young, Blake, Caldier, Scott, Shea and Takko. House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Agriculture, Water & Rural Eco- nomic Development Background: The Washington State Department of Agri- culture (WSDA) is authorized to adopt rules that allow for cottage food operations. Pe rmitted cottage food opera- tions are exempt from the stat e's commercial food service regulations and from licensing by public health jurisdic- tions. A cottage food operation is defined as a person whoproduces, in the kitchen of their domestic residence, a foodthat is not pote ntially hazardous. Items that are expressly allowed to be sold by a cot- tage food operation, accordin g to the rules adopted by the WSDA, include: baked good products that are cooked in an oven, such as loaf breads, rolls, biscuits , muffins, cakes, scones, cookies, crackers, cereals, trail mixes, candies that are cooked in an oven, certain pies, and nut mixes; standardized jams, jellies, preserves, and fruit butters; recombined and packaged dry herbs, seasoning, and mixtures that are obtained from approved sources;and flavored vinegars. Potentially hazardous foods that are not allowed to be produced by a cottage food op erator are those that require temperature control and are capable of supporting the rap-id growth of pathogenic or toxigenic microorganisms. Examples of prohibited foods, as provided in the rules adopted by the WSDA, include: fresh or dried meat or meat products (including jerky); canned fruits, vegetables, vegetable butters, and sal- sas; fish or shellfish products; canned pickled products; raw seed sprouts; bakery goods that require any type of refrigeration; tempered or molded chocolate; milk and dairy products; cut fresh fruits or vegetables and products made from them; garlic in oil mixtures; juices made from fresh fruits or vegetables; ice or ice products; barbecue sauces, ketchups, or mustards; and focaccia-style breads with vegetables or cheeses.Summary: The statutory list of allowable food products that may be sold by a cottage food operation is expandedto include both baked cand ies and candies made on a stovetop. Cottage food products containing the active ingredient in cannabis are specifically prohibited. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1625 C 255 L 15 Concerning provision of drugs to ambulance or aid ser- vices. By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Represen tatives Schmick and Wylie). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health Care Background: Pharmacy Services . In hospitals that have pharmaceutical services, the di rector of pharmacy is re- sponsible for the distribution of drugs throughout the hos-pital. Hospital pharmacies must be licensed by thePharmacy Quality Assuran ce Commission (Commission). They provide pharmaceutical ser vices that include procur- ing, preparing, storing, distributing, and controlling alldrugs in the hospital; inspec ting nursing care units where medications are dispensed, administered, or stored; moni-toring drug therapy; providing drug information to pa-tients and providers; and surv eying and reporting adverse drug reactions. Regulations adopted by the Commission define \"wholesale distribution\" as the sale of prescription drugsto a person who is not a consumer or patient. Hospitalpharmacies are generally not engaged in wholesale drugdistribution activities; however, they may perform somesimilar functions that have been specifically exemptedfrom the term. These exemptions include certain intra-company transfers to affiliated entities and the sale of adrug for emergency medical reasons. The term \"emergen-cy medical reasons\" is not defined, but includes transfersof drugs between retail pharmacies to alleviate temporaryshortages. Emergency Medical Personnel . Emergency medical personnel may provide patient ca re that is included within training curricula, approved specialized training, and local medical program director protocols. The four categoriesof emergency medical service personnel in descending or-der of training are: paramedics, intermediate life supporttechnicians, emergency medical technicians, and first re-House 97 0 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 95 0 (House concurred)HB 1627 95sponders. Emergency medical service personnel may only provide services within the scope of care established in the curriculum of the person's leve l of certification or any spe- cialized training. In addition, the services must be includ- ed in the protocols of each county's medical programdirector. With the exception of the administration of epi- nephrine, an emergency medical technician may not ad-minister injections. Summary: Pharmacies operated by a hospital may pro- vide medications to ambulance and aid services for usesassociated with providing emergency medical services. The pharmacies may provide the medications if: the hospital is located in the same county or an adja- cent county to the ambulance or aid service's area of operation; the medical program director requests the medica- tions for the ambulance or aid service and the types ofmedications provided (1) correspond to the level of service provided by the ambulance or aid service and the training of its emergency medical personnel and(2) are identified by the medical program directorthrough patient care protocols; and the provision of the medications is not contingent upon arrangements to tran sport patients to the hospi- tal other than for reasons re lated to the medical needs of patients and patient care procedures. The Emergency Medical Services and Trauma Care Steering Committee (Steering Committee) must reviewthe appropriateness of allowi ng emergency medical tech- nicians to use hydrocortisone similarmedications for the treatment of adrenal insufficiency and glucagon emergency kits. The review must consider theadequacy of current training, the feasibility of supple-menting training, the costs an d likely utilization of stock- ing ambulances with the me dications, and options for localized solutions to speci fic community needs. The Steering Committee must report to the Governor and the appropriate committees of th e Legislature by December 15, 2016, with the results of its review and any recommen- dations.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015HB 1627 C 154 L 15 Expanding the existing prohib ition on unlawfully entering the land of another to hunt or to retrieve hunted wildlife under Title 77 RCW to include entering the land of another to collect wildlife parts. By Representative Schmick.House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Na tural Resources & Parks Background: It is a misdemeanor to hunt on, or retrieve hunted wildlife from, the premises of another if a personknowingly enters or remains un lawfully in or on the prem- ises of another for the purpose of hunting wildlife or re-trieving hunted wildlife. The following are defenses to aprosecution for unlawfully hun ting on or retrieving hunted wildlife from the premises of another: The premises were open to the public for hunting pur- poses, and the actor complie d with all lawful condi- tions imposed on access to or remaining on thepremises. The actor reasonably believed that the premises' owner\u2014or another person with authority to license access\u2014would have licensed the actor to enter orremain on the premises to hunt wildlife or retrieve hunted wildlife. The actor reasonably believed the premises were not privately owned. After reasonable attemp ts to contact the premises' owner, the actor retrieved hunted wildlife for the sole purpose of avoiding wasting fish or wildlife. This defense applies only to the retrieval of hunted wild- life, not to the act of hunting itself.If a person is found guilty of unlawfully hunting on or retrieving hunted wildlife from the premises of another,the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WD-FW) must revoke all of the person's hunting licenses andtags and order a suspension of the person's hunting privi-leges for two years. The WDFW must seize any wildlifeor wildlife parts that were un lawfully hunted or unlawfully retrieved from the premises of another. Summary: The existing prohibition on unlawfully hunt- ing on or retrieving hunted wildlife from the premises of another is expanded to includ e the act of knowingly enter- ing or remaining unlawfully in or on the premises of an-other for the purpose of collecting wildlife parts. A personcharged with unlawfully coll ecting wildlife parts from the premises of another may assert the same defenses as a per-son charged with unlawfully hunting wildlife on the prem- ises of another. However, the defense of avoiding wastingfish or wildlife is unavailable to a person charged with un-lawfully collecting wildlife pa rts from the premises of an- other.House 97 0 Senate 47 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)EHB 1633 96A person convicted of unlawfully collecting wildlife parts from the premises of another will not have any hunt-ing licenses or tags they may possess revoked or have theirhunting privileges suspended for two years.

By Representatives Zeiger, Jinkins, Young, Fey, Appleton, Hargrove, Sawyer, Walsh, Stanford, Johnson, Riccelli, Kochmar, Muri, Pollet, Kagi and Wylie. House Committee on Capital Budget Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Background: Housing Assistance Program . Established by the Legislature in 1987 an d administered by the Depart- ment of Commerce (Commerce), the Housing AssistanceProgram (HAP), commonly re ferred to as the Housing Trust Fund, provides loans and grants for construction, ac-quisition, and rehabilitation of low-income multi-family and single-family housing. Housing units supported by the HAP may only serve peop le with special housing needs and with incomes at 50 percent or below a local ar- ea's median family income. At least 30 percent of theHAP resources in a funding cycle must benefit projects inrural communities. Or ganizations eligible to receive fund- ing include: local governmen ts; local housing authorities; regional support networks; nonprofit community or neigh-borhood-based organizations; federally recognized Indian tribes; and regional or stat ewide nonprofit housing assis- tance organizations. Since 1989, the HAP has invested $976 million in 41,257 housing units statewid e for people with low in- comes, persons with special needs, farm workers, home-less individuals and families, seniors, and other target populations. Over the last six biennia, the HAP has been funded at ce must provide for state- wide geographic distribution. Commerce must give first priority to projects that use privately-owned housing pur-chased by a public housing au thority or nonprofit public development authority. A secon d priority must be given to projects that use publicly owned housing. Within thesepriorities, Commerce must give preference to projects based on some or all of the 13 criteria. Examples include: the degree of leveraging of other funds; the degree of commitment from programs focusing on special needs populations; local government contributions; projects that demonstrate a strong probability of serv- ing the original target group or income level for at least 25 years; demonstrated ability to implement the project; and project location and access to area employment cen- ters and public transportation. Local School Districts . There are 295 school districts in Washington. Each district administers the public school system in its jurisdiction and elects a board to direct poli-cies and operate the school program. Local school boardshave broad authority to manage and oversee the educationprograms in their districts. Housing Authorities . Housing authorities are public nonprofit corporations create d by cities and counties that provide affordable housing opportunities within a commu- nity. Housing authorities have broad powers, including:purchasing and disposing of property to create housing;leasing or renting property; operating housing projects;and administering low-income housing programs. Nonprofit Housing Providers . Nonprofit housing pro- viders are private not-for-profit organizations, includingcommunity development corpor ations, that provide af- fordable housing opportunities within a community. Non-profit housing providers may finance, build, or manageaffordable housing projects. Summary: Project applications involving collaborative partnerships between local school districts and either pub-lic housing authorities or nonp rofit housing providers that help children of low-income families succeed in schoolmust be given preference by Commerce. To receive thispreference, a local school district must provide communi-ty members an opportunity to offer input on the proposedproject.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 April 1, 2016 (Section 2)House 98 0 Senate 48 0 House 92 6 Senate 47 1SHB 1636 97SHB 1636 C 204 L 15 Requiring disability employmen t reporting by state agen- cies. By House Committee on State Government (originally sponsored by Representatives MacEwen and Griffey). House Committee on State Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: There are several state programs that ad- dress vocational rehabilitation for persons with disabili- ties. The Division of V ocational Rehabilitation (DVR) isan agency within the Department of Social and Health Ser-vices (DSHS) that provides a statewide program of ser-vices to disabled persons that support self-sufficiency, jobopportunities, and community integration. The Develop- mental Disabilities Administration (DDA) also within theDSHS, assists individuals w ith developmental disabilities and their families to obtain services and support based onindividual preference, capabilities, and needs. The Department of Services for the Blind (DSB) oper- ates the V ocational Rehab ilitation Program (Program) to provide services that help blind persons overcome barriersand develop skills necessary fo r employment and indepen- dence. The Program must ensure that the services provid-ed to eligible persons meet th e requirements of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In 2013 the Governor issued Executive Order 13-02, which established a goal that by 2017, 5 percent of thestate work force will be comprised of people living with adisability. The Executive Order also directed the Office ofFinancial Management (OFM ) to convene the Disability Employment Task Force to assist state agencies with re-cruiting and retaining disabled persons and engage the pri- vate sector to help incr ease opportunities for disabled persons in all employment sectors. Summary: State agencies with 100 or more employees must submit an annual report that includes the total num- ber of employees in the previous year and the number ofemployees classified as disabled. The report also must in- clude: the total number employees hired and separated in the past year, including the nu mber of employees hired from the DVR and from the DSB; the total number of planned hires for the current year; and opportunities for internships for DVR, DDA, and DSB client placements leading to entry-level posi- tions. Each agency must submit its report to the OFM human resource director, with copies sent to the DVR and theGovernor's Disability Employment Task Force, by Janu-ary 31 of each year.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1637 C 49 L 15 Authorizing law enforcement and prosecutorial officials of federally recognized Indian tribes access to prescriptionmonitoring data. By Representatives Stokesbary, Hurst, Gregory, Zeiger, Fey,Dent and Jinkins. House Committee on Community Development, Housing & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Health Care Background: In 2007 the Department of Health (DOH) was required to establish and maintain a PrescriptionMonitoring Program to mon itor the prescribing and dis- pensing of all Schedule II, III, IV , and V controlled sub- stances. Information submi tted for each prescription must include at least a patient identifier, the drug dispensed, thedate of dispensing, the quant ity dispensed, the prescriber, and the dispenser. With certain exceptions, prescriptioninformation submitted to th e DOH is confidential. The exceptions allow the DOH to provide data in the Prescription Monitoring Program to: persons authorized to prescribe or dispense controlled substances; an individual who requests the individual's own records; health professional licensi ng, certification, or regula- tory agencies; local, state, and federal law enforcement or prosecu- torial officials who are engaged in bona fide specificinvestigations involvin g a designated person; authorized practitioners of the Department of Social and Health Services and the Health Care Authorityregarding Medicaid recipients; the Director of the Department of Labor and Indus- tries regarding workers' compensation claimants; the Director of the Department of Corrections regard- ing committed offenders; entities under court order; and DOH personnel for the purposes of administering the program.

By Representatives Blake, Lytton and Tharinger.House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Senate Committee on Natu ral Resources & Parks Background: The crime of Unlawful Trafficking in Fish, Shellfish, or Wildlife in the second degree is a class C fel-ony. This crime applies if a person traffics in fish, shell- fish, or wildlife with a wholes ale value of less than $250 and the trafficked product is eith er in violation of a rule for unclassified species or the species is classified as a gamespecies, food fish, shellfish, game fish, or a protected spe- cies. Prior to 2001, the crime only applied to fish and wild- life. Legislation that year added shellfish to the scope of the crime. The legislation added the word \"shellfish\" to the phrase \"fish or wildlife\" to create the re-occurringphrase \"fish, shellfish, or wildlife.\" The addition of the word \"shellfish\" occurred eight times in the 2001 legislation. However, the phrase \"fish and wildlife\" occurs nine times in the underlying statute. This resulted in one instance in the statutory basis for the crime of Unlawful Trafficking in Fish, Shellfish, or Wild-life where \"shellfish\" is not in cluded in the phrase \"fish or wildlife.\" This appears in the element of the crime that de- scribes the species classificatio n that must apply for the crime to be prosecuted, and re sults in only \"fish or wild- life,\" but not \"shellfish,\" being a species type that qualifiesunder that element. Summary: The word \"shellfish\" is added to the phrase \"fish or wildlife\" for the purp oses of the scope of one ele- ment to the crime of Unlawful Trafficking in Fish, Shell-fish, or Wildlife in the second degree.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015HB 1652 C 256 L 15 Concerning medicaid manage d health care system pay- ments for health care services provided by nonparticipat- ing providers. By Representatives Cody and Ha rris; by request of Health Care Authority. House Committee on Health Care & Wellness House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Health CareSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Medicaid is a federal-state partnership with programs established in the federal Social Security Actand implemented at the state level with federal matching funds. Federal law provides a framework for coverage of children, pregnant women, parents, elderly and disabledadults, and other adults with varying income requirements. Managed care is a prepaid, comprehensive system of medical and health care deliv ery, including preventive, primary, specialty, and ancilla ry health services through a network of providers. Healthy Options (HO) is the HealthCare Authority's Medicaid ma naged care program for low- income people in Washington. Healthy Options offers el- igible clients a complete medical benefits package. Managed care systems serving HO clients must pay nonparticipating providers the lowest amounts the systems pay for the same services unde r the systems' contracts with similar providers in the state. Nonparticipating providers must accept those rates as pa yment in full, in addition to any deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments due from the patients. Enrollees are not liable to nonparticipating pro- viders for covered services, except for amounts due for any deductibles, coinsurances, or copayments. Managed care systems must maintain networks of ap- propriate providers sufficient to provide adequate access to all services covered under their contracts with the state,including hospital-based servic es. The Department of So- cial and Health Services an d the Health Care Authority must monitor and periodically report to the Legislature on the proportion of services provided by contracted provid-ers and nonparticipating providers for each of their man-aged care systems. Requirements for Medicaid managed health care pro- viders to maintain adequate provider networks and to pay nonparticipating providers the lowest amounts the systems pay for the same services with similar providers expire onJuly 1, 2016. Summary: The July 1, 2016, expiration of the require- ments for Medicaid managed health care providers tomaintain adequate provider networks and to pay nonpar-ticipating providers the lowe st amounts the systems pay for the same services with similar providers is moved toJuly 1, 2021.House 67 30 Senate 47 0 House 97 0 Senate 49 0ESHB 1671 99Managed health care systems must make good faith efforts to contract with no nparticipating providers before paying the lowest amount paid for the same services under contracts with similar providers in the state.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESHB 1671 C 205 L 15 Concerning access to opioid overdose medications. By House Committee on Health Care & (origi- nally sponsored by Robinson, Tharinger and Jinkins). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health Care Background: Opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and oxycodone, act on opioid receptors in the brain and ner-vous system, causing depressi on of the central nervous system and respiratory system. Naloxone is a legend drugthat is used to prevent opioid -related overdoses. It blocks opioid receptors and reverses the effects of the opioid.Naloxone may be sprayed into the nose or injected in mus- cle or intravenously. It is unlawful to possess, deliver, or dispense a legend drug except pursuant to a prescription issued by a healthcare professional with presc riptive authority who is li- censed in Washington. A pe rson acting in good faith, however, may receive a naloxone prescription, possessnaloxone, or administer naloxone to a person sufferingfrom an apparent opiate-related overdose. It is not unpro- fessional conduct under the Uniform Disciplinary Act fora practitioner or a person to administer, dispense, pre- scribe, purchase, acquire, pos sess, or use naloxone if the conduct results from a good faith effort to assist either: (1) a person experiencing, or likely to experience, an opiate-related overdose; or (2) a fam ily member, friend, or other person in a position to assi st a person experiencing, or likely to experience, an opiate-related overdose. Summary: A health care practitioner who is authorized to prescribe legend drugs may prescribe, dispense, distrib-ute, and deliver an opioid overdose medication: (1) direct-ly to a person at risk of experiencing an opioid-related overdose; or (2) by collabora tive drug therapy agreement, standing order, or protocol to a first responder, familymember, or other person in a position to assist a person at risk of experiencing an op ioid-related overdose. These prescriptions and protocol or ders are issued for a legiti- mate medical purpose in the usual course of professionalpractice. At the time of prescribing, dispensing, distribut-ing, or delivering the opioid overdose medication, the practitioner must inform the recipient that as soon as pos-sible after administration, the person at risk of experienc-ing an overdose should be tr ansported to a hospital or a first responder should be summoned. Any person or entity may lawfully possess, store, de- liver, distribute, or administer an opioid overdose medica-tion pursuant to a practitio ner's prescription pharmacist may dispense an opioid overdose medi- cation pursuant to such a prescription and may administer an opioid overdose medication to a person at risk of expe-riencing an overdose. At th e time of dispensing the med- ication, the pharmacist must provide written instructions on the proper response to an opioid-related overdose, in-cluding instructions for seek ing immediate medical atten- tion. The instructions to se ek immediate medical attention must be conspicuously displayed. The following individuals ar e not subject to civil or criminal liability or disciplinary action under the UniformDisciplinary Act (UDA) for their authorized actions relat-ed to opioid overdose medicatio ns or the outcomes of their authorized actions if they ac t in good faith and with rea- sonable care: practitioners who prescribe, dispense, dis-tribute, or deliver overdose medication; pharmacists who dispense an opioid overdose medication;and persons who possess, store, distribute, or administer an opioid overdose medication. The provision in the UDArelated to naloxone is repealed. \"Opioid overdose medication\" means any drug used to reverse an opioid overdose that binds to opioid receptorsand blocks or inhibits the effe cts of opioids acting on those receptors, excluding intentio nal administration via the in- travenous route. \"Opioid-related overdose\" means a con-dition, including extreme phy sical illness, decreased level of consciousness, respiratory depression, coma, or death,that results from consuming or using an opioid or another substance with which an opio id was combined, or that a lay person would reasonably be lieve to be an opioid-relat- ed overdose requiring medical assistance. \"First responder\" is defined to mean a career or volun- teer firefighter, law enforcem ent officer, paramedic, first responder, or emergency medical technician, as well asany entity that employs or supe rvises such an individual. order\" and \"protoco l\" mean written or electron- ically recorded instructions prepared by a prescriber for distribution and administration of a drug by designatedand trained staff or volunteers of an organization or entity,as well as other actions and in terventions to be used upon the occurrence of defined clin ical events to improve pa- tients' timely access to treatment.

By request of Department of Social andHealth Services. House Committee on Public Safety Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Background: Generally, youth under the age of 18 years old who are charged with a crime remain under the juris-diction of the juvenile court. However, a juvenile can bedeclined to adult court and char ged as an adult if: (a) the juvenile court, after a hearin g, declines jurisdiction over the case (called \"discretionary declines\"); or (b) the juve-nile court is statutorily requir ed to decline jurisdiction and transfer the case to adult crim inal court (called \"automatic declines\"). The juvenile court must au tomatically decline a juve- nile if the juvenile is 16 or 17 years old and is chargedwith: (a) a serious violent of fense; (b) a violent offense and the offender has certain criminal history consisting ofserious felonies; (c) Robbery in the first degree, Rape of a Child in the first degree, or Drive-by Shooting; (d) Bur- glary in the first degree and the juvenile offender has acriminal history of one or more prior felonies or misde-meanors; or (e) any violent offense and the offender is al-leged to have been armed with a firearm. Juvenile Confinement . Most respondents adjudicated in juvenile court receive local sanctions, which can in- clude up to 30 days of confinement in a juvenile detentioncenter. The Juvenile Reha bilitation Administration (JRA), a division of the Department of Social and Health Services(DSHS), provides detention and other services for juvenileoffenders who are not eligible for local sanctions. Con- finement at the JRA occurs when a term of confinement isgreater than 30 days and includes a minimum and maxi-mum term of confinement. Individuals who are declined from juvenile court ju- risdiction are placed under th e authority of the Department of Corrections (DOC). The DOC then makes an indepen- dent assessment to determine whether the needs and cor-rectional goals of the child could better be met byprograms and the housing environment provided by a ju-venile correctional institution. Youthful offenders under the jurisdiction of the DOC must be housed separatelyfrom adult offenders. Youthful Offender Program . Declined youth commit- ted to the custody of the DOC become part of the YouthfulOffender Program. The Youthful Offender Program isjointly operated by the JRA an d the DOC. Generally, de- clined youth less than 18 ye ars of age are housed at the JRA. If the youth is expected to complete the term of con- finement before age 21, that youth remains at the JRA. Ifthe youth is expected to serve a term of confinement be- yond the age of 21 years old, the case is reviewed when the youth is age 18 years old to determine if the youth is ableto serve the remaining time at the DOC. The JRA currently houses approximately 45 youthful offenders. Of the 45 youth, 35 are between the ages of 18 and 21, and 10 youth are between the ages of 16 and 18.Seventeen of the youths will complete their sentence be- fore the age of 21 years old. Summary: Any youth convicted as an adult must initially be placed in a DOC facility to determine the child's earned release date (the anticipated date he or she will complete confinement). Youth Turning 21 Years Old After Their Anticipated Release Date . If a youth is anticipated to complete his or her confinement before turning 21 years old, the DOCmust transfer the child to the custody of the DSHS until such time he or she completes his or her term of confine- ment. While in the custody of the DSHS, the child musthave the same treatment, housing options, transfer, and ac-cess to program resources as any other child committed di-rectly to that juvenile co rrectional facility. Treatment, placement, and program decisi ons must be at the discre- tion of the DSHS. The youth may only be transferred backto the custody of the DOC w ith the approval of the DSHS or in instances where a youth turns 21 years old and hastime remaining in his or her time of confinement. If a child's sentence incl udes a term of community custody, the DSHS may only release that child to commu- nity custody upon the DOC's approval of the child's re- lease plan. If the child is held past his or her release datepending approval, the DSHS must retain custody untilsuch time the child's plan is approved or the child com- pletes the ordered term of confinement. In any instance where the DSHS determines that re- taining custody of a child presents a safety risk, the childmay be returned to the custody of the DOC. Youth Turning 21 Years Old Before Their Anticipated Release Date . If an individual is anticipated to complete his or her confinement on or after turning 21 years old, theDOC must transfer the child to the custody of the DSHS, upon approval by the DSHS. Despite the transfer, the DOC will retain authority over the custody decisions andmust approve any leave from the facility. While residingin a JRA facility, the DSHS has authority over all routineand day-to-day operations for the child while in their cus- tody. When the child turns 21 years old, he or she must betransferred back to a DOC facility.

By House Committee on Envi ronment (originally spon- sored by Thar-inger, Moscoso, Riccelli and Santos). House Committee on Environment House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Washington Department of Transpor- tation (DOT) maintains standard specifications for road, bridge, and municipal constr uction. According to the DOT, the standard specificatio ns are, with some limited exceptions, incorporated into the written agreement be- tween the DOT and their contractors. These standardspecifications include the ma ximum allowable percent, by weight, of recycled materials in road and bridge aggregatematerials. The allowable per centages are based on the ma- terials being recycled, such as hot mix asphalt, concreterubble, and steel furnace slag, and the use of the material,such as crushed surfacing, gravel backfill, or ballast. De- pending on the material and its use, the maximum allow- able percentage of recycled material is either 0 percent, 20percent, or 100 percent. Summary: The DOT, together with cities, counties, and Washington-based construction industry associations (im- plementation partners) must develop and establish criteriaand objectives for the reuse and recycling of commonlydefined coarse and fine aggregate cement and concretemixtures (construction aggregate and recycled concretematerials). Beginning in 2016, all Washington roadway, street, highway, and transportation infrastructure projects under-taken by the DOT must use at least 25 percent construction aggregate and recycled concre te materials each year cu- mulatively across all projects if adequate amounts of ma-terials are available and are cost effective. Also beginning in 2016, any local government with 100,000 residents or more is required to solicit bids from contractors that propose to use recycled construction con-tent. Once solicited, the lo cal governments must compare the lowest responsible bid prop osing to use recycled mate- rials with the lowest responsible bid not proposing to userecycled materials and award the contract to the lowest re-sponsible bidder proposing to use the highest percentage of recycled material if it is at no additional cost. Localgovernments with less than 100,000 residents must reviewtheir capacity for recycling and reusing construction mate-rials, establish strategies for meeting that capacity, and be- gin implementing those strategies. Any local governmentwith less than 100,000 residents, or any local governmentwith jurisdiction over a public works transportation or in- frastructure project, regardless of size, must also adoptstandards as developed by the DOT for the use of recycledmaterials as shown in the DOT's standard specificationsfor road, bridge, and municipal construction. The DOT and its implementation partners must report to the Legislature annually on the progress being made to reach the established recycling goals. The annual reportsmust be issued from the years 2017 until 2020.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1720 C 50 L 15 Concerning healthy housing. By Representatives Robinson, Pe and Santos. House Committee on Community Development, Housing & Tribal Affairs Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Background: (Program) was established in 1987. The programis administered by the Department of Commerce (Com-merce) and seeks to achieve monetary and energy savings for low-income households and other energy consumersby directing public and private weatherization resourcesfrom sponsoring entities or other sources to low-income households. Fund sources in clude the Weatherization As- sistance Program (WAP) within the United States Depart- ment of Energy (DOE), the Bonneville PowerAdministration, and the Low -Income Home Energy Assis- tance Program within the Unite d States Health and Human Services Department. Comm erce also receives state funds, which are matched by utility companie s that sell gas and electric heat. Commerce defines \"low-income,\"but the amount may not exceed 80 percent of medianhousehold income, adjusted for household size, for thecounty in which the dwelling unit to be weatherized is lo-cated. Weatherization services provided under the Program include energy and resource conservation, energy efficien-cy improvements, repairs, indoor quality improvements,health and safety improvemen ts, and client education. Commerce solicits proposals fo r low-income weatheriza- tion programs from potential sponsors and allocates fund- ing. United States Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program/Weatheri zation Plus Health Initiative . The WAP was created in 1976 to assist low-income fami-lies who lacked resources to invest in energy efficiency. The WAP also plays a role in ensuring the health and safe-ty of low-income homes. The DOE-funded Weatheriza-tion Plus Health Initiative co nnects the WAP network with providers of healthy homes services. Healthy homes ser-vices include lead hazard co ntrol, remediation of asthma triggers (including moisture , mold, and pests), reduction in exposure to radon and other toxic chemicals, and pre-vention of injuries caused by old or dilapidated housing. United States Department of Housing and Urban De- velopment . In 1999 the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) created theHealthy Homes Initiative. Un der the Healthy Homes pro- gram, the HUD addresses multip le childhood diseases and injuries in the home and environmental health and safety concerns including mold, lead , allergens, asthma, carbon monoxide, home safety, pesticides, and radon throughgrants that focus on developing low-cost methods for haz-ard assessment, and educatin g residents and communities on how to mitigate hazards . The HUD specifies seven healthy home principles to keep a healthy home, includingkeeping homes, clean, safe, and contaminant free. Summary: Sponsors submitting proposals under the Pro- gram may propose to use grant awards and matching fundsto make healthy housing improvements to homes undergo-ing weatherization. Projects that improve the health and safety of residents are added to the types of projects thatreceive prioritized funding from the Program. Commerce must also develop policies that improve the health andsafety of residents in homes and buildings requiring im-provements. Healthy housing is defined as increasing the health and safety of a home by inte grating energy efficiency ac- tivities and indoor environm ental measures , consistent with the Weatherization Plus Health Initiative of the DOE and the healthy housing prin ciples adopted by the HUD.

Medicaid covers ambulance transportation in several different cases. Generally, service is covered when it ismedically necessary based on th e client's condition at the time of the trip, it is appropriate to the client's actual med-ical need, and it is to a destin ation that is a contracted Med- icaid provider or the appropriate trauma facility. Summary: The Department of Health and the Depart- ment of Social and Health Services must convene a work group. The work group must establish alternative facility guidelines for the development of protocols, procedures,and applicable training for am bulance services to transport patients in need of mental health or chemical dependencyservices. The guidelines must establish when transport toa mental health facility or chemical dependency treatmentprogram is required as indicated by the presence of a med-ical emergency, the severity of the patient's behavioralhealth needs, the training of emergency medical servicepersonnel, and the risk posed by the patient to himself or herself or to others. The work group must include mem- bers of the Emergency Medi cal Service and Trauma Care Steering Committee, mental health providers, ambulanceservices, firefighters, and chem ical dependency treatment programs. The guidelines mu st be completed by July 1, 2016, and be distributed to regional emergency medicalservices and trauma care councils for inclusion in their re-gional plans. Ambulance services are gi ven specific authority to transport patients to nonmedi cal facilities, such as mental health facilities and chemical dependency treatment pro- grams. Immunity from liabilit y that generally applies to emergency medical services pr oviders is extended to acts or omissions by those provid ers when transporting a pa- tient to a mental health faci lity or chemical dependency treatment program in accordan ce with regional alternative facility procedures.

By House Committee on Health Care & Wellness (origi- nally sponsored by Represen tatives Schmick, Cody and Short). House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health Care Background: Nursing Assistants . Nursing assistants as- sist in the delivery of nursi ng and nursing-related activities to patients in a health care fa cility under the direction and supervision of a registered nurse or a licensed practicalnurse. The Department of H ealth (DOH) registers nursing assistants and certifies tho se who complete required edu- cation and training as determined by the Nursing CareQuality Assurance Commissi on (Nursing Commission). \"Health care facility\" is defi ned as a nursing home, hospi- tal, hospice care facility, home health care agency, hospiceagency, or other entity for deliv ery of health care services as defined by the Nursing Commission. Licensed Service Providers . Under the Community Mental Health Services Act, a \"licensed service provider\"is: a licensed entity; an entity that has an agreement with the Department of Social and Health Services and that meets state minimum standard s as a result of accreditation by a recognized behavioral health accrediting body; or an allopathic or osteopathic physician, registered nurse, ad-vanced registered nurse practitioner, or psychologist. Summary: For purposes of the regulation of nursing as- sistants, the definition of \"h ealth care facility\" includes li- censed service providers under the Community MentalHealth Services Act, other than individual health care pro-viders. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1730 C 51 L 15 Concerning the handling of earnest money. By House Committee on Busi ness & Financial Services (originally sponsored by Representatives Kirby and Vick). House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance Background: Earnest Money . Many real estate transac- tions use an earnest money depos it provision. In these ar- rangements, one party (typica lly the purchaser) agrees in the purchase and sale agreement to deposit a sum of mon-ey with a third party. A party forfeits the deposit byHouse 95 2 Senate 47 0House 98 0 Senate 47 0SHB 1738 104breaching the contract, allowing the other party to keep the money. Courts treat these arrangements as a form of liq-uidated damages. Enforcement of an identif ied earnest money clause is guaranteed regardless of actual damages so long as theclause satisfies the following requirements: the agreementmust (1) designate payments as an earnest money depositand (2) provide that forfeiture of the deposit is the seller'sexclusive remedy if another party reneges on the agree-ment. Earnest money deposits in real estate transactions are typically held by an escrow ag ent, a real estate firm, or a title insurance agent. Interpleader Actions . An interpleader action is a law- suit in which the holder of a sum of money or other prop-erty deposits the money or property with the court andnames as defendants the parties who assert rival claims tothe money. The court then determines the ownership of the money or property, and the original holder is absolved of responsibility. In most lawsuits, includin g interpleader, the defen- dants to the suit must be pe rsonally served with a sum- mons and a copy of the complaint. There are a variety ofexceptions to the pers onal service requirement, such as for minors, self-insurance progra ms, and foreign or alien steamship companies. Summary: Procedures After a Demand on Earnest Mon- ey. The holder of an earnest money deposit is given spe- cific procedures to follow when it receives a writtendemand for all or part of the earnest money. The act ap-plies only to transactions invol ving residential real proper- ty, whether improved or unimproved. Within 15 days from the receipt of a written demand from a party to the transaction, the holder must either: (1) notify all other parties of th e demand; (2) release the ear- nest money to one or more of the parties; or (3) commencean interpleader action in superior court. If the holder opts to notify other parties, the holder's notice must be in writing, sent by both United States PostalService mail and electronic mail (e-mail) to the parties' last known addresses, and include a copy of the demand. Itmust also contain a statement that: the parties have 20 days from the mailing date of the holder's notice to provide notice of their own objec- tion to the release of the earnest money; and their failure to deliver a timely written objection within 20 days will result in a release of the earnest money to the party that ma de the original demand. The holder of earnest money may use e-mail and mail- ing address information provided by the parties and is not obligated to search for that in formation outside its own re- cords. If it does search outside its records, it is not liablefor failing to locate such information. If the holder receives an ob jection within 20 days, it must file an interpleader actio n in superior court within 60days of receiving the objection or an inconsistent demand. However, the holder may release the funds or delay filingthe interpleader action if it re ceives consistent instructions to do so from the parties after their initial objections. If the holder receives no objectio ns, it must deliver the earnest money to the demanding party wi thin 10 days after the 20- day period expires. The holder may also file an interplead- er action at any time, even if no conflicting demands were received. If the holder of the earnes t money follows the proce- dures for responding to a de mand for earnest money, it is not liable to any person for releasing the earnest money tothe demanding party, unless it releases the funds on the ini- tial demand without waiting for ob jections of filing an in- terpleader action. The procedures for responding to a demand for earnest money apply to all earnest money held by the holder on theact's effective date, even if it was received before that date. Interpleader Action: Form Summons and Complaint . A form summons and complain t are provided for inter- pleader actions filed by a ho lder. The court must award reasonable attorneys' fees an d court costs to the holder. Personal Service of Summons Not Required . If the holder files an interpleader action, the personal service re- quirement is satisfied if the holder sends the summons and complaint to each party by first-class mail at the party's usual mailing address or the ad dress designated in the pur- chase and sale agreement.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1738 C 9 L 15 E 2 Concerning marine, off-road recreational vehicle, and snowmobile fuel tax refunds based on actual fuel taxes paid. By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Condotta, Buysand Committee Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: Non-highway and off-road fuel tax refunds are calculated using a lower fu el tax rate than the actual motor vehicle fuel tax rate. As a result, some fuel taxespaid by non-highway and off-road vehicle (ORV) users areincorporated into the state's transportation budget and usedfor highway purposes by state agencies, cities, and coun-ties. In 1990 the fuel tax was increased to 23 cents per gal-lon, and refunds were limited to 18 cents per gallon for off- road and non-highway users. In 2003 when the fuel taxHouse 97 0 Senate 48 0SHB 1749 105was increased to 28 cents, the refund rate was increased by 1 cent per gallon per biennium, ending at 23 cents per gal-lon after July 1, 2011. The full 5-cents increase of the\"Nickel Package\" was dedicated to state projects, and oth-er highway purposes. In 2005 when the fuel tax was in- creased by 9.5 cents, the refund s remained at 23 cents, and the full 9.5 cents were used for state and local highway projects, and other highway purposes. Marine Fuel Tax Refunds . After taking into account past and anticipated claims for refunds, 23 cents per gallonis transferred monthly to the Recreation Resources Ac-count, for administration by the Recreation and Conserva- tion Funding Board, to bene fit watercraft recreation. Off-Road Vehicle Fuel Tax Refunds . One percent of the motor vehicle fuel tax revenues, which are paid byORV users, which is equivalent to 23 cents per gallon ofORV fuel tax, is divided between two accounts: the ORV and Non-Highway Vehicle Account\u201441.5 percent, for the develo pment and maintenance of non-highway roads and recreation facilities, adminis- tered by the Department of Natural Resources, theWashington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and theState Parks and Recreation Commission; and the NOV A Program Account\u201458.5 percent, for the development and management of ORV , non-motor-ized, and non-highway road recreation facilities, administered by the Recreation and Conservation Office's Recreation and Conservation Funding Board. Very few non-highway refunds are actually made. Most off-road fuel tax refunds are transferred to the dedi- cated accounts listed above. Snowmobile Fuel Tax Refunds . The Department of Licensing determines the fuel tax paid on snowmobile fu- el. The snowmobile fuel tax refund amount is determined by multiplying the number of registered snowmobiles by 135 gallons as the average yearly amount of fuel used anda fuel tax rate of 23 cents per gallon. This amount is trans- ferred to the Snowmobile Account administered by theState Parks and Recreation Commission. The funds areused for snowmobile recreational areas. No individual re-funds are made. Summary: The fuel tax rate for marine, ORV , and snow- mobile fuel tax refunds and tr ansfers is maintained at 23 cents per gallon through June 30, 2031. The fuel tax ratefor marine, ORV , and snowmo bile fuel tax refunds and transfers is changed beginning on July 1, 2031, and there-after. The refunds and transfers will be based on the state'sfuel rate in existence at the time of the fuel purchase.Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Effective: September 26, 2015SHB 1749 C 52 L 15 Concerning contractor registration requirements for own- ers of property. By House Committee on Labo r (originally sponsored by Representatives MacEwen, Manweller and Condotta). House Committee on Labor Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: The Contractor Regist ration Act requires general and specialty contractor s to register with the De- partment of Labor and Industries (Department). Appli-cants must obtain a bond and insurance to register. \"Contractor\" is defined as including any entity who, in the pursuit of an independent business, undertakes to orsubmits a bid to construct, improve, develop or take spec-ified other actions with respec t to a building, development, or other structure listed in statute. Specifically included inthe definition is an owner who of fers to sell property with- out occupying or using the structure, project, develop-ment, or improvement for more than one year after it was substantially comple ted or abandoned. The exemptions from regist ration include an owner who contracts with a registered contractor. However, thisexemption does not apply to a person who performs the ac- tivities of a contractor for the purpose of leasing or selling improved property he or sh e has owned for less than 12 months. Summary: The provision making an owner a \"contrac- tor\" if he or she offers to sell improved property without occupying or using it for more than one year is modified. A person is not a contractor under this provision if the per-son contracts with a registered general contractor and doesnot superintend the work.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 House 98 0 House 89 0 Senate 43 0House 98 0 Senate 46 0HB 1779 106HB 1779 C 159 L 15 Requiring specialized training for persons conducting vic- tim interviews as part of the disciplinary process for ahealth professional alleged to have committed sexual mis-conduct. By Representatives Van De Wege, Johnson, Harris, Jink- ins and Tharinger. House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health Care Background: Credentialed health ca re providers are sub- ject to professional discipline under the Uniform Disci-plinary Act (UDA). Under the UDA, the discipliningauthority may take action against a provider for a varietyof reasons, including unprofessional conduct, unlicensedpractice, and the mental or physical inability to practice skillfully or safely. The Secretary of Health is the disci-plining authority for many pr oviders, and various boards and commissions are the discip lining authorities for the re- mainder. The UDA allows (and in some cases requires) individ- uals and organizations to file reports or complaints about health care providers. Once a disciplining authority re- ceives a complaint, it makes a threshold determination as to whether the conduct in th e complaint constitutes a vio- lation of the law and whether the disciplining authority has the legal authority to take ac tion. If a complaint does not meet this threshold, it is cl osed. If it does, the disciplining authority conducts an investig ation. After the investiga- tion, if the evidence supports the complaint, the disciplin- ing authority may institute disciplinary proceedingsagainst the provider. Disciplinary proceedings may be re-solved in a variety of ways , including a formal hearing (pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act) or a stip-ulated agreement. If the alleged unprofessional conduct involves only sexual misconduct, the Secretary of Health serves as thesole disciplining authority. A board or commission that re- ceives such a complaint must forward the matter to the Secretary of Health. Summary: Beginning July 1, 2016, for all complaints al- leging sexual misconduct, all vi ctim interviews conducted as part of an investigation must be conducted by a personwho has successfully completed a training program on in-terviewing victims of sexual misconduct in a manner that minimizes the negative impacts on victims. The trainingmay be provided by the disci plining authority, the Depart- ment of Health, or an outside entity. When determiningthe type of training that is appropriate, the disciplining au-thority must consult with a statewide organization thatprovides information, training , and expertise to persons and entities who support victim s, family and friends, the general public, and other persons whose lives have beenaffected by sexual assault.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1806 C 53 L 15 Correcting references to elections statutes.

By House Committee on Approp riations (originally spon- sored by Representatives Condotta and Hurst). House Committee on Commerce & Gaming House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Commerce & Labor Background: Spirits Retail Licensees . Businesses li- censed by the Liquor Control Board (LCB) to sell spiritsat the retail level are designat ed as \"spirits retail licens- ees.\" Such licensees generally fall into two categories: (1) grocery stores and other larg e retail establishments en- compassing at least 10,000 feet of retail space; and (2)smaller liquor stores that are either former state-owned li-quor stores or former \"contract liquor stores\" that sold li-quor on behalf of the state pursuant to contracts with theLCB prior to the passage of Initiative Measure No. 1183 in2011. License Issuance Fee . All spirits retail licensees must pay an annual license issuance fee to the LCB. Large spir-its retail licensees, with retail space exceeding 10,000square feet, must pay a license issuance fee equivalent toHouse 92 5 Senate 46 2 House 96 1 Senate 47 0SHB 1813 10717 percent of all spirit sales revenues. Beginning on June 30, 2013, former state liquor stores and former contract li-quor stores were granted a limited exemption from the payment of the 17 percent lic ense issuance fee for speci- fied types of spirits sales. Sp ecifically, such stores are ex- empt from payment of the 17 percent fee with respect to spirits sales to those retailer s licensed to sell spirits for consumption on the premises (i .e., bars and restaurants). Spirits Delivery Locations . A spirits retail licensee must accept delivery of spirits shipments either at its li-censed premises or at one or more warehouse facilities that have been registered with the LCB. Summary: The LCB may not assess a monetary penalty exceeding 1 percent of the balance due against a licenseethat fails to timely pay the license issuance fee. For the purpose of negotiating volume discounts, a group of spirits retail licensees may accept delivery ofspirits at their individual lic ensed premises, or at any one of the individual licensees premises, at a warehouse facil-ity registered with the LCB.

Conditional Scholarship for Educators . A conditional scholarship is a loan that is fo rgiven in whole or in part in exchange for service as a certificated teacher at a K-12public school. The state forg ives one year of loan obliga- tion for every two years a recipient teaches in a Washing-ton K-12 public school. When a recipient fails to continue with the required course of study or teaching obligation, the recipient must repay the remaining loan principal with interest. The Retooling Mathematics and Sciences Conditional Scholarship Program requires a K-12 teacher, or certificat-ed elementary educator who is not employed in a position requiring an elementary educa tion certificate, to pursue an endorsement in math or science to be eligible for the pro- gram. The conditional schola rship amount is determined by the Student Achievement Council, may not exceed$3,000 per year, and is applied to the cost of tuition, fees, and educational expenses. Summary: Endorsements and Standards . The OSPI and the Professional Educator Standard Board (PESB) mustadopt computer science learning standards developed by anationally recognized computer science education organi- zation. The PESB must also develop standards for a K-12 computer science endorsement, which must facilitate dual endorsement in computer science and mathematics, sci-ence, or another related high-demand endorsement. Conditional Scholarship for Educators . The Retool- ing to Teach Mathematic s and Sciences Conditional Scholarship Program is renamed the Educator RetoolingConditional Scholarship Program. A K-12 teacher, or cer-tificated elementary educator who is not employed in a po- sition requiring an elementary education certificate, may qualify for the conditional scholarship program by pursu-ing an endorsement in a su bject or geographic endorse- ment shortage area, as de fined by the Professional Educator Standards Board.

House 98 0 Senate 48 1 (Senate amended) House 98 0 (House concurred) House 91 7 House 88 4 Senate 43 0HB 1819 108Authorized and Prohibited Uses . The WATV allows off-road and, in certain circum stances, on-road use. A person may operate a WATV on any public road-way, not including nonhighway roads and trails, at a speedof 35 miles per hour or less subject to certain restrictions.A person may not operate a WATV on a state highway andmay not cross a public roadway with a speed in excess of35 miles per hour. A person also may not operate a WATVwithin the boundaries of a county with a population of 15,000 or more unless the county, by ordinance, has ap-proved the operation of WATVs on roadways. A person isfurther prohibited from operating a WATV within theboundary of a city or town un less the city or town has ap- proved operation of WATVs. Operational Requirements . In order to operate a WATV off road, a person must: have a metal tag issued by the Department of Licens- ing (DOL) of the same size as a motorcycle license plate; and have a current and proper WATV off-road vehicle registration and tab. In addition to the above requirements, a person may also operate a WATV on certain public roads if: the WATV meets certain equipment standards, such as headlight, taillight, stoplight, and reflector require- ments; the person has current and proper WATV on-road vehicle registration and tab; and the person provides a required declaration. Declaration Requirements .

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015HB 1819 C 54 L 15 Concerning appointments to inspect the books of account of a political committee or a candidate committee. By Representatives Wilson, Griffey, Dent, Van Werven, Caldier, Pike, Shea, Vick, Harmsworth and Condotta. House Committee on State Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Background: In 1972 the voters passed Initiative 276, which required the disclosure of campaign finances, lob- byist activities, and financial affairs of elective officers and candidates. The initiative created the Public Disclo- sure Commission (PDC), a fi ve-member, bipartisan citi- zen commission, to enforce th e provisions of the campaign finance disclosure law. The Fair Campaign Practices Act was enacted follow- ing the passage of Initiative 134. The initiative imposed campaign contribution limits on elections for statewide and legislative office, furthe r regulated independent ex- penditures, and restricted the use of public funds for polit- ical purposes. Every political committee is required to file a state- ment of organization with the PDC within two weeks of itsorganization or within two weeks after the date the com-mittee expects to either receive contributions or make ex-penditures in any election cam paign, whichever is earlier. The statement of organization must include, among otherthings, the name and address of its treasurer and deposito-ry. Political committees must repo rt contributions and ex- penditures to the PDC on a monthly basis as long as con-tributions or expenditures exceed $200 since the last report. A listing of the names and addresses of personsmaking contributions of $25 or more must be included inthe report. The treasurer is required to maintain books of account that accurately reflect all contributions and expenditures. The books of account must be open for public inspectionall business days between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. beginning,eight days before and up to the day of the election. An in-spection must be allowed with in 24 hours of the time the appointment is made. It is unlawful to refuse to allow or keep an appointment for an inspection of the books of ac- count. Summary: A person wishing to inspect the books of ac- count must provide the treasure r with his or her telephone number and must provide phot o identification prior to in- specting the books of account. A treasurer may refuse to show the books of account to any person who does notmake an appointment or prov ide the required identifica- tion.Votes on Final Passage: House 96 2 Senate 47 0 House 67 31 Senate 44 0ESHB 1842 109Effective: July 24, 2015 ESHB 1842 C 11 L 15 E 3 Concerning transit agency coordination. By House Committee on Transp ortation (originally spon- sored by House Committee on Transportation Background: Transit Reporting Requirements . Each September, transit agencies in Washington are required tosubmit six-year transit develo pment plans for that year and the ensuing five years, as well as system reports identify- ing public transpor tation services provided in the previous year and objectives for improvements. Similar reports aredue to the Federal Transit Administration at the same time. Based on information that is submitted in the system reports, the Washington State Department of Transporta-tion (WSDOT) must prepare an annual report that summa- rizes individual public transp ortation systems. This report is due December 1 of each year to the transportation com-mittees of the Legislature and each state municipality. Regional Mobility Grants . The regional mobility grant program provides $50 million per biennium to aid local governments in fundin g projects that reduce delays for people and goods and improve connectivity betweencounties and regional popula tion centers. This includes projects such as intercounty connectivity service, park andride lots, rush hour transit service, and capital projects thatimprove the connectivity and ef ficiency of the transporta- tion system. The WSDOT must to submit a prioritized list to the Legislature by December 1 of each year of all the projectsrequesting funding. When prioritizing projects, the WS- DOT must insure that the proj ects are consistent with var- ious state, regional, and local plans, and must take intoconsideration the following criteria: enhancing the efficiency of regional corridors in moving people among jurisdictions and modes oftransportation; energy efficiency issues; reducing delay for people and goods; freight and goods movement as related to economic development; regional significance; rural isolation; the leveraging of other funds; and safety and security issues. The WSDOT must also take into consideration the ob- jectives of the following progra ms and acts when prioritiz- ing projects: the Growth Management Act; the High Capacity Transportation Act; the Commute Trip Reduction Act; transportation demand management programs; federal and state air quality requirements; and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and related state accessi bility requirements. Summary: The WSDOT is required to develop an annual report regarding transit agen cy coordination in counties with a population of 700,000 or more that border the PugetSound, which currently includes King, Pierce, and Sno-homish counties. By December 1 of each year, the reportmust be made available to the transportation committees of the Legislature and each transit authority in those samecounties. By September 1 of each year, all transit agencies in a county with a population of 700,000 or more that bordersthe Puget Sound are required to report to the WSDOT ontheir coordination efforts in the following areas: integrating marketing efforts; aligning fare structures; integrating service planning; coordinating long-range planning, including capital projects planning and implementation; integrating other administ rative functions and internal business processes as appropriate; and integrating certain cust omer-focused tools and initia- tives. The regional mobility grant criteria are modified by adding coordination and integration to the criteria uponwhich the grants are awarde d to the agencies in King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. A new transit coordination grant program is created within the WSDOT and expires in five years, on July 1,2020. The grants from the program are only available totransit agencies located in counties with a population of 700,000 or more that border the Puget Sound. The grantsmust be proposed jointly by two or more transit agencies,are intended to encourage jo int planning and coordination, and must include measurable outcomes. Upon completion of the project, transit coordination grant recipients must provide a report to the WSDOT thatincludes the following: an overview of the project; how the grant funds were spent; the extent to which in tended project outcomes were met; and identified best practices. The WSDOT must provide an annual report to the transportation committees of the Legislature on the transitcoordination grants that were awarded, and the report mustinclude data to determine if completed transit coordination grant projects produced the anticipated outcomes included in the grant applications.ESHB 1844 110Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: July 6, 2015 ESHB 1844 C 282 L 15 Concerning work performed on ferry vessels and termi- nals. By House Committee on Transp Appleton, Ortiz-Self and Tarleton). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Washington State Ferries (WSF) divi- sion of the Washington State Department of Transporta-tion (WSDOT) operates and maintains ferry vessels and terminals, constructs terminals, and acquires vessels. The system serves eight Washingt on counties and one Canadi- an province through 23 v essels and 20 terminals. As part of the marine highway system, the WSF is subject to a $60,000 limit on work that can be performed by state forces on state highways. Since March 15, 2010, the dollar limit was increased by the Legislature to $120,000, except for a brief periodbetween July 1, 2013 and March 14, 2014 when the dollarlimit was $60,000. Through June 30, 2015, the WSF is subject to a $120,000 limit on work that can be performed by stateforces on state highways. Summary: The dollar threshold is permanently increased for work that may be performed on ferry vessels and ter-minals by state forces from $60,000 to $100,000. For work between $100,000 and $200,000, the WS- DOT must first contact contractors on their small worksroster to gaug e their interest and av ailability to do the work. The contractors have 72 hours to respond to theWSDOT. If any contractor is interested and capable to dothe work, the WSDOT must follow the small works rosterprocedures. If no qualified contractors respond with inter-est and availability, the WSDO T may use its regular con- tracting procedures. Additionally, if the Secretary ofTransportation determines that the work to be completed is an emergency, then the WSDOT procedures governingemergencies apply.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2015SHB 1851 C 144 L 15 Creating an expedited permitting and contracting process for bridges owned by local governments that are deemedstructurally deficient. By House Committee on Environment (originally spon- sored by Representatives Hayes, Bergquist, Zeiger, Takko,Harmsworth, Wilson, Griffey, Hargrove, Smith and Ma-gendanz). House Committee on Environment Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The State Environmental Policy Act (SE- PA) establishes a review process for state and local gov-ernments to identify enviro nmental impacts that may result from governmental deci sions, such as the issuance of permits. Except for projects that are exempt from SEPArequirements, the SEPA generally requires a project appli- cant to submit an environmenta l checklist that includes an- swers to questions about th e potential impacts of the project on the built and natu ral environments. Generally, an environmental impact statem ent must be prepared for a proposal that the lead agency determines will have a prob- able significant, adverse imp act on the environment. The information collected throu gh the SEPA review process may be used to change a pr oposal to mitigate likely im- pacts or to condition or deny a proposal when adverse en-vironmental impacts are identified. The SEPA statute andrules contain exemptions for ce rtain actions that do not re- quire the submission of a ch ecklist or the development of an environmental impact stat ement. Among the activities exempted in SEPA rules ad opted by the Department of Ecology (ECY) are repair projec ts for roads, bridges, and other transportation infrastructure that are undertaken bythe Washington State Department of Transportation (WS-DOT), that take place within an existing right-of-way, andthat do not add automobile lanes or otherwise change thecapacity or function of the infrastructure. In the event that an accid ent, earthquake, or other emergency damages or jeopardizes a state highway, theWSDOT may obtain at least three bids from prequalifiedcontractors to reconstruct or repair the bridge without pub- lishing a call for bids under typical public works contract-ing procedures. Under this expedited contracting process,the WSDOT must award a contract to the lowest responsi-ble bidder. The WSDOT is required to notify any associ-ation or organization of contractors that has filed a requestto receive regular notification about emergency projects. The WSDOT evaluates and rates several aspects of the design, function, and condition of bridges in the state.Bridges deemed to be in poor condition, which is the low- est bridge condition rating, show advanced deficiencies,such as cracking, deterioration, or seriously affected pri-mary structural co mponents. Likewise, the Federal High- way Administration maintains a national bridge inventory,which contains information ab out the use, size, location,House 98 0 Senate 45 0 House 98 0 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 98 0 (House concurred)SHB 1853 111design, and condition of bridg es nationwide. In the na- tional bridge inventory, the condition of bridges is evalu- ated on a scale of zero to nine, with zero being designatedfor failed, out-of-service bridges beyond corrective actionand nine being designated for bridges in excellent condi-tion. A bridge rating of fo ur indicates poor condition, which is indicated by spallin g (a depression in concrete caused by the separation of surface concrete), scour (ero-sion of bank or streambed material around bridge piers orabutments), and other signs of bridge component corro-sion. Summary: The ECY is directed to amend SEPA rules so that the categorical exemptio n available to WSDOT infra- structure projects is also available for repair or replace-ment projects involving a structurally deficient city, town,or county bridge. Cities, towns, and counties may use the expedited con- tracting process currently available to the WSDOT in or-der to repair or replace a structurally deficient bridge. To be classified as structura lly deficient, a bridge must have a poor condition classifica tion in the state bridge rat- ing system and must feature a deck, superstructure, or sub- structure rating of four or below in the national bridgeinventory. Structurally deficient bridges are also de-scribed as possessing reduced load-carrying capacity anddeteriorated conditions of si gnificant bridge elements. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1853 C 220 L 15 Encouraging utility leadership in electric vehicle charging infrastructure build-out. By House Committee on Tech nology & Economic Devel- opment (originally andTharinger). House Committee on Technol ogy & Economic Develop- ment Senate Committee on Energy , Environment & Telecom- munications Background: The Utilities and Transportation Commis- sion. The Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) regulates the rates, services, and practices of privately-owned utilities and transportati on companies. Among the companies under regulation by the UTC are electrical and natural gas companies. The UT C is required to ensure that rates charged by these companies are \"fair, just, and rea-sonable.\" Rate of Return on Investment . Under regulation by the UTC, the rates to be charged by privately-owned utili-ties are calculated from a utility's rate base and rate of re- turn allowed on its rate base. A utility's rate base is the total nondepreciated value of its property and equipment used to provide utility service to ratepayers. \"Rate of re-turn\" is the level of profit and the cost of debt that a utilityis allowed to return on its rate base through rates charged to utility customers. In establishing rates for g as and electrical companies, the UTC must allow an incentive rate of return on invest- ment for certain programs or projects, including those toimprove the efficiency of energy end-use or to generate re- newable energy. The incentive rates of return on invest-ment to be allowed are established by adding an incrementof 2 percent to the rate of re turn on common equity permit- ted on the company' s other investments. Summary: In establishing rates for gas and electrical companies, the UTC must cons ider policies to improve ac- cess to and promote fair co mpetition in the provision of electric vehicle supply eq uipment (EVSE) build-out. These policies may include, bu t are not limited to, allow- ing a rate of return on investment on capital expendituresfor EVSE that is deployed for the benefit of ratepayers, provided that the capital e xpenditures do not increase costs to ratepayers in excess of 0.25 percent. A rate of return on investment for EVSE build-out may only be allowed if the company chooses to pursuecapital investment in EVSE on a fully regulated basis sim- ilar to other capital investme nts behind a customer's meter. The incentive rate of return is established by adding an in- crement of up to 2 percent to the rate of return on common equity permitted on the co mpany's other investments. Eligible capital investments in EVSE are limited to those that are installed after July 1, 2015, and which areexpected to result in real and tangible EVSE being in- stalled and located where electric vehicles are most likelyto be parked for interval s longer than two hours. A rate of return on investment for EVSE build-out may only be earned for a period up to the depreciable lifeof the asset. When the capita l investment has fully depre- ciated, an electrical company may gift the EVSE to the owner of the property on which it is located. By December 31, 2017, the UTC must report to the Legislature with regard to the use of any incentives al- lowed for EVSE, the quantifiab le impacts of the incentives on actual electric vehicle deployment, and any recommen-dations to the Legislature abou t utility participation in the electric vehicle market.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015House 98 0 Senate 43 5 House 71 27 Senate 33 16 (Senate amended)House 67 31 (House concurred)EHB 1859 112EHB 1859 C 4 L 15 E 1 Concerning the amendment, recodification, decodifica- tion, or repeal of statutes relating to state capital construc-tion funds and accounts and b ond authorizations that are inactive, obsolete, or no lo nger necessary for continued publication in the Revised Code of Washington.

By Representatives Lytton and Morris.House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Motor Vehicle Fund . Under the 18th Amendment to the Washingt on Constitution, vehicle li- censing fees, motor vehicle fuel taxes, and all other staterevenue intended to be used for highway purposes must be paid into the State Treasury, placed in the Motor VehicleFund (MVF), and used only for highway purposes. High-way purposes include expenditures on construction, re-construction, maintenance, repair, and betterment ofpublic highways, county roads, bridges, and city streets. Highway purposes also include the operation of ferriesthat are a part of any public highway, county road, or citystreet. The Rural Arterial Trust Account . Within the MVF is the Rural Arterial Trust Account (RATA). All moneys inthe RATA must be expended fo r: (1) the construction and improvement of county rural arterials and collectors; (2) the construction of replacemen t bridges funded by the fed- eral bridge replacement prog ram on access roads in rural areas; and (3) those expenses of the County Road Admin- istration Board associated w ith the administration of the Rural Arterial Program. To be eligible to receiv e funds from th e RATA, coun- ties must spend all revenues collected for road purposes only for purposes allowed under statute and the Washing-ton Constitution. Allowable road purposes specifically in- clude removal of barriers to fish passage andaccompanying streambed and stream bank repair, and traf-fic law enforcement. The el igibility restriction does not apply to: counties with a population of less than 8,000; counties that expend reve nues collected for road pur- poses only on other governmental services after authorization from county voters; and monies diverted from the road district levy under applicable community rev italization financing stat- utes. County Road Funds . In each county, there is a fund known as the county road fund (CRF). Any funds that ac-crue to the county for use upon the roads must be creditedand deposited into the CRF. The CRF may receive funds from sources such as: (a) levies made by the county legi slative authority for the pur- pose of raising revenue to estab lish, lay out, construct, al- ter, repair, improve, and main tain county roads, bridges, and wharves necessary for vehicle ferriage, and otherproper county purposes; (b) the MVF; and (c) reimburse-ments by the federal govern ment for expenditures made from the CRF. Money paid to a CRF may be used for purposes enu- merated such as: the construction, altera tion, repair, improvement, or maintenance of county roads and bridges; wharves necessary for ferriage of motor vehicles; ferries; acquiring, operating, and maintaining machinery, equipment, quarries, or pits for the extraction of materials; the cost of establishing county roads, acquiring rights-of-way, and operatin g the county engineering office; programs directly relate d to county road purposes, specifically, insurance programs, self-insurance pro- grams, and risk management programs; and any other proper county road purpose. A county road purpose specifically includes construc- tion, maintenance, or improvement of park-and-ride lotsand the removal of barriers to fish passage.House 98 0 House 92 0 Senate 43 0SHB 1879 113Summary: For counties that consist entirely of islands, county road purposes specifi cally include marine uses re- lating to navigation and moorage. These counties may de-posit revenue from real and personal property taxes andcounty road tax levies into a subaccount of their CRF to be used for marine facilities, including mooring buoys, docks, and aids to navigation. Counties that use revenue for marine uses and facili- ties in accordance with this au thority are eligible to receive funds from the RATA.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SHB 1879 C 283 L 15 Directing the health care auth ority to issue a request for proposals for integrated managed health and behavioralhealth services for foster children.

House Committee on Health Care & Wellness House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Medicaid and Foster Youth . The Health Care Authority (HCA) administers the Medicaid program,which is a state-fede ral program that pays for health care for low-income state residents who meet certain eligibilitycriteria. Persons under 19 years old who are in foster careand are under the legal responsibi lity of the state or a tribe located within the state are e ligible for Medicaid. Persons under 21 years old who are eith er in foster care or eligible for continued foster care services may also enroll in Med-icaid. In addition, persons between 19 and 26 years old may receive Medicaid if they e ither were in foster care and enrolled in Medicaid on their eighteenth birthday or wereolder than 18 when their foster care assistance ended. Integration of Health Care and Behavioral Health Ser- vices for Foster Youth . In 2014 the HCA and the Depart- ment of Social and Health Services were directed todevelop a plan to provide integrated managed health andmental health care for foster children on Medicaid. Theplan had to address the deve lopment of a service delivery system, benefit design, reimbursement mechanisms, andstandards for contracting with health plans. The plan had to include a timeline and funding estimate for full integra-tion. In addition, the plan ha d to be designed so that the requirement for providing ment al health services to chil-dren under the T.R. v. Dreyfus and Porter settlement ( T.R. settlement ) is met. The report submitted to th e Legislature identifies a timeline for integration of se rvices with January 2018 as the date for executing an integrated contract. The reportnoted that the primary challe nge of full integration would be moving foster children affected by the T.R. settlement to a managed care organizatio n while maintaining conti- nuity and quality of care. Antipsychotic Medications . Antipsychotic medica- tions were intended to help people with severe mental ill- nesses such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but arenow used for many other cond itions. Early antipsychotics, commonly referred to as firs t generation antipsychotics, carried several side effects such as movement disordersand sedation. More recently developed antipsychoticmedications, commonly referred to as second generationantipsychotics, have fewer si de effects related to motor skills, although they have been associated with weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and other side effects. A 2012 reportby the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual-ity noted the increased use of antipsychotic medications for children and youth despite the general lack of high-quality and longitudinal studies. The HCA must review the psychotropic medications of all children under 5 years old and establish methods toevaluate the appropriateness of the medication for the chil-dren, including the use of second opinions from experts inchild Deficit Summary: Integrated Medicaid Managed Care for Foster Youth . The Health Care Authority (HCA) must seek pro- posals to provide integrated managed health care and be-havioral health care to foster children enrolled inMedicaid. Behavioral health services must be integratedinto managed health care plans for foster youth by October1, 2018. The request for prop osals must address the devel- opment of a service delivery system, benefit design, reim-bursement mechanisms, and standards for contracting with health plans. In addition, the plan must meet the re-quirements for mental health services as established underthe T.R. v. Dreyfus and Porter settlement. The integrated managed care plan must begin providing services on De-cember 1, 2016. Antipsychotic Medication Reviews for Foster Youth. The HCA must require that an expert in psychiatry provide a second opinion review for all prescriptions of one ormore antipsychotic medicatio ns for any child under 18 years old who is in the foster care system and is enrolledin Medicaid. A 30-day supply of medications may be dis-pensed pending the second opinion review. The secondopinion must address psychoso cial interventions that have been or will be offered to the child and the caretaker to ad- dress the behavioral issues.House 75 21 Senate 46 3 (Senate amended)House 81 16 (House concurred)HB 1884 114The HCA must promote the appropriate use of behav- ioral therapies in place of or in addition to prescription medications where appropriate and available, rather thanmerely encouraging their use.

By Representatives Vick, Berg quist, Hayes, Riccelli, Or- cutt, Wilson and Pike. House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: An electric personal assistive mobility de- vice (EPAMD) is defined as a self-balancing device withtwo wheels not in tandem that is designed to transport one person by electric power. The power of an EPAMD is lim-ited to 750 watts; and the maximum speed is limited to 20miles per hour. An EPAMD is not motor vehicles, andthey are excluded from the definition of a motorcycle. A driver's license is not required to operate an EP- AMD. Additionally, an EPAMD may not be operated ona fully controlled limited access highway, but they may beoperated on a sidewalk. A municipality may restrict theuse of an EPAMD in locations with congested pedestrian and non-motorized traffic. Municipalities may not, how- ever, restrict the speed of an EPAMD in the entire commu-nity or in areas in which there is infrequent pedestrian traffic. Finally, the user of an EPAMD is classified as a\"vulnerable user of a public way.\" Summary: The definition of an electric personal assistive mobility device is expanded to include a self-balancing device with one wheel that is designed to transport one person. The power of such devices is limited to 2,000watts, and their maximum speed is limited to 20 miles perhour.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015EHB 1890 C 284 L 15 Concerning a second-party paym ent process for paying is- suer. By Representatives Schmick and Cody.House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Senate Committee on Health Care Background: An individual enrolled in a qualified health plan (QHP) through the Health Benefit Exchange (Ex-change) is responsi ble for making premium and cost-shar- ing payments to the issuer . Enrollees currently make premium payments to the Exchange, but beginning withthe 2016 open enrollment peri od, issuers will begin col- lecting premium payments directly from enrollees. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued guidance related to premium and cost-sharing payments made by third parties on behalf of QHPenrollees. The CMS discourages issuers from acceptingthird-party payments from hosp itals, health care provid- ers, and other commercial entitie s due to concerns that the practice could skew the insurance risk pool and create anunlevel field in the Exchange. By CMS rule, however, anissuer that offers a QHP in the individual market is re- quired to accept premium and cost-sharing payments onbehalf of an enrollee if the payment is made by: the RyanWhite HIV/AIDS Program; other state and federal govern-ment programs that provide premium and cost-sharingsupport for individuals; or Indian tribes, tribal organiza-tions, or urban Indian national organizations. Summary: Issuers must accept paym ents made by a sec- ond-party payment process, and these payments may bemade with any legal tender denominated in U.S. dollars. \"Second-party payment process\" means a process inwhich: an individual has an account in his or her name at a financial institution that is managed by either theinstitution or an entity that has established the account on the individual's behalf and with his or her express agreement; the account is funded with funds from the individual or his or her family members or in a manner other- wise consistent with federal law; and the account is under the control of the covered person so that he or she may authorize payments from the account. An issuer is not required to accept payment by a sec- ond-party payment process if the second-party payer iscontrolled by, or receives fundi ng from, an entity that may be reimbursed by an issuer for providing health care ser-vices or if the account is fu nded by such an entity, except for the third-party entities fro m which federal law requires the issuer to accept payment.

House Committee on Technol ogy & Economic Develop- ment Senate Committee on Energy , Environment & Telecom- munications Background: Disclosures to Retail Electric Customers . Except for small utilities, each electric utility must provide its retail electric customers wi th certain disclosures, in- cluding an explanation of the utility's policies governing the confidentiality of propri etary customer information, including the circumstances u nder which the information may be disclosed and the ways in which customers cancontrol access to the information. \"Small utility\" means any consumer-owned utility with 25,000 or fewer electric me ters in service, or that has an average of seven or fewer customers per mile of distri-bution line. \"Proprietary customer in formation\" means informa- tion that relates to the source and amount of electricityused by a retail electric customer, a retail electric custom-er's payment history, household data, and information con-tained in an electric bill. Disclosures of Private Information . The Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) prohibits investor- owned utilities from disclosing or selling private consum-er information with or for a utility's affiliates, subsidiaries, or any other third party for the purposes of marketing ser-vices or product offerings to a customer who does not al-ready subscribe to that service or product, unless the utility obtains the customer's written or electronic permission. \"Private consumer informa tion\" includes the customer's name, address, telephone number, and any other personal-ly identifying information. Consumer-owned utilities are not under the regulatory jurisdiction of the UTC. Consumer Protection Act . The Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA) declares that unfair and deceptivepractices in trade or commerce are illegal. The CPA al-lows a person injured by an unfair or deceptive practice to bring a private cause of action for damages. The Office of the Attorney General may investigate and prosecuteclaims under the CPA on behalf of the state or individuals in the state. Energy Benchmarking Programs . Gas and electric utilities serving more than 25 ,000 customers are required to maintain energy use data for nonresidential buildings and certain public agency buildings. These data must bemaintained in such a way as to allow them to be inputted into the United States Enviro nmental Protection Agency's Energy Star Portfolio Manager (Portfolio Manager). Gas and electric utilities serving over 25,000 custom- ers must upload building energy use data into PortfolioManager. In doing so, the utili ty may not disclose person- ally identifying information. Owners of nonresidential buildings that are over 10,000 square feet in size mu st disclose Portfolio Manager data and ratings for the previo us 12 months to prospective buyers, lenders, or renters. There are no penalties speci-fied for noncompliance with disclosure requirements. Summary: Disclosures to Retail Electric Customers . Each electric utility, except for a small utility, must pro-vide its retail electric customer s with an explanation of the utility's policies governing th e confidentiality of private, as well as proprietary, customer information, including the circumstances under which the information may be dis-closed and the ways in whic h customers can control access to the information. \"Private customer information\" in- cludes a retail electric customer's name, address, telephonenumber, and other personally identifying information.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015SHB 1897 C 20 L 15 E 3 Creating the joint center for deployment and research in earth-abundant materials. By House Committee on T echnology & Economic Devel- opment (originally sponsore d by Representatives Smith, Morris, Tarleton, Young, Hayes, Haler, Sells, Buys, Faganand Short). Background: In 2011 the United States Department of Energy (DOE) released a report examining the role of rare earth metals and other material s in clean ener gy technolo- gies, such as wind turbines, electric vehicles, solar cells,and energy efficient lighting. The report found that sever-al clean energy technologies are dependent on one of fiverare earth elements that are at risk of supply disruptions in the short term. The DOE listed these materials as 'critical'materials. Two other elements, lithium and tellurium,were identified as being 'near critical' materials. Rare earth elements (REEs) may be moderately abun- dant in the earth's crust, but are not concentrated enough to be easily exploited economically. The DOE found that China is the largest supplier of REEs and the United Statesis heavily import-dependent fo r a number of critical and near-critical materials. Th e DOE has recommended strat- egies to diversify and expand the supply chain, fund re-search to develop su bstitutes for critical materials, and reduce waste of critical mate rials through the development of more efficient manufactur ing processes, recycling, and reuse. The supply chain for critical materials includes pro- cessing, workforce development, and research and devel-opment. The federal govern ment has started to award funding for projects that can enhance the ability of the United States to continue deploying clean technologiesand other advanced technologies currently dependent onREEs and other critical materials. The Critical MaterialsInstitute (CMI), facilitated by the Ames National Labora- tory, is one example of a conc erted local, national, and in- ternational effort to address cr itical materials supply chain issues. Summary: The Joint Center for Deployment and Re- search in Earth-Abundant Materials (JCDREAM) is creat-ed. The JCDREAM is a mul ti-institutional education and research center under the au thority of the University of Washington (UW) and Wash ington State University (WSU). The JCDREAM's purpose is to: (1) establish atransformative program in earth-abundant materials to ac-celerate the development of next generation clean energy and transportation technologies in Washington; (2) estab- lish a coordinated framework to drive research and de-ployment of earth-abundant materials and the recycling ofadvanced materials used in clean technologies; and (3) promote environmentally responsible processes for themanufacturing and recycling of advanced materials. House 98 0 Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 94 1 (House concurred)SHB 1898 117The JCDREAM is governed by a board of directors (Board) appointed by the Governor, consisting of nine vot-ing members and one chair, who may vote if necessary tobreak a tie. The Board must include as representatives the following: deans from WSU and the UW; one representa-tive from a regional univers ity; a representative from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL); a com-munity college representative ; representatives from large, medium, and small industry companies; one member withexperience in national security and energy policy; and onemember with experience in innovation and development of policy to address envi ronmental challenges. The Board must hire an executive director and may hire additional staff. The initial administrative offices must be west of the Cascades. The JCDREAM must makeits facilities and resources ava ilable to all four-year insti- tutions of higher education. The JCDREAM may solicitand receive gifts and grants from public and private sourc-es, and such gifts are exempt from certain limitations es-tablished in the Ethics in Public Service Act. The Board's duties include, for example, working with clean technology and transporta tion industry firms to iden- tify research areas beneficial to Washington's industries,identifying entrepreneurial researchers, and developing internships and other opportun ities for students. In addi- tion, the Board must leverage its financial impact through joint support arrangements an d development of non-state funding sources. The Board must allocate appropriatedseed funds for collaboration on research, for product de-velopment and deployment, and as assistance to commu-nity colleges and trade sc hools for workforce training programs. The Board must develop an operating plan byDecember 1, 2015, that must include performance metricsto measure total research dolla rs leveraged, total research- ers involved, total workforce trained, and total number of products or processes commercialized and deployed. TheBoard must, in coordination with the Office of the Gover-nor and the Department of Commerce, submit a biennial report including these metrics to the Legislature and Gov-ernor assessing the impact of the JCDREAM on the stateeconomy and the development of next generation cleanenergy and transportation technologies.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 SHB 1898 C 286 L 15 Concerning awareness of the possibility of children testi- fying remotely in certain cases.By House Committee on Judi ciary (originally sponsored by Johnson, Walkinshaw, Mu-ri, Robinson, Pettigrew, Lytton and Kilduff). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: Child Testimony by Closed-Circuit Televi- sion. On motion of the prosecuting attorney in certain criminal proceedings, the co urt may allow a child witness to testify by closed-circuit television from a room outsidethe presence of the defendant and the jury. The court'sability to allow a child witness to testify by closed-circuit television is limited to cases in which the child witness isunder the age of 14 and th e testimony will describe: an act or attempted act of sexual contact or physical abuse involving the child; an act or attempted act of sexual contact or physical abuse by a person against another child; a trafficking or child sexual exploitation offense; or a violent offense comm itted against or by a person known or familiar to the child witness. To allow testimony outside the presence of the defen- dant and the jury, the court must find by substantial evi-dence that requiring the child witness to testify in thepresence of the defendant or jury will cause the child to suffer serious emotional or mental distress that will pre- vent the child from reasonably communicating at trial. If the child is able to communicate in front of the defendant but not the jury, the defend ant will remain in the room while the jury is excluded. If the court allows a child wit-ness to testify outside the presence of the defendant, thedefendant must be able to communicate constantly with the defense attorney. The prosecutor, defense attorney,and a victim's advocate, if an y, must be in the room with the child-witness. The court may or may not be in the room with the child. The court may not permit ch ild testimony by closed- circuit television unless there is no less restrictive methodof obtaining the testimony th at adequately protects the child from serious emotional or mental distress. The courtmust find that the prosecutor has made all reasonable ef-forts to prepare the child witn ess for testifying. Addition- ally, the court must balance the strength of the state's casewithout the testimony of the child witness against the de- fendant's constitutional rights. Child testimony by closed- circuit television is not permi tted if the defendant is acting as his or her own attorney or when identification of the de-fendant is at issue. Criminal Justice Training Commission Sexual Assault Investigation and Prosecution Training . The Criminal Jus- tice Training Commission (CJT C) provides basic law en- forcement training and edu cational programs for law enforcement, corrections person nel, and other public safe- ty professionals. The CJTC is required to offer a yearly in-tensive training session on investigating and prosecuting sexual assault cases. The training must take an integratedHouse 97 0 Senate 43 1SHB 1919 118approach so that prosecutors, law enforcement, defenders, and victim advocates can benefit from the training. Summary: The CJTC's annual traini ng on investigating and prosecuting sexual assault cases must include a refer-ence to the possibility that a court may allow certain chil-dren under the age of 14 to t estify in a room outside of the presence of the defendant and the jury. In addition, the CJTC must annually survey law en- forcement and prosecuting agencies and report to the Leg-islature every other year starting December 1, 2015,regarding the following: the frequency of cases where children under the age of 14 elect not to testify, including the reasons for the election not to testify; the number of cases where the child remote testimony law was used, and whether those cases resulted in conviction; and the number of child sexual abuse cases referred for prosecution and the number of those cases that were prosecuted.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 1940 PARTIAL VETO C 170 L 15 Exempting levies imposed by qualifying flood control zone districts from certain lim itations upon regular prop- House Committee on Finance Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: All real and personal property in the state is subject to property tax each year based on its value, un- less specific exemption is pr ovided by law. The Washing- ton Constitution (Constitution) requires that taxes be uniform within a class of property. Uniformity requiresboth an equal rate of tax an d equality in valuing the prop- erty. The Constitution limits regula r property tax levies to a maximum of 1 percent of the property's value ($10 per$1,000 of assessed value). There are individual districtrate maximums and aggregate rate maximums to keep the total tax rate for regular prop erty taxes within the constitu- tional limit. For example: the state levy rate is limited to $3.60 per $1,000 of assessed value; county general levies are limited to $1.80 per $1,000 of assessed value; county road levies are limited to $2.25 per $1,000 of assessed value; and city levies are limited to $3.375 per $1,000 of assessed value. For property tax purposes, the state, counties, and cit- ies, with respect to the levies listed above, are collectively referred to as senior taxing districts. Junior taxing districts, a term that includes fire, hospi- tal, flood control zone and most other special purpose dis-tricts, each have specific rate limits as well. The tax rates for senior and junior districts, excluding the state, must fit within an overall rate lim it of $5.90 per $1,000 of assessed value. If th e $5.90 limit is exceeded, statute establishes the sequenti al order in which the levies of various junior taxing district levies must be proportion-ally reduced or eliminated (a process referred to as prora-tioning) to conform to the $5.90 limit. Some regular property tax levies, including levies for port districts, emergency medical services, and criminaljustice purposes, are not subjec t to the $5.90 aggregate rateHouse 97 0 Senate 45 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)House 89 9 Senate 44 3EHB 1943 119limit. These levies have protections from general prora- tioning requirements and exis t within the 50 cent \"gap\" that remains after subtracting the $3.60 state levy and the $5.90 in local regular levi es from the constitutional $10 limit per $1,000 of assessed value. Qualifying flood control zone districts may protect up to 25 cents per $1,000 of assessed value of their levy au-thority through excep tions to general prorationing require- ments if their levy within the $5.90 limit is subject toprorationing. To qualify, a flood control district must belocated in a county with a population of 775,000 or moreand whose boundaries are coex tensive with the county. This provision is set to expire in 2018. Summary: A flood control zone district that is located in a county with a population of 775,000 or more and coex-tensive with a county may con tinue to qualify for proration protection until January 1, 2023 . A flood control zone dis- trict that is located in a coun ty within the Chehalis River basin and coextensive with a county may qualify for pro-ration protection from January 1, 2018 until January 1,2023.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2018 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the expi- ration date clause, allowing qualifying flood control zone districts to permanently protect a portion of their levy ca-pacity from general prorationing requirements. VETO MESSAGE ON HB 1940 May 6, 2015 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, withou t my approval as to Section 7, House Bill No. 1940 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to exempti ng levies imposed by qualify- ing flood control zone districts from certain limitations upon regular property tax levies.\"Section 7 of House Bill No. 1940 expires the protection of flood control zone district levies fr om prorationing on January 1, 2023. This expiration date is problematic and restricts the flexibility of flood control zone districts to select and appropriately finance flood control projects. With th e expiration date, any bonds will very likely be more expensive for flood c ontrol zone districts. There is also greater risk of in sufficient revenue s for flood control projects regardless of financing met hod in the event the levy is pro- rationed. To allow for maximum fl exibility in financing flood con- trol projects to protect the ci tizens of Washington state from flooding, I am vetoing se ction 7 of this bill. For these reasons I have vetoed Section 7 of House Bill No. 1940. With the exception of Secti on 7, House Bill No. 1940 is ap- proved. Respectfully submitted, Jay InsleeGovernor EHB 1943 C 287 L 15 Concerning electronic monitoring. By Representatives Shea, G oodman, McCaslin and Scott. House Committee on Public Safety House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Senate Committee on Law & JusticeSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: A court may order an offender, as an alter- native to incarceration, to hom e detention.

Home detention is a subset of electronicmonitoring. Home detentio n may not be imposed for an offender if the sentencing court finds that the offender haspreviously and knowingly violated the terms of a home de-tention program and the viola tion was not technical, mi- nor, or non-substantive. \"Electronic monitoring\" is defined as tracking the lo- cation of an individual pretrial or post-trial through the use of technology capable of determining the monitored per-son's location. Electronic mo nitoring is included in the definition of partial confinemen t. This definition of elec- tronic monitoring is applicab le in the following contexts: when imposed by the DO C pursuant to its discretion to monitor sex offenders; when imposed by the court as part of a domestic vio- lence protection order or after conviction for violation of such orders; and when imposed as a condit ion of release in a criminal case. Supervising Agency Requirements . A supervising agency is defined as a public entity that authorized a home detention or home monitoring program and has jurisdic- tion over a monitored individual. A monitoring agencymay be a supervising agency.

The Displaced Homemaker Act of 1979 expanded services todisplaced homemakers provided through the federal gov-ernment program and established guidelines for the StateBoard for Community and Technical Colleges related totraining, counseling, and prov iding services to displaced homemakers. The program has not been funded since2011. The Project Even Start Program . Project Even Start facilitates the expansion of se rvices provided through the federal Even Start Family Literacy Program that was firstauthorized in 1988 to pr ovide literacy and basic skills training to parents though community and technical col- leges. A central purpose of Project Even Start was to en- able parents to assist their own children to gain literacy skills. Project Even Start does not receive funding fromthe state. The Educational Assist ance Grant Program . The Ed- ucational Assistance Grant Program was created in 2003for students with dependents, subject to the availability of receipts of gifts, grants, or endowments from privatesources. Since 2003 no gift s, grants, or endowments have been provided for this purpose. Technical College Districts and Boards . The Commu- nity and Technical College Ac t of 1991 transferred voca- tional-technical institutes, now known as technical colleges, from the common sch ool system to the higher education system. Direction was provided for the use ofshared facilities between voca tional-technical institutes and common schools until such a time as one of the pro- grams could be removed from the facility. Certain vestedinterests were assigned to either school district boards or technical college boards. State statutes specify name s, districts, and member- ship for boards of trustees for each vocational-technical institute (technical college). Districts and membership forboards of trustees are also provided in statutes pertainingto both community college s and technical colleges. The High School Completion Pilot Program . In 2007 a pilot program was created fo r two community or techni- cal colleges to make courses or a program of study avail- able on the college campus designed to enable students under the age of 21, who have completed all state and localhigh school graduation requirem ents, except the certificate of academic achievement or certificate of individualachievement, to complete th eir high school education and obtain a high school diploma. The Washington Scholars Program . The Washington Scholars Program recognizes the accomplishments of four high school seniors from each of the state's 49 legislative districts. Eligible students must be nominated by their school principal and rank in the top 1 percent of their grad-uating senior class to receive state scholarships for up tofour years. The scholarships can be used at any of Wash- ington's public or private colle ges or universities. Funding for the program was suspende d in the 2011-13 biennium, though scholars selected in earlier years continue to re-ceive their awards. In the 2011-13 biennium, recipients re-ceived honorary recognition-only certificates. General Obligation Bond s. Washington periodically issues general obligation bonds to finance projects authorized in the capital budget,including higher education fa cilities. General obligation bonds pledge the full faith, credit, and taxing power of thestate towards payment of debt service. Legislation autho-rizing the issuance of bonds requires a 60 percent majority vote in both the House of Re presentatives and the Senate. Bond authorization legislatio n generally specifies the ac- count or accounts into whic h bond sale proceeds are de- posited, as well as the source of debt service payments. When debt service payments are due, the State Treasurer(Treasurer) withdraws the amounts necessary to make thepayments from the State General Fund and deposits theminto bond retirement funds. The State Finance Committee, composed of the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, andthe Treasurer, is responsible for supervising and con-trolling the issuance of all st ate bonds. General obligation bonds are typically issued with 25-year maturities. Summary: Certain statutes pertaining to general obliga- tion bonds that were issued for higher education capital projects that have matured are decodified. An expiration date of August 1, 2015, is provided for the following provisions: the Displaced Homemaker Act; the Project Even Start program;House 96 1 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 98 0 (House concurred)HB 1962 122 certain statutes for technical colleges and Seattle V ocational Institution to collect tuition and fees per their standard operating procedures; the Educational Assistance Grant; the naming of vocationa l-technical institutes, their districts, and providing for boards of trustees; certain statutes pertaining to the transfer of voca- tional-technical institute s from the common school system to the higher education system; the Opportunity Express website; and the High School Completion Pilot program.

By Representatives Moscoso, Orcutt, Clibborn, Bergquist, Zeiger, Pollet and Tarleton. House Committee on Higher Education Senate Committee on Higher Education Background: Public institutions of higher education are required and authorized to grant various tuition and fee waivers. Some waivers are state-supported, and institu-tions receive state funding to make up revenue fromwaived tuition and fees. Othe r waivers are discretionary, and institutions do not receive state funding. The institu- tions are limited in their tuition and fee waiver authority inthat the total amount of tuitio n and fee revenue waived, ex- empted, or reduced may not exceed a percentage of theirestimated gross operating fee revenue. The institutions'percentage caps are as follows: University of Washington is 21 percent; Washington State University is 20 percent; Eastern Washington University is 11 percent; Central Washington Un iversity is 10 percent; Western Washington Un iversity is 10 percent; The Evergreen State College is 10 percent; and community colleges as a whole are 35 percent. Under certain conditions, th e following individuals must be given tuition and fee waivers to attend a postsec- ondary institution: wrongly convicted persons and their children; Washington Schola r students; and children and spouses of veteran or National Guard members, law en-forcement officers, firefighters, or state patrol officerswho lost their lives or became totally disabled in the line of duty. Totally disabled means a person who has becometotally or permanently disabled for life by bodily injury or disease and is thereby prevented from performing any oc-cupation or gainful pursuit. Summary: The state universities, the regional universi- ties, and The Evergreen State College must waive tuitionand fees for the children and surviving spouses of highway workers who died or became to tally disabled in the line of duty while employed by a tr ansportation agency. A trans- portation agency m eans any agency, department, or divi- sion of a municipal corpora tion, political subdivision, or other unit of local government in Washington whose pri-mary function is the construction and maintenance of thestate's highways and roads. A transportation agency is dis-tinguished from a transit agency , as one of a transportation agency's main functions is highway maintenance, such as the State Department of Tran sportation. A transportation agency does not include government contractors.

VETO MESSAGE ON ESHB 1980 May 11, 2015 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, withou t my approval as to Section 1, Engrossed Substitute Hous e Bill No. 1980 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to implementing recommendations of the sunshine committee.\" Guardian Ad Litems undergo a rigorous evaluation of their backgrounds and qualifications , which include background checks that are required by law. There is no need for this informa- tion to be distributed to parties. I believe that enactment of this law would have a chilling effect on GAL programs and their ability to recruit volunteers if this informat ion were shared with parties in dependency actions. For these reasons I have vetoed Section 1 of Engrossed Substi- tute House Bill No. 1980. With the exception of Section 1, Engrossed Substitute House Bill No. 1980 is approved. Respectfully submitted, Jay Inslee GovernorEHB 1989 C 187 L 15 Concerning water storage asset management services. By Representatives Dent and Takko.House Committee on Local Government Senate Committee on Agriculture, Water & Rural Eco- nomic Development Background: Municipal Water Systems . Cities and towns may provide for the sewerage, drainage, and watersupply of a city or town, an d may establish, construct, and maintain water supply system s and systems of sewers and drains within or without their corporate limits. First Class Cities . A first class city may contract for public works pursuant to public notice and a call for com-petitive bids. Subject to lim itations, a city may also have public works performed by c ity employees or a county. \"Public works\" means all wo rk, construction, alteration, repair, or improvement other than ordinary maintenance,executed at the city's cost. A city must let a contract using competitive bidding procedures for any public works project: (a) in excess of$90,000, when more than a single craft or trade is in-volved; or (b) in excess of $4 5,000, when a single craft or trade is involved, the project is street signalization, or the project is street lighting. The competitive bidding require- ments for a city may be waived by the city legislative au- thority if an exemp tion applies to the work or contract. The city may also let contracts using a small works rosterprocess. Procurement of the following types of service con- tracts are exempt from contract and competitive biddingrequirements: (1) the selection of persons or entities toconstruct or develop water po llution control facilities or to provide water pollution control services; and (2) the selec- tion of persons or entities to construct or develop solid waste handling facilities or to provide solid waste han-dling services. Second Class Cities . A second class city must use contract and competitive bidd ing for public works when the estimated cost of the work or improvement: (a) ex-ceeds $65,000 and more than a single craft or trade is in- volved; or (b) exceeds $40,000, and a single craft or tradeis involved, the project is str eet signalization, or the proj- ect is street lighting. Publ ic works below these thresholds may be let by contract or day labor without calling forbids. \"Public works\" means all work, construction, alter- ation, repair, or improvement other than ordinary mainte- nance, executed at the cost of the city. When a contract is subjec t to competitive bidding re- quirements, the city must publish notice calling for sealed bids and let the contract to the lowest responsible bidder.In lieu of other contract procedures, the city may also letcontracts using a small works roster process. Towns . Towns are authorized to contract for supply- ing water for municipal purposes, and to acquire, con-House 89 9 Senate 44 0 (Senate amended)House 87 11 (House concurred) HB 2000 126struct, repair, and manage pumps, aqueducts, reservoirs, or other works necessary or pr oper for supplying water for use of the town, its inhabitant s, or irrigating purposes. In letting contracts, towns are au thorized to use the same pro- cedures as second class cities. Summary: Municipalities are expressly authorized to contract for asset management service of their water stor-age assets ( i.e., water storage structures and associated dis- tribution systems, such as water tanks, towers, wells, meters, or water filters). Municipalities may negotiate afair and reasonable water storage asset management ser-vice contract with firms th at submit the best proposals. Services provided under the contract may include financ-ing, designing, improving, op erating, maintaining, repair- ing, testing, inspecting, cleaning, administering, ormanaging the water storage asset. If a municipality chooses to contract for asset manage- ment services, the municipality: must publish advance notice of its requirements to procure asset management services; may negotiate with the fi rm that submits the best pro- posal based on criteria established by the municipal-ity; must terminate negotiations if the municipality is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract; and may select another firm to continue negotiations with until a contract is reached, or may terminate the selec- tion process. If the municipality chooses to negotiate a contract un- der these procurement procedures, no other statutory pro-curement requirements apply.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 2000 C 207 L 15 Authorizing the governor to enter into agreements with federally recognized Indian tribes in the state of Washing-ton concerning marijuana. By Representatives Hurst, Condotta and Tarleton. House Committee on Commerce & Gaming House Committee on FinanceSenate Committee on Commerce & LaborSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Tribal-State Compacts . Where authorized by statute, the Governor may enter into compacts andagreements with the Indian tribes of this state regarding matters of mutual interest or concern. Many such com- pacts have been implemented regarding gambling and var-ious taxation issues, includ ing those rega rding cigarette taxes and gasoline taxes. In 2001 legislation was enactedallowing the Governor to en ter into contracts with the tribes concerning the sale of cigarettes. Such contractsmust be for renewable terms of eight years or less. Ciga-rettes sold on Indian lands du ring the contracts' term are subject to a tribal cigarette tax and are exempt from statecigarette, sales, and use taxes. Regulation of Marijuana Commerce under the State Controlled Substances Act . Initiative Measure No. 502 (I- 502) was a ballot measure approved by Washington votersin November of 2012 that: (1) legalized the production, processing, possession, and personal use of marijuana; (2)created a framework for a regu latory scheme to be further developed by the Liquor Control Board (LCB) through itsrule-making authority; and (3) revised provisions in crim- inal statute to accommod ate such legalization. Under the CSA, the LCB may issue three categories of commercial marijuana licenses: (1) the marijuana produc- er's license entitles the holder to produce marijuana for sale at wholesale to licensed marijuana processors or other producers; (2) the marijuana processor's license entitles the holder to process, packag e, and label marijuana for sale at wholesale to marijuana retailers and other proces-sors; and (3) the marijuana retailer's license entitles theholder to sell marijuana products at retail prices in retailoutlets. Federal Response to Stat e Marijuana Legalization . In recent years, the United States Department of Justice(DOJ) has issued several polic y statements regarding state regulation of legalized marijuana. In August of 2013,Deputy Attorney General Jame s Cole issued a memoran- dum (Cole Memorandum) in response to the legalizationof marijuana in Washington and Colorado. This memo- randum acknowledges that enforcement of state law bystate and local enforcement agencies should remain theprimary means of addressing marijuana-related activity and indicates that federal au thorities will not interfere with state legalization efforts provided the state implementsstrong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems.The Cole memorandum establis hes the following eight en- forcement priorities that th e federal government will con- sider in evaluating the adequ acy of the regulatory systems implemented by states that have legalized marijuana: 1. preventing the distributio n of marijuana to minors; 2. preventing marijuana sales revenue from being di- rected to criminal enterprises; 3. preventing marijuana fro m being diverted from states where it is legal to states in which it is illegal; 4. preventing state-author ized marijuana activity from being used as a cover fo r trafficking other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 5. preventing violence and the use of firearms in the production and distribution of marijuana; 6. preventing drugged driving and other marijuana-re- lated public health consequences;House 97 0 Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred)HB 2007 127 7. preventing the growth of marijuana on public lands; and 8. preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. The Cole Memorandum also affirms the continuing authority of the federal government to challenge state reg-ulatory systems and to take enforcement actions wherestate enforcement efforts are inadequate. Marijuana Commerce in Indian Country . In October of 2014, another federal memorandum (Wilkinson Memo-randum) was issued regarding the legali zation of marijua- na by Indian tribes. Its subs tantive provisions are largely identical to the Cole Memora ndum, insofar as it indicates that federal authorities will not interfere with tribal legal- ization efforts provided the tribe implements strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems consistentwith federal law enforcement priorities. The Wilkinson Memorandum also acknowledge s that the tribes are sover- eign nations and thus directs the DOJ to consult with af-fected tribes on a government-to-government basis onmatters relating to the regulation of legalized marijuana. Summary: The Governor may enter into agreements with federally recognized Indian tribes concerning marijuana. Such agreements may address any marijuana-related issue that involves both state and tribal interests or otherwisehas an impact on tribal-state relations. Such agreements may include the following subject matter: criminal and civil law enforcement; regulatory issues related to the commercial produc- tion, processing, sale, an d possession of marijuana and processed marijuana products; medical and pharmaceutical research involving mari- juana; taxation; and dispute resolution, including the use of mediation or other nonjudicial process. Any marijuana agreement re lating to the production, processing, and sale of ma rijuana in Indian country, whether for recreational or medical purposes, must ad-dress the following issues: preservation of public health and safety; ensuring the security of production, processing, retail, and research facilities; and cross-border commerce in marijuana. The Governor may delegate the power to negotiate marijuana agreements to the L CB. In conducting such ne- gotiations, the LCB must, when necessary, consult withthe Governor or the Department of Revenue. Any tribal-state marijuana agreement must include a requirement that the tribe impo se a tribal marijuana tax in an amount that is at least 100 percent of state and local ex-cise, sales, and use taxes on sales of marijuana. However,tribal marijuana sales to the tr ibe, tribal entities, or tribal members are exempt from this taxation requirement to theextent such sales are exempt from such taxation under state and federal law. State licensed marijuana retailers may purchase and receive marijuana and processed marijuana products froma federally recognized Indian tr ibe as permitted by a tribal- state agreement. State licensed marijuana producers and processors may sell and distribute mariju ana and proces sed marijuana products to a federally recogn ized Indian tribe as permit- ted by a tribal-state agreement.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 HB 2007 C 147 L 15 Concerning reimbursement to eligible providers for med- icaid ground emergency medical transportation services. By Representatives Zeiger, Sullivan, Stambaugh, Van De Wege, Riccelli and Ormsby. House Committee on Appropriations Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Medicaid . Medicaid is a federal-state part- nership with programs establishe d in the federal Social Se- curity Act, and implemented at the state level with federal matching funds. Federal la w provides a framework for coverage of children, pregnant women, parents, elderlyand disabled adults, and othe r adults with varying income requirements. Medicaid includes coverage for emergencytransportation services. Supplemental Payments an d Certified Public Expen- diture Programs . In addition to re imbursement for Medic- aid services, states may make supplemental payments tocertain providers that are sepa rate from, and in addition to, reimbursements made at standa rd payment rates. Supple- mental payments are eligible for federal matching dollars if aggregate payments to th e providers receiving the sup- plemental payments are less than what Medicare wouldpay for the same services. Certified Public Expenditu re (CPE) programs allow public providers of medical services to certify their ex- penses as the non-federal share in order to receive Medic-aid matching dollars, which means that the state does nothave to contribute the matching share of these expendi-tures. These CPE programs can be combined with supple- mental payments to provide additional funding to public providers without incurring additional state costs. Managed Care . Managed care is a prepaid, compre- hensive system of medical and health care delivery, in-House 80 18 Senate House36 13 (Senate amended) (House refused to concur) Senate 46 0 (Senate amended)House 79 17 (House concurred)ESHB 2012 128cluding preventive, primary, specialty, and ancillary health services through a network of providers. Healthy Options(HO) is the Health Care Authority's (HCA) Medicaidmanaged care program for low-income people in Wash-ington. Healthy Options offers eligible clients a complete medical benefits package. Me dicaid clients that are not enrolled in managed care recei ve coverage directly from the HCA, which reimburses contracted providers on a fee-for-service basis. Intergovernmental Transfer Programs . Intergovern- mental transfers (IGT) are transfers of public dollars be-tween governmental entities. Localities and other public entities may transfer their own tax revenues to the state tohelp fund the state's Medicaid program. Summary: Certified Public Expenditure Program for Emergency Ground Transportation . The Health Care Au- thority (HCA) must provide supplemental payments for publicly provided Medicaid ground emergency medicaltransportation (GEMT) services to the extent allowed bylaw. The supplemental paym ents, combined with other sources of reimbursement from the HCA, may not exceedthe actual costs of pr oviding the services. The HCA must implement a certified public expendi- ture (CPE) program to support the supplemental pay-ments. Public GEMT provid ers receiving the payments must certify their expenses as the non-federal share of thesupplemental payments. The Legislature states its intentto provide the supplemental payments without any expen- diture from the State General Fund, and providers mustagree to reimburse the HCA for the costs of administeringthe CPE program. The HCA must seek federal approval for the CPE pro- gram and supplemental payments, and the HCA may notimplement those changes without federal approval. The CPE program and supplemental payments are in- operative if an appellate court or the federal Centers forMedicare and Medicaid Serv ices (CMS) makes a final de- termination that the suppleme ntal payments must be made to any providers other than public GEMT providers. Participating GEMT provid ers must provide evidence supporting their certifications and submit data specified by the HCA to determine the appr opriate amounts of federal matching dollars to claim. The providers must keep re- cords specified by the HCA to fully disclose reimburse-ment amounts to which they are entitled and any other records required by the CMS. Participation in the C PE program is voluntary. Intergovernmental Transfer Program for Emergency Ground Transportation . The HCA may design and imple- ment an intergovernmental tr ansfer (IGT) program to sup- port increased payments to managed care systems for public GEMT services. The public GEMT providers must provide the non-federal share for the increased payments. The managed care payments must be at least actuariallyequivalent to the supplemental payments provided underthe CPE program. Managed care systems must pay all of the increased payments to the participating EMT provid-ers. The HCA must only implement the IGT program if federal matching dollars are available and if the HCA has received the necessary federal approvals. The HCA mayreturn, refuse to accept, or adjust IGT payments as neces-sary to comply with federa l Medicaid requirements. The HCA must implement the IGT program on the date that federal approval is obtained, and it may be imple- mented retroactively to the ex tent allowed by federal law. If federal approval has been obtained, the HCA may start paying the increased managed care payments for dates ofservice on or after January 1, 2015. The HCA may not use State General Fund dollars to implement the IGT program. Participating GEMT provid-ers must agree to reimburs e the HCA for implementation costs. The IGT payments are also subject to a 20 percentadministration fee on the non -federal share paid to the HCA, which can count as a co st of providing the services. Managed care systems and participating public GEMT providers must comply with requests for informa- tion or data requirements imposed by the HCA for the pur-poses of claiming federal ma tching dollars or obtaining federal approvals. Participating in the IG T program is voluntary.

By House Committee on Transportation (originally spon- sored by Representatives Or cutt, Clibborn, Hargrove, Hayes, Pike, Zeiger, Muri and Wilson). House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) defines practical design as anapproach for project decisions that focuses on the need for the project and looks for cost-e ffective solutions. It engag- es local stakeholders at the earliest stages of definingscope to ensure their input is included at the beginning stage of project design. Practical design implementationis part of the WSDOT's curre nt agency-wide reforms plan. The WSDOT was directed to implement a practical designstrategy for transportation de sign standards and report by June 30, 2015, on where practical design has been appliedHouse 88 10 Senate 39 7SHB 2021 129or is intended to be applie d and the cost savings resulting from the use of practical design. Summary: The Washington State Department of Trans- portation (WSDOT) is encourag ed to continue to apply practical design in project delivery. In doing so, it is theexpectation of the Legislature that practical design will re-sult in reduced project costs. Significant changes to proj- ect title or scope due to practical design require legislativeapproval and the Legislature must utilize existing mecha-nisms and processes to ensure timely approval. Addition- ally, the WSDOT must notify the transportationcommittees of the Legislature prior to letting any contract with a title or scope change. The WSDOT must evaluate each Connecting Wash- ington project to determine sa vings attributable to practi- cal design. For design-bid-b uild projects and design-build projects when the project is at 30-percent design, the eval-uation occurs at the end of the design phase. The WSDOTmust report on the savings as part of its annual budget sub-mittal. The savings must be made available through the transportation future fundin g program for new Connecting Washington projects, accelerating the schedule of existingConnecting Washington projects, and preservation invest-ments in fiscal year 2024. Beginning in 2024, the WS- DOT may provide a list of highway improvement projectsor preservation investments fo r potential legislative ap- proval, so long as certain criteria are met. The Transportation Future Funding Program Account (Account) is created in the Connecting Washington Ac-count. Moneys in the Accoun t may only be spent after ap- propriation and may only be used for preservationprojects, to accelerate the schedule of existing Connecting Washington projects, for new Connecting Washingtonprojects, and for principal and interest on bonds authorized for the projects. The Account may not be appropriated un-til 2024 and moneys may not be expended on the SR 99 Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project. The Accountwill retain any in terest earnings.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the section directing the Secretary to send a copy of the fiscal impact statement to the proponent an d allowing for judicial re- view of the statement upon appeal by a dissatisfied party. VETO MESSAGE ON HB 2055 May 6, 2015 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, withou t my approval as to Section 3, House Bill No. 2055 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to statements on ballot measures in vot- ers' pamphlets.\" The intent of this bill is to provide voters with more information about the potential fiscal impact of a ballot initiative. The bill moves forward the deadline for the Attorney General to prepare the explanatory statement and th e Office of Financial Manage- ment to prepare the fiscal impact statement so that the information is available to the pro and con committees when drafting their statements for the voters pamphlet. In addition to moving forward the deadline for the Office of Fi- nancial Management to prepare th e fiscal impact statement, Sec- tion 3 also creates a new c ause of action for any persondissatisfied with the fiscal impact statement to challenge the state- ment in superior court. This ne w cause of action would frustrate the intent of this bill and cause unnecessary delay. It would also place the court in the untenable position of having to make advi- sory rulings on the initiative at issue in the fiscal impact statement.The Office of Financial Manage ment identifies the assumptions made in preparation of the fiscal impact stat ement. Under this new cause of action, the court would have to make a legal ruling on these assumptions, which would constitute an advisory opinion on the initiative. There are current legal options available to those who wish to challenge a fiscal impact statement without creating a new cause of action. For these reasons, I am vetoing section 3 of House Bill 2055. While I am vetoing Section 3, I am instructing the Office of Fi- nancial Management to work coop eratively with the Secretary of State to ensure any fiscal impact statement is completed in time to share with the pro and con committees before they complete their statements for the voters' pamphlet. This will ensure the intent of the legislation is fulfilled. For these reasons I have vetoed Section 3 of House Bill No. 2055. With the exception of Section 3, House Bill No. 2055 is ap- proved. Respectfully submitted, Jay Inslee Governor 2SHB 2063 C 162 L 15 Creating a work group to design a qualified achieving a better life experience program. By House Committee on Approp riations House Committee on Early Le arning & Human Services House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Health CareSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Achieving a Better Life Experience Act . The federal Achieving a Bette r Life Experience (ABLE) Act was enacted in December 2014. The law amended theInternal Revenue Code to exempt from taxation qualifiedABLE savings programs established by states. Individu-als can contribute to savings accounts for eligible people with disabilities. Individuals may invest up to $14,000 per year in ABLE accounts. Withdrawals from the account will notbe taxed provided that the m oney is spent on qualified ex- penses, such as housing, edu cation, transportation, health care, and rehabilitation. Th e complete description of qualified expenses and other parameters of these accountsare expected to become available in the summer or fall of2015 when the Secretary of the United States Treasury is-sues regulations. An individual generally cannot have more than $2,000 in savings or other assets for means-tested federal pro-House 97 1 Senate 45 1 (Senate amended)House 96 0 (House concurred) ESHB 2093 132grams such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). However, investments up to $100,000 in 529A ac-counts will be disregarded as assets for purposes of Med-icaid or SSI eligibility. Developmental Disab ilities Endowment Trust . The Washington Developmental Disabilities Endowment Trust (Endowment Trust) was established in 1999. This Endow-ment Trust is governed by a seven-person governingboard, six of whom are appointed by the Governor. TheDepartment of Commerce provides support to the govern-ing board when funds are appropriated for that purpose. The Endowment Trust is available to individuals un- der age 65 with a qualifying developmental disability orig- inating before age 18. An indi vidual must be eligible for services provided by the Developmental Disability Ad- ministration to be eligible for the Endowment Trust. Summary: The State Treasurer's Office must convene a work group to design an ABLE program by July 1, 2015.The work group must include representatives from the De-partment of Commerce, the State Investment Board, theWashington Advanced College Tuition Payment Program,the Department of Social and Health Services, the Devel- opmental Disability Endowm ent Governing Board, and the disability community. The ABLE design work group must provide a report to the Governor and the Legislature by November 1, 2015that includes the following: a recommendation of the appropriate lead agency for the ABLE program; an analysis of the appropriate investment instrumen- tality for ABLE account investments; an implementation plan for the ABLE program; and a recommendation regarding the composition and role of an ABLE advisory board. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESHB 2093 C 182 L 15 Concerning wildland fire suppression. By House Committee on Agricu lture & Natural Resources (originally sponsored by Representatives Kretz, Short,Blake, Buys and Condotta). House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Natu ral Resources & Parks Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Wildland Fire Suppression . There is a duty on landowners and on people engaged in activity on landwho have knowledge of a wildland fire to make every rea-sonable effort to suppress the w ildland fire. That duty ap- plies regardless of the origin or spread of the wildland fire.If a person does not suppress a wildland fire, the Depart-ment of Natural Resources (DNR) must summarily sup-press it. If a wildland fire occu rs in a land clearing, right- of-way clearing, or landowner operation, the wildland fire must be fought to the full lim it of available employees and equipment. Also, when in the state's best interest and for the pur- poses of forest firefighting and patrol, the DNR may coop-erate with any agency of anot her state, the United States or a federal agency, and or county, town, corporation, person,or native American tribe. Further, the DNR may contractand enter agreements with pr ivate corporations for the protection and development of the forest lands within thestate. Trespassing on Public or Private Land . A person may be liable to the state for damages and prosecuted criminal-ly for cutting, removing, or damaging timber from statelands, using or occupying state lands, removing any valu-able material from state lands, causing waste or damage tostate lands, or for related acts. Also, a person may be lia-ble criminally and civilly for trespassing on private land. Summary: Local Wildland Fire Liaison . The Commis- sioner of Public Lands (Commissioner) must appoint a lo-cal wildland fire liaison (Lia ison) who reports directly to the Commissioner or the De partment of Natural Re- source's (DNR) supervisor and generally represents the in-terests and concerns of landowners and the public duringfire suppression activities of the DNR. The Liaison is to provide advice to the Commi ssioner on issues like access to land during fire suppre ssion activities, the availability of local fire suppression asse ts, environmental concerns, and landowner interests. Th e Commissioner must consult with county legislative author ities while appointing the Li- aison. The Liaison must prepare a report to the Commission- er by December 31, 2015. The report must contain recom-mendations about things like opportunities for the DNR to increase training with local fi re protection districts, the ability to quickly evaluate the availability of local fire dis-trict resources to allow the local resources to be more effi-ciently and effectively dispatch ed to wildland fires, and ways to increase and maintain the viability of local fire suppression assets. The DNR then must submit a report tothe Legislature by October 31, 2016, that summarizes theLiaison's recommendations, explains the steps the DNRtook to implement the recommendations, and offers anal-yses of the results. The appointment of the Liai son and the preparation of the report are subject to the availability of amounts appro- priated for those specific purposes. Wildland Fire Advisory Committee . The Commis- sioner must appoint and maintain a Wild land Fire Adviso- ry Committee (Committee) to advise the Commissioner onall matters related to wildland firefighting in the state.House 89 8 Senate 46 2ESHB 2093 133This includes developing recommendations regarding the DNR's capital budget requests related to wildland fire- fighting and developing strategies to enhance the safe andeffective use of private and pu blic wildland firefighting re- sources. The Commissioner may appoint members as the Commissioner determines is mo st helpful. However, the Commissioner is required to invite at least the following people: two county commission ers\u2014one from east of the crest of the Cascade mountains and one from west of the crest of the Cascade mountains; two owners of industrial land\u2014one owner of timber- land and one owner of rangeland; the State Fire Marshal or a representative of the State Fire Marshal's Office; two individuals with th e title of fire chief\u2014one from a community located east of the crest of the Cascade mountains and one from a community located west ofthe crest of the Cascade mountains; one individual with th e title of fire commissioner; one small forest landowner; and one representative from e ach of the following: (1) a federal wildland firefighting agency; (2) a tribal nation; (3) a statewide environmental organization; and (4) a state land trust beneficiary. The Liaison serves as the ad ministrative chair for the Committee and the DNR must pr ovide staff support for all Committee meetings. The Committee meets at the call ofthe chair and each member serves without compensation. Members are immune from civil liability for official ac-tions. The appointment of th e Committee is subject to the availability of amounts approp riated for that specific pur- pose. Entering Public or Private Land to Suppress or Con- trol a Wildland Fire . Person Accessing Land. A person is authorized, although not requir ed, to enter public or pri- vate land in order to extingu ish or control a wildland fire when fighting the wildland fire in that particular time and location can be reasonably considered a public necessitydue to an imminent danger. No civil or criminal liability may be imposed by any court for any direct or proximateadverse impacts resulting from a person's access to land for the purposes of attempting to extinguish or control a wildland fire in that circ umstance, except upon proof of gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct by the person. In order for a person to lawfully access public or pri- vate land to suppress a wildla nd fire, all of the following conditions must exist: there is an active fire on or near the land; the person has a reasonab le belief that the local fire conditions are creating an emergency situation and that there is an imminent danger of a fire growing orspreading to or from the parcel of the land being entered; the person has a reasonable belief that preventive measures will extinguish or control the wildfire; the person has a reasonable belief that he or she is capable of taking preventive measures; the person only undertakes measures that are reason- able and necessary until pr ofessional wildfire sup- pression personnel arrives; the person does not continue to take suppression actions after specific direc tion to cease from the land- owner; the person follows the instructions of professional wildfire fighting personnel, including ceasing to engage in firefighting activ ities, when directed to do so by professional fire suppression personnel; and the person promptly notifies emergency personnel and the landowner, lessee, or occupant prior to enter- ing the land or within a reasonable time after the indi-vidual attempts to extinguish or control the wildlandfire. A person may not materially benefit or retain any valuable materials from access to the public or privateland. Any authority to enter pu blic or private land is lim- ited to the minimum necessar y activities reasonably re- quired to extinguish or co ntrol the wildland fire. Examples of activities that may be reasonable include us-ing hand tools to clear the ground of debris, operating readily available water hoses, clearing flammable materi-als from the vicinity of stru ctures, unlocking or opening gates to assist firefighter access, and safely scouting andreporting fire behavior. Activ ities that are prohibited in- clude lighting a fire in an atte mpt to stop the spread of an- other fire, using explosives as a firefighting technique,using aircraft for fire suppr ession, and directing other peo- ple to engage in firefighting. Landowner. No civil or criminal liability may be im- posed on the owner, lessee, or occupant of any land ac-cessed for purposes of fire suppression activities for anydirect or proximate adverse impacts resulting from the ac-cess to privately owned or publicly owned land, exceptupon proof of willful or wanton misconduct by the owner,lessee, or occupant. The barri er to liability includes im- pacts on: the person accessing the privately owned or pub-licly owned land and the person's personal property,including loss of life, any structures or land alterationsconstructed by individuals entering the privately owned orpublicly owned land, other landholdings, and overall envi-ronmental resources. However, the barrier to liability does not include an action against an owner, lessee, or occupantfor negligently permitting fire to spread. Department of Natural Resources' Master Contractor Lists . In order to maximize the effective utilization of lo- cal fire suppression assets, the DNR must: (1) compileEHB 2122 134and update, annually, master lists of qualified fire suppres- sion contractors who have valid incident qualifications forthe kind of contracted work to be performed, which, for contractors providing fire engi nes, tenders, crews, or sim- ilar resources, is a valid inci dent qualification card, com- monly called a Red Card, and for contractors providingother types of support is a DNR qualification and safetydocument, commonly called a Blue Card, and make thelists available to county legi slative authorities, emergency management departments, and lo cal fire districts; (2) co- operate with federal wildla nd firefighting agencies to maximize the efficient use of local resources in close prox-imity to wildland fire incide nts; (3) enter into preemptive agreements with landowners in possession of firefightingcapability that may be used in wildland fire suppression efforts, including bulldozers, fa llers, fuel tenders, potable water tenders, water sprayers, wash trailers, refrigeration units, and buses; and (4) reac h out to provide basic inci- dent command system and wild land fire safety training to landowners in possession of firefighting capability to help ensure that any wildland fire suppression actions privatelandowners take on their own land are accomplished safe-ly and in coordination with any related incident command structure. When entering into those types of preemptive agree- ments with landowners, the DNR must ensure that allequipment and personnel satisfy the DNR's standards andthat all contractors are under the supervision of recognizedwildland fire personnel while engaged in fire suppression activities. The DNR may not be held civilly liable for any adverse impacts resulting from training provided by the DNR or preemptive agreements entered into by the DNR except upon proof of gross ne gligence or willful or wanton misconduct. The compilation of the master lists of qualified fire suppression contractors and the related requirements aresubject to the availability of amounts appropriated for those specific purposes.

House Committee on Local Government House Committee on Finance Background: Real Estate Excise Tax - General Authori- zation for Counties and Cities . A county legislative au- thority may impose an excise tax on each sale of real property in the unincorporated areas of the county. Simi-larly, city and town (city) legislative authorities may im- pose an excise tax on each sale of real property within theircorporate limits. County and city real estate excise taxes(REET I) may not exceed a rate of 0.25 percent of the sell- ing price of property. However, in lieu of imposing a localsales and use tax, a county or city may impose an addition- al excise tax on each sale of real property within its juris- diction at a rate not to excee d 0.50 percent of the selling price. Proceeds from the REET I ma y be used for capital purposes, improvements, and projects. In counties and cit-ies with fewer than 5,000 resi dents, and counties and cities that do not fully plan unde r the Growth Management Act (GMA), the proceeds may be used for any capital purposeidentified in a capital improvem ents plan and local capital improvements. In counties with more than 5,000 resi-dents, and cities with more th an 5,000 residents that fully plan under the GMA, the proceeds may be used: (a) to fi-nance capital projects specified in a capital facilities plan;(b) for housing relocation assistance for low income ten-ants; (c) for qualifying debt retirement; and (d) for projects to which revenue was committe d prior to April 30, 1992.

Until December 31, 2016, counties and cities may also use a portion of REET I proceeds for the operation andmaintenance of existing REET I capital projects. Under this temporary authority, counties and cities may use theHouse 97 0 Senate 48 0 (Senate amended)House 98 0 (House concurred)EHB 2122 135greater of either $100,000 or 35 percent of available funds collected under REET I, not to exceed $1 million per year. Real Estate Excise Tax - Ad ditional Authorization for Fully Planning Counties and Cities . Counties and cities that are required to plan under the GMA may impose anadditional real estate excise tax (REET II) on each sale ofreal property within their jurisdictions. The issue ofwhether to impose the REET II must first be approved by voters at a general or special election. The REET II maynot exceed a rate of 0.25 pe rcent of the selling price of property. Counties and cities may use revenue collected from the REET II for: (a) financing capital projects specified inthe capital facilities element of a comprehensive plan; (b) qualifying debt retirement; or (c) projects to which reve-nue was committed prior to Ma rch 1, 1992. For purposes of using REET II proceeds, \"capital project\" (REET IIcapital projects) means public works projects of a local government for planning, acquisition, construction, recon-struction, repair, replacemen t, rehabilitation, or improve- ment of certain types of facilities and infrastructure, including: streets, roads, hi ghways, and sidewalks; street and road lighting systems; and storm and sanita ry sewer systems. Until December 31, 2016, counties and cities may also use a portion of REET II proceeds for the operation andmaintenance of existing REET II capital projects. Underthis temporary authority, counties and cities may use thegreater of either $100,000 or 35 percent of available fundscollected under REET II, not to exceed $1 million per year.

This directive is ful-filled through a contract with the Municipal Research and Services Center (MRSC), a nonprofit organization thatprovides policy, financial, and legal research and support services in accordance with the terms of the contract. TheMRSC maintains a website wh ere publications, reports, and materials associated with municipal research and ser-vices are posted. Summary: Real Estate Excise Tax - New Authorized Uses of Revenue . Counties and cities that impose the REET I may use the greater of $100,000 or 25 percent of available funds, not to ex ceed $1 million per year, fromREET I revenues for maintenance of REET I capital proj- ects. In addition, counties an d cities that impose the REET II may use the greater of $100,000 or 25 percent of avail-able funds, not to exceed $1 million per year, from REET II revenues: for maintenance of R EET II capital projects; and for planning, acquisition, construction, reconstruc- tion, repair, replacement, rehabilitation, improve- ment, and maintenance of some REET I capitalprojects ( i.e., only projects included within the defini- tion of REET I capital projects that are not also included within the definition of REET II capitalprojects) Similar REET authority that expires on December 31, 2016, is not affected. \"Maintenance\" means the us e of funds for labor and materials that will preserve, pr event the decline of, or ex- tend the useful life of a capital project. \"Maintenance\"does not include labor or mate rial costs for routine opera- tions of a capital project. Prior to exercising this authority, counties and cities must first meet certain criteria.

By House Committee on Gene ral Government & Informa- tion Technology (originally sponsored by RepresentativeHudgins; by request of De partment of Agriculture). House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Background: The Washington State Department of Agri- culture (WSDA) Food Safety Program regulates Washing-ton's food supply by inspecting food processing andstorage facilities and their pr actices, managing several food processing licenses, providing technical assistance,and investigating consumer complaints and food-related emergencies. The WSDA collects approximately 150 different fees that support WSDA activities, including the Food Safety Program. In a budget proviso in the 2013-15 State Omni-bus Appropriation Act, the Legislature directed theWSDA to convene a work group with appropriate stake-holders to review fees supporting WSDA programs thatalso receive State General Fund support. The resulting work group released a report in November 2013 that madea number of fee-specific recommendations, all of them inthe Food Safety Program. Summary: The following WSDA fees are changed: The milk processing plant license fee is raised from $55 to $250 per year. The dairy technician's in itial license fee is raised from $10 to $25, and the renewa l fee is raised from $5 to $25 each odd-numbered year. The sanitary certificate fees for milk processing plants and food processors are raised from $50 to $75 per certificate. The range for food processing plant license fees, which are based on gross annu al sales, is raised from a minimum of $55 and a maximum of $825 per year to a minimum of $92 and a maximum of $862 peryear. The food storage warehouse fee is raised from $50 to $200 per year. The following WSDA fees are created: The fee for any endorsem ent, in addition to a dairy technician's license, is $25.

Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 2E2SHB 2136 C 4 L 15 E 2 Concerning comprehensive marijuana market reforms to ensure a well-regulated and taxed marijuana market in Washington state. By House Committee on Approp riations (originally spon- sored by Representative Carlyle). House Committee on Finance House Committee on AppropriationsSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Overview of Initiative 502 . Initiative 502 (I-502) was a ballot measure a pproved by Washington vot- ers in November 2012 that: (1) legalized the production, processing, possession and personal use of marijuana; (2)created a framework for a regu latory scheme to be further developed by the Liquor and Cannabis Board (LCB)through its rule-making author ity; and (3) revised criminal laws to accom modate such legalization. Initiative 502 contained the following provisions: legalizing the personal us e and possession of up to 1 ounce of marijuana, as well as specified productsdirectly related to such marijuana use; licensing and regulating marijuana production, distri- bution, and retailing; designating the LCB as the regulatory entity responsi- ble for the implementation of the initiative, including continuing oversight over the commercial practices and conduct of licensed marijuana producers, proces- sors, and retailers; providing the LCB with rule-making authority with respect to the development of the requisite regulatory scheme; implementing excise ta xes on marijuana production, processing, and retailing; creating a dedicated mar ijuana fund for the collection and distribution of mariju ana- related tax revenues; removing provisions containing criminal or civil pen- alties for marijuana-related activities authorized by I- 502; andSenate 40 4 House 63 35 Senate 35 82E2SHB 2136 137 amending driving under the influence laws to include specific provisions pertaining to driving under the influence of marijuana. Federal Response to Mar ijuana Legalization by the States . Washington is one of at least 23 states that have passed legislation allowing the use of marijuana for me-dicinal purposes and one of four states that allow its recre-ational use. These activities, however, remain illegalunder federal law. In August of 2013, the United States Department of Justice issued a formal en forcement policy memorandum in response to the legalization of recreational marijuana in the states of Washington and Colorado. In this memoran-dum, federal prosecutors were instructed to focus investi- gative and prosecutorial reso urces related to marijuana on specific enforcement priorities to prevent: the distribution of marijuana to minors; marijuana sales revenue from being directed to crimi- nal enterprises; marijuana from being diverted from states where it is legal to states where it is illegal; state-authorized mariju ana activity from being used as a cover for trafficking other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; violence and the use of firearms in the production and distribution of marijuana; drugged driving and ot her marijuana-related public health consequences; the growth of marijuana on public lands; and marijuana possession or use on federal property. With respect to state laws that authorize marijuana production, distribution, and sales, the memorandumstates that when these activ ities are conducted in compli- ance with strong and effectiv e regulatory and enforcement systems there is a reduced threat to federal priorities. Insuch instances, the memorandum asserts that state and lo-cal law enforcement should be the primary means of reg- ulation. The memorandum, however, affirms continuingfederal authority to challenge state regulatory systems and to bring individual enforcemen t actions in cases in which state regulatory efforts are inadequate. Licensing of Marijuana Pr oducers, Processors, and Retailers . The LCB issues three categories of commercial marijuana licenses: (1) the marijuana producer's licenseentitles the holder to produce marijuana for sale at whole- sale to licensed marijuana pro cessors or other producers; (2) the marijuana processor' s license entitles the holder to process, package, and label marijuana for sale at whole- sale to marijuana retailers and other processors; and (3) the marijuana retailer's license entitles the holder to sell mari-juana products at retail prices in retail outlets. Marijuana Research License . In addition to the mari- juana producer, processor, and retail licenses, there is amarijuana research license allowing holders to produce,process, possess, and deliver marijuana for the purposes of: testing chemical potency and composition; conducting clinical inv estigations of marijuana- derived drug products; conducting research on the efficacy and safety of marijuana use as medical treatment; and conducting genomic and agricultural research. The University of Washington and Washington State University may also conduct marijuana research. The LifeSciences Discovery Fund Authority (LSDF Authority) isrequired to review all applic ations for marijuana research licenses. A portion of license fees go into the Life Scienc-es Discovery Fund (LSDF). Residency Requirements for Marijuana Business Li- cense Applicants . In order to apply for a marijuana pro- ducer, processor, or retailer license, a prospective licenseemust establish state residency at least three months prior tothe submission of the application. Transport and Delivery of Marijuana by Third-Party Carriers . Transportation or delivery of marijuana and pro- cessed marijuana products may be done only by the em-ployees of a licensed producer, processor, or retailer.Other transportation or trucking services may not be usedfor this purpose. Taxation of Marijuana Producers, Processors, and Re- tailers . An excise tax of 25 percent of the sale price must be paid by each of the three categories of licensees at eachstep of the production, pro cessing, and marketing process: producers pay a tax of 25 percent of the wholesale price of the marijuana sold to processors or to other producers; processors pay a tax of 25 percent of the wholesale price of the useable mariju ana or marijuana-infused products sold to retailers or to other processors; and retailers pay a tax of 25 percent of the retail price of the useable marijuana or marijuana-infused productssold to the consumer. There are no provisions ex plicitly addressing the tax- ation of retail sales of medical cannabis by collective gar-dens or medical cannabis dispensaries. Sales and Use Tax . Retail sales taxes are imposed on retail sales of most articles of tangible personal property,digital products, and some services. A retail sale is a saleto the final consumer or end user of the property, digitalproduct, or service. If retail sales taxes were not collectedwhen the user acquired the property, digital products, orservices, then use taxes apply to the value of property, dig- ital product, or service, when u sed in this state. The state, most cities, and all counties levy retail sales and use taxes.The state sales and use tax rate is 6.5 percent; local salesand use tax rates vary from 0.5 percent to 3.1 percent, de-pending on the location. Dedicated Marijuana Fund . Initiative 502 created a Dedicated Marijuana Fund, deposited with the State Trea-2E2SHB 2136 138surer that consists of moneys derived from marijuana ex- cise taxes, license fees, penalti es, forfeitures, and all other moneys, income, or revenue received by the LCB frommarijuana-related activities. Proceeds from the fund must be distributed every three months by the LCB to specified public entities and in amounts established in statute. Among the distributions is $5 million annually for the LC B to administer the legal marijuana system. Allowable Uses by the Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery . The Department of Social and Health Ser- vices' Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery(DBHR) may use marijuana revenues for specific pro-grams, specifically for implementation and maintenanceof programs aimed at prevention or reduction of maladap-tive substance use, substance abuse, or substance depen-dence for middle school and high school students. Life Sciences Discovery Fund . The LSDF was creat- ed to promote life science research in Washington. TheLSDF may receive tobacco settlement strategic contribu-tion payments and leverage these state contribution pay-ments by providing grant opportunities to support lifesciences research and development. The LSDF is managed by the LSDF Authority, gov- erned by a board consisting of legislators and persons ap-pointed by the Governor. The LSDF Authority solicits and reviews grant applications. Marijuana Retailer Signage and Product Display Re- quirements . Marijuana retailers may not display any sig- nage except for one sign, no more than 1,600 square inches, identifying the business by its name. Retailers alsomust ensure that no marijuan a products are visible from a public right-of-way. Marijuana Product Advertising Limitations . Marijua- na retailers are subject to sp ecified restrictions regarding the advertising of marijuan a and marijuana-based prod- ucts. Included in these regula tions is a blanket prohibition barring any advertising: within 1,000 feet of school grounds, playgrounds, recreation centers, child care centers, public parks, libraries, or specified types of game arcades; on or in a public transit vehicle or public transit shel- ter; or on publicly owned property. A licensee who violates any of these advertising pro- hibitions is subject to a $1, 000 fine for each violation. Buffer Distances Around Marijuana Businesses . The LCB may not issue a license to any prospective producer,processor, or retailer who se business premises are located within 1,000 feet of the perimeter of the grounds: an elementary or secondary school; a playground; a recreation center or facility; a child care center; a public park; a public transit center; a library; or any game arcade, admission to which is not restricted to persons 21 years of age or older. Federal law imposes additiona l penalties on the distri- bution of controlled substances within 1,000 feet of an el-ementary or secondary schoo l, college, playground, or public housing facility. The same federal penalties are im-posed for distribution within 100 feet of a youth center,swimming pool, or video arcade. Medical Marijuana Cooperatives . Effective July 1, 2016, four-member medical ma rijuana cooperatives are permitted. Up to four patien ts or designated providers may participate in a cooperativ e to share responsibility for the production and processing of marijuana for the medi-cal use of its members. Th e location of the cooperative must be registered with the LCB and is only permitted if itis at least one mile away fro m a marijuana retailer. The registration must include each member's name and copiesof each member's recognition cards. Only registeredmembers may participate in th e cooperative or obtain mar- ijuana from the cooperative. If a member leaves the coop-erative, no new member may join for 60 days after theLCB has been notified of the change in membership. All members of the cooperative mu st provide labor; financial compensation is not permitted. Marijuana grown at a co- operative is only for the medical use of its members andmay not be sold or donated to another. Minors may not participate in coop eratives. The LCB must develop a seed to sale traceability system to track all marijuana grown by the cooperative. Public Use of Marijuana . It is unlawful to consume or open a package containing marijuana or marijuana prod-ucts in view of the general public. Regulation of Marijuana Businesses by Local Govern- ments . Many cities and counties throughout the state have enacted ordinances that proh ibit the siting of licensed mar- ijuana producers, processors, and retailers within theirborders. Approximately 105 cities and 11 counties inWashington have enacted such a prohibition or moratori- um. Other cities and counties have enacted special zoningordinances limiting the location of recreational marijuana businesses to certain areas or have proposed special li-censing requirements. These actions by Washington cities and counties have given rise to litigation regardin g whether or not local gov- ernments are preempted fro m enacting local ordinances that have the effect of preventing or interfering with thesiting of state-licensed marijuana businesses authorizedunder I-502. Courts in Clark County, the City of Fife, theCity of Wenatchee, and elsewhere have ruled that state lawdoes not preempt such actio ns by local governments. In January 2014, the Washington State Attorney Generalpublished a formal opinion stating that state law does notpreempt local ordinances that impose bans or moratoriaregarding the siting of mar ijuana producers, processors, and 139Mandatory Minimum Sentence for Misdemeanor Vio- lations . Any person convicted of a misdemeanor violation of the Controlled Substances Act must receive a minimum24-hour prison sentence and a fine of at least $250 or $500for a second violation. The sentence and fine may be de-ferred or suspended in certain circumstances. Synthetic Cannabinoids and Bath Salts: Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act . e hallucinations, agitation, and serious cardiac symptoms. Cathinone derivatives are commonly known as \"bath salts.\" Synthetic cannabinoids are drugs that target the same brain receptors that interact with the tetrahydrocannabinol present in marijuana that produces a psychoactive effect.Synthetic cannabinoids are often called \"spice\" or \"K2,\"after popular brands of the substances. The Pharmacy Quality As surance Commission ad- dresses the evolving chemis try of illegal controlled sub- stances by classifying or reclassifying new compoundsunder its rule-making authority. Cathinones and methcathinones are listed on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, meaning they have noaccepted medical value, have a high potential for abuse,and lack accepted safety for use in medical treatment un-der supervision. The manufacture, delivery, or possession of a Sched- ule I controlled substance is a class B felony, punishable by either up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $20,000,or both, plus an additional $1,000 fine. Summary: Intent and Tax Preference Performance State- ment . The Legislature declares that its intent and a tax preference performance statemen t is included for the au- thorized sales and use tax ex emption for qualified patients. The Department of Revenue (DOR) must provide a specif-ic tax reporting line for mariju ana retailers to include the amount of exempt sales on their tax return. Marijuana Research Licensees . One half of the issu- ance fee for each marijuana research license is directed tothe LSDF. The University of Washington and Washington State University may contract with entities licensed by a federally recognized Indian tr ibe to conduct marijuana re- search without approval by the LSDF Authority. Residency Requirement for Marijuana Business Li- cense Applicants . The duration of the residency require- ment for a marijuana bu siness license applicant is increased from three months to six months. Transport and Delivery of Marijuana by Third Party Carriers . A licensed marijuana producer, processor, re- searcher, or retailer may use the services of a common car-rier to physically transport or deliver marijuana andmarijuana products between licensed entities within the state. The common carrier must be licensed by the LCB and may only transport mar ijuana between other licensed marijuana businesses. Empl oyees of a licensed commoncarrier who are involved in th e transportation of marijuana or marijuana products must be at least 21 years old. An employee of a common carrier may not use or car- ry a firearm while transp orting marijuana, unless: the LCB explicitly authorizes the carrying or use of firearms by the employee; the employee has a private security guard license; and the employee is othe rwise in full compliance with LCB regulations. The LCB must establish ru les creating an annual li- censing procedure for a common carrier who seeking tooffer marijuana transportation services. The rules must: establish criteria for the approval or denial of a license application; provide minimum qualifications for any employee authorized to drive or op erate the transportation or delivery vehicle; address the safety of the employees transporting or delivering the products, in cluding issues relating to the carrying of firearms by the employees; address the security of the products being transported, including a system of electr onically tracking all prod- ucts at both the point of pi ckup and the point of deliv- ery; and set reasonable fees for the application and licensing process. Taxation of Marijuana Producers, Processors, and Re- tailers . The 25 percent marijuana excise taxes payable by marijuana producers and processors, respectively, areeliminated. The 25 percent marijuana excise tax on retail-ers is modified by specifica lly imposing the tax on the buyer of any marijuana product subject to the excise tax.The rate is changed to 37 pe rcent and applies to the final retail price of marijuana products subject to the tax. Thisretail marijuana excise tax is d esignated as a trust fund tax. Trust fund taxes are those taxes collected from the buyerand held in trust by the seller until remitted to the stateagency that administers the tax. This tax is in addition to st ate retail sales and use tax and must be separately itemized on the sales receipt pro-vided to consumers. The displayed shelf price must illus-trate the final price to the consumer, including themarijuana excise tax, but need not include the general re- tail sales tax. The LCB may collect and administer the marijuana excise tax. Licensees who have been issued a notice of un-paid marijuana excise taxes may request an adjudicative proceeding. A sales and use tax exemption for qualifying patients is allowed for patients with a medical cannabis authoriza- tion card. Designated providers of qualifying patients arealso exempt from retail sales tax when purchasing for aqualifying patient.2E2SHB 2136 140Bundled Transactions and Conditional Sales . Mari- juana producers and processors may not require the pur-chase of non-marijuan a products or services as a condition precedent to the purchase of marijuana or marijuana products. Licensed marijuana retailers must collect the marijua- na excise tax on the entire sales price of bundled transac-tions, unless the retailer maintains records that may beused to determine the true va lue of the marijuana product sold in the bundled transaction. Dedicated Marijuana Account . The Dedicated Mari- juana Fund is renamed the Dedicated Marijuana Account.Monies in the Dedicated Marijuana Account must be ap-propriated before the distributions may be made. Distribution of Marijuana Excise Tax Revenue . A portion of marijuana excise tax revenues deposited into the State General Fund is shared with counties and cities.Starting no earlier than fiscal year 2018, distributions tolocal jurisdictions may not oc cur until $25 million of mar- ijuana tax revenues has been deposited into the State Gen- eral Fund, at which point 30 percent of the previous fiscal year's marijuana-related Stat e General Fund revenues will be distributed to eligible coun ties and cities in four install- ments. Thirty percent of the local distribution must be dis-bursed to counties, cities, and towns based on the amount of marijuana excise tax revenues attributable to licensedmarijuana retailers located with in a county, city, or town. The remaining 70 percent must be disbursed based on pop-ulation, with counties receivin g 60 percent of this alloca- tion and cities and towns sharin g the remaining 40 percent. Local jurisdiction distributio ns may not exceed $15 mil- lion per fiscal year for the 2017-2019 biennium and $20million per fiscal year thereafter. Subject to appropriation, at least $6 million must be appropriated per fiscal year for fiscal years 2016 and 2017to local governments for ma rijuana enforcement. The monies must be distributed un der a formula based on retail sales within local jurisdictio ns. If the $12 million is not appropriated in the operatin g budget, this requirement is null and void and local gove rnments will not receive the additional funding. Allowable Uses by the Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery . The types of programs that the DBHR may support using the revenue distributed under I-502 are ex-panded to include the develo pment and evaluation of pro- grams and practices aimed at prevention or reduction ofmaladaptive substance use am ong middle and high school students. The DBHR may also use marijuana tax funds forevidence-based or research -based programs and requires that these programs be deemed cost-beneficial by Septem-ber 1, 2020. Marijuana Retailer Signage and Product Display Re- quirements . Marijuana retailers may only display two signs for purposes of identifyi ng the business. Signs must be permanently attached to a building and must be no larg- er than 1,600 square inches. No sign may be posted within1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school or a play- ground. Marijuana retailers are no longer required to en-sure that product in the store is not visible from a publicright-of-way. Signage Requirements for Prospective Licensees . Applicants for a marijuana producer, processor, research-er, or retailer license must conspicuously display a sign onthe outside of the premises to be licensed notifying the public of the application. Th e LCB must adopt rules to im- plement siting requirements for the size of the sign and the text thereon, the content of the sign, and any other require- ments necessary to ensure that the sign provides adequatenotice to the public. The LCB must provide the sign to the applicant, but may charge a fee. A local jurisdiction may require additional notice by an applicant to any of the following entities located within1,000 feet of the premises to be licensed: elementary and secondary schools; playgrounds; public parks; care centers; churches; libraries; public transit centers; and game arcades admitting persons under 21 years old. Buffer Distances Around Marijuana Businesses . The legislative authority of a coun ty, city, or town may reduce the buffer requirements for licensed marijuana businesses from 1,000 feet to 100 feet from recreation centers, childcare centers, public parks, pu blic transit centers, libraries, and certain game arcades (the 1,000-foot buffer require-ment for schools and playgrounds is maintained). In orderto reduce the buffer requirem ent, a county, city, or town must pass an ordinance decl aring that the reduction will not negatively impact the ju risdiction's law enforcement efforts, public safety, or pu blic health. The LCB may li- cense businesses located in compliance with such an ordi-nance. Location of Medical Marijuana Cooperatives . Medi- cal marijuana cooperatives may not be located within one mile of a licensed marijuana re tailer or within 1,000 feet of a school, playground, public transit center, recreation cen-ter, child care center, public park, library, or certain game arcades. If the cooperative is located in a city, county, or town that has enacte d a smaller buffer zone for marijuana retailers, the cooperative may be located in areas not re- stricted by the ordinance. Public Use of Marijuana . Consuming marijuana or marijuana products, or opening a package containing mar-ijuana or marijuana products, in a public place or in viewof the general public is proh ibited. \"Public place\" in- cludes, among other locations , streets, school facilities, public buildings, restaurants, public parks, and other areasto which the public has an unrestricted right of access.

However, if the person receiving the drug is a minor under 18 years old and atleast two years younger than the person violating the law,the minimum fine is increased to $25,000. Courts may notsuspend or defer the fine unless the violator is indigent. Changes to Marijuana-Relate d Definitions in the Con- trolled Substances Act . The term \"marijuana concen- trates\" in the Controlled Substances Act is redefined toinclude all concentrates having a tetrahydrocannabinol(THC) concentration greater than 10 percent. The definition of \"marijuana- infused products\" in the Controlled Substances Act is revised to reduce the maxi-mum allowable THC concentration in the products from60 percent to 10 percent. Cannabis-Based Beauty Aids .

By Representatives Kagi, Orwall, Committee on Early Le arning & Human Services Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Background: Dependency Court System . The Depart- ment of Social and Health Services (DSHS) may file a pe-tition in court alleging that a child should be a dependent of the state due to abuse or neglect or because there is no parent, guardian, or custodian capable of adequately car-ing for the child. If a court determines that a child is dependent, the court will conduct periodic reviews and make determina-tions regarding the child's pl acement, the provision of ser- vices by the DSHS, compliance of the parents, andwhether progress has been made by the parents. Under certain circumstances af ter a child has been re- moved from the custody of a parent for at least six monthspursuant to a finding of dependency, a petition may befiled seeking termination of parental rights. Adoption and Safe Families Act . The federal Adop- tion and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 requires childwelfare agencies to file a petition seeking termination of parental rights if a child has been in out-of-home care for 15 of the most recent 22 months, unless the court makes agood cause exception as to wh y the filing of a termination petition is not appropriate. Good Cause Exceptions Not to File a Termination Pe- tition . In Washington, good cause exceptions not to file a termination petition when a child has been in out-of-home care for 15 out of the last 22 months include the following: The child is cared for by a relative.House 67 28 House 70 25 House 59 38 Senate 36 72EHB 2151 142 The DSHS has not provided services that the court and the DSHS have deemed necessary for the child to safely return home. The DSHS has documented in the case plan a com- pelling reason why filing a termination petition would not be in the child's best interests. The parent is incarcerated or the parent's prior incar- ceration is a significant factor in why the child has been in out-of-home care, the parent maintains a meaningful role in the child 's life, and the DSHS has not documented another reas on to file a termination petition. The parent has been accepted into a dependency treat- ment court program or long-term substance abuse program and is demonstra ting compliance with treat- ment goals until June 30, 2015. The parent files a declaration stating the parent's financial inability to pay for court-ordered services and that the DSHS was unw illing or unable to pay for the same services necessary for the child to safelyreturn home until June 30, 2015. Summary: The expiration date of June 30, 2015 is re- moved for the following good cause exceptions for the court not to order the DSHS to file a petition seeking the termination of parental rights if a child has been in out-of- home care for 15 of the last 22 months since the date thedependency petition was filed: where a parent has been accepted into a dependency treatment court program or long-term substance abuse or dual diagnoses treatment program and isdemonstrating compliance with treatment goals; and where a parent who has been court ordered to com- plete services necessary for the child's safe returnhome files a declaration under penalty of perjury stat- ing the parent's financial inability to pay for the ser- vices and that the DSHS wa s unwilling or unable to pay for those services. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: June 30, 2015 2EHB 2151 C 5 L 15 E 2 Extending the hospital safety net assessment. By Representatives Jinkin s, Schmick and Bergquist. House Committee on Appropriations Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Medicaid Provider Charges . Provider charges, such as assessments, fees, or taxes, have beenused by some states to help fund the costs of the Medicaid program. Under federal rules, this would include anymandatory payment where at least 85 percent of the bur-den falls on health care providers. States collect fundsfrom providers and pay them back as Medicaid payments,and states can claim the federal matching share of thosepayments. To conform to federal laws, assessments, fees, and taxes must be generally redistributive in nature and nohospitals can be held harml ess from the burden of the as- sessments, fees, or taxes. The charges must be broad-based and uniform, which mean s they must be imposed on all providers in a given class and the same rate must applyacross providers. If a charge is not broad-based and uni-form it must meet statistical tests that demonstrate that the amount of the charge is not directly correlated to Medicaid payments. Additionally, Medica id payments for these ser- vices cannot exceed Medicare reimbursement levels. Hospital Payment Methods . The Health Care Author- ity (HCA) manages the Hospital Safety Net Assessment(HSNA) program. An assessment on non-Medicare inpa-tient days is imposed on most hospitals, and proceeds fromthe assessment are deposited into the HSNA Fund (Fund). The Federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) program. The pro-gram allows more flexibility in staffing and simplifiedbilling methods, and it creates incentives to integrate health delivery systems. Washington currently has 38 hos-pitals certified as CAHs. Pa yments to CAHs under Wash- ington's medical assistance programs are based onallowable costs. Larger urban private hospitals are reimbursed under the Prospective Payment Syst em (PPS) for inpatient ser- vices and the Outpatient PPS for outpatient services. The Certified Public Expenditures (CPE) program is a payment methodology that app lies to public hospitals, in- cluding government owned and operated hospitals that arenot CAHs or state psychiatric hospitals. The CPE pro-gram's payment method appli es to inpatient claims and Disproportionate Share Hosp ital (DSH) payments. The CPE program allows public ho spitals to certify their ex- penses as the state share in order to receive federal match-ing Medicaid funds, which means that the state does notneed to contribute the matching share of these expendi-tures. Assessments . The hospital assessments are based on the number of non-Medicare inpatient days. The amountof the assessment varies by hosp ital type and is reduced if a PPS hospital has more than 54,000 patient days per year.If required to obtain federal ma tching funds, that threshold may be adjusted to comply with federal requirements. The assessments range from $7 to $344 depending on the type of hospital and number of patient days. The HCAcalculates the amounts due annually and collects the as-sessments on a quarterly basis. If sufficient other funds are available to make the in- creased payments, the HCA will reduce the amounts of theHouse 98 0 Senate 49 0 (Senate amended)House 97 0 (House concurred)2EHB 2151 143assessments to the minimum levels necessary to support those payments. Any actual or estimated surplus in the Fund at the end of a fiscal year (FY) must be applied to re- duce the assessment amounts in the following FY . Hospital Payments . Moneys in the Fund may be used for various increases in hosp ital payments, including grants to CPE hospitals; fee -for-service supplemental pay- ments to PPS, psychiatric, an d rehabilitation hospitals; and increased managed care payment rates. Grants to CPE Hospitals . Public CPE hospitals re- ceive grants from the Fund. Starting in FY 2016, thegrants from the Fund will be reduced in equal increments to zero by the end of FY 20 19. The initial allocations in FY 2014 and FY 2015 include the following: The University of Washington Medical Center receives $3.3 million. Harborview Medical Center receives $7.6 million. Other CPE hospitals receive $4.7 million divided between the individual hosp itals based on total Med- icaid payments. Fee-for-Service . The HCA provides supplemental payments from the Fund to PP S, psychiatric, rehabilita- tion, and border hospitals b ased on prior fee-for-service utilization of inpatient and ou tpatient services. Starting in FY 2016, the supplemental payments are reduced in equalincrements from FY 2016 to zero in FY 2019. These pay-ments also include additional fe deral matching funds. The initial allocations in FY 2014 and FY 20 15 include the fol- lowing: The PPS hospitals receive $28,125,000 for inpatient payments and $24,550,000 for outpatient payments. Psychiatric hospitals r eceive $625,000 for inpatient payments. Rehabilitation hospitals receive $150,0 00 for inpa- tient payments. Border hospitals receive inpatient and $250,000 for outpatient payments.Managed Care. The HCA uses moneys from the Fund to increase capitation payments to managed care organiza-tions by an amount at least equal to the amount available in the Fund after deducting disbursements for other speci-fied purposes. The amount must be no less than$153,131,600 in FY 2014 and FY 2015, decreasing inequal increments to zero in FY 2019, along with the max-imum available amount of federal funds. Payments to in-dividual managed care organizations are divided based onanticipated enrollment, utilization, or other factors that arereasonable and appropriate. The HCA requires managedcare organizations to spend th ese dollars for hospital ser- vices within 30 days after receipt. In FYs 2015, 2016, and2017, the HCA will use any additional federal matching funds available for the incr eased managed care payments resulting from the Medicaid ex pansion under the federal Affordable Care Act to su bstitute for assessment dollars that otherwise would be used for the increased capitationpayments. If total payments to managed care organiza- tions exceed what is permitted under Medicaid laws andregulations, payments will be reduced to levels that meet the requirements and the balance of assessment funds re-maining will be used to reduce future assessments. Rural Hospitals. Rural CAHs receive $1.9 million in FY 2014 and FY 2015 from the Fund plus federal match-ing funds in DSH payments, reduced in equal increments to zero in FY 2019. Critical Access Hospitals that are notDSH eligible receive $520,000 in FY 2014 and FY 2015,reduced in equal increments to zero in FY 2019, that is di- vided between the individual hospitals based on totalMedicaid payments. The HCA uses any remain ing surplus assessment dol- lars to proportionately redu ce future assessments on PPS hospitals. The sum of $199.8 million in the 2013-15 biennium may be expended from the Fund in lieu of State GeneralFund payments to hospitals. An additional sum of $1 mil- lion per biennium may be disbursed from the Fund forpayment of administrative expenses incurred by the HCArelated to the assessment program. Phase-Down and Expiration . The HSNA expires on July 1, 2017. The assessmen ts and payments phase down in equal increments over a four-year period starting in FY2016 until the amounts are zer o by the end of FY 2019. Summary: Phase-Down and Expiration . The expiration of the HSNA program is extended from July 1, 2017, toJuly 1, 2019. The assessments and payments no longer phase down to zero by the end of FY 2019. Assessments . The amounts of annual assessments per non-Medicare bed day paid by hospitals are revised to thefollowing amounts: Prospective Payment System hospitals must pay no more than $350 instead of $344. Psychiatric hospitals must pay no more than $70 instead of $67. Rehabilitation hospitals must pay no more than $70 instead of $67. Other assessment amounts remain unchanged. Hospital Payments . Fee-for-service and managed care payments to hospitals are revised. Fee-for-service pay- ments are as follows: The University of Washington Medical Center receives $4,455,000. Harborview Medical Center receives $10,260,000. All other CPE hospitals receive $6,345,000. Critical Access Hospitals that do not receive Dispro- portionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments receive$702,000. Critical Access Hospitals that are eligible for DSH receive $1,336,000 in DSH payments. Inpatient funds.ESHB 2160 144 Inpatient psychiatric hospitals receive $875,000 plus federal matching funds. Inpatient rehabilitation hospitals receive $225,000 plus federal matching funds. Managed care payments must be no less than $96 mil- lion, plus federal matching funds. Additional federalmatching dollars from the Medicaid expansion may nolonger substitute for HSNA dollars. The sums of $292 million per biennium may be ex- pended from the Fund in lieu of State General Fund pay-ments to hospitals. Other payment amounts remain unchanged. Hospital Safety Net Assessment Administration . The HCA must provide the Washington State Hospital Associ-ation with a monthly report showing the amount of pay-ments made to managed care plans, including the amountof additional premium tax payments. Provisions for contracting between hospitals and the HCA are changed to allow exte nsion of existing contracts and to disallow reductions in aggregate payments from variations based on budget-neutral rebasing of payment rates. The HCA may use a surplus in the Fund to reduce as- sessments through FY 2019. Hospital Residencies . Revenue from the hospital safety net assessment is used for new family residencyprogram slots, and new psychiatric residency programslots, at the University of Washington. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Second Special Session Effective: June 30, 2015 ESHB 2160 C 8 L 15 E 2 Concerning the distributio n of intimate images. By House Committee on Judici ary (originally sponsored by Representatives Wylie, Orwall, Klippert and Buys). House Committee on Judiciary Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: Liability may exist for some harms that re- sult from the disclosure of embarrassing or emotionally distressful material. The tort of invasion of privacy is based on the com- mon law tort of public disclosure of private facts. Invasionof privacy occurs when a pers on gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another. A person who in-vades another's privacy is subject to liability to the other person if the matter publicized is of a kind that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person and is not of legit-imate concern to the public. The tort of intentional inf liction of emotional distress, also known as the tort of outr age, occurs when a defendant engages in extreme and outrag eous conduct to intentional- ly or recklessly inflict emotional distress on a plaintiff andthe plaintiff actually suffers severe emotional distress as aresult. Summary: A person is liable for distributing an intimate image of another if he or she intentionally and without consent distributes an intimate image that: was obtained under circumstances in which a reason- able person would know or understand that the imagewas to remain private; or was knowingly obtained by the person without autho- rization or by exceeding authorized access from theother person's property, accounts, messages, files, or resources. Several factors may be used to determine whether a reasonable person would know or understand that an im- age was to remain private. An \"intimate image\" is an y image or recording of an identifiable person that is take n in a private setting, is not a matter of public concern, and depicts: sexual activity; or a person's intimate body parts, whether nude or visi- ble through less than opaque clothing. Anyone who distributes an intimate image of another, and at the time of such distribution knows or reasonablyshould know that disclosure would cause harm to the de-picted person, is liable for actual damages, reasonable at-torneys' fees, and costs. The court also may awardinjunctive relief as it deems necessary. However, an inter-active computer service, as defined by federal law, maynot be held liable for content provided by another person. It is an affirmative defense to a violation if a family member of a minor distributes certain images of the minor to other family or friends and did not intend any harm orharassment in the disclosure. The court must make it know n to a plaintiff that the plaintiff may use a confidenti al identity, and the court must use the confidential identity in all petitions, filings, or oth- er documents.Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Effective: September 26, 2015House 79 16 House 86 11 Senate 39 5 House 97 0 Senate 48 0 (Senate amended) House 90 0 Senate 43 0HB 2181 145HB 2181 PARTIAL VETO C 58 L 15 Modifying the maximum sp eed limit on highways. By Representatives Schmick, Clibborn, Orcutt and Scott. House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: Generally, the maximum speed limit on public streets, roads, and high ways is set by statute: 25 miles per hour (mph) on city and town streets, 50 mph oncounty roads, and 60 mph on state highways. These limits may be increased or decreased by the Secretary of theWashington State Department of Transportation (WS-DOT) if an engineering and traffic investigation showsthat a higher or lower maximum speed is reasonable andsafe under the circumstances. The maximum speed limiton any state highway, however, may not be increased togreater than 70 mph. Additionally, vehicles with a grossweight of greater than 10,000 pounds may not exceed 60mph. Summary: The Secretary of the WSDOT may increase the maximum speed limit on any highway or portion ofhighway to not more than 75 miles per hour.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 Partial Veto Summary: Vetoes a section that provided legislative findings and explai ned that the Legislature in- tended House Bill 2181 to require the WSDOT to deter- mine locations on Interstate 90, and elsewhere on the state highway system, upon which a greater speed limit is rea- sonable and safe and modify the maximum speed limit ac-cordingly. VETO MESSAGE ON HB 2181 April 22, 2015 To the Honorable Speaker and Members, The House of Representatives of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, withou t my approval as to Section 1, House Bill No. 2181 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to the maximum speed limit on high- ways.\" This bill presumes that there are portions of Interstate 90 -- and other portions of the state highway system -- where the speed limit could be increased to 75 mph without compromising safety. According to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission, speed- ing or driving too fast for condi tions accounts for more than one- third of all deadly crashes in Washi ngton. It's a fact that as vehicle speed increases, the amount of energy generated increases expo- nentially, and the risk of death an d injury increases substantially as collision speed increases. Our state's Target Zero Plan aims to reduce traffic death and serious injuries to zero by 2030. Although the number of speeding-involved cr ashes is declining due to the Target Zero program, there are s till far too many people dying on our roadways. An increase in al lowable speeds before a thorough safety assessment is performed is simply premature.Therefore, I am vetoing Se ction 1 of House Bill 2181. However, I am directing the Department of Transportation to consult with the Traffic Safety Co mmission and the State Patrol to assess whether the speed limit could be increased without any compromise in safety. Moreover, I strongly encourage the Legislature to reconsider the Traffic Safety Comm ission's distracted dr iving bill in the up- coming session as a way to further reduce traffic fatalities. It's vi- tal that we make progress im proving safety this year. For these reasons I have vetoed Section 1 of House Bill No. 2181. With the exception of Section 1, House Bill No. 2181 is ap- proved. Respectfully submitted, Jay Inslee Governor EHB 2190 C 148 L 15 Authorizing the electronic submission of vessel reports of sale. By Representatives Harmsworth, Moscoso, Orcutt, Clib- born, Wilson, Condotta, Kretz, Rodne, Dunshee and Pike. House Committee on Transportation Senate Committee on Transportation Background: The owner of a vessel must notify the De- partment of Licensing (DOL) w ithin five business days of the date when he or she sells or otherwise disposes of avessel. In order for a report of sale to be considered prop- erly filed it must include the date of the sale or transfer, the name and address of the owner and the person acquiringthe vessel, the vessel hull iden tification number and vessel registration number, and a date stamp by the DOL show-ing it was received on or before the fifth business day afterthe date of sale or transfer. A report of sale does not transfer ownership, but may protect the seller from civil liability if the person acquiringthe vessel does not complete the transfer of ownership.The DOL only accepts vessel reports of sale via a paperform that must be completed, printed, signed, and mailed to the DOL. The DOL accepts vehicle reports of sale elec-tronically. Summary: The DOL is required to provide or approve re- ports of sale forms, provide a system enabling vessel own-ers to submit reports of sale electronically, immediately update the DOL's vessel record when a report of sale has been filed, provide instructions to sellers on releasing their interest in a vessel, and send a quarterly report to the De-partment of Revenue that lists vessels for which a report ofsale has been received; but no transfer of ownership hastaken place.Votes on Final Passage: House 78 19 Senate 41 7 House 97 1 Senate 48 0 HB 2195 146Effective: January 1, 2017 HB 2195 C 28 L 15 E 3 Modifying certain auditor's fees.

Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 EHB 2212 C 22 L 15 E 3 Exempting hospitals licensed under chapter 70.41 RCW that receive capital funds to operate new psychiatric ser-vices from certain certificate of need requirements. By Representatives Cody, Schmick and Fagan.House Committee on Capital Budget Senate Committee on Health CareSenate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Certificate of Need . A certificate of need from the Department of Health (DOH) is required prior tothe following: construction, renovation, or sale of a healthcare facility; changes in bed capa city at certain health care facilities; an increase in the nu mber of dialysis stations at a kidney disease center; or the addition of specializedhealth services. The DOH must consider specific criteria when deter- mining whether to issue a certif icate of need including: (1) the population's need for the service; (2) the availability of less costly or more effective alternative methods of pro-viding the service; (3) the fi nancial feasibility and proba-ble impact of the proposal on the cost of health care in the community; (4) the need and availability of services and facilities for physicians and th eir patients in the communi- ty; (5) the efficiency and appropriateness of the use of ex-isting services and facilities sim ilar to those proposed; and (6) whether the hospital meets or exceeds the regional av-erage level of charity care. In 2014 the certificate of need requirement for acute care hospitals was suspende d when the hospitals change the use of existing licensed beds to psychiatric care bedsthat include involuntary treat ment. This suspension ex- pires June 30, 2015. Supreme Court Decision . In August 2014 the Wash- ington Supreme Court decided the case of In re D.W ., which involved 10 involuntary psychiatric patients whoasked the Superior Court in Pierce County to hold that their detention in uncertified treatment beds was unlawful. The Supreme Court found that current Washington stat-utes and regulations do not authorize temporary certifica-tion of treatment beds as a response to overcrowding. Summary: Hospitals that receive grants awarded in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 for new psychiatric beds from the Department of Commerce are exempt from requesting a certificate of need. The Department of Commerce maynot make prior approval of a certificate of need applicationa condition for a grant application. The period for the exempt ion is two years from the date of the grant award. Any new beds added under theexemption must remain psychiatric beds unless a new cer-tificate of need is granted. The authorization expires June30, 2019.Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Third Special Session Effective: July 6, 2015 HB 2217 C 23 L 15 E 3 Concerning the state's use of the juvenile offender basic training camp program. By Representatives Hunter, Sullivan and Carlyle.House Committee on Appropriations Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: The Department of Social and Health Ser- vices (DSHS) is required to establish a medium-security juvenile offender basic training camp (JOBTC). The JOB-House 59 38 House 73 24 Senate 31 13 House 97 0 House 97 0 House 98 0 Senate 45 0EHB 2253 147TC was designed to be a 120-day program that empha- sized building a juvenile offender's self-esteem,confidence, and discipline through a structured curriculumincluding educationa l, vocational, re habilitative, and physical training components. A juvenile offender must m eet the following criteria to be eligible for the JOBTC: have an aggregate minimu m sentence of less than 65 weeks; have a minimum of 29 weeks remaining until maxi- mum sentence upon admission to the JOBTC; not be assessed as a high-risk offender by the Juvenile Justice and Rehabilitation Administration's (JJRA) Risk Assessment Recidivism tool; not have a violent or sex offense on his or her current commitment; not have any prior serious violent offense; and not have mental or physical health problems that could endanger his or her health or drastically affect his or her performance in the JOBTC.Juvenile offenders who meet the above eligibility cri- teria and successfully graduate from the JOBTC spend theremainder of their disposition under parole supervision inthe community. When the JJRA opened th e JOBTC in 1997, the JJRA had a caseload of approximately 1,400 youth and the JOB-TC was funded for 48 beds. By fiscal year (FY) 2014, theJJRA caseload had declined to 533 youth and the JOBTCwas funded for 16 beds. The actual average daily popula-tion of the JOBTC over the FY 2012-FY 2014 period was11 youth. The JJRA has reported that youth today infre-quently meet the original JOBTC eligibility criteria. The JOBTC is located in Connell and is currently op- erated through a contract with Pioneer Human Services. Summary: The requirement for the DSHS to establish a JOBTC is changed to an authorization to do so.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Second Special Session Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015EHB 2253 C 11 L 15 E 2 Amending statutory timelines governing the administra- tion and organization of the jo int administrative rules re- view committee that prescr ibe when member, alternate, chair, and vice chair appointments and final decisions re-garding petitions for re view must be made. By Representatives Hudgins and Taylor.House Committee on State Government Background: The Legislature exercises some oversight over agency rulemaking thro ugh the Joint Administrative Rules Review Committee (JA RRC). The JARRC is em- powered to examine three main issues: whether a rule is consistent with the intent of the Legislature; whether a rulewas adopted in accordance w ith the law; and whether an agency is using a policy or in terpretive statement in place of a rule. The JARRC may also , by majority vote, order an agency to engage in the significant legislative rulemak- ing process or develop a sm all business economic impact statement. Membership . The JARRC is composed of eight legis- lative members, four senators and four representatives,and at least four alternate members. Members are appoint-ed in the following manner: four members, with no more than two members from the same political party, appointed by the House; four members, with no more than two members from the same political party, appointed by the Senate; one alternate member from each caucus of the House of Representatives, appoin ted by the House; and one alternate member from each caucus of the Senate, appointed by the Senate. Members and alternates must be appointed as soon as possible after the Legislature convenes in regular sessionin an odd-numbered year. Member terms extend until their successors are ap- pointed and qualified at the next regular session in an odd-numbered year, or until they no longer serve in the Legis- lature, whichever occurs first. Vacancies must be filledwithin 30 days. Members an d alternates may be reap- pointed to the committee. Appointments for chairperso ns and vice chairpersons from among the committee membership must be made inJanuary of each even-numbered year as soon as possibleafter a legislative session convenes. The appointments aremade on an alternating basi s between the House of Repre- sentatives and the Senate. Begi nning in the year 2000, the Speaker of the House of Re presentatives appoints the chairperson and vice chairper son and beginning in 2002, the President of the Senate makes the appointments. Review of Rules . Any person may petition the JAR- RC for a review of a proposed or existing rule, a proposedor existing policy, or an inte rpretive statement of general applicability. If the JARRC issu es an adverse finding on aHouse 72 25 House 71 24 House 77 20 House 81 16 Senate 47 0ESHB 2263 148rule, the agency in question is required to conduct a hear- ing on the committee's findings . If the JARRC is dissatis- fied with the agency respon se to its findings, it may publish notice of its dissatisfaction in the State Register,recommend to the Governor th at he or she suspend the rule, or refer the matter to a standing policy committee of the Legislature. Within 30 days of receipt of the petition, the JAARC must acknowledge receipt of the petition and describe any initial action taken. If the pe tition is rejected, a written statement of the reasons for rejection must be included.The JAARC must make a final decision on a petitionedrule within 90 days of the receipt of the petition. Summary: Appointments of successors to any member or alternate member of the JAARC must be made as soonas possible after the Legislature convenes in regular ses-sion in odd-numbered years, but no later than by June 30of the same year. Appointments of the chairperson andvice chairperson must be made as soon as possible afterthe Legislature convenes in re gular session in even-num- bered years, but no later than by June 30th of the sameyear. The alternating schedu le is updated requiring the President of the Senate to ap point the chairperson and vice chairperson beginning in 2016, and the Speaker of theHouse of Representatives to make those appointments be- ginning in 2018. The term of any member or alternate ex- tends until a successor is appointed or the member nolonger serves in the Legislature, whichever occurs first.Vacancies must be filled within 30 days of the vacancy oc- curring. A final decision of a petitio ned rule may be deferred if a decision has not been made by the time the Legislaturemeets in regular or special session. In those instances, afinal decision must be made within 90 days of adjourn-ment of the regular or special session. During a legislativesession, a petitioner may bring any concerns raised in a pe-tition to any legislator, and those concerns may be ad-dressed directly through legislation.Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Effective: September 26, 2015ESHB 2263 C 24 L 15 E 3 Providing local governments with options to strengthen their communities by providing services and facilities for people with mental illness, de velopmental disabilities, and other vulnerable populations, and by increasing access toeducational experiences thr ough cultural organizations. By House Committee on Finance (originally sponsored by Representatives Springer, Wa lkinshaw, Robinson, Thar- inger, Carlyle, McBride, Fitzgibbon and Reykdal). House Committee on Finance Background: Sales and Use Tax . Retail sales taxes are imposed on retail sales of most articles of tangible person- al property, digital products, and some services. A retailsale is a sale to the final consumer or end user of the prop-erty, digital product, or service. If retail sales taxes werenot collected when the user acquired the property, digitalproducts, or services, then use taxes apply to the value ofproperty, digital product, or service when used in this state.The state, most cities, and a ll counties levy retail sales and use taxes. The state sales and use tax rate is 6.5 percent;local sales and use tax rates vary from 0.5 percent to 3.1 percent, depending on the location. Property Tax . Property taxes are imposed by state and local governments. The county assessor determines as-sessed value for each property . The county assessor also calculates the tax rate necessary to raise the correctamount of property taxes for each taxing district. The as- sessor calculates the rate so th e individual district rate lim- it, the district revenue limit, and the aggregate rate limits are all satisfied. The property tax bill for an individualproperty is determined by mu ltiplying the assessed value of the property by the tax rate for each taxing district inwhich the property is located. Summary: Cultural Access Programs . A county may es- tablish a cultural access program (CAP) that allocatesfunds to cultural organizations providing programming orexperiences for the general public. The primary purposeof the organization receiving funding must be the advance-ment or preservation of science or technology, the visualor performing arts, zoology, botany, anthropology, heri-tage, or natural history. The CAP funding must be used fora public benefit that generally relates to increasing access,outreach, and opportun ities to the public. Any county may authorize a CAP or enter into an in- terlocal agreement with a gr oup of contiguous counties to create a CAP. A county may designate an en tity or agency to operate the functions of th e CAP. A county with a pop- ulation under 1.5 million may contract with the Washing- ton State Arts Commissio n to provide consulting, management, or administrative services to the CAP. Any county may establish an advisory council with membersthat include leaders in the bu siness, educational, and cul-House 89 0 Senate 44 0ESHB 2263 149tural communities who represent the interests of the pro- gram. A city may create a CAP if the county where the city is located either expressly forfeits its own option or does not propose a choice to vote rs for creating a CAP before June 30, 2017. A city that creates a CAP shares the sameauthority as if created by the county. Public School Cultural Access Program . Each CAP must include a public school cultural access program com-ponent to increase student access to cultural programming and facilities. In a county with a population over 1.5 mil-lion, the public school CAP mu st include: transportation for students to attend at l east one program annually; a cen- tralized service for cultural or ganizations to coordinate op- portunities for students; c onsolidation of student opportunities to increase cost efficiency; the development of tools to correlate activiti es with school curricula; and partnerships between schools and cultural organizations.A portion of any remaining res ources should be used to en- courage districts and regional cultural organizations to en-hance activities and programs. Revenue and Tax Authority . A county may advance funding to the CAP for initial administrative costs, includ- ing public outreach about the program and proposed fund-ing sources. The county may require repayment by theCAP from tax proceeds, if approved by voters. A county with a population over 1.5 million, or a city in a county that has opted out, may levy a sales and use taxto fund a CAP. A county wi th a population below 1.5 mil- lion, or city in a county that has opted out, may levy eithera sales and use tax or a property tax in order to fund a CAP.All levy authority is conditioned upon voter approvalthrough a general or special election. Authorizationthrough voter approval may last for no longer than sevenyears. The county may renew the tax levy after sevenyears for one or more additio nal seven-year periods upon voter approval at a general or special election. All tax rev- enue under this authority must be credited to a special fund in the county treasury and used solely for the CAP. The sales and use tax may be levied up to 0.1 percent on the sale of goods and serv ices within the county. The property tax may be levied up to an amount equal to theannual total taxable retail sa les and uses multiplied by 0.1 percent, subject to the $5.90 local tax limit. Funding Allocation . The usual and customary fund- ing provided by a county to support cultural organizations may not be replaced or diminished by a CAP. Any CAPfunds received by a state-related cultural organization maynot replace or materially dimi nish any state funding usual- ly received by the organization. A County Under 1.5 Million People . A CAP must re- serve program funds for alloca tion in the following prior- ity: repayment of any start-up money provided by the county; program administrative costs; operation of a public school cultural access program, including music and arts educ ation that is provided in addition to basic education funding; and remaining funds distributed to the entity designated by the county to allocat e among eligible cultural organizations that meet the guidelines and criteria ofthe CAP. A County over 1.5 Million People . A CAP must re- serve program funds for alloca tion in the following prior- ity: repayment of any start-up money provided by the county; program administrative costs (up to 1.25 percent of total funds); operation of a public school cultural access program (10 percent of remaining funds); distribution to regional cultural organizations that widely benefit the public, as determined by CAP guidelines (70 percent of remaining funds); and remaining funds distributed to the entity designated by the county to allocate funds to community-based cultural organizations or a community preservation and development authority (up to 8 percent of whichmay be used on th e designated entity's administrative costs). Management and Accountability . Funds distributed to a cultural organization may be used for cultural and edu-cational programs and activities, capital projects (exceptfor regional cultural organizations), equipment and sup-plies related to a project, and start-up costs for any newcommunity-based cultural organization. Funding distributed to a cultural organization must be used for a discernible public benefit related to: increasing access to prog rams and facilities, includ- ing reduced or free admission , particularly for diverse or underserved communities; providing services or programs away from the organi- zation's facilities; providing educational programs in schools and other places; broadening programs, pe rformances, and exhibitions for the public; supporting collaborative relations among cultural organizations; and supporting capacity building for co mmunity-based cultural organizations. A county must evaluate a fu nding request based on the public benefit that the cultural organization plans to pro-vide. The CAP must adopt guidelines and standards of performance by the organization in providing the publicbenefit. The guidelines must include procedures to notify organizations at risk of losing eligibility and provide mea-HB 2264 150sures for retaining eligibility. At the conclusion of a CAP- funded project, the organization must report on the publicbenefit realized. In a county over 1.5 millio n people, a regional cultural organization is eligible to rece ive funding if it: is a state nonprofit corporation in good standing; is located in the county and primarily benefits county residents; has not re- cently declared bankruptcy; has provided financial state-ments to the CAP; and has an adjusted average annual revenue of at least $1.25 millio n. A regional cultural or- ganization in a county over 1.5 million people must re- serve at least 20 percent of funds for, and report annuallyon, its participation in the public school cultural accessprogram. The annual report on the public school cultural access program must include data on how many studentswere served at each event type , grade level, and school lo- cation, and the percentage of students who participate in free or reduced-price school meal programs. Upon renew-al of a tax levy authority for the CAP, as approved by thevoters, the county must set a new minimum annual reve- nue amount for a regional cultural organization. The funding allocation availa ble to eligible regional cultural organizations is di stributed proportionally based on an annual ranking based on each organization's revenue and attendance. No organization may receive more than15 percent of its annual revenue. Housing and Related Services . County legislative au- thorities may implement a 0.1 percent sales and use tax, if approved by a majority of vote rs, in order to fund housing and related services. A city legislative authority may im- plement the whole or remainder of the tax if, if approvedby a majority of voters, the county has not opted to imple-ment the full tax within two ye ars in a county with a pop- ulation of less than 1.5 million, or three years in a county with a population of over 1.5 million. A minimum of 60 percent of revenues collected must be used for constructing affo rdable housing, affordable housing units, facilities prov iding housing-related ser- vices, or mental and behavior health-related services, or tofund the operations and maintenance costs of newly con-structed affordable housing , facilities providing housing- related services, or evaluatio n and treatment centers. The affordable housing and facilit ies providing housing-relat- ed programs must serve any of the following individualswith income below 60 percent of area median income: in- dividuals with mental illness, veterans, senior citizens,homeless families with child ren, unaccompanied home- less youth, persons with disab ilities, or domestic violence victims. A county may issue bonds against up to 50 percent of the revenues in order to co nstruct affordable housing, housing units, and facilities pr oviding housing-related ser- vices or mental and behavior health-related services. Theremainder of the funding must be used for the operation,delivery, or evaluation of mental and behavioral healthtreatment programs or housing-related services.Revenues may be used to offset reductions in state or federal funds for housing an d related services; however, no more than 10 percent of the revenues collected may beused to supplant existing loca l funding for such services. Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 January 1, 2018 (Section 405) HB 2264 C 21 L 15 E 3 Amending the statewide mini mum privacy policy for dis- closure of customer en ergy use information. By Representatives Smith and Haler.House Committee on Technology & Economic Develop- ment Background: The Statewide Minimum Privacy Policy for Disclosure of Customer Energy Use Information . Leg- islation enacted in the 2015 re gular session established the Statewide Minimum Privacy Policy (Privacy Policy) fordisclosure of utility custom er energy use information. Effective July 24, 2015: an electric utility may not sell private or proprietary retail electric customer information; except under limited circumstances, an electric utility may not disclose private or proprietary retail electric customer information with or to its affiliates, subsid- iaries, or any other third party for the purposes of marketing services or product offerings to a retail electric customer who does not already subscribe tothe service or product, un less the utility has first obtained the customer's written or electronic permis- sion; customer permission is not required when the utility has a contract with a third party that is directly related to the conduct of the utility's business, if the contract prohibits the third party from further disclosing any private or proprietary customer information to certain other third parties; and a person other than an electric utility may not capture, obtain, or disclose private or proprietary customer information for commercial purposes except under limited circumstances. \"Person\" means any individu al, partnership, corpora- tion, limited liability company, or other organization orcommercial entity, other than an electric utility. House 89 8 House 87 10 Senate 33 12EHB 2266 151\"Private consumer informa tion\" includes the address, telephone number, and any other per-sonally identifying information. Enforcement of the Privacy Policy . Violation of the Privacy Policy is declared an unfair and deceptive act intrade or commerce and an unfair method of competitionfor purposes of applying the Consumer Protection Act(CPA). Consumer Protection Act . The CPA prohibits unfair methods of competition and un fair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce directly orindirectly affecting the people of Washington. The CPAallows a person injured by a vi olation of the act to bring a private cause of action for dama ges. In addition, the CPA allows the Attorney General (AG) to bring a CPA action inthe name of the state or on behalf of persons residing in thestate. In an action brought by the AG, the prevailing party may, at the discretion of the court, recover the costs of theaction and reasonable attorneys' fees. The CPA does not apply to actions or transactions that are regulated by the Utilities and Transportation Commis- sion (UTC). Therefore, the CPA does not apply to regulat- ed actions of an investor-own ed utility. In addition, the CPA has been construed to be inapplicable to actions of municipal corporations, includ ing public utility districts, on the grounds that actions of such municipal corporationshave not been deemed to be actions \"in the conduct oftrade or commerce.\" Disclosure of Private Customer Energy Information by Investor-Owned Utilities . The UTC prohibits investor- owned utilities from disclosing or selling private consum-er information with or for a utility's affiliates, subsidiaries, or any other third party for the purposes of marketing ser-vices or product offerings to a customer who does not al-ready subscribe to that service or product, unless the utility obtains the customer's writte n \"Consumer-owned utili- ty\" (COU) means a municipal electric utility, a public util-ity district, an irrigation district, a cooperative, or a mutualcorporation or association, that is engaged in the businessof distributing electricity to more than one retail electriccustomer in the state. The UTC does not have authority toregulate COUs, which are in stead primarily regulated by their own governing bodies. The State Auditor's Officehas authority to examine the fi nancial affairs of all local governments, including public utility districts and munic- ipal electric utilities, and to audit the compliance of COUs with the Energy Independence Act. Summary: The Statewide Minimum Privacy Policy for Disclosure of Customer Energy Use Information . An electric utility's authority to di sclose private or proprietary customer information to a thir d party with which the utility has a contract is modified. In addition to prohibiting the third party from further disclo sing the customer informa- tion, the contract must proh ibit the third party from sellingthe information to a party that is not the utility and not a party to the contract with the utility. Implementation by Consumer-Owned Utilities . A consumer-owned utility (COU) must implement the State- wide Minimum Privacy Policy for disclosure of customer energy use information thro ugh a policy adopted by its governing board by October 9, 2016. The policy must in-clude provisions ensuring comp liance with the statewide minimum privacy policy and must include procedures,consistent with applicable la w, for investigation and reso- lution of complaints by a retail electric customer whoseprivate or proprietary information may have been sold bythe COU or disclosed by th e utility for the purposes of marketing services or product offerings without the cus-tomer's permission. Consumer Protection Act . Disclosure or sale of pri- vate or proprietary customer information by an electricutility is no longer declared an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and enforceable under the ConsumerProtection Act (CPA). Disclosure or sale of private or pro-prietary customer information by a third party remains en-forceable as a CPA violation, if a contract with the utilityprohibited the third party from further disclosure or sale of the customer information.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 EHB 2266 C 38 L 15 E 3 Deferring implementation of class size reduction and school employee staf fing formula changes. By Representative Sullivan.House Committee on Appropriations Background: Prototypical Schools . Legislation enacted in 2009 and 2010 redefined basic education and restruc-tured the K-12 funding formulas. In 2009 legislation wasenacted that expanded the de finition of basic education and established the framework for a new K-12 funding al-location formula based on prototypical schools. In 2010legislation was enacted that established the new prototyp-ical school allocation formulas at funding levels that rep- resented the 2009-10 school year state spending on basiceducation. Additionally, th e 2010 legislation called for phased-in implementation of specified enhancements tothe basic education program and the funding to support it.Three of these four enhancemen ts have been partially im- plemented, as of the 2014-15 school year: (1) specified in-creases in funding for materials, supplies, and operatingcosts (MSOC) by the 2015-16 school year; (2) full fundingof class size reductions for grades kindergarten through 3House 97 0 Senate 44 0EHB 2267 152(K-3) by the school year; and (3) imple- mentation of all-day kindergarten, also by the 2017-18school year. The prototypical school funding formula for basic ed- ucation took effect September 1, 2011. The formula allo-cates funds to school districts based on assumed levels ofstaff and other resources necessary to support a \"prototyp-ical\" school that serves an assumed number of students at defined elementary, middle, and high school levels. Thestructure of the formula provides allocations for classroomteachers at an assumed class size, plus other building-levelstaff such as principals, teacher-librarians, counselors, andoffice support. The allocations to a school district are ad- justed to reflect the full-time equivalent enrolled students, in proportion to the prototypical school ratios. The fund-ing provided to school districts through the prototypicalschool formulas is for allocation purposes only. Districtshave discretion over how the money is spent, subject tosome limits. Initiative 1351 . Washington voters approved Initia- tive (I-1351) on November 4, 2014. Initiative 1351amended the prototypical school funding formula to lowerclass sizes in all grades; prov ide additional class size re- ductions in high poverty schools beyond those specifiedfor the general education class sizes; and increase the allo-cation of school-based and dist rict-wide staff units in all categories. The initiative sp ecified a phase-in schedule for the funding of the new prototypical schools funding for-mula. For the 2015-17 biennium, funding allocations arerequired to be no less than 50 percent of the difference be- tween the funding necessary to support the prototypical model as of September 1, 2013, and the funding necessary to support the numerical values to support the prototypicalmodel as revised by the initia tive. Full implementation of I-1351 is required to be completed by the end of the 2017-19 biennium. During the two-year period after a ballot measure is approved by the voters, there are special limitations on re- peal or amendment of the me asure. First, the measure may not be repealed by legislativ e vote, but it may be repealed by \"direct vote\" of the people. Second, the measure maybe amended by legislative vote with a two-thirds approval of both houses, or by \"direct vote\" of the people. \"Directvote\" of the people includes voter enactment of a referen- dum bill approved by a cons titutional majority of both houses of the Legislature. Summary: Legislative findings and intent are declared regarding educational reason s for temporary deferral of Initiative 1351. First, the Legislature intends to focus onimplementation of the 2009 and 2010 legislation that rede- fined basic education, which the McCleary v. State (2012) ruling identified as a remedy. These reforms include classsize reduction in early grad es as recommended by the re- search reviewed by the B asic Education Funding Task Force and the Quality Educa tion Council. Second, the Legislature finds that there are practical implementationissues for the deferral, includ ing production of new teach- ers, the need to avoid exacerbating teacher recruitmentchallenges, and time to plan and construct new class-rooms. The implementation schedule specified under I-1351 is revised, delaying by four years the implementation of al-locations for class size reduction and increased staffingunits. The first biennium by which the Legislature must begin providing funding for prototypical staffing increasesis changed to the 2019-21 bi ennium. Full funding is re- quired to be provided by the end of the 2021-23 biennium.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: July 14, 2015 EHB 2267 C 29 L 15 E 3 Suspending the state expenditure limit in order to imple- ment the state's Article IX obligation to amply fund basic education. By Representative Hunter.House Committee on Appropriations Background: In 1993 voters adopted Initiative 601, which established the state expenditure limit. The expen-diture limit law restricts the amount that the state mayspend from the State General Fu nd (GFS) each fiscal year. The expenditure limit for each year is the prior year's ac- tual GFS expenditures, adjust ed for inflation as measured by a 10-year rolling average of personal income growth, and further adjusted for revenue and program transfersinto and out of the GFS. The state Expenditure Limit Committee establishes, adjusts, and projects the expenditure limit. The State Trea-surer is prohibited from maki ng payments from the GFS that exceed the limit. Legislation enacted in 20 12 established requirements for a four-year balanced budget and a budget Outlookprocess. The Economic and Revenue Forecast Counciladopts the Outlook, which is a four-year projection of GSF and related fund revenues and expenditures. Summary: The Legislature declares its intent to tempo- rarily suspend the state expe nditure limit in the biennia during which and immediately following the state's phase-in of funding of its Article IX obligations pursuant to Chapter 584, Laws of 2009 (ESHB 2261), Chapter 236,Laws of 2010 (SHB 2776), and the McCleary court case. The state expenditure limit is suspended until the 2021-23 fiscal biennium. Th e expenditure limit for fiscal year 2022 equals the state's actual GFS expenditures forfiscal year 2021, adjusted by the fiscal growth factor.House 72 26 Senate 33 11EHB 2286 153The Economic and Revenue Forecast Council, in con- sultation with the Expenditure Limit Committee, mustprepare draft legislation for introduction in the 2016 legis-lative session that synchroniz es the requirements of the expenditure limit, the four-y ear balanced budget require- ment, and the budget Outlook process.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: July 6, 2015 EHB 2286 C 2 L 15 E 3 Directing the treasurer to tran sfer budget st abilization ac- count deposits that are attrib utable to extraordinary reve- nue growth in the 2013-2015, 2015-2017, and 2017-2019fiscal biennia. By Representative Hunter.Background: In 2007 the voters ratified a constitutional amendment that created the Budget Stabilization Account (BSA) as Article VII, section 12 of the state constitution. Each year, the State Treasurer must deposit 1 percent ofgeneral state revenues (GSR) in to the constitutionally cre- ated BSA. The term GSR is defined in the constitution and is generally synonymous with the statutory State GeneralFund (GFS). In general, appropriations from the BSA require a three-fifths majority in each house of the Legislature, but in the case of a catastrophic event or low employmentgrowth, the Legislature may appropriate from the BSAwith a constitutional majo rity vote of each house. In 2011 the voters ratifie d an amendment to Article VII, section 12 that required further deposits into the BSA. In biennia in which the stat e experiences extraordinary revenue growth (ERG), an amount equivalent to three-quarters of the ERG must be transferred to the BSA. Ex-traordinary revenue growth is defined as the amount bywhich the percentage growth of GSR in that biennium ex-ceeds by more than one-third the average percentagegrowth in GSR over the five previous biennia. Extraordi- nary revenue growth is transf erred only to the extent that it exceeds the required 1 percent transfer, and ERG is nottransferred in a biennium that follows a fiscal biennium inwhich employment growth av eraged less than 1 percent per fiscal year. Under legislation that was enacted in 2012 and is often referred to as the budget Outlook, the operating budget must be balanced over four years. This means that the leg-islative budget for the current biennium must leave a pos-itive ending fund balance in the GFS and related funds, and that the projected maintenance level costs of that bud-get in the ensuing biennium mu st not exceed the estimatedavailable fiscal resources for the ensuing biennium. How- ever, the requirement to balance in the ensuing bienniumdoes not apply in a fiscal biennium in which moneys areappropriated from the BSA. Summary: During the 2013-15, 2015-17, and 2017-19 fiscal biennia, the State Tre asurer must transfer from the BSA to the GFS the entire amounts of the BSA depositsfor the respective biennia that are attributable to ERG.Maximum transfer amounts are specified for each bienni- um. The transfers in this bill do not alter the requirement to balance the budget in th e ensuing fiscal biennium. Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: June 30, 2015 SSB 5004 C 288 L 15 Establishing the position and authority of warrant officers. By Senate Committee on Law & Justice (originally spon- sored by Senators Angel and Rolfes). Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: Washington cities fall into one of the fol- lowing classifications based on population: first class, second class, and town. A first-class city is defined as acity with a population of 10,0 00 or more at the time of its organization or reorganization and has a charter adoptedunder the state Constitution. A second-class city is a city with a population of 1500 or more at the time of its orga-nization or reorganization that does not have a charter ad- opted under the state Cons titution and does not operate under the state Model Municipal Code. A town has a pop-ulation of up to 1500 at th e time of its organization and does not operate under the state Model Municipal Code. A warrant officer is a limited-commission officer with the authority to arrest base d on misdemeanor warrants and to serve court orders. Warrant officers are not fully com-missioned law enforcement of ficers subject to law en- forcement academy requirements. Washington lawcurrently provides cities with a population of over 400,000with the authority to maintain the position of warrant offi- cer within the city police department. These cities are au-thorized to establish the number of warrant officerpositions and the qualifications for warrant officers by or- dinance. The warrant officer's compensation must be paidby the city employing the warrant officer. A warrant offi-cer is vested only with the au thority to make arrests autho- rized by court order and other arrests as authorized byordinance. A municipal court order may not be executedby the warrant officer outside of the limits served by thatHouse 64 33 Senate 33 11 House 89 9 Senate 44 1SB 5011 154court unless the person authorized by the order first con- tacts the law enforcement agen cy in whose jurisdiction the order is to be served. If a de fendant is arrested in another city or county pursuant to a municipal court order, the mu-nicipal court issuing the order bears the cost of arrestingthe defendant, serving the order, and returning the defen-dant to the city. Warrant officers are not entitled to death,disability, or retirement benef its currently authorized un- der state law for law enforcem ent officers and firefighters. A city with a population of up to 400,000 is not expresslyauthorized by statute to main tain the position of warrant officer within its police department. Summary: Any code or non-code city or town may estab- lish and maintain the position of warrant officer within the police department. A warrant officer is vested only withauthority identified in ordinance which may include mak-ing arrests authorized by warrants, and service of civil andcriminal process. The authority to serve or enforce acourt's process is limited to th e authority that the local ju- risdiction has granted by ordinance. The chief of policemust establish training requir ements consistent with the duties of the warrant officer, which must be approved by the Criminal Justice Training Commission. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5011 C 289 L Addressing third-party payor release of health care infor- mation. By Senators Becker, Cleveland, Frockt and Keiser.Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 establishes nationwide standards for the use, disclosu re, storage, and transfer of protected health information. In Washington the Uniform Health Care Information Act governs the disclosure ofhealth care information by health care providers. Legislation passed in 2014 (ESSB 6265) modified the requirements for the disclosure of patient health care in- formation, including elimina tion of duplicative standards for disclosures and streamlinin g standards related to shar- ing mental health records between providers. One changewas made to allow third-party payors to disclose informa- tion only as provided under th e Uniform Health Care In- formation Act, but reference to health care providers was removed, and the section was vetoed by the Governor.The same section of statute was amended in a different billthat established the framework for the All Payer ClaimsDatabase (E2SHB 2572) and th e broader reference to the Uniform Health Care Information Act was not corrected. Summary: The Uniform Health Care Information Act is corrected to allow third-party payors to release health careinformation only to the extent health care providers are au- thorized to do so under the All Payer Claims Database and the two sections of the Unifor m Health Care Information Act that allow providers to re lease health care information without authorization.

By Senators Honeyford and Ericksen.Senate Committee on Agriculture, Water & Rural Eco- nomic Development House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Background: To ship fluid milk and milk products across state lines, the Washington State Department of Agricul-ture (WSDA) administers a m ilk inspection program in ac- cordance with standards es tablished by the National Conference of Interstate M ilk Shipments (NCIMS). A milk assessment fee is assessed to support the dairy in-spection program, and to ma intain compliance with the provisions of NCIMS and the Grade A Pasteurized MilkOrdinance. The current authority to collect the milk assessment expires on June 30, 2015. Summary: The current authority to assess milk processed in the state is extended un til June 30, 2020. The current maximum assessment level of $0.0054 per hundredweight is retained. The funds continue to be de posited in the dairy inspec- tion account within the agricultu ral local fund. The funds continue to be used only to provide inspection services to the dairy industry.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 27, 2015Senate 43 1 House 70 28 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred)Senate 47 0 House 96 1 (House amended)Senate 46 1 (Senate concurred) Senate 47 0 Senate 47 0 House 92 0SSB 5023 155SSB 5023 C 19 L 15 Concerning the filing of grou p health benefit plans other than small group plans, stand-alone dental plans, andstand-alone vision plans by di sability insurers, health care service contractors, and health maintenance organizations. By Senate Committee on Hea lth Care (originally spon- sored by Senators Parlette and Keiser). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: The Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC) regulates insurance carriers and insurance products,including health insurance plans. There are three types ofhealth insurance carriers or issuers, disability insurers, health care service contractor s, and health maintenance or- ganizations. In addition, there are limited health care ser-vice contractors that may offer dental services, vision careservices, or other services. Each type of carrier has uniqueinsurance laws, and the laws may vary for large groups,small groups, and the individual market. Recent changes in federal law have resulted in more standardized review process es for insurance rate filings and contract filings, often k nown as rates and forms, in particular for the individual market and the small group market. There are some remaining differences for formsfilings based on carrier license type and the product andmarket offering. The OIC rule s for forms filings detail the requirements for health care service contractors and healthmaintenance organizations, wh ile disability insurers fol- low different requirements. Summary: All rates and forms of group health benefit plans, other than small grou p plans, and all stand-alone dental and stand-alone vision plans offered must be filedbefore the contract form is offered for sale to the public and before the rate schedule is used. Filings of negotiated group contract forms, other than small group plans, must be filed within 30 working days after the negotiations are comple te, or the date the renewal premiums are implemented. A negotiated contract in- cludes a health benefit plan, stand-alone dental or stand-alone vision plan where the benefits and other terms andconditions are negotiated and ag reed to by the carrier and the policy holder. The rates and forms must comply with state and federal laws. Stand-alone dental and stand-alone vision plans of- fered by a disability insurer to out-of-state groups may be negotiated, but may not be offered in this state before theCommissioner finds that stand-alone dental and stand-alone vision plans meet the standards set for disability in- surers. Rules developed by OIC to implement this section must use the already-adopted standards in place for health care service contractors and health maintenance organiza-tions.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5024 PARTIAL VETO C 225 L 15 Making conforming amendments made necessary by reor- ganizing and streamlining cent ral service functions, pow- ers, and duties of state government. By Senator Benton; by request of Department of Enter- prise Services. Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Background: A 2011 act extensively reorganized and, in some cases, renamed state agencies that primarily provideservices to other agencies, including contracting, risk management, information technology, and employee man-agement services. The 2011 act did not comprehensively revise all affected statutes. Accordingly, many statutescontain provisions that are in consistent with the 2011 act or are otherwise outdated or obsolete. Summary: Several statutes are revised to conform to the 2011 act reorganizing state ag encies that primarily provide services to other agencies. Outdated or obsolete provisionsare corrected, or repealed.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed sections previously amended or repealed, rather than decodified, by other legislation.

By Senate Committee on Hea lth Care (originally spon- sored by Senators Angel, Darneille, Dammeier, Keiser, Parlette, Cleveland, Bailey and Chase). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: In 2007 the Department of Health (DOH) was authorized to establish and maintain a Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) to monitor the prescribing and dispensing of all Schedules II, III, IV , and V controlled substances. Information su bmitted for each prescription must include at least a patient identifier, the drug dis-pensed, the date of dispensing, the quantity dispensed, the prescriber, and the dispenser . With certain exceptions, prescription information subm itted to DOH is confiden- tial. The exceptions allow DOH to provide data in the Pre- scription Monitoring Program to the following: personsauthorized to prescribe or dispense controlled substances; an individual who requests the individual's own records;health professional licensing, certification, or regulatory agencies; law enforcement officials who are engaged inbona fide specific investiga tions involving a designated person; authorized practitioners of the Department of So- cial and Health Services and the Health Care Authority re- garding Medicaid recipients; the Director of theDepartment of Labor and In dustries regarding workers' compensation claimants; the Director of the Departmentof Corrections regarding co mmitted offenders; entities un- der court order; and DOH pe rsonnel for the purposes of administering the program. Data may also be provided topublic or private entities for st atistical, research, or educa- tional purposes after removi ng identifying information. Test sites are facilities that analyze materials derived from the human body for the purp oses of health care, treat- ment, or screening. Test sites are licensed by DOH andmust meet quality control, qu ality assurance, recordkeep- ing, and personnel requirem ents established by DOH and federal law. Summary: DOH may provide data in the PMP to person- nel of a test site if: a person authorized to prescribe or dispense drugs engages the test site to provide assistance in deter- mining which medications are being used by a patient under the person's care; the test site has a procedure to ensure that the privacy and confidentiality of patients and their information are maintained and not discl osed to unauthorized par- ties; the test site does not charge clients for accessing the PMP; the test site is licensed by DOH; and the test site is certified as a drug testing laboratory by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admin- istration (Administration). Test sites may not store, share, or sell data accessed from the PMP database. The da ta may only be transmitted to prescribing health care practitioners for the purpose ofcaring for their patients. A responsible person, as desig- nated by the Administration, must supervise the test site's access to data.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5030 C 188 L 15 Addressing the limited liability company act. By Senate Committee on Law & Justice (originally spon- sored by Senators Pedersen and O'Ban; by request ofWashington State Bar Association). Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: A limited liability company (LLC) is a type of business organization. LLCs have flexible structuresand management. An LLC only needs one individualmember - owner - but multip le business organizations may also join together as members to form an LLC. An LLC may be member managed or manager managed. An LLC organization provides its members with the benefitsof both a corporation and a partnership, and is relativelyeasy to create. Like a corporation, the LLC structure pro-tects the members from liab ility in most circumstances. Like a partnership, LLCs are not taxed as a separate busi-ness entity under federal law - no double taxation. Washington enacted its fi rst law governing LLCs in 1994. Under the current law, the LLC's members must file a certificate of formation with the Secretary of State to cre- Senate 49 0House 77 20 (House amended)Senate 42 2 (Senate concurred)SB 5031 157ate an LLC. LLCs must comply with all other state laws and with the terms of a written LLC agreement. The writ-ten LLC agreement binds the members and governs theLLC's affairs. LLCs have the same power to conduct busi- ness that an individual has for matters not covered by statelaw or the LLC agreement. Summary: The LLC agreement governs the relations be- tween the LLC and its members, the relations among theLLC's members, and the LLC manager's rights and duties.If the LLC agreement does not sp ecify these internal rela- tions, legal rights, and duties, default rules and presump-tions supplement the LLC ag reement as a matter of law. Some of the default rules also set minimum legal require-ments that an LLC agreement cannot limit or eliminate. An LLC agreement may be written, oral, or implied. However, like similar laws governing partnerships, theLLC must make a written record if it limits the rights ofdissenters to a merger. An LLC may either be membermanaged or manager managed. Unless the LLC agree-ment provides otherwise, an LLC is presumed membermanaged. A majority vote is sufficient to authorize most LLC actions that require member consent. Some LLC ac-tions, like merger or conversion, require a unanimous voteof members or additional member approval. The LLC manager owes defined fiduciary duties of loyalty and care. Members owe the same fiduciary dutiesto a member-managed LLC. As to matters in the ordinary course of an LLC's activ- ities, each member of a member-managed LLC is theLLC's agent and has apparent authority to bind the LLC.Likewise, each manager of a manager-managed LLC isthe LLC's agent and has the authority to bind the LLC. Members no longer have apparent authority to bind a man-ager-managed LLC. An LLC must provide its members with any records the members request subject to reasonable limits on the use of the records. An LLC must allocate and distributeprofits and losses according to specific requirements. Aninsolvent LLC may not make di stributions to its members. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2016SB 5031 C 20 L 15 Permitting advance action re garding business opportuni- ties under the business corporation act. By Senators Pedersen and O'Ban; by request of Washing- ton State Bar Association. Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: Corporate directors and officers must al- ways act in the corporation's best interests because theyare bound by their fiduciary duty of loyalty. Under theduty of loyalty, a director or officer must not take advan-tage of a business opportunity for personal gain when the business opportunity rightfully belongs to the corporation. A fiduciary who violates this duty is held responsible un- der the common law corpor ate opportunity doctrine. Some states protect corporate officers and directors from potential liability under the corporate opportunitydoctrine with statutory safe harbor provisions allowing thefiduciary to seek the corporation's approval and obtain thecorporation's disclaimer of all rights to the business oppor-tunity. Currently Washington's Business Corporations Act (WBCA) does not provide this safe harbor. Other states allow a corporation to include a provision in its articles of incorporation relieving directors and offi-cers of their duty to offer a business opportunity to the cor- poration before pursuing the opportunity for personalinterests. The corporation may limit the provision to spe- cific circumstances. Currently WBCA does not authorizea corporation to include this pr ovision in its articles of in- corporation. Summary: Articles of incorporation may limit or elimi- nate a director's or officer's duty to offer a business oppor- tunity to the corporation be fore pursuing it for personal interests. A corporation or its shareholders cannot sue a director or officer for breach of duty under the corporate opportu-nity doctrine if: the director or officer offers the business opportunity to the corporation be fore acting on it; and the corporation disclaim s its interests by following specific statutory disclaimer procedures. The fact that a director or officer failed to offer a busi- ness opportunity to the corpora tion, and failed to obtain a corporate disclaimer before ac ting, is not enough evidence to prove a breach of duty in a lawsuit.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015Senate 48 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 45 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 47 0 House 96 1SB 5032 158SB 5032 C 107 L 15 Specifying when a transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest for purposes of the uniform commercial code. By Senators Pedersen and O'Ban.Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) controls commercial transactions between merchants,such as equipment sales and leases. Washington laws fol-low the UCC. For commercial transactions, the UCC dis-tinguishes leases from secured sales based on thetransactions' terms. Bankruptcy and tax laws vary depend- ing on whether a transaction is a lease or a sale subject toa seller's retained security interest. A common commercial lease term allows rental pay- ments to change based on the sale amount when the leas-ing company sells the equipment. These leases arecommonly called terminal rental adjustment or TRACleases. In 2012 the Legislature amended the commercialcode provisions distinguishing leases from secured sales.Currently these provisions do not address TRAC leases. Summary: Case-specific facts determine if a transaction in lease form creates a lease or a security interest. A trans-action in lease form does no t create a security interest merely because it contains a TRAC provision.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5035 C 4 L 15 Authorizing the awarding of th e medal of valor to a group of persons. By Senators Pearson, Kohl-We lles, Hatfield and Liias; by request of Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State. Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on State Government Background: In 2000 the state Medal of Valor was estab- lished. The medal may be awarded by the Governor, in thename of the state, to any person who saved, or attemptedto save, the life of another at the risk of serious injury or death to themselves, upon th e selection of the Governor's Medal of Valor Committee. The award is presented onlyduring a joint session of both houses of the Legislature.Any individual may nominate any resident of this state forany act of valor. The medal cannot be awarded to those acting as a re- sult of service given by any branch of law enforcement,firefighting, rescue, or other hazardous profession where the individual is employed by a government entity within the state of Washington. It may be awarded posthumously. The Governor's Medal of Valor Committee consists of the Governor, President of the Senate, Speaker of theHouse of Representatives, and Chief Justice of the Su-preme Court, or their designees. The Secretary of Stateserves as a nonvoting ex-officio member and serves as thesecretary to the committee. Summary: The state Medal of Valor may also be awarded to a group of persons who saved, or attempted to save, thelife of another at the risk of serious injury to themselves.

By Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations & Secu- rity (originally sponsored by Senators Chase, Roach, Hat-field and Miloscia). Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on Local Government Background: Water-sewer districts provide water and sewer services to incorporated and unincorporated areas.Districts are established through a petition, public hearing,and voter approval process and are managed by a board ofelected commissioners. District powers include the au-thority to purchase, construct, maintain, and supply water- works to furnish water to inha bitants, and to develop and operate sewer and drainage systems. Cities and towns may provide for the sewerage, drain- age, and water supply of the city or town. They may also establish, construct, and main tain water supply systems and systems of sewers and drai ns both within and outside their corporate limits. A city legislative authority may adopt a resolution or ordinance to assume jurisdiction of all or part of a districtwhen: a district is wholly w ithin the boundaries of the city or town; part of a district equal to at least 60 percent of the dis- trict area or 60 percent of the assessed valuation of real property in the district is within the boundaries ofthe city or town; or part of a district equal to less than 60 percent of the district area and less than 60 percent of the assessedSenate 46 1 House 97 0Senate 47 0 House 97 02SSB 5052 159valuation of real property in the district is within the boundaries of the city or town. If a city or town assumes jurisdiction over an entire district, all property, franchises, rights, assets, district-spe-cific taxes levied, and all other facilities and equipment ofthe district become the proper ty of the city upon assump- tion. The city manages the di strict, including its facilities and equipment, and collects service charges from theproperties served by the city. The city must honor or as-sume existing district debts. A city may assume jurisdiction by ordinance over a portion of a district located within its jurisdiction if theportion equals at least 60 perc ent of the district's total area or assessed real property va luation. Citie s encompassing less than 60 percent of the district's total area and assessed real property valuation may assume jurisdiction of the dis-trict that is within its corpor ate city limits. In both situa- tions, the district's voters ma y elect to require the city to assume responsibility for the ma nagement of the district's property, facilities, and equipment throughout the entiredistrict. If a district includes more than one city, a city encom- passing at least 60 percent of the district's assessed valua- tion may assume management responsibility over thedistrict if that city has approval from the other city or citiesincluded within the district. The other cities may installfacilities and establish local improvement districts to payfor these facilities, which may be connected to the utility system operated by the principa l city if they were installed in accordance with the principal city's standards.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 2SSB 5052 PARTIAL VETO C 70 L 15 Establishing the cannabis patient protection act. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Rivers , Hatfield and Conway). Senate Committee on Health Care Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Medical Use of Marijuana. In 1998 voters approved Initiative 692 whic h permitted the use of mari- juana for medical purposes by qualifying patients. TheLegislature subsequently amended the chapter on medicaluse of marijuana in 2007, 2010, and 2011, changing whomay authorize the medical use of marijuana, the definition of terminal or debilitating me dical condition, what consti- tutes a 60-day supply of medical marijuana, and allowingqualifying patients and designated providers to participatein collective gardens. In order to qualify for the use of medical marijuana, patients must have a terminal or debilitating medical con-dition such as cancer, the hu man immunodeficiency virus, multiple sclerosis, intractable pain, glaucoma, Crohn's dis- ease, hepatitis C, nausea or sei zure diseases, or a disease approved by the Medical Qu ality Assurance Commission, and the diagnosis of this co ndition must be made by a health care professional. The health care professional whodetermines that a person would benefit from the medicaluse of marijuana must provide that patient with valid doc- umentation written on ta mper-resistant paper. Qualifying patients who hold valid documentation may assert an affirmative defense at trial that they are au-thorized medical marijuana patients. These patients arenot currently provided arrest protection. Patients may grow medical marijuana for themselves or designate a provider to grow on their behalf. Designat-ed providers may only provide marijuana for one patient ata time, must be 18 years of ag e, and must be designated inSenate 28 21 House 96 1 (House amended)Senate 43 6 (Senate concurred)2SSB 5052 160writing by the qualifyi ng patient to serve in this capacity. There is no age lim it for patients. Qualifying patients and their designated providers may possess no more than 15marijuana plants and 24 ou nces of useable marijuana product. Up to ten qualifying patients may share responsibility for acquiring and supplying the resources required to pro-duce, process, transport, an d deliver marijuana for the medical use of its members. Collective gardens may con-tain up to 45 plants and 72 ounces of useable marijuanaand no marijuana from the coll ective garden may be deliv- ered to anyone other than one of the qualifying patientsparticipating in the collective garden. No provision for the sale of marijuana from a collective garden or for the li-censing of collective gardens is made in statute. No state agency is provided with regulatory oversight of medical marijuana. The Department of Health (DOH)does provide guidance to its licensees who recommend the medical use of marijuana, and is the disciplinary authority for its providers who authorize the medical use of marijua-na in violation of the statutory requirements. DOH doesnot perform investigations un til a complaint is made that someone is unlawfully author izing the medical use of mar- ijuana. There are no statutory licensing or productionstandards for medical marijuana and there are no provi-sions for taxation of medical marijuana. Recreational Use of Marijuana. In 2012 voters ap- proved Initiative 502 which est ablished a regulatory sys- tem for the production, processing, and distribution oflimited amounts of marijuan a for non-medical purposes. Under this system, the Liquor Control Board (LCB) issues licenses to marijuana producers, processors, and retailers,and adopts standards for the regulation of these operations. The number of these licenses that may be issued is estab-lished by LCB. Persons over 21 years of age may pur-chase up to one ounce of usea ble marijuana, 16 ounces of solid marijuana-infused product, 72 ounces of liquid mar-ijuana-infused product, or seven grams of marijuana con-centrates at a licensed retailer. Federal Response to State Marijuana Regulations. Washington is one of 33 states, and the District of Colum-bia, that have passed legislation allowing the use of mari-juana for medicinal purposes - although some of these states permit the use of high cannabidiol products only.Washington is also one of four states, and the District ofColumbia, that allow recreatio nal use of marijuana. The use of marijuana remains ille gal under federal law. How- ever, Congress in its 2015 fiscal year funding bill provided that the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) maynot use federal funds to pr event states from carrying out their medical marijuana laws . Additionally, the DOJ has issued several policy statements regarding state regulationof marijuana and describing when prosecutors may inter-vene. Federal prosecutors have been instructed to focusinvestigative and prosecutoria l resources related to mari- juana on specific enforcemen t priorities to prevent: the distribution of marijuana to minors; marijuana sales reve-nue from being directed to cr iminal enterprises; marijuana from being diverted from states where it is legal to statesin which it is illegal; state- authorized ma rijuana activity from being used as a cover for trafficking other illegaldrugs or other illegal activity; violence and the use of fire-arms in the production and distribution of marijuana; drugged driving and other marijuana-related public healthconsequences; the growth of marijuana on public lands; and marijuana possession or use on federal property. Summary: LCB is renamed to the Liquor and Cannabis Board (LCB). Medical use of marijuana is regulated through the structure provided in Initiativ e 502. Specific provisions for the medical use of marijuan a are included: the terminal or debilitating medica l conditions that qualify a patient for the medical use of marijuana mu st be severe enough to sig- nificantly interfere with activ ities of daily living and must be able to be objectively asse ssed and evaluated; and qual- ifying patients continue to be able to grow marijuana for their medical use. A medical marijuana authorization da- tabase (database) is created. Qualifying patients and des- ignated providers who do not sign up with the database may grow marijuana for their medical use but are limitedto four plants and 6 ounces of useable marijuana and areprovided an affirmative defense to charges of violating the law on medical use of marijuan a. Qualifying patients and designated providers who do sign up with the database may grow up to 15 plants for their medical use, are provid-ed arrest protection, and may possess three times theamount of marijuana than wh at is permitted for the recre- ational user. A medical marijuana endor sement to a marijuana re- tail license is established to be issued by LCB. The en- dorsement may be issued co ncurrently with the retail license and medical marijuana-endorsed stores must carryproducts identified by DOH as beneficial to medical mar-ijuana patients. DOH must also adopt safe handling re-quirements for all marijuan a products to be sold by endorsed stores and must adopt training requirements forretail employees. LCB must reopen the license period for retail stores and allow for additional licenses to be issuedto address the needs of the medical market. LCB must es-tablish a merit based system for issuing retail licenses.First priority must be given to applicants that have applied for a marijuana retailer licen se before July 1, 2014, and who have operated or been employed by a collective gar- den before November 6, 2012, and second priority to ap-plicants who were operating or employed by a collectivegarden before November 6, 2012 but who have not previ- ously applied for a marijuana license. Beginning July 1, 2016 health care professionals who authorize the medical use of marijuana must use an autho- rization form developed by DOH. The authorization formmust include the qualifying pa tient's or designated provid- er's name, address, and date of birth; the health care pro-fessional's name, address, and license number; the amount2SSB 5052 161of marijuana recommended fo r the qualifying patient; a telephone number where the au thorization can be verified; the dates of issuance and expiration; and a statement thatthe authorization does not provide protection from arrestunless the patient or provider is also entered into the data- base. Authorizations are valid for one year for adults and six months for minors. Minors may be authorized for the medical use of mar- ijuana if the minor's parent or guardian agrees to the autho-rization. The parent or guardian must have sole controlover the minor's marijuana. Minors may not grow mari-juana, nor may they purchase from a retailer. However,they may enter the premises of a medical marijuana retail-er if they are accompanied by their parent or guardian whois serving as the designated provider. Patients who are be-tween ages 18 and 21 may enter marijuana retail outlets that hold medical mar ijuana endorsements. The database is to be admini stered by a third party un- der contract with DOH. Th e database must allow autho- rizing marijuana retailers with medical marijuanaendorsements to en ter the qualifying patient or designated provider into the database an d, consequently, provide the patient or provider with a recognition card that may beused to confirm the authentic ity of the patient or provider. Patients and providers who ar e entered into the database are provided protection from arrest so long as they are incompliance with th e law on the medical use of marijuana. Patients and providers who ar e entered into the database are permitted the following po ssession amounts: 3 ounces of useable marijuana, 48 ounces of marijuana-infusedproduct in solid form, 216 ounces of marijuana-infused product in liquid form, 21 grams of marijuana concen- trates, and 6 plants. The aut horizing health care profes- sional may authorize more than the six plants and 3 ouncesof useable marijuana if the patient's medical needs requireadditional amounts, but no mo re than 8 ounces of useable marijuana and 15 plants. No more than 15 plants may be grown in a housing unit, unless the housing unit is the location of a coopera- tive. No plants may be grown or processed if any portionof the activity may be viewed or smelled from the publicor the private property of another housing unit. The database is not subject to public disclosure. The database is accessible to only the following groups of peo-ple: the medical marijuana retailer with a medical mari- juana endorsement, to add the patient or provider to the database; persons authorized to prescribe or dispense controlled substances to access health care information on their patients to provide medical care to their patients; a qualifying patient or designated provider to request or receive his or her own health care information; law enforcement officers who are engaged in a bona fide investigation relating to the use of marijuana; a marijuana retailer ho lding a medical marijuana endorsement to confirm the validity of a recognition card; the Department of Revenue to verify tax exemptions; and the Department of Hea lth to monitor compliance of health care professionals. It is a class C felony for a person to access the database for an unauthorized purpose or to disclose any information obtained by accessing the data base. Funding for the cre- ation and maintenance of the database comes from the Health Professions Accoun t which will be reimbursed from the Dedicated Marijuana Fund. Qualifying patients and designated providers placed in the database must be issued recognition cards. Recogni-tion cards must include a rand omly generated number that will identify the patient or pr ovider, a photograph of the patient or provider, the amount of marijuana for which thepatient has been authorized, the effective and expiration dates of the card, the name of the health care professionalwho authorized the patient or provider, and other security features necessary to ensure its validity. Patients and pro- viders will be charged $1 fo r each initial and renewal rec- ognition card issued with proceeds to be deposited into theHealth Professions Account. The provision authorizing collective gardens is re- pealed, effective July 1, 20 16. Four member cooperatives are permitted. Up to four patients or designated providersmay participate in a cooperativ e to share responsibility for the production and processing of marijuana for the medi-cal use of its members. Th e location of the cooperative must be registered with LCB and is only permitted if it is at least 1 mile away from a marijuana retailer. The regis-tration must include each me mber's name and copies of each member's recognition card s. Only registered mem- bers may participate in the cooperative or obtain marijua- na from the cooperative. If a member leaves thecooperative, no new member may join for 60 days afterLCB has been notified of the change in membership. All members of the cooperative must provide labor; monetaryassistance is not permitted. Marijuana grown at a cooper-ative is only for the medical use of its members and maynot be sold or donated to another. Minors may not partic-ipate in cooperatives. LCB must develop a seed to saletraceability system to track al l marijuana grown by the co- operative. Licensed marijuana producer s may be permitted to in- crease the amount of their pr oduction space if the addition- al amount is to be used to grow plants identified asappropriate for medical use. Extractions by any person without a license is prohib- ited. LCB must adopt rules on non-combustible methods of extractions that may be used. A medical marijuana consultant certificate is estab- lished to be issued Certificate holders must meet2SSB 5052 162education requiremen ts relating to the medical use of mar- ijuana and the laws and rule s implementing the recreation- al and medical systems. DOH must also makerecommendations on whether medical marijuana specialty clinics may be permitted. LCB may conduct controlled purchase programs in re- tail outlets, cooperatives, and, until they expire July 1, 2016 in collective gardens to ensure minors are not access- ing marijuana. Retailers ma y conduct in-house controlled purchase programs.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 25, 2015 July 1, 2016 (Sections 2, 19, 20, 23-26, 31, 35, 40, 49) April 24, 2015 (Sections 21, 22, 32, 33) Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed the section that prohibited employers of health care providers from limiting medical marijuana r ecommendations to patients. The sections that removed medical marijuana from Sched- ule I of the Controlled Su bstances Act and the resulting criminal penalties relating to the newly unscheduled med- ical products were also veto ed. Finally, the section that would make the bill continge nt on House Bill 2136 pass- ing was vetoed. VETO MESSAGE ON 2SSB 5052 April 24, 2015 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 36, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 52, Sec ond Substitute Senate Bill No. 5052 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to establis hing the cannabis patient pro- tection act.\" After tremendous deliberation, compromise and hard work from our outstanding bipartisan spon sors and co-sponsors, committee chairs and ranking members from both houses, we have a measure that will create a medical mar ijuana system that works for our state. I am committed to ensuring a sy stem that serv es patients well and makes medicine available in a safe and accessible manner, just like we would do for any medici ne. That's what this bill strives to provide. It will help famili es of patients in real need. As significant an accomplishment as this bill is for our state - and for patients to be ensured of having a safe place to get medi- cine they need - I know some remain concerned. These perspec- tives are important and compelling. I recognize the solution is not perfect. However, I do think this is far better than today's wholly unregulated system. We will have options for patients and a system of strong enforce- ment to ensure public safety, esp ecially for children. It is a good thing that this bill allows imme diate enforcement of dispensaries to ensure they are not selling marijuana to kids. I want to be clear that I am committed to implementing this law effectively by ensuring cooperatives are safe for patients in need, not sources of illicit diversion in our communities. To this end, I have directed the Liquor Control B oard to work with the Attorney General's Office and local law enforcement to consider all optionsto ensure patient and public safety.I also want to reassure you that the Department of Health will create an authorization form that will continue to honor the doc- tor-patient relationship. While this bill takes a tremendous step forward, a large volume remains of unfinished work on marijuana tax policy, enforcement,local revenue sharing and funding for public health prevention programs. I strongly support efforts to address these items - and call on legislators to finish the job and provide the tools necessary to ensure a well-regulated and functioning marijuana market in our state. I am vetoing the following sections: Section 36. This sectio n prohibits employers of health care pro- viders from limiting medical marijuana recommendations to pa- tients. This is an em ployment law provision that may cause confusion and potential unintende d consequences. This section was added without adequate input. Th e sponsors of this legislation have also requested this provision be vetoed to allow time for fur- ther discussion to develop appropriate policy. Sections 42 and 43. These sectio ns remove from Schedule I of our state's Controlled Substances Act any medical marijuana product. This is a laudable idea and I appreciate the intent to re- duce the stigma of medical mari juana by rescheduling it from a Schedule I - an illegal - controlled substance to something more appropriate. However, our state' s rescheduling system has very limited effect , and rescheduling just medi cinal marijuana - not the entire cannabis plant and derivativ es - may cause serious prob- lems such as having the unintende d effect of limiting the types of marijuana that are considered medi cine. To that end, I have in- structed the Department of Health to thoroughly consider this idea in consultation with medical pr ofessionals and st akeholders, and bring an appropriate resolution to me and the Legislature by nextyear. Furthermore, I will continue to advocate for the federal gov- ernment to consider a national rescheduling solution, which may be most beneficial, considering the limited power that state re- scheduling has in this respect. Sections 44, 45 and 46. These sec tions create new felonies in our criminal code. Washington state does not need additional criminal penalties related to me dical marijuana. Moreover, these sections were added as part of th e same amendment that created sections 42 and 43 that would hav e rescheduled medical marijua- na. Because I have vetoed sections 42 and 43, sections 44, 45, and 46 are also unnecessary. Section 52. This section make s Senate Bill 5052 contingent on the enactment of some version of House Bill 2136 by October 1, 2015. This contingent effective date causes confusion and poten- tially conflicts with other effective dates in Senate Bill 5052. In ad- dition, if the Legislature is unabl e to pass a version of House Bill 2136, the Code Reviser's Office has advised me that this provision acts as a null and void clause, in which case we risk jeopardizing the integrity of the syst em created in this bill. I strongly agree with the need for additional policy and administrative changes to en- sure a well- regulated and func tioning marijuana market. Howev- er, this bill should not be made contingent on those changes. For these reasons I have vetoed Sections 36, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 52 of Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 5052. With the exception of Sections 36, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 52, Second Substitute Senate Bi ll No. 5052 is approved.

By Senate Committee on Law & Justice (originally spon- sored by Senators Frockt, Fain, Pedersen and Chase; by re-quest of Attorney General). Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: Patent Law . Patent law is based in the U.S. Constitution and federal law. Article One, Section 8,Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution secures for limited timesto authors and inventors the ex clusive right to their respec- tive writings and discoveries. A patent is an intellectual property right granted by government to an inventor to ex-clude others from making, using, offering for sale, or sell-ing the invention. Generally th e term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Apatent filed with the government is open to public disclo- sure. A patent right is effectiv e only in the U.S. and its ter- ritories, and the right may be legally enforced in court to prevent infringement with the exclusive right. There is no legal requirement for a patent ed invention to actually be developed. A patent right may be sold, assigned, or li-censed. Washington State Consumer Protection Act (CPA) . Washington's CPA declares unlawful \"unfair competitionand unfair acts or deceptive acts or practices\" in the con-duct of trade or commerce. A person may bring a lawsuitto recover actual damages sustained from an unfair or de-ceptive act. A court in its discretion may award an injuredperson treble damages not to exceed $25,000 including costs of the lawsuit and attorn ey fees. The Attorney Gen- eral's Office may enforce CP A to protect consumers from fraud and unfair business practices. Summary: The Patent Troll Prevention Act is a new chapter in Title 19 RCW. A person may not make asser- tions of patent infringement in bad faith. An assertion of patent infringement is when a person sends a demandthreatening a target with litig ation while asserting that the target infringed a patent or that the target should obtain alicense in order to avoid litigation. In a lawsuit, a courtmay consider certain non-excl usive factors as evidence of a good or bad faith assertion. Bad faith factors includewhether a demand does not contain specific informationsuch as a patent number, the name and address of the pat-ent owner, and facts relating to specific areas in how the target is infringing the patent , or failing to provide the pre- ceding information upon request. A violation is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce under CPA. The Attorney General is autho-rized to bring an action under CPA in the name of the state, or on behalf of persons residing in the state to enforce theprovisions.An assertion of a patent infringement under federal law regarding biological products are not subject to theact.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5070 C 290 L 15 Requiring the department of corrections to supervise do- mestic violence offenders who have a conviction and weresentenced for a domestic violence felony offense that wasplead and proven. By Senators Pearson, Warnick, Dammeier, Kohl-Welles and Brown. Senate Committee on Law & Justice Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Public Safety House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Background: When the Sentencing Reform Act was passed by the Legislature in 1984, it contained very limit-ed provisions for the supervis ion of offenders. Over time the Legislature added back supervision in varying lengthsof time and for varying offenses. In 1999 the Legislaturepassed the Offender Accountability Act (OAA). TheOAA extended community custody to all sex offenses, allviolent offenses, all crimes against persons, and all felonydrug offenses. It also required the Department of Correc-tions (DOC) to utilize a validat ed risk assessment and su- pervise offenders according to their risk level. Since that time, the Legislature has gradually decreased the numberof offenders supervised by DOC: In 2003 under SB 5990, the Legislature authorized DOC to supervise only th ose offenders in the two highest risk levels unless the offender committed a sex offense, violent offense, crime against a person,certain drug offenses, burglary, or felony domestic violence. In 2009 under SB 5288/6162, the Legislature autho- rized DOC to supervise only those offenders in the two highest risk levels unless the offender committed a sex offense or serious violent offense, received analternative sentence, was designated as dangerously mentally ill, was a misdemeanant sex offender, or was classified as a certain domestic violent offender.Community custody term le ngths were reduced to 36 months for sex or serious violent offenders, 18 months for violent offenders, and 12 months for allothers.Senate 41 6 House 94 3SB 5075 164 In 2011 under SB 5891, the Legislature eliminated supervision for offenders convicted of first-time fail- ure to register and misd emeanant domestic violence offenders, and instituted su pervision for repeat felony and misdemeanant domes tic violence offenders where domestic violence wa s plead and proven after August 1, 2011.Currently DOC must superv ise the following offend- ers sentenced to community custody: 1. offenders who are classified at a high risk to reoffend; and 2. regardless of risk classification, those offenders who: a. are convicted of a sex o ffense or serious violent offense; b. are identified as dangerously mentally ill; c. have an indeterminate sentence; d. are convicted of a failure to register; e. have a current conviction for domestic violence felony offense where domestic violence was plead and proven after August 1, 2011, and a prior con- viction for a repetitive domestic violent offense ordomestic violence felony offense where domestic violence was plead and proven after August 1, 2011; f. are sentenced to a Drug Offender Sentencing Al- ternative, Special Sex Offender Sentencing Alter-native, or First Time Offender Waiver; g. must be supervised unde r the Interstate Compact; or h. are certain misdemeanant sex offenders and repeat domestic violence offenders. In 2010 the Legislature made a number of changes to the laws relating to domestic violence, including changes in the areas of law enforcement and arrest, no-contact andprotection orders, firearms possession, and sentencing re-forms. Notably, the legisla tion adjusted how prior felony and non-felony domestic violence related offenses are cal-culated for purposes of calcul ating an offender's sentence. All domestic violence offen ses must be plead and proven after August 1, 2011. Summary: DOC must supervise an offender sentenced to community custody regardless of risk classification if the offender has a conviction for a domestic violence felonyoffense where domestic vi olence was plead and proven and was committed after the effective date of the bill. Pri-or provisions remain in effect for offenders who commit-ted a domestic violence felony offense prior to theeffective date of the bill. The state and its officers, agents, and employees must not be held criminally or civ illy liable for its supervision of an offender unless the state and its officers, agents, andemployees acted with gross negligence. The entire act is null and void unless specific funding is provided for this act in the omnibus appropriations bill. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5075 C 79 L 15 Making nonsubstantive changes to procurement law. By Senator Baumgartner; by re quest of Department of En- terprise Services. Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on State Government Background: In 2011 laws were enacted consolidating procurement functions of the Department of General Ad-ministration, the Department of Information Services, and the Office of Financial Mana gement into the newly-creat- ed Department of Enterpri se Services (DES). DES was tasked with implementing the reform and consolidation of state procurement practices and providing a report to theGovernor with procurement reform recommendations byDecember 31, 2011. Legislation reflecting these recommendations was en- acted in 2012. DES oversees state procurement of goodsand services. DES adopted uniform policies and proce-dures and provides training on best practices for state pro- curement. Agencies must submit sole-s ource contracts to DES and make the contracts available for public inspection atleast ten days before the proposed starting date of the con-tract. Agencies with procurement authority must developcomplaint and protest processes. DES may debar a contractor, individual, or other enti- ty from submitting a bid, having a bid considered, or en- tering into a state contract fo r a period up to three years as a result of certain offenses or misconduct relating to con-tracts. Agencies must provid e DES with a list of all con- tracts that the agency entered into or renewed on an annual basis. Summary: Changes are made to correct statutory cross references, correct the agency name, and repeal outdatedprovisions of procurement law.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 Senate 49 0House 97 0 (House amended) Senate 45 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 47 0 House 96 1SB 5079 165SB 5079 C 6 L 15 E 1 Requiring the department of social and health services to notify the military regarding ch ild abuse and neglect alle- gations of families with an active military status. By Senators O'Ban, Conway and Dammeier.Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services Background: The Department of Defense (DOD) is re- quired by law to coordinate with civilian child welfareagencies to obtain informa tion regarding allegations of child abuse and neglect involvi ng children in military fam- ilies. Within DOD, the Family Advocacy Program ad-dresses prevention of and response to child abuse andneglect involving such families. DOD policy requires mil- itary services to establish me morandum of understandings with state and local child protective services (CPS) to col-laborate the oversight of child abuse and neglect cases in-volving military families. It is estimated that 70 percent of active duty military families reside in th e civilian community. When CPS receives a report of an incident of alleged abuse or neglect involving a child who died or has a phys-ical injury or injuries that are not accidental, or who wassubjected to alleged sexual abus e, CPS must report the in- cident to the proper law enforcement agency. Summary: CPS must make efforts to determine the mili- tary status of parents whose children are subject to abuse or neglect allegations. Upon receiving an allegation of abuse or neglect that involves military parents or guard-ians, CPS must notify military law enforcement. If an al- legation of abuse or neglect involving military parents orguardians is screened in and open for investigation, CPS must notify the DOD Fam ily Advocacy Program.

By Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Educa- tion (originally Kohl-Welles, on Early L earning & K-12 Education House Committee on EducationBackground: Sudden cardiac death is the result of an un- expected failure of proper heart function that may occurduring or immediately after exercise. It is reported thatcardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in youth ath-letes. The Washington Interscholastic Activities Associa- tion (WIAA) is a private, nonprofit service organizationand rulemaking body. WIAA consists of nearly 800 mem-ber high schools and middle or junior high schools, bothpublic and private, and it is divided into nine geographicservice districts. WIAA staff administers policies, rules,and regulations and provides other assistance and serviceto member schools. The University of Washington Medicine Center for Sports Cardiology aims to advance the cardiovascular care of athletes and physically active patients of all ages. Thiscenter is a collaboration betw een sports medicine and car- diology specialists to establish clinical and academic re-sources. Summary: The stated intent of the Legislature is to make youth athletes, their families, and coaches aware of suddencardiac arrest. Online Pamphlet . W I A A m u s t w o r k w i t h m e m b e r schools' board of directors, a nonprofit organization thateducates communities about sudden cardiac arrest inyouth athletes, and the University of Washington Medi-cine Center for Sports Cardiology to develop and makeavailable an online pamphlet that provides youth athletes, their parents or guardians, and coaches with information about sudden cardiac arrest. The online pamphlet must in- clude information on the natu re, risk, symptoms and warn- ing signs, prevention, and tr eatment of sudden cardiac arrest. The online pamphlet must be posted on the Officeof Superintendent of Public Instruction's website. On a yearly basis, prior to participating in an inter- scholastic athletic activity, a sudden cardiac arrest formstating that the online pamphlet was reviewed must besigned by the youth athlete and the athlete's parents orguardian and returned to the school. Online Prevention Program for Coaches . WIAA must work with member schools' boar d of directors, an organi- zation that provides educationa l training for safe participa- tion in athletic activity, and the University of Washington Medicine Center for Sports Cardiology to make availablean existing online sudden cardiac arrest prevention pro-gram for coaches.

By Senate Committee on Hea lth Care (originally spon- sored by Senators Becker, Frockt, Conway, Keiser andMullet; by request of Governor Inslee). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: The 2014 Legislatur e passed E2SHB 2572 which directed the Office of Financial Management(OFM) to establish a statewide all-payer health careclaims database to support transparent public reporting ofhealth care information. OFM must select a lead organi-zation to coordinate and manage the database. The leadorganization is responsible fo r collecting claims data, de- signing data collection mech anisms, ensuring protection of the data, providing reports from the database, develop-ing protocols and policies, developing a plan for financialsustainability and charge fees no t to exceed $5,000 for re- ports and data files, and co nvening advisory committees. OFM initiated rulemaking bu t delayed selection of a lead organization. Claims data includes the clai ms data related to health care coverage for Medicaid and the Public EmployeesBenefits Board program, and other voluntarily provideddata that may be provided by insurance carriers and self-funded employers. The claims data provided to the data- base, the database itself, and any raw data received fromthe database are not public records and are exempt frompublic disclosure. Extensive stakeholder discussions were held over the 2014 interim to identify modi fications for submission of claims data, protection of proprietary financial data, andadditional parameters for the re lease of data and reports. Summary: OFM must initiate a competitive procurement process to select a lead organization to coordinate andmanage the all-payer claims database. The proposal must include criteria to be applied in the scoring evaluation thatinclude extra points for the following items: the degree of experience in health care data collection, analysis, analyt- ics, and security; a long-term self-sustainable financial model; experience in convening and engaging stakehold-ers to develop reports; expe rience meeting budget andtimelines for report generation s; and the ability to combine cost and quality data. The successful lead organization must apply to be certified as a qualified entity by the Cen-ters for Medicare an d Medicaid Services by December 31, 2017. As part of the procurement process, the lead organiza- tion must demonstrate they ha ve a contract with a data vendor to perform data collection, processing, aggrega-tion, extracts, and analytics. The data vendor must estab-lish a secure data submission process, review data files,ensure quality of data files, assign unique identifiers to in- dividuals represented in the da tabase, demonstrate internal controls and state of the art encryption methods, store dataon a secure server, and ensure state of the art security for transferring data. The lead organization and data vendormust provide a detailed descrip tion of the security meth- ods to the Office of the Ch ief Information Officer housed within OFM. The following data suppliers must provide claims da- ta: the Medicaid program, the Public Employees BenefitsBoard program, all health in surance carriers operating in this state, all third-party administrators paying claims onbehalf of health plans in this state, and the state Labor and Industries program. The Director of OFM may expandthis requirement to include other types of insurance poli- cies, such as Long-Term Care policies and Medicare sup-plemental coverage. Empl oyer-sponsored self-funded health plans and Taft-Hartley trusts may voluntarily pro-vide claims data. The lead organization must develop a plan for the fi- nancial sustainability of the database as self-sustaining. The $5,000 cap on the fees the lead organization maycharge for reports and data files is removed. Any fees must be approved by OFM an d should be comparable, ac- counting for relevant differences across data requests anduses. Fees must not be charge d to providers or data sup- pliers other than th e fees directly related to requested re- ports. The advisory committees th e lead organization must convene are modified to include in-state representation from key provider organizations, hospitals, public health,health maintenance organizations, large and small privatepurchasers, consumer organizations, and the two largestcarriers supplying claims data. Requests for claims data must include the following: the identity of any entities th at will analyze the data; the stated purpose of the request; a description of the proposed methodology; the specific variable requested; how the re-quester will ensure all data is handled to ensure privacy and confidentiality protection; the method for storing, de- stroying, or returning the data to the lead organization; and protections that will ensure the data is not used for anypurposes not authorized by th e approved application. Any entity that receives claims or other data must maintain confidentiality and may only release data if it does not contain proprietary financial information or direct or indi-Senate 46 0 House 79 18SB 5085 167rect patient identifiers, and th e release is described and ap- proved as part of the request. The lead organization, in conjunction with OFM and the data vendor, must create a process to govern levels of access to the data: Claims data that includ e proprietary financial infor- mation, direct patient identifiers, indirect patientidentifiers, unique identifiers, or any combination, may be released only to researchers with a signed data use and confidentiality agreement. Access to this level of data is remo ved for federal, state and local government agencies, and for the lead organiza- tion. Claims data that do not contain direct patient identifi- ers, but may contain proprietary financial informa- tion, indirect patient identi fiers, unique identifiers, or any combination, may be released to agencies, researchers, the lead organization, and other entities with a signed data use agreement, however agenciesmay not use the data for procurement of health bene- fits for their employees. Claims data that do not contain proprietary financial information or direct patient identifiers may bereleased upon receipt of a signed data use agreement. Reports may not contain proprietary financial infor- mation, or direct or indirect patient identifiers; however, the use of geographic areas w ith sufficient population size or aggregate gender, age, medical condition, or other char-acteristics may be used for reports as long as they cannotlead to the identification of an individual. Reports issued by the lead organization may utilize proprietary financialinformation to calculate aggregate cost data. OFM mustdevelop in rule a format for the calculation and display of aggregate cost data. In deve loping the rule, OFM must so- licit feedback from stakeholde rs and must consider data presented as proportions, ranges, averages, and medians,as well as the differences in types of data. Recipients of data must protect data containing direct and indirect identifiers, proprietary financial information,or any combination thereof; mu st not re-disclose the data; attempt to determine the iden tify of any person whose in- formation is included in the data set; consent to penalties associated with the inappropriate disclosures or uses of thedata; and destroy or return the data at the conclusion of the data use agreement. By October 31 of each year, the lead organization must submit a list to OFM of reports they anticipate pro-ducing during the following ca lendar year. OFM may es- tablish a public comment period not to exceed 30 days and must submit the list and any comments to the appropriate committees of the Legislature for review. The lead orga- nization may not publish any repo rt that directly or indi- rectly identifies individual patients; disclose a carrier'sproprietary financial inform ation, or compare perfor-mance that includes any provid er with fewer than four pro- viders, rather than five. The lead organization may notrelease a report that compares providers, hospitals, or data suppliers unless it allows veri fication of the data and com- ment on the reasonableness of conclusions reached. The requirement to limit reports where one data supplier com- prises more than 25 percent of the claims data is removed.The lead organization must distinguish in advance when itis operating as the lead organization and when it is operat-ing in its capacity as a private entity. The claims data thatcontain direct patient identifiers or proprietary financialinformation must remain exclus ively in the custody of the data vendor and may not be accessed by the lead organiza-tion. OFM must adopt rules, including procedures for es- tablishing appropriate fees, procedures for data release,and penalties associated with the inappropriate disclosuresor uses of direct patient iden tifiers, indirect patient identi- fiers, and proprietary financial information. By December 1, 2016 and 2017, OFM must report to the Legislature on the develo pment of the database includ- ing, but not limited to, budge t and cost detail, technical progress, and work plan metrics. Two years after the firstreport is issued, OFM must re port to the Legislature every two years regarding the cost, performance, and effective-ness of the database, and the pe rformance of the lead orga- nization. Using independent economic expertise, subject to appropriation, the report mu st evaluate whether the da- tabase advanced the goals est ablished for the database, as well as the performance of the lead organization. The re-port must make recommendations on how the databasecan be improved, whether the contract for the lead organi-zation should be modified, renewed, or terminated, and theimpact the database had on competition between andamong providers, purchasers, and payers. The act contains a severability clause in the event any portion of the act is dete rmined to be invalid.

By Senators Rolfes, Damm eier, Conway, Benton, Chase, Billig, Ranker, Hobbs, Fraser, McAuliffe and Pearson. Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: The Department of Licensing issues vari- ous special vehicle license plates that may be used in lieuSenate 44 5 House 82 15 (House amended)Senate 41 6 (Senate concurred)SB 5088 168of standard plates. Generally, special license plates that are sponsored by a governmental or nonprofit organizationhave an additional fee that is due annually, with the pro- ceeds benefiting a specific organization or purpose. Otherspecial license plates are ava ilable to individuals that meet certain requirements. One su ch special plate is the Gold Star license plate, which may be issued to the mother, fa- ther, widow or widower, a biological or adopted child, anadoptive parent, a stepparent, and a foster parent or otheradult that is legally responsi ble for a member of the armed forces who died while in service and as a result of that ser-vice. Gold Star license plates are issued without paymentof any license plate fees and ar e replaced free of charge if the plate is lost, stolen, damaged, defaced, or destroyed. Summary: The list of individuals who are eligible to re- ceive a Gold Star license plate is expanded to include a sib-ling of a member of the armed forces who died while inservice and as a result of that service. Widows or widowers with Gold Star license plates are exempt from all taxes and fees that are due annually at ve-hicle registration for one personal-use motor vehicle. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5088 C 12 L 15 Concerning a geological hazards assessment. By Senators and Conway;by request of Commissioner of Public Lands. Senate Committee on Natu ral Resources & Parks House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Background: The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) maintains a state geological survey that includesexamination of economic products, soils, water resources,and road building materials; and preparation of geologicaland economic maps. The geological survey must assessand map volcanic, seismic, la ndslide, and tsunami hazards in Washington. Light detection and ranging (lidar) mapping is a re- mote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges - vari able distances - to the earth. A lidar instrument principally consists of a laser, a scan-ner, and a specialized GPS receiver. Airplanes and heli-copters are the most comm only used platforms for acquiring lidar data over broad areas. Two types of lidarare topographic - land, and bathymetric - seafloor systems allow sc ientists and mapping profes-sionals to examine both natural and manmade environments with accuracy. The survey and map account holds funds DNR may use for the state base mapping system and land boundarymaps. Summary: With respect to the geological survey, DNR must apply the best practicable technology, including li-dar, to identify and map geological hazards and to estimatepotential hazard consequen ces and occurrence probabili- ties. DNR must coordinate with state and local govern-ment agencies to compile ex isting data, including hazard maps and geotechnical reports, and use the best practica-ble technology to acquire and process new data or update deficient data. DNR must create and maintain a publiclyavailable database of the maps and data it collects. Activities DNR performs for the state geological sur- vey are added as an allowable purpose for funds in the sur- veys and maps account.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5100 C 189 L 15 Concerning the processing of certain motor vehicle-relat- ed violations applicable to rental cars. By Senators Hobbs and King.Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Under current law, local jurisdictions and the Washington State Department of Transportation (WS-DOT) may report the following violations to the Depart-ment of Licensing (DOL) fo r purposes of withholding vehicle registration renewals applicable to the vehicle at issue: two or more unpaid parking violations; two or more unpaid au tomated traffic safety camera violations; two or more unpaid automated school bus safety cam- era violations; and one or more unpaid civil penalties for toll violations. However, these reporting provisions do not apply if the vehicle at issue is a rented or leased vehicle. Rental car businesses are re lieved of liability for the violations by forwarding the renter's name and address tothe jurisdiction or WSDOT in a timely manner. Local courts may refer un paid monetary obligations attached to parking or camera violations to a collections agency, which include viola tions involving a rented or leased vehicle. This provision applies to whomever is ul-Senate 48 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 46 0 (Senate concurred)Senate 48 0 House 97 0SB 5101 169timately liable for the violation - the rental car business or the renter. Summary: The exception for rented or leased vehicles from the DOL reporting process for unpaid parking, cam- era, and toll violations is removed. This has the effect ofallowing local jurisdictions and WSDOT to report unpaid parking, camera, or toll viol ations, for which rental car businesses are liable, to DOL for purposes of withholding vehicle registration renewals applicable to the vehicle at issue. Consistent with language found in the automated cam- era statutes, language is added clarifying that if a rental carbusiness forwards the renter's name and address to the ju- risdiction, liability for an un paid parking infraction trans- fers to the renter.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5101 C 80 L 15 Modifying mental status evaluation provisions. By Senators Padden and O'Ban.Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: If a court finds that reasonable grounds ex- ist to believe that an offender is a person with a mental ill- ness and that this condition is likely to have influenced the offense, the court may order an offender whose sentenceincludes community placement or community supervision to undergo a mental status evaluation and to participate inavailable outpatient mental health treatment. The order must be based on a presentence report and any mental sta-tus evaluations that may have been filed with the court to determine the offender's compet ency or eligibility for a de- fense of insanity. In State v. Robert Locke (2013), the trial court sen- tenced Locke to 12 months' confinement and ordered amental health evaluation an d treatment as a sentencing condition without first obtainin g the required presentence report. The state conceded the error and the case was re-manded to the trial court to vacate the sentence condition. Summary: The order for mental status evaluation and treatment may, but is not required to, be based on the pre-sentence report.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015SB 5104 C 81 L 15 Concerning the possession or use of alcohol and con- trolled substances in sentencing provisions. By Senator Padden.Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Public Safety Background: As part of any felony sentence, the court may impose crime-related prohibitions. When the courtfinds that the offender has a chemical dependency issue that contributed to the person's offense, the court may, as acondition of the sentence, order the offender to participate in rehabilitative programs or perform affirmative conductreasonably related to the circumstances of the crime. In State v. Warnock (2013), there was ample evidence of the offender's alcohol intoxication during the offense,but there was no evidence an d no court finding regarding the abuse of any other substance. The trial court ordered achemical dependency evalua tion and treatment. The Court of Appeals remanded th e case to the trial court to impose only an alcohol evaluation and treatment. Summary: Crime-related prohibitions are defined to in- clude prohibition on the use or possession of alcohol, can- nabis, or controlled substances if the court finds that any chemical or substance abuse c ontributed to the offense. If a court finds that any chemic al dependency contributed to the offense, the court may orde r participation in rehabilita- tive programs for alcohol, can nabis, or controlled sub- stances as a condition of the sentence regardless of the particular substance that cont ributed to the offense. The court may impose a prohibition on the use or possession of alcohol, cannabis products, or controlled substances re- gardless of whether a chemical dependency evaluation isordered.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5107 C 291 L 15 Encouraging the establishmen t of therapeutic courts. By Senators Padden, Pedersen, Roach, O'Ban, Darneille and Benton. Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on JudiciaryHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: Many courts in Washington have specially designed court calendars or dockets that provide an alter-native to traditional court processes in particular kinds ofcases. Often called problem-solving courts or therapeuticSenate 47 2 House 95 2 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 47 0 House 97 0Senate 49 0 House 97 0SB 5107 170courts, these alternative cour ts commonly require intense, judicially supervised treatment with the goal of reducingrecidivism. Participation in an alternative court program is voluntary and only open to specific defendants or re- spondents who fit qualifying criteria. There is typically anadvantageous result for comp letion of the program, such as dismissal of the underlying charges. Although there are a wide variety of therapeutic courts in operation throughout the st ate, the requirements for cer- tain courts are outlined in st atute, including drug courts, driving under the influence (DUI) courts, mental healthcourts, and juvenile gang cour ts. The statutes describing these courts contain similar minimum requirements forparticipation. While there is some variation, a defendant is generally ineligible to participate in a therapeutic court if the defen- dant is currently charged with or convicted of a sex of-fense, serious violent offense, an offense involving afirearm, or a crime during which the defendant caused aperson's death or inflicted great bodily injury. In addition, the statutes contain common funding language, requiringthat any jurisdiction seeking state funding for therapeutic court must first exhaust av ailable federal funding and match allocated state monies wi th local cash or in-kind re- sources. In 2013 the Legislature en couraged the establishment of effective specialty and therapeutic courts and recom-mended guidelines for operatin g such courts. That legis- lation also included a requirement that any jurisdiction establishing a specialty or th erapeutic court endeavor to incorporate certain treatment court principles and bestpractices as recognized by state and national treatment court agencies and organizations in structuring a particularprogram. Additionally, the Superior Court Judges' Asso-ciation and the District and Municipal Court Judges' Asso-ciation were encouraged to invite other appropriateorganizations and convene a workgroup to examine andmake recommendations regardin g the structure of all spe- cialty and therapeutic courts in Washington. The two as- sociations created the workgroup and issued a reportincluding recommended legislation. Summary: Current statutes regarding therapeutic courts are repealed, including the sections governing drug courts,DUI courts, mental health courts, and juvenile gangcourts, among others. Most of the provisions of the re-pealed sections are consolidated and reincorporated into a new chapter. Miscellaneous other sections of repealedstatutes are reincorporated into different sections of theRCW. The Legislature recognizes the inherent authority of the judicial branch to establis h therapeutic courts and the utility of such courts, and cites specific examples of differ- ent types of therapeutic court programs. Therapeutic court and specialty court are both defined as a court utilizingprogramming structured to reduce recidivism or other ad-verse outcomes, and increase rehabilitation through theuse of continuous and intense judicially supervised treat- ment and the appropriate use of services, sanctions, and in-centives. Every trial and juvenile co urt is authorized and en- couraged to establish and operate therapeutic courts. Ju-risdictions establishing therap eutic courts must endeavor to incorporate a list of best practices largely mirroringthose appearing in current law. Promising practices,emerging best practices, and research-based practices, asdefined in the act, are author ized where determined by the court to be appropriate. R estrictions are placed on the ability of therapeutic courts to enforce or apply foreign law. Currently operating ther apeutic courts continue to be authorized. In criminal cases, the consen t of the prosecutor is re- quired. Therapeutic courts re tain the discretion to estab- lish processes for eligibility and admission, andtherapeutic court judges retain the discretion to decline to accept a particular case into the court. Except under spe-cial findings by the court, defe ndants are inel igible for par- ticipation in a therapeu tic court if they are: charged with or have been previously convicted of a serious violent offense or sex offense; charged with an offense involving actual , threatened, or attempted discharge of a firearm in furtherance ofthe offense; charged with or have been previously convicted of vehicular homicide; or charged with or have been previously convicted of an offense alleging substantia l bodily harm, great bodily harm, or death of another person. Jurisdictions may seek federal funding and must match appropriated state fund s with local cash or in-kind resources. Counties that impose a sales and use tax for the purpose of providing for the operation or delivery ofchemical dependency or ment al health treatment programs and services to establish and operate a therapeutic courtfor dependency proceedings mu st do so. Monies allocated by the state may be used to supplement, not to supplantother federal, state, or loca l funds for therapeutic courts. Until June 30, 2016, no match is required for state moniesexpended for administrative and overhead costs. Any jurisdiction that has es tablished more than one therapeutic court may combin e the functions of those courts into a single therapeu tic court. Individual trial courts are authorized and enco uraged to establish multi-ju- risdictional partnerships, inte r-local agreements, or both, to enhance or expand the coverage area of a therapeuticcourt.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 July 1, 2018 (Section 9) Senate 49 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred)SB 5119 171SB 5119 C 109 L 15 Providing authority for two or more nonprofit corpora- tions to participate in a joint self-insurance program cov-ering property or liability risks. By Senators Angel and Mullet.Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance House Committee on Business & Financial ServicesHouse Committee on General Government & Information Technology Background: Local government entities have the author- ity to individually or jointly self-insure against risks, joint- ly purchase insurance or reinsu rance, and to contract for risk management, claims, and administrative services. Inaddition, subject to specifie d conditions, local government entities may enter into joint self-insurance programs withsimilar entities from other states. In 2004 the Legislature authorized nonprofit corpora- tions to form self-insurance risk pools with other nonprofitcorporations or local govern ment entities for property or liability risks. Nonprofit corpor ations that form self-insur- ance risk pools are subject to the same restrictions and reg-ulations as are local government entities that form self-insurance risk pools, except that nonprofit corporationsare not authorized to enter into joint self-insurance pro- grams with nonprofit corporations from other states. The Risk Manager within the Department of Enter- prise Services is responsible for the regulation of these self-insurance activities and may adopt rules governingtheir operations. Summary: The authority for nonprofit corporations to join a self-insurance program with other nonprofit corpo-rations is removed from chap ter 48.62 RCW and placed in its own chapter to clarify that nonprofit corporations and local governments are separate and cannot commingle forthe purposes of creating insurance risk pools. Nonprofit corporations are authorized to enter into joint self-insurance programs with similar entities from other states, subject to specified conditions.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015SB 5120 C 82 L 15 Concerning school district dissolutions. By Senator Parlette.Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education House Committee on Education Background: Educational Service Districts (ESDs) are regional agencies that provide services to school districtsand assist the Office of Superi ntendent of Public Instruc- tion and State Board of Education. There are nine ESDs.Each ESD has a regional comm ittee on school district or- ganization composed of registered voters in the ESD.There is a statutory public process that the regional com-mittee must follow to transfer school district territory fromone district to another, cons olidate one or more school dis- tricts with one or more school districts, or dissolve aschool district and annex the te rritory to another district or districts. If a school district's enrollment drops below five stu- dents in kindergarten through eighth grade in the priorschool year, the ESD must repo rt this information to the regional committee which must then dissolve the school district. The school district is then annexed into another school district or districts. Summary: The criteria for the dissolution of a school dis- trict based on student enrollm ent is changed to require three consecutive years of an average enrollment of fewerthan five students in kindergarten through eighth grade.

By Senators Kohl-Welles, Ri vers, Bailey, Pedersen, Liias, McAuliffe, Frockt, Chase, Keiser and Hatfield. Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & WellnessHouse Committee on Commerce & GamingHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: In 2012 voters approved Initiative 502 which established a regulatory system for the production, processing, and distribution of limited amounts of mari-juana for non-medical purposes. Under this system, theLiquor Control Board (LCB) is sues licenses to marijuana producers, processors, and retailers and adopts standardsfor the regulation of these operations. A marijuana producer licen se permits a licensee to produce, harvest, trim, dry, cure, and pack age marijuanaSenate 48 0 House 97 0Senate 43 4 House 89 8SB 5122 172into lots for sale at wholesale to marijuana processor licensees and to other mariju ana producer licensees. A marijuana producer can also produce and sell marijuana plants, seed, and plant tissue culture to other marijuana producer licensees. A marijuana processor license allowsthe licensee to process, packag e, and label usable marijua- na and marijuana-infused produc ts for sale at wholesale to marijuana retailers. A mar ijuana retailer license allows the licensee to sell only usab le marijuana, marijuana-in- fused products, and marijuana pa raphernalia at retail in re- tail outlets to persons 21 years of age and older. None ofthese licenses permit a person to grow marijuana for re- search purposes. The Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act was adopted by the Legislature in 1979. It established aControlled Substances Therapeutic Research Program(Program) to be administered by the Pharmacy QualityAssurance Commission. The Program was limited to can- cer chemotherapy and radiology patients and glaucomapatients who are certified by a patient qualification reviewcommittee as being involved in a life-threatening or sense- threatening situation. The Program does not grow mari- juana for its use. It is perm itted to use marijuana that has been confiscated by local or state law enforcement agen- cies. In 2011 the Legislature authorized both the University of Washington (UW) and Washington State University(WSU) to conduct scientific research on the efficacy andsafety of administering marijuana as part of medical treat-ment. As part of this research, UW and WSU were autho-rized to develop and conduct studies to ascertain thegeneral medical safety and efficacy of marijuana and per-mitted to develop medical gu idelines for the appropriate administration and use of marijuana. No provision wasmade for either university to grow marijuana or to other-wise obtain marijuana. The Life Sciences Discovery Fund (LSDF) was estab- lished in 2005 to foster grow th of the state's life sciences sector and improve the health and economic wellbeing ofthe State's residents. LSDF invests monies from the Mas-ter Tobacco Settlement Agreement in research and devel-opment across Washington th at demonstrate the strongest potential for delivering health and economic returns to the state. Summary: A marijuana research license is established to permit a licensee to produce and possess marijuana to testchemical potency and compos of marijuana-derived drug products; con-duct research on the efficacy and safety of administering marijuana as part of a medi cal treatment; and conduct ge- nomic or agricultural research. Marijuana research license applicants must submit to LSDF a description of the r esearch it intends to conduct. LSDF must review the project and determine if it meetsone of the permitted research purposes. The application isrejected if LSDF does not find that the project is for a per- mitted research purpose. A licensee may only sell ma rijuana it produces to oth- er marijuana research licensee s. The licensee may con- tract with UW or WSU to perfo rm research in conjunction with the university. The application fee for a marijuana research license is $250. The annual fee for issuance and renewal of the li-cense is $1,000. Fifty percen t of the application fee and renewal fees must be deposited to the LSDF.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5122 C 83 L 15 Concerning precollege placement measures. By Senators Kohl-Welles, Frockt, Liias, Bailey and McAuliffe. Senate Committee on Higher Education House Committee on Higher Education Background: In 2013, under SB 5712, the Legislature di- rected the State Board for Community and Technical Col-leges (SBCTC) to encourag e colleges to use multiple measures to determine whether a student must enroll in a precollege course. Additionally the SBCTC must requirecolleges to post information about available options for course placement on their website and in admissions ma-terials. In September 2014, the six public baccalaureate insti- tutions and SBCTC agreed to use the eleventh grade Smarter Balanced Assessment scores of level three or fourto enroll first-year college students who have been admit- ted into entry-level colleg e math and English courses without further placement testin g. The agreement applies to high school graduating classes of 2016 through 2018,and then will be renewed or mo dified. Colleges, universi- ties, and high schools are also designing math and Englishlanguage arts tran sition courses for high school seniors who did not score at a level three or above. Several highschools are already piloting th e curriculum. Seniors who earn a B or above in the classes will also be able to bypass placement testing at many colleges. Under current law, the Washington Student Achieve- ment Council (WSAC) must co llaborate with appropriate state agencies and stakeholders to improve student transi- tions and success, which includes but is not limited to, set-ting minimum college admissions standards. Summary: The public baccalaureate institutions may use multiple measures to determ ine whether a student must enroll in a precollege course including, but not limited to, placement tests, the SAT, hi gh school transcripts, collegeSenate 45 3 House 95 0SB 5125 173transcripts, or initial class performance.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5125 C 260 L 15 Increasing district court civil jurisdiction. By Senators Padden, Darneille, Roach and Hatfield.Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: The Legislature limits the district court's jurisdiction based on the case's value, or the amount at is-sue, in specific civil cases. The Legislature adjusts the case value limit periodically as the economy changes. In 2008, the most rece nt change, the Legi slature raised the civil case jurisdiction from $5 0,000 per case to $75,000 per case exclusive of interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. Summary: The value of a civil claim or the amount at is- sue in the case, must not ex ceed $100,000 exclusive of in- terest, costs, and attorneys' fees to meet the district court'samount in controversy jurisdiction limit. The $100,000jurisdictional limit applies to each claimant.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5139 C 226 L 15 Concerning building code standards for certain buildings four or more stories high.

By Senators Dammeier, Beck er, Bailey, Rivers, Brown, Parlette and O'Ban. Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on State Government Background: Bree Collaborative . The Dr. Robert Bree established in 2011 bythe Washington State Legislat ure to provide a mechanism through which public and private health care stakeholderscan work together to impr ove quality, health outcomes, and cost effectiveness of care in this state. The Collabora- tive must annually identify up to three health care services for which there are substantial variations in practice pat- terns or high utilization trends in Washington. Upon the identification of these health care services, the Collabora- tive must identify evidence-b ased best practices to im- prove the quality and reduce va riation in the use of service. The Collaborative must also id entify strategies to increase the use of the evidence-based practices. The Collaborative must report to the Administrator of the Health Care Authority (A dministrator) on the selected health services and the proposed strategies. If endorsed bythe Administrator, all state-purchased health care pro-grams, including health carriers and third party adminis-trators that contract with state programs, must implementthe evidence-based guidelines and strategies. To acquire expertise in the particular health care ser- vice areas under review, the Collaborative must add mem-bers or establish clinical co mmittees. Proceedings of the Collaborative must be open to the public and notice of meetings must be provided at least 20 days in advance.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5147 C 209 L 15 Establishing a medicaid baseline health assessment and monitoring the medicaid population's health. By Senate Committee on Hea lth Care (originally spon- sored by Senators Becker, Bailey, Brown and Rivers). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: The Legislature has passed a number of bills related to performance measures for Medicaid cover- age: The 2013 legislative budget included a requirement that the Health Care Auth ority (HCA) contracts with managed care organizations must incorporate accountability measures that monitor patient health and improved health outcom es, with an expectation that each patient receive a wellness examination that documents the baseline health status and allows for monitoring of health im provements and outcome measures. The 2013 Legislature also passed ESHB 1519 requir- ing outcomes and performan ce measures for the array of Medicaid programs contracted by HCA and the Department of Social and Health Services, which include medical, behavioral health services, chemicaldependency services, and long-term care services and supports. The agencies ar e required to include com- mon measures in contracts by July 1, 2015. The 2014 Legislature passed E2SHB 2572 to improve health care purchasing and transform the health caredelivery system. The bill created a Performance Measure Coordinating Committee to recommend standard statewide measures of health performance by January 1, 2015, that can be used to inform publicand private health care purchasers. The Performance Measure Coordinating Committee provided recommendations to the HCA in December that include measures for preventio n, chronic illness, and acute care. There are 52 different measures categorized by pop-ulation measures; clinical measures for children, adoles-cents, and adults by health plans, primary care medicalgroups, and hospitals; and meas ures related to health care costs. Summary: The HCA and DSHS contracts with service coordination organizations mu st include the outcomes and performance measures developed by the PerformanceMeasure Coordinating Committe e, and each contract must require an initial health scree n be conducted for new en- rollees, consistent with the terms and conditions of the contract to implement the he alth screen required by the 2013-15 legislative budget. By December 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, HCA and the DSHS must report to the Legislature on the perfor- mance measures. The report mu st also include the follow- ing: the number of Medicaid clients enrolled over the pre- vious year; the number of enrollees who received a baseline health status measurement over the previous year; an analysis of trends in health improvement for Med- icaid enrollees; and recommendations for impr oving the health of Medic- aid enrollees. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5154 C 261 L 15 Concerning registered sex or kidnapping offenders. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senator Hargrove). Senate Committee on Law & Justice Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Public Safety Background: Any adult or juvenile offender residing in the state who has been convicte d of a sex offense must reg- ister with the county sherif f upon release from confine- ment. The offender must pr ovide complete information to the county sheriff including the offender's address, aliasesSenate 45 4 House 97 0 Senate 49 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 45 0 (Senate concurred)SSB 5154 175used, place of employment, so cial security number, photo- graph, and fingerprints. Beginning in 2008, all registeredoffenders also must provide a DNA sample. This require-ment is not part of the registration requirements and there-fore the failure to provide a DNA sample is not a failure to register. The End of Sentence Review Committee (ESRC), chaired by the Department of Corrections, classifies sexoffenders being released from Washington correctional in- stitutions according to their ri sk of reoffense within the community. ESRC classifies each offender as a level I -low risk, level II - moderate risk, or level III - high risk, and then forwards this classif ication to the county sheriff in the jurisdiction where the offender will reside. The sheriff may adopt ESRC's risk le vel or establish a different level. If ESRC has not had the opportunity to classify asex offender, such as when the offender has moved toWashington State from another state, the sheriff's officewill perform its own classificatio n of the offender's risk. The risk level classification dictates the level of notice tothe public and the amount of information the sheriff mayrelease about the offender. The Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs (WASPC) operates an electronic statewide unifiedsex offender notification and registration program whichcontains a database of all registered sex offenders in thestate of Washington. WASPC creates and maintains a pub-lic website that posts all leve l II and level III sex offenders. Law enforcement may also disclose information about of-fenders classified as level I upon the request of any victimor witness to the offense or any community member wholives near the offender. For level III sex offenders, law en- forcement must additionally pub lish notice in at least one newspaper in the area of the sex offender's registered ad-dress. An adult sex offender may petition the superior court to be relieved of the duty to register when the person has spent ten consecutive years in the community without be- ing convicted of a disqualifying offense during that timeperiod. If the person is requir ed to register for a federal or out-of-state conviction, the person may petition after 15 consecutive years in the comm unity without a disqualify- ing offense. A person may not petition for relief from reg- istration if the person has been determined to be a sexually violent predator or convicted as an adult of a sex offense that is a class A felony that was committed with forcible compulsion. In 1994 Congress passed the Jacob Wetterling Act. That act required states to in stitute lifetime registration re- quirements for offenders convicted of specified sex of-fenses or face financial pena lties to the federal Byrne Grant. In 2001 the Legislature passed the Jacob Wetter-ling provisions requiring life time registration for further classes of offenders. Those provisions expired on July 1,2012.Summary: In assigning risk levels, an offender must be classified as: level I - if the person's risk assessment and other rele- vant factors indicate that the person is at a low risk to sexually reoffend within the community at large; level II - if the person's risk assessment and other rel- evant factors indicate that the person is at a moderate risk to sexually reoffend within the community at large; or level III - if the person's risk assessment and other relevant factors indicate that the person is at a high risk to sexually reoffend within the community at large. A person required to register as a sex offender who in- tends to travel outside the Un ited States must notify the county sheriff where the person is registered at least 21days prior to travel. The notice must include identifying information and details regardin g the person's travel. The county sheriff must notify th e United States Marshals Ser- vice as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification.Offenders who travel outside the United States due to awork or family emergency, or who travel routinely outside of the United States for work, must submit written noticein person at least 24 hours in advance of travel instead ofthe 21 days, as is required fo r all other registered offend- ers. If a registered offender plans to travel outside theUnited States and the plans to travel are cancelled or post-poned, the offender must no tify the sheriff no later than three days after the cancella tion or postponement, or on the scheduled departure date, whichever is earlier. Tempo- rary residents visiting from another state or country whowill be in the state longer than ten days must register theirtemporary addresses with the co unty sheriff within three days of arrival. The crime of refusal to prov ide DNA is established. A person is guilty of the refusal to provide DNA if the person has a duty to register and re fuses to comply with a request for a DNA sample as required by law. The refusal to pro-vide DNA is a gross misdemeanor. The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction must publish on its website educational materials devel- oped in conjunction with part ner agencies for parents and other interested family memb ers in recognizing character- istics of sex offenders and preventing victimization. Upon receipt of a public records request for sex and kidnapping offender information, the Washington Associ-ation of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs (WASPC) must referthe requestor, in writing, to the appropriate law enforce- ment agency or agencies fo r submission of the request. WASPC has no further obligation to respond to such pub-lic records requests. A number of other changes are made that close various loopholes or provide clarifica tion with regard to sex of- fender registration and notification including the follow-ing:SSB 5156 176 a tribal conviction for an offense for which the person would be required to register as a sex offender while residing in the reservation of conviction is defined as a sex offense requiring registration under Washingtonlaw; law enforcement may di sclose information about offenders classified as level I upon the request of anyperson seeking informatio n regarding a specifically named offender; when a sex offender moves to another county, the offender must register within three business days of moving with the county sh eriff of the county into which the offender has moved and must providesigned written notice of the change of address to the county sheriff with whom the offender last registered. The sheriff with whom the offender last registered isresponsible for verification of the offender until the offender registers in the new county; when an offender is cl assified as a level III, law enforcement must issue a new release, but is notrequired to actively publis h notice in the newspaper; law enforcement agencies may develop a process to allow an offender to petition for review of theoffender's assigned risk level classification; law enforcement may remove a sex offender from the registry if an administrativ e authority in the person's state of conviction has made an individualized deter- mination that the person is not required to register; the court's decision to relieve a sex offender of the duty to register does not constitute a certificate of rehabilitation for the purposes of restoring a person's right to possess a firearm; a person may not petition for relief from registration if the person has been de termined to be a sexually violent predator; when a person who is required to register is placed on partial confinement in the community, the person must register with the county sheriff while on partialconfinement; a person convicted in another state as a juvenile may petition for relief from registration in the county inwhich the person resides; and expired provisions that were passed in order to com- ply with the federal Jacob Wetterling Act areremoved. The Sex Offender Policy Board must review and make findings and recommendations regarding the followingfour issues: disclosure to the public of information compiled and submitted for the purposes of sex offender and kid- napping offender registries that is currently held bypublic agencies, including the relationship between current laws on public disclosure; any other best practices adopted by or under consider- ation in other states regarding public disclosure ofinformation compiled and submitted for the purposes of sex offender and kidnapping offender registries; ability of registered sex offenders and kidnapping offenders to petition for revi ew of their assigned risk level classification and whether such a review process should be conducted accordi ng to a uniform statewide standard; and the guidelines established by a sex offender policy workgroup addressing sex offender community noti-fication, including whether and how public access to the guidelines can be improved. The Sex Offender Policy Board must report its find- ings and recommendations to the Governor and to the ap- propriate committees of the Legislature on or beforeDecember 1, 2015.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5156 C 110 L 15 Concerning the disclosure of information regarding eleva- tors and other conveyances in certain real estate transac-tions. By Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor (originally sponsored by Senators Keiser, Warnick and Conway). Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor House Committee on Business & Financial Services Background: Disclosure Statement Required in Real Es- tate Transfers . Generally, a real estate seller must deliver a real property transfer disclosure statement to the buyerno later than five business days after mutual acceptance ofa written purchase agreement, unless an exception applies or the buyer waives the righ t to receive the disclosure statement. Within three busin ess days of receipt of the dis- closure statement, the buyer may approve and accept thedisclosure statement or rescind the purchase agreement. Disclosure Statement Questions . The disclosure state- ments are provided in statut e for commercial, and unim- proved and improved residential real property. Improvedresidential real property generally includes real propertywith one to four residentia l dwelling units, a condomini- um, a timeshare, or a mobile or manufactured home. Thedisclosure statement provides a number of specific ques-tions requiring the seller to respond by checking yes, no, or don't know, and to provide some explanations.

Elevator Regulation . The Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) regulates conveyances, which include el-evators and other elevating devices. L&I must inspect andpermit all new, altered, or relocated conveyances operatedexclusively for single-family use in private residences.Annual inspections are not re quired for private residence conveyances operated exclus ively for single-family use unless the owner requ ests the inspection. Summary: The real property transfer disclosure state- ment for improved residential real property is expanded to include the disclosure of any defects in elevators, incline elevators, stairway chair lifts, and wheelchair lifts.

By Senate Committee on Law & Justice (originally spon- sored by Senators McCoy and Fraser). Senate Committee on Law & Justice Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Public Safety Background: In 2007 a young woman named Kelsey Smith died after being kidnapped; she had a cell phone thatmight have revealed her loca tion in time for emergency re- sponse, but law enforcement wa s unable to obtain her cell phone's location from the te lecommunications service pro- vider until more than three days had elapsed. Ms. Smith'sfamily has established a founda tion in her name that works to pass state laws to provid e law enforcement with a way to quickly ascertain the loca tion of a wireless telecommu- nications device if a person has been determined, by lawenforcement, to be at risk of death or serious physical harm due to being kidnapped or missing. Federal law prohibits providers of electronic commu- nication services to the pub lic from knowingly divulging records or other information pe rtaining to a customer, ex- cept under specific circumstances, such as pursuant to awarrant. Another circumstance in which providers are au-thorized to disclose records or information pertaining to customers is disclosure to a governmental entity, if theprovider, in good faith, believes that an emergency involv-ing danger of death or serious physical injury to any per- son requires disclosure, with out delay, of information relating to the emergency. A number of states have enact-ed laws to regulate or encourage the disclosure by provid-ers of cell phone location information. The Fourth Amendm ent of the United States Constitu- tion and Article I, section 7 of the state Constitution pro-hibits the government from conducting a warrantlesssearch, unless an exception ap plies. Two exceptions from the warrant requirement that the court recognizes are when a party consents to the search and when disclosure is nec- essary without waiting for a cour t order, due to exigent cir- cumstances such as an emergency involving immediatedanger of death or serious bodily injury. Although somefederal court decisions have held that the government doesnot need a warrant under the Fourth Amendment to obtain cell phone location data, the analysis under the state Con-stitution may be different. Currently Washington prose- cuting attorneys advise law en forcement to obtain search warrants before requesting cell phone location data fromservice providers. Summary: Wireless telecommunica tions providers must provide call location informa tion for the telecommunica- tions device of a user when requested by a law enforce-ment agency responding to an emergency involving risk ofdeath or serious physical harm. Law enforcement agen-cies may not request this information for any other pur-pose. A law enforcement officer making a request for calllocation information be on duty during the course of offi- cial duties at the time of the request. The law enforcementagency must verify there is no relationship or conflict of interest between the law enforcement officer responding,investigating or making the re quest, and either the person requesting the call location in formation or the person for whom the call location inform ation is being requested. Law enforcement is prohibited from distributing cellphone information to any other party, except to first re- sponders responding to the emergency situation. Law en-forcement agencies must chec k with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Crime Information Center, and any otherdatabases to determine if the person requesting the infor-mation has a history of domestic violence or stalking, or acourt order restricting contact, or if either the person re-questing the information or th e person for whom the call location information is being requested is participating in the address confidentiality pr ogram. Law enforcement agencies may not provide call location information to any person where there is a reas onable belief that the person has a history of domestic violence or stalking, or there is acourt order restricting contact, or the person is participat-ing in the address confidential ity program, unless pursuant to a court order. No cause of action may be brought in anycourt against wireless teleco mmunications providers for providing call location inform ation while acting in good faith and in accordance with this act.Senate 42 6 House 97 0SSB 5163 178All wireless telecommunications providers registered to do business in Washington and all resellers of wirelesstelecommunications services must submit emergency con- tact information to the Washington State Patrol (WSP),and submit new information immediately if there is anychange. WSP must maintain a database with emergencycontact information for all of the wireless telecommunica- tions providers and make th e information immediately available upon a request from law enforcement. WSP may adopt rules as needed to fulfill the requirements of this act. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5163 C 210 L 15 Providing for educational da ta on students from military families. By Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Educa- tion (originally sponsored McCoy, Mullet, Conway, Fain, Chase and Darneille). Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education House Committee on Education Background: According to a recent report by the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), Washing- ton serves 32,000 military-connected students. OSPI is required to develop standards for the school data system. OSPI must de velop a reporting format and instructions for school distri cts to collect and submit data on student demographics. This data must be disaggregat-ed by distinct ethnic categori es within racial subgroups but not by students from a military family. The K-12 Data Governance Group is a workgroup within OSPI that oversees the development and imple-mentation of a K-12 education data system for financial,student, and educator data. In 2007 the United States Department of Education provided final guidance on the reporting of racial and eth-nic data. The guidelines allow individuals to self-identifytheir ethnicity and race and permits individuals to select more than one race and/or et hnicity. The guidelines ex- pand reporting options to seve n categories: American In- dian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,White, and Two or More Races. Summary: By the 2016-17 school year, OSPI's reporting format and instructions for sch ool districts to collect and submit data must include da ta on students from military families. Students from mi litary families means studentswith a parent or guardian wh o is in the following two cat- egories: a member of the active duty United States armed forces; and a member of the reserves of the United States armed forces or a member of the Washington NationalGuard. Data must be collected and submitted separately for these two categories. The K-12 Data Governance Group must develop best practice guidelines for the colle ction and regular updating of this data on students from military families. Collection and updating of th is data must use the Unit- ed States Department of Education 2007 Race and Ethnic-ity Reporting Guidelines, incl uding the sub-racial and sub- ethnic categories within tho se guidelines, with the follow- ing modifications: further disaggregation of the Black category to differ- entiate students of African origin and students native to the United States with African ancestors; further disaggregation of countries of origin for Asian students; further disaggregation of the White category to include sub-ethnic categories for Eastern European nationalities that have si gnificant populations in Washington; and for students who report as multiracial, collection of their racial and ethnic combination of categories OSPI must conduct an analysis of the average number of students from military fa milies who are special educa- tion students statewide, by sc hool district, and by school. However, to protect the privac y of students, the data from schools and districts that have fewer than ten studentsfrom military families who ar e special education students must not be reported. OSPI mu st report its analysis to the Legislature by December 31, 2017.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5165 C 22 L 15 Authorizing palliative care in conjunction with treatment or management of serious or life-threatening illness.

Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & WellnessSenate 48 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 49 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 48 0 House 67 30 (House amended)Senate 44 1 (Senate concurred)SSB 5166 179Background: Palliative care is specialized medical care for a person with serious illn ess that is focused on provid- ing relief from symptoms an d improving the quality of life. Services can be provided to patients in any stage ofillness to assist with symptoms such as pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, or depression . Palliative care is provided in many settings including homes, hospitals, hospices, nursing facilities, and assisted living facilities. Hospice care includes a set of services that are gener- ally provided to a person w ith a life expectancy of six months. Palliative care can be a component of hospice care but is not limited to term inally ill patients. Medicare recently modified their hosp ice care benefit to allow pa- tients to concurrently recei ve palliative care and curative care. Health plans licensed as h ealth care service contrac- tors and disability insurance contractors must offer option- al health coverage for home health care and hospice care.Coverage is focused on persons who are homebound andwould otherwise require hosp italization. The focus on homebound patients has created some concerns when pro-viding palliative care. Summary: The home health care and hospice care benefit provided by health plans licensed as health care servicecontractors and disability insu rance contractors is modi- fied. Patients seeking palliativ e care in conjunction with treatment or management of serious or life-threatening ill-ness need not be homebound in order to be eligible for coverage.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5166 C 191 L 15 Concerning the management of forage fish resources.

Senate Committee on Natural Resources & Parks Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Agriculture & Natural ResourcesHouse Committee on Capital Budget Background: The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), among other duties, must protect andmanage fish and wildlife by establishing the time, place, manner, and methods used to harvest or enjoy fish andwildlife. Generally a recrea tional license is required to hunt, fish, or take wildlife or seaweed. A recreational fish-ing or shellfish license is not required, however, for carp,smelt, and crawfish, and a hu nting license is not required for bullfrogs.WDFW describes forage fish as a variety of small schooling fish that serve as fo od for many species of fish, birds, and marine mammals. Several forage fish species are fished recreationally and commercially in Washington.Forage fish species present in state waters include thenorthern anchovy, pacific sa nd lance - also known as can- dlefish, pacific herring, paci fic sardine, and a variety of smelt species. Summary: WDFW and the Department of Natural Re- sources (DNR) must collaborate to conduct a survey ofsurf smelt and sand lance spawning grounds throughoutthe Puget Sound, incl uding the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The habitat survey must be completed and accessible by thepublic by June 30, 2017. To the extent possible, the surveyshould be conducted using Veterans Conservation Corpscrews. Provides legislativ e intent that DNR and WDFW complete the surf smelt and sand lance spawning grounds survey with funds specifi cally appropriated from the state's capital budget for the 2015-17 biennium. Also by June 30, 2017, WDFW must conduct a mid- water trawl survey throughout the Puget Sound to evaluate the prevalence of adults of all species of forage fish.WDFW must integrate survey results into existing Puget Sound ecosystem assessments to assist in managing andconserving forage fish species and the species that prey onthem.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5175 C 23 L 15 Regarding telemedicine. By Senate Committee on Hea lth Care (originally spon- sored by Senators and Mullet). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & WellnessHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: Advances in technolo gy, communications, and data management have resulted in new approaches tothe delivery of medical care se rvices. Telemedicine makes use of interactive technology and may include real-time interactive consultations, st ore and forward technology, remote monitoring of patients, and case-base teleconfer-encing. Telemedicine services are currently provided fora number telepsychiatry, s, teleradiology, and teledermatology, among others.Senate 47 0 House 97 0Senate 45 4 House 93 4 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred)SB 5176 180The Medical Quality Assu rance Commission (Com- mission) recently adopted gu idelines on the appropriate use of telemedicine which describe how telemedicine is tobe defined, supervised, regulated, and disciplined by theCommission consistent with existing statutes governing the practice of medicine. Payment for some services does occur, but there is not a mandate to provide payment for covered services andpayment practices vary. The federal Affordable Ca re Act (ACA) established requirements for many health plans to cover essentialhealth benefits, which refl ect ten general categories of care: ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance abuse disorder services, includingbehavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; preventive and wellness services and chronicdisease management; and pediatric services including oraland vision care. Summary: Health insurance carri ers, including health plans offered to state employees and Medicaid managed care plan enrollees, must reimburse a provider for a health care service delivered through telemedicine or store andforward technology if: the plan provides coverage of the health care service when provided in person; the health care service is medically necessary; and the health care service is a service recognized as an essential health benefit under the ACA. Telemedicine means the delivery of health care ser- vices through the use of inte ractive audio and video tech- nology, permitting real-time communication between the patient and the provider for medical diagnosis, consulta- tion, or treatment. It does not include the use of audio- only telephone, facsimile, or email. Store and forward technology means the asynchro nous transmission of a covered person's medical info rmation from an originating site to the health care provider at a distant site which re-sults in medical diagnosis an d management of the covered person. If the service is provided through store and forward technology there must be an associated office visit be-tween the covered person and the referring health care pro-vider. Reimbursement of store and forward technology isavailable only for those cove red services specified in the negotiated agreement between the health plan and health care provider. An originating site for a telemedicine service includes a hospital, rural health clin ic, federally qualified health center, physician's or other health care provider's office,community mental health ce nter, skilled nursing facility, or renal dialysis center except an independent renal dialy-sis center. The originating s ite means the ph ysical location of a patient receiving health services through telemedi-cine. The distant site means the site where the provider islocated when the service is provided through telemedi- cine. An originating site may char ge a facility fee for infra- structure and preparation of the patient. Reimbursementmust be subject to a nego tiated agreement between the originating site and the health plan. A distant site or anyother site not listed may no t charge a facility fee. The health plan may not di stinguish between originat- ing sites that are rural and urban in providing coverage.The health plan may apply u tilization review, prior autho- rization, deductible, copaymen t, or coinsurance require- ments that are applicable to a comparable health careservice provided in person. An originating site hospital may rely on a distant site hospital's decision to grant or renew clinical privileges ofthe physician if the originat ing site hospital obtains rea- sonable assurances that the following provisions are met: the distant site hospita l providing the telemedicine services in a Medicare-participating hospital; any physician providing telemedicine services at the distant site will be fully privileged to provide such services at the distant site hospital; any physician providing telemedicine services will hold and maintain a valid lic ense to perform such ser- vices issued or recognized by the state of Washing-ton; and the originating site hosp ital has evidence of an inter- nal review of the distant site physician's performance and sends the performance in formation to the distant site hospital for use in the periodic appraisal of the distant physician.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators O'Ban and Darneille; by request of De-partment of Social and Health Services). Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on JudiciaryHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: Forensic mental health services are evalu- ation and treatment services related to competency tostand trial (CST) and criminal insanity. Forensic mentalhealth services are administered by staff from Washing-ton's three state hospitals: Western State Hospital, EasternState Hospital, and the Child Study and Treatment Center.The issue of CST arises when a party to a criminal pro- ceeding or the court raises the issue of to whether a crimi- nal defendant has the present capacity to understand thenature of the charges or to assist in their own defense.Whenever CST is raised, th e legal proceedings must be stayed until a mental health ex pert can evaluate the defen- dant and report on the defendant's mental state. If a courtfinds that a defendant is inco mpetent to stand trial (IST), the court may order the defendant to receive competencyrestoration treatment. Comp etency restoration periods vary depending on whether th e defendant is charged with a felony or a misdemeanor, and by the type of felony ormisdemeanor charge. DSHS may place a defendant who is ordered to re- ceive competency restoration treatment in an appropriate treatment facility. Historically, DSHS has provided com-petency restoration treatment exclusively at state hospi-tals. In 2014 DSHS published a report entitled Forensic Mental Health Consultant Revi ew Final Report. This re- port was prepared by Ground swell Services, Inc., a con- sortium of national experts in forensic mental health services based at the Univers ity of Denver, University of Virginia, and University of Massachusetts. The reportmakes several recommendations, including a recommen-dation that Washington should establish a centralized Of- fice of Forensic Mental Health Services. In 2014, the state was sued regarding the timeliness of services related to CST. In April 2015, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washingtonfound that waiting times for CST services violate the sub- stantive due process rights of criminal defendants and es-tablished seven days as the maximum justifiable period ofincarceration absent an indi vidualized finding of good cause. Summary: The Legislature encourages DSHS to devel- op, on a phased-in basis, alternative locations and in-creased access to competency restoration treatment for individuals who do not require inpatient hospitalization.This may include community mental health providers orother local facilities that are willing and able to provide ap-propriate treatment under contract. During the 2015-17fiscal biennium, DSHS may contract with one or morecounties or cities to provide competency restoration ser-vices in a county or city jail, if the jail is willing and ableto serve as a location for comp etency restoration and the Secretary of DSHS determines there is an emergent needfor beds and documents the ju stification, including a plan to address the emergency. Competency restoration pa-tients must be physically separated from other populationsat the jail and must be provided as much as possible witha therapeutic environment. DSHS must develop a screen-ing process to determine which individuals are safe to re-ceive competency restoration treatment outside the state hospitals in collaboration with counties and courts.Senate 47 0 House 96 1SSB 5186 182Time periods for competency restoration treatment for felony and misdemeanor defendants must include onlytime that the defendant is at the facility receiving treatment and do not include reasonable time for transport. A statu- tory seven-day time limit for pl acement in a treatment pro- gram or a court hearing under chapter 10.77 RCW isspecified to apply only to pe rsons who are criminally in- sane, and not persons ordered to receive competency res-toration treatment. The clerk of court, prosecutor, and jailadministrator must provide certain documents to the statehospital within 24 hours of th e signing of an order related to CST. Jails must transport a defendant to a state hospital for CST services within one da y of an offer of admission, and must arrange for CST eval uators to have reasonable, timely, and appropriate access to defendants. An Office of Forensic Ment al Health is established within DSHS. This office must be led by a director on atleast the level of deputy as sistant secretary within DSHS who must, after a reasonable period of transition, have thefollowing responsibilities: operational control of a ll forensic evaluation services, including specific budget allocation separate from the budget for state hospital services; training forensic evaluators; developing a system to certify forensic evaluators and monitor the quality of fo rensic evaluation reports; acting as liaison with courts, jails, and community mental health programs to ensure proper flow of information, coordination of logistical issues, and solving problems in complex circumstances; coordinating with stat e hospitals to identify and develop best practice recommendations and curriculafor services unique to forensic patients; promoting congruence ac ross state hospitals where appropriate and interventio ns which flow smoothly into community interventions; coordinating with entiti es regarding community treat- ment and monitoring of persons on conditional release; overseeing forensic data collection and analysis; and overseeing development and implementation of com- munity forensic programs. A prosecutor may dismiss a charge without prejudice if the issue of CST is raised and refer the defendant for as- sessment by a mental health professional, chemical depen-dency professional, or developmental disabilitiesprofessional to determine the appropriate service needs ofthe defendant. Defendants who have a current charge orprior conviction for a violent of fense or sex offense are ex- cluded from this provision. The expiration date of DSHS' obligation to reimburse a county for the cost of appo inting an expert to evaluate CST instead is extended thre e years until June 30, 2019. Criteria for triggering this obligation are expanded to in-clude the situation in which DSHS did not perform at least one third of in custody CST evaluations for defendants inthe county in the most recent quarter. Counties which uti- lize this provision must mainta in certain data elements and share data with DSHS upon request. The Administrative Office of the Courts must develop standard court forms for fore nsic mental health services and involuntary civil commitm ent by December 31, 2015. A court video testimony work group is established to con-sider and facilitate the use of video testimony by CSTevaluators and state hospital representatives.

Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015SSB 5202 C 211 L 15 Regarding the financial educ ation public-private partner- ship. By Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Educa- tion Frockt, Keiser and Habib). Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education House Committee on Education Background: The Financial Education Public-Private Partnership (Partnership) consis ts of four legislators, four representatives from the financia l services sector, four ed- ucators, one designee from th e Department of Financial Institutions, and two representatives from the Office ofSuperintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). The duties of the Partnership include the following: communicating financial education standards and strategies for improving fi nancial education to school districts; reviewing and developing a procedure for endorsing financial education curriculum; identifying assessments and outcome measures that schools can use to determine whether students meetfinancial education standards; and monitoring and providing guidance for professional development.Legislation enacted in 2007 established goals of basic education. One of those goals was understanding the im-portance of work and finance. In 2008 financial literacy was included in Washington's seventh grade level expecta- tions for social studies and ec onomics. There are no sep- arate Essential Academic Learning Requirements(EALRs) for financial education. The JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Liter- acy (Coalition) is a nonprofit organization that promotesfinancial literacy among students from prekindergartenthrough college. The Coalitio n partners with corporate, nonprofit, academic, and g overnment entities, including Washington entities. The Wash ington branch of the Coa- lition adopted financial literacy concepts that link with EALRs, which school districts are encouraged to adopt. Summary: The State Treasurer or the State Treasurer's designee is added as a member to the Partnership. Teach-ers who are members of the Partnership may be paid theirtravel expenses according to current law from funds avail- able in the Partnership accou nt. Funds from the Partner- ship account may also pay for a substitute teacher when member teachers attend official meetings of the Partner-ship. If the Partnership pays for these expenses, the schooldistrict must release a teacher to attend official Partnership meetings. The Partnership must work with OSPI to integrate fi- nancial education skills and content knowledge into the state learning standards.

Online instructional materials and re- sources are added to the financial education curriculumthat the Partnership reviews on an ongoing basis. The Partnership is no longer required to identify as- sessments and outcome measur es for schools to determine whether students meet the financial education standards,or to create professional development that could lead to acertificate endorsement or othe r certification of competen- cy. After consulting with the Partnership, OSPI must make available to all districts a list of materials that align with the financial standards in tegrated into the state learn- ing standards. The Partnership may seek federal and pri-vate funds to support school districts in providing accessto the materials an d related professional development for certificated teachers. School districts must provide highschool students the opportunity to access the financial ed- ucation standards and publiciz e the availability of these opportunities to students and their families.

By Senators Warnick, Hasegawa and Keiser; by request of Department of Enterprise Services. Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Capital Budget Background: A job order contract allows public entities to contract for small public works projects to repair andrenovate public fa cilities without all the bidding require- ments of most public works projects. The contract is for afixed period, with an indefin ite quantity of work, at nego- tiated work orders and prices . A determination must be made that the use of job or der contracts will benefit the public by providing an effect ive means of reducing the to- tal lead time and cost for the project. State and local agen-cies are limited to two job order contracts, except theDepartment of Enterprise Serv ices is limited to four con- tracts. The maximum that can be contracted through job order contracts is $4 million per year, except counties with more than 1 million resident s the limit is $6 million. Summary: The Department of Enterprise Services and cities with populations greate r than 400,000 are allowed amaximum of $6 million per year for job order contracts and may have six job order contracts in place. The amendment authorized cities with populations greater than 400,000 to use up to six job order contracts fora total of $6 million per year.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5207 C 227 L 15 Concerning office hours for registered tow truck opera- tors.

By Senators Bailey, Conway , Hobbs, Schoesler, Angel, Keiser and Benton; by requ est of Select Committee on Pension Policy. Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Appropriations Background: The Washington State Patrol Retirement System (WSPRS) covers all co mmissioned officers of the Washington State Patrol (WSP). Members of the WSPRSmay retire at age 55 or after 25 years of service at any age.There are two tiers of benefits in WSPRS: Plan 1, which was closed on December 31, 2002, and Plan 2, which hascovered all new fully commi ssioned officers of WSP that received their commissions after that date. Members of the WSPRS have the opportunity to par- ticipate in the Department of Retirement Systems (DRS)-administered deferred compensation program consistentwith the requirements of sec tion 457 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, commonly called a 457 Plan. The DRS457 Plan allows state employees to place a portion of sal- ary, on a pre-tax basis, in to a deferred compensation ac- count. Counties, munici palities, and other political subdivisions may participate in the DRS-administered de- ferred compensation program, or they may offer other de-ferred compensation plans. Members and survivors of the Public Employees' Re- tirement System, the Teachers ' Retirement System, and the School Employees' Retirement Systems Plans 3 may con-vert some or all of the funds from their Plan 3 member ac-count to a life annuity. The 2006 Legislature provided the opportunity for members of the WSPRS and other DRS-administered re-tirement systems to pu rchase up to five years of additional service credit at the time of retir ement. The increase in the retiree's monthly benefit r esulting from the additional years of service credit is a type of life annuity. The cost of the additional service credit is the actuarial equivalent val- ue of the resulting increase in the member's benefit. The member may pay all or part of the cost of the additional service credit with an eligible transfer from a qualified re-tirement plan. In 2014 the Legislature provided retirees from the Law Enforcement Officers' an d Fire Fighters' Retirement System Plan 2 (LEOFF 2) with an option to also purchase an actuarially equivalent life annuity at retirement. Annu-ity purchases from LEOFF 2 require a minimum purchaseof $25,000 from a tax-qualified plan offered by a govern-mental employer. Summary: WSPRS members are permitted to purchase actuarially equivalent life annuity benefits from the WSPRS retirement fund at the time of retirement. Annui- ty purchases must be made with $25,000 or more, and thefunds used for the purchase must be from a tax-qualified plan offered by a governmental employer.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 2SSB 5215 C 84 L 15 Establishing the Washington internet crimes against chil- dren account. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Roach, Pedersen, Kohl-Welles,Baumgartner, Padden, Darn eille, Keiser, Benton and O'Ban). Senate Committee on Law & Justice Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: The Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program (ICAC program) helps state and local lawenforcement agencies develop an effective response totechnology-facilitated child se xual exploitation and Inter- net crimes against children. This help encompasses foren-sic and investigative compon ents, training and technical assistance, victim services, and community education. The program was developed in response to the in- creasing number of children and teenagers using the Inter-net, the proliferation of child sexual abuse imagesavailable electronically, and he ightened online activity by predators seeking unsupervised contact with potential un-derage victims. The Office of Juvenile and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) created the ICAC program under theauthority of the fiscal year (FY) 1998 Justice Appropria- tions Act, Public Law 105-119. The Providing Resources,Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats toOur Children Act of 2008, P.L. 110-401, codified at 42USC 17601, et seq., authorized the ICAC program throughFY 2013. The ICAC program is a national network of 61 coor- dinated task forces representing over 3500 federal, state,and local law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies. In Washington the ICAC is administered through the SeattlePolice Department. These agencies are engaged in bothproactive and reactive invest igations, forensic investiga- tions, and criminal prosecutions . By helping state and lo- cal agencies to develop effec tive, sustainable responses to online child victimization - in cluding responses to the on- line sharing of child sexual abuse images, OJJDP has in- creased the capacity of thou sands of communities across the country to combat Intern et crimes against children. Since the ICAC program's inception in 1998, more than 440,000 law enforcement officers, prosecutors, andother professionals have been trained on techniques to in-Senate 47 0 House 97 0SB 5227 186vestigate and prosecute ICAC-related cases. Since 1998, ICAC Task Forces have reviewed more than 435,000 com-plaints of alleged child sexual victimization resulting inthe arrest of more than 45,000 individuals. In calendar year 2013, ICAC investigations contribut- ed to the arrests of more than 7400 individuals, and taskforces conducted over 60,098 forensic examinations. Ad- ditionally, the ICAC program trained over 30,000 law en-forcement personnel, over 3500 prosecutors, and morethan 5300 other professionals working in the ICAC field. Unclaimed prizes in the st ate lottery account are re- tained in the state lottery fund for further use as prizes, ex- cept one-third of all unclaime d prize money is deposited in the economic development strategic reserve account andduring the 2013-15 fiscal biennium, the Legislature maytransfer to the education le gacy trust account amounts as reflect the excess fund balance in the state lottery account from unclaimed prizes. Summary: The Washington ICAC account is created in custody of the state treasury. The account must be used exclusively by Washington ICAC and its affiliate agenciesfor combating Internet-facil itated crimes against children, promoting education on Internet safety to the public and to minors, and rescuing child victims from abuse and ex-ploitation. Only the Crimin al Justice Training Commis- sion (CJTC) or the CJTC's designee may authorizeexpenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. The Commi ssion may enter into agree- ments with the Washington Association of Sheriffs andPolice Chiefs to administer grants and other activities ofthe account and to be paid an administrative fee not to ex- ceed 3 percent of expenditures.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5227 C 276 L 15 Creating the international co mmercial arbitration act. By Senators Baumgartner, O'Ban, Dammeier and Fain.Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: Arbitration is a method for resolving dis- putes without going to court. In international commercial dealings, arbitration gives businesses more control be-cause the process is set by the parties' private agreementand the decision maker is a mu tually selected neutral party. Arbitration keeps business disputes confidential and pro-tects businesses from uncertai n outcomes based on foreign laws and judicial processes. The international commercial arbitration law's pur- pose is to provide uniform terms for arbitration agree-ments and uniform enforcemen t processes for arbitration agreements and awards. Curre ntly more than 60 nations and eight U.S. states have adopted the international com- mercial arbitration law. The states that have adopted the law are California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,Louisiana, Oregon, and Texas. Washington has not adopt- ed the international comm ercial arbitration law. Summary: The international commer cial arbitration law applies only to arbitrations th at take place within Washing- ton except when a superior co urt has authority to issue or enforce interim measures, or to enforce arbitration agree- ments and awards. Washington's international commer-cial arbitration law is subject to any conflictingagreements between the federal government and other na-tions. The arbitration agreem ent must be in writing. An arbitration clause may remain valid even if the underlyingcontract of the parties is inva lid. Parties may pursue arbi- tration under their arbitratio n agreement even if the dis- pute is pending in court.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5238 C 25 L 15 Concerning public water system s' public participation no- tice provisions.

More than 5.5 mil- lion Washington residents, roughly 85 percent of the pop-ulation receive their drinking water from Group A orGroup B public water systems. Group A water systemshave 15 or more service connections, regularly serve 25 ormore people 60 or more days per year, or serve 1000 ormore people for two or more consecutive days. Group Bwater systems serve fewer than 15 connections and fewer than 25 people per day. Some public water system s must submit a water sys- tem plan for review and approval by the Department ofHealth. These public water sy stems include the following: systems having 1000 or more service connections; systems required to deve lop water system plans under the Public Water System Coordination Act of 1977; new systems or expanding systems; and other specified systems. The Growth Management Act (GMA) . GMA is the comprehensive land use plan ning framework for countiesSenate 48 0 House 97 0Senate 37 10 House 98 0SB 5249 187and cities in Washington. Orig inally enacted in 1990 and 1991, GMA establishes land use designation and environ-mental protection requirements for all Washington coun-ties and cities, and a significantly wider array of planningduties for the 28 counties and the cities within them thatfully plan under GMA. GMA requires counties and cities to establish a pro- gram that identifies procedures and schedules for the pub-lic to participate in the development and amendment of comprehensive plans and development regulations. Theprogram must include notice procedures that are reason-ably calculated to provide no tice to property owners and other affected and interested individuals, tribes, govern-ment agencies, businesses, school districts, and organiza-tions of proposed amendments to comprehensive plansand development regulations. The procedures should pro-vide for broad dissemination of proposals and alternatives,an opportunity for written co mments, public meetings af- ter the effective notice, a provision for open discussion,communication programs, information services, and con-sideration of and response to public comments. Summary: The list of persons and entities that public par- ticipation requirements of GMA must, through notice pro- cedures, must also be reasonably calculated to providenotice of proposed amendmen ts to comprehensive plans and development regulations is expanded to include Group A public water systems th at are required to develop water system plans. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5249 C 112 L 15 Creating a bond issuance exemption for qualifying local revitalization financing projects. By Senators Darneille, Conway and Miloscia.Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on Technol ogy & Economic Develop- ment Background: Public infrastructure funding is accom- plished in a number of different ways in the state. Tax in-crement financing is a method of redistributing increased tax revenues within a geog raphic area resulting from a public investment to pay fo r the bonds required to con- struct a project. The Legislature has created a number of tax increment financing programs: the Co mmunity Revitalization Fi- nancing Program in 2001; the Local Infrastructure Financ-ing Tool Program in 2006; the Local RevitalizationFinancing Program (LRF) in 2009. LRF authorizes cities and counties to create revitaliza- tion areas and allows certain increases in local sales anduse tax revenues and local prop erty tax revenues generated from within the revitalizatio n area, additional funds from other local public sources, and a state contribution to beused for payment of bonds is sued for financing local pub- lic improvements within the revitalization area. The 2009 legislation designated seven LRF demon- stration projects, provided a total state contribution of$2.25 million per fiscal year, and set a specific state con- tribution amount for each project ranging from $200,000to $500,000. The legislation also provided for a competi- tive process to be administered by the Department of Rev-enue (DOR) on a first-come basis in order to enable additional sponsoring local gov ernments to seek a state contribution. DOR began accepting applications on Sep-tember 1, 2009. Thirteen app lications were received. Six projects were allocated state contributions before the $2.5million cap was reached. Seven additional applications re- ceived no state contribution. In 2010 the Legislature am ended the LRF statutes and increased the maximum state contribution for demonstra- tion projects from $2.25 million to $4.2 million. Six juris- dictions were allowed to resubmit applications for approval in 2010. Five ju risdictions resubmitted applica- tions. Bringing the total LRF award amounts for demon-stration projects up to $4.16 million. Summary: A city or county does not need to issue bonds for the Tacoma Internationa l Financial Services Area/Ta- coma Dome Demonstration Project or for local revitaliza-tion financing projects of less than $150,000.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESB 5262 C 262 L 15 Releasing juvenile case records to the Washington state of- fice of civil legal aid.

If thecourt determines that the chil d is dependent, then the court will conduct periodic review s and make determinations about the child's placement and the parents' progress inSenate 49 0 House 93 4 Senate 46 1 House 81 16SSB 5268 188correcting parental deficiencies. Under certain circum- stances, the court may order th e filing of a petition for the termination of parental rights. Pursuant to legislation enacted in 2014 - E2SSB 6126, the court must appoint an atto rney for a child in a depen- dency proceeding six months after granting a petition to terminate the parent and child relationship and when there is no remaining parent with pa rental rights. Subject to the availability of amounts approp riated for this specific pur- pose, the state must pay the costs for legal services of at-torneys appointed to represent children six months aftertermination of parental rights if those services are provid-ed in accordance with the stan dards of practice, voluntary training, and caseload limits developed and recommended by the statewide children's representation workgroup. The Office of Civil Legal Aid (OCLA) administers funds appropriated fo r the appointment of an attorney for a child who has no remaining pa rent with parental rights. OCLA may enter into contracts with counties to disbursestate funds and may require a county to use attorneys un- der contract with OCLA to remain within appropriated amounts. Prior to disbursing state funds, OCLA must ver- ify that the appointed attorney s meet the standards of prac- tice, voluntary training, and caseload limits.

By Senate Committee on Hea lth Care (originally spon- sored by Senators Parlette, Ko hl-Welles, Hatfield, Angel and Fraser). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Health care professionals with prescription authority may prescribe topi cal ophthalmic products to treat a variety of medical conditions, including glaucoma.Many insurers have structured the design of their drug benefits to align with the fre quency at which prescriptions can be filled. With oral drug s, a 30-day supply is limited to the number of pills prov ided. However, with topical opthalmic products, patients may accidently put multiple drops in their eyes, or miss the eye, which would result inthe prescription running out before 30 days have passed. Summary: Pharmacists may refill a prescription for top- ical ophthalmic products at 70 percent of the predicted days of use. This applies to original prescriptions and re-fills. In order to refill the prescription early, the prescrip-tion must indicate the number of refills permitted and the early refill must not exceed th at number. Early refills are permitted only one time.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 E2SSB 5269 C 258 L 15 Concerning court review of detention decisions under the involuntary treatment act. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Frockt, Habib andPedersen). Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on JudiciaryHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: A civil detention under the Involuntary Treatment Act (ITA) must be initiated by a designated mental health professional (DMHP). A DMHP may de-tain a person following inve stigation if the DMHP deter- mines that the person, as the result of a mental disorder, presents a likelihood of serious harm, or is gravely dis-abled. Likelihood of serious harm means a substantial risk that the person will inflict serious harm on self or others asevidenced by behavior whic h has caused such harm or places another person in reasonable fear of sustaining suchharm. Gravely disabled means that the person is in dangerof serious physical harm based upon a failure to providefor their essential human needs of health or safety, or man-ifests severe deterioration in ro utine functioning and is not receiving care that is essen tial for health or safety. A DMHP investigation must consist of an evaluation of the specific facts suppor ting detention and an evalua- tion of the credibility of an y witnesses providing informa- tion to support detention. A personal interview with the person is required unless th e person refuses an interview. A DMHP may not initiate detention if it appears the personSenate 49 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 44 3 (Senate concurred)Senate 49 0 House 97 0SSB 5275 189will voluntarily seek approp riate treatment. A DMHP must consider all reasonabl y available information from credible witnesses, including family members, landlords, neighbors, or others with a significant history of involve-ment with the person. A DMHP must also consider rea-sonably available treatment re cords, including records of prior commitment, prior determ inations of competency to stand trial or criminal insan ity, and any history of violent acts. If the likelihood of serious ha rm is imminent, or if the person is in imminent danger due to being gravely dis-abled, the DMHP may immediately cause the person to bedetained to a triage facility, crisis stabilization unit, evalu- ation and treatment facility, or emergency department. Ifthe likelihood of serious harm or grave disability is present but not imminent, the DMHP mu st obtain a judicial order authorizing detention and ce rtifying that the petition is supported by probable cause. The judicial order may bebased upon sworn telephonic testimony or the DMHP'ssworn declaration, and is issued ex parte. Initial detention under the ITA is for 72 hours, exclud- ing weekends and holidays, during which time the de- tained person must be provided with appointed counsel orallowed to retain counsel. Be fore the end of the 72-hour period, the facility providing treatment must release the person or file a petition asking the superior court to autho- rize continuance of detention fo r up to 14 additional days, or to commit the person for up to 90 days of outpatienttreatment. The court must hold a probable cause hearingto determine whether there is sufficient evidence based ona preponderance of the evidence standard to issue a deten-tion or commitment order. Th e probable cause hearing is an adversary hearing, govern ed by the rules of evidence, in which the facility must be represented by the county prosecuting attorney. Summary: An immediate family member, guardian, or conservator of a person may petition superior court for re-view of a DMHP decision to not detain a person for eval-uation and treatment under the ITA, or to not take action within 48 hours of a request for investigation. The court must review the petition to de termine whether it raises suf- ficient evidence to support the al legation. If it so finds, the court must provide a copy of the petition to the DMHPagency and order the agency to provide the court and the petitioner with a written sworn statement providing the ba-sis for the decision to not se ek initial detention and a copy of all information material to the DMHP's decision within one judicial day. Any person may submit a declaration in support of or in opposition to the DMHP's decision. The petition must be submitted on forms develope d by the courts and contain a sworn declaration from the petitioner and other witness-es, if desired, describing why the person should be de-tained for evaluation and treat ment, a description of the relationship between the petitioner and the person, and thedate on which an investig ation was requested from the DMHP. If the court finds after revi ewing all the information that there is probable caus e to support initial detention, and that the person has refu sed to accept evaluation and treatment voluntarily, the court may enter an order for ini-tial detention. The court must issue a final ruling on the petition within five judicial days after it is filed. TheDMHP must execute the order without delay. The Department of Social and Health Services and each regional support network or agency employing DM-HPs must publish information in an easily accessible for- mat describing the process fo r filing a petition under this act. A DMHP or DMHP agency that receives a request for investigation must inquire wh ether the request comes from an immediate family member, guardian, or conservatorwho would be eligible to petitio n under this act. If the per- son is not detained within 48 hours, the agency must in- form this person about th e process to petition for court review. For the purposes of this act, immediate family mem- ber means spouse, domestic partner, child, stepchild, par-ent, stepparent, grandparent, or sibling. This act may be known and cited as Joel's Law. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5275 C 86 L 15 Concerning tax code improvemen ts that do not affect state revenue collections. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Schoesler, Hargrove, Hill, Sheldon and Hewitt). Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Finance Background: When legislation is enacted, it frequently contains references to other statutes. These referencesmay become erroneous due to changes made to the refer-enced statutes by other legislation enacted during the samelegislative session. In add ition, statutes sometimes in- clude provisions that are lim ited in time. These provisions become obsolete with the passage of time. From time to time, administrative agencies suggest statutory revisions for the purpose of increasing clarity orimproving administration.Senate 46 3 House 92 5 (House amended)Senate (Senate refused to concur)House 92 5 (House amended)Senate 45 2 (Senate concurred)SSB 5275 190Summary: Part 1 - Eliminating Obsolete and Redundant Statutory Provisions . Two statutes are repealed that are duplicative of RCW 82.04.600: RCW 82.04.395 - exempt s certain materials printed in school district and educational service district printing facilities; and RCW 82.04.397 - exempt s certain materials printed in county, city, or town printing facilities. The Business and Occupation (B&O) tax credit in RCW 82.04.4333 for a portion of employer-provided jobtraining costs of eligible taxpayers is repealed: The credit has not been used since 2006. The credit for customized employment training under 82.04.4333 is being used instead. The B&O tax credit for the cost of purchasing me- chanical lifting devices in hosp itals is repealed. This re- peal eliminates the need for the Department of Revenue(DOR) to issue an irrelevant annual report on the amount of credits claimed: Credit could not be earned after December 30, 2010. Although unused credit can be carried forward until fully used, tax reporting data indicates that no credit has been claimed since the first quarter of 2011. The sales tax exemption in RCW 82.08.0265 for sales to nonresidents of certain reta il services, such as the repair of tangible personal property (TPP) and TPP that becomes a component part during the co urse of providing retail ser- vices exempt from sales tax under this statute is repealed: The statute no longer serves any purpose because of the sales tax sourcing provisions in RCW 82.32.730,which generally source sa les of TPP and retail ser- vices to the location where receipt by the buyer occurs. RCW 82.14.220, which references duties of the State Treasurer that are no longer required, is repealed. RCW 82.24.235, which is part of a series of changes in Sections 307 and 308 to clarify that DOR may onlyadopt rules to administer th e cigarette and other tobacco products (OTP) tax statutes, but not enforce these statutes,is repealed. The Liquor Control Board (LCB) must con-tinue enforcing the cigarette and OTP laws. RCW 84.41.030, 84.41.041, and 84.48.034 are amended to remove obsolete language regarding cyclical revaluation for property tax purposes. By law, all countiesare now required to revalue property annually. Previouslythey were able to value prop erty anywhere between every one to four years. Part 2 - Providing Administrative Efficiencies . RCW 46.71.090 is amended to streamline the process of provid-ing notice to automotive repa ir facilities regarding cus- tomer rights by allowing DOR to maintain the information on its website in lieu of se nding annual notices to automo- tive repair facilities. DOR con tinues to provide this infor-mation when issuing a tax re gistration to an automotive repair business, either in paper form or electronically. The application requirem ent in RCW 82.08.900 is eliminated to make it easier to claim the sales tax exemp- tion for certain services and components related to anaer-obic digesters. This makes it on par with other agriculturalexemptions. Part 3 - Providing Greater Clarity and Consistency . Out-of-date references in RCW 82.04.627 are updated: This statute addresses the place of sale of specified components of commercial airplanes for B&O tax purposes. The statue contains out-of-date federal aviation regu- lation (FAR) citations and references terms no longer used in FARs. The B&O and sales and use tax exemptions for restau- rant employee meals is clarified to only apply to the restaurant's employees. Ambiguity concerning whether airplanes used primar- ily to provide services to th e federal government, such as fire suppression services, are exempt from the sales and use tax is clarified. These sections make clear that such airplanes are exempt fro m the sales and use tax. Sections 307 and 308, along with section 101(7), clar- ify that DOR may only adopt rules to administer the ciga-rette and OTP taxes, but not enforce these taxes. LCB must continue enforcing the cigarette and OTP tax laws: In 1997 legislation was enacted (ESHB 2272) that transferred responsibility fo r the enforcement of ciga- rette taxes to LCB. DOR retained the responsibility for administering cigarette taxes. Enforcement of cigarette taxes includes ensuring that tobacco sellers are properly licensed, keeping tobacco out of the hands of those under age 18, and investigat-ing and preventing unlawf ul acquisition and ship- ments of contraband cigarettes. Administration of cigarette taxes includes collecting the taxes, engaging in taxpayer education efforts, auditing taxpayers, and ad ministering the cigarette stamping process. There is a similar delegation of duties between DOR and LCB with respect to the OTP tax. DOR's administrative provisions in RCW 82.32 are clarified to apply to fees collected by DOR - e.g. the woodstove fee imposed in RCW 70 .94.483 and the replacement tire fee imposed in RCW 70.95.510. The requirement for taxpayer s to maintain records is clarified to apply to any tax or fee administered by DOR,not just taxes or fees impo sed in chapters 82.04 through 82.27 RCW. RCW 82.65A.030 is amended to replace the term per- sons with developmental disa bilities with the term persons with intellectual di sabilities, which is c onsistent with other statutes SSB 5276 191RCW's 84.38.030, and 84.39.010 are amended to clarify the meanin g of the term disability for purposes of the property tax exemption for nonprofithomes for the aging, the senior citizen/disabled personproperty tax deferral, and th e property tax grant program for widows and widowers of veterans. More specifically, these sections: clarify that the term disability for purposes of these property tax programs is not limited to physical dis- abilities; and align the definition of disability for these programs with the definition of disabil ity for the senior citizen/ disabled person property tax exemption program. County treasurers need not continue the property tax foreclosure process when a ta xpayer pays all amounts due under a certificate of delinquency, except a lien for de-ferred property taxes that rema in eligible for continued de- ferral: In 2013 DOR succeeded in getting legislation enacted to ensure that the state is entitled to be repaid fordeferred property tax liens when a county sells or rents tax-title property - i.e. property acquired by a county for delinquent proper ty taxes when the prop- erty goes unsold at the foreclosure sale. Staff from the treasurers' offices in Thurston and King counties recently qu estioned whether the trea- surer could discontinue property tax foreclosure pro-ceedings where the property owner paid all amounts due under a certificate of delinquency other than a lien for deferred property taxes. It was never DOR's intent to allow the foreclosure of properties subject to a lien for deferred property taxeswhen the owner is still eligib le for a continued deferral of taxes. These sections w ould codify this intent. Part 4 - Taxability Matrix . Recent amendments to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) are implemented to: provide that when the taxa bility matrix is updated, sellers and certified service providers who relied onthe prior taxability matrix are relieved from liability until the first day of the calendar month that is at least 30 days after DOR submits notice of the change tothe taxability matrix to the SSUTA Governing Board; and expand the taxability matr ix to include the state's practices in the administration of sales and use taxes as required under SSUTA.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Kohl-Welles, Roach and Keiser). Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Finance Background: A taxpayer may seek a property tax refund on any of several specified grounds. Grounds for refundsinclude taxes paid as a result of a manifest error in a de-scription of property that is taxed, such as an error in the square footage description of a building. A taxpayer mustseek a refund within three years of the tax due date. Tocorrect a manifest error, a county assessor or treasurer maycancel or correct tax records up to three years precedingthe year in which the error is discovered. Prior to 2009, a county legi slative authority could au- thorize refund of property taxe s paid more than three years after the tax due date. A 2009 act deleted that authority. Summary: A county legislative authority may authorize a property tax refund on a claim filed more than threeyears after the tax due date for taxes paid as a result of amanifest error in a description of property. On that basis,a county assessor or treasurer may cancel or correct tax re-cords more than three years preceding the year in whichthe error is discovered, to re fund or reduce taxes for a property owner.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5280 C 192 L 15 Concerning the sale of beer and cider by grocery store licensees.

Washington Real Estate Research Account Created in 1999 . In 1999 the Washington real estate research account (account) was created in the state treasury. This accountwas funded through a $10 fee assessed on each real estatebroker originally licensed after October 1, 1999, and oneach license renewal for licenses expiring after October 1,1999. Expenditures from the account may be used only tosupport a real estate research center in Washington. Theaccount is subject to appropriation. Center's Purpose .

By Senate Committee on Hea lth Care (originally spon- sored by Senators Becker, Keiser, Frockt, Bailey, Ericksen, Mullet andBenton). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Drug Schedules . Drugs and other sub- stances that are considered co ntrolled substances under the Controlled Substances Act are divided into five catego-ries: Schedule I controlled substances are those that have no currently acceptable medical use in the UnitedStates. Schedule II substances have a high potential for abuse, such as cocaine or Ritalin, which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. Schedule III drugs, subs tances, or chemicals are drugs with moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence. Schedules IV and V controlled substances have low potentials for abuse.Hydrocodone Classification. Hydrocodone is an opi- ate analgesic typically combin ed with other ingredients in products used to relieve mode rate to severe pain. Federal law classified combination products with less than 15 mil-ligrams of hydrocodone per dosage unit, e.g. Vicodin, asSchedule III narcotics. Prod ucts with 15 or more milli- grams of hydrocodone per dosage unit were classified asSchedule II narcotics. In October 2014, the Drug Enforce- ment Administration rescheduled all hydrocodone combi-nation products as Schedule II narcotics. Optometrists and Controlled Substances . Optome- trists examine the human eye fo r defects in vision and, af- ter completing required didac tic and clinical instruction, may use certain topical and oral drugs for diagnostic andtreatment purposes. No opto metrist may prescribe, dis- pense, purchase, possess, or ad minister drugs classified as Schedule III through V contro lled substances, except as permitted by the Optometry Bo ard of Washington for the treatment of diseases and cond itions related to the human eye. An optometrist may prescribe, dispense, or administer authorized controlled substanc es for up to seven days to treat a particular patient for a single trauma, episode, orcondition, or for associated pa in. Optometrists may not use, prescribe, dispense, pu rchase, possess, or administer any Schedule I or II controlled substance Summary: Optometrists may use, prescribe, dispense, purchase, possess, or administer Schedule II hydrocodonecombination products.

Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor House Committee on Business & Financial Services Background: The Consumer Protection Act (CPA) pro- hibits unfair or deceptive practices in commerce. TheCPA may be enforced by private legal action or through acivil action by the Attorney Ge neral. False advertising and false representation may cons titute unfair and deceptive practices. Summary: A locksmith cannot misrepresent the lock- smith's geographic location by: listing a local telephone number in a local telephone directory or on an Internet website if calls to the num- ber are routinely forwarded to a location outside the calling area covered by the directory and the listingdoes not conspicu ously disclose the business' locality and state; or listing a business name in a local telephone directory or on an Internet website if the name misrepresents the geographic location of the business and the listing fails to disclose the locality and state of the business. These misrepresentations are unfair and deceptive acts under the CPA.

Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: The Department of Licensing (DOL) ad- ministers and collects the majority of State transportationrevenues, including administ ration of the International Registration Plan (IRP). IRP is an international program that allows commercial vehicles registration reciprocityamong states and Canadian prov inces. It also facilitates uniformity of laws regarding the registration of interstate commercial vehicles and provides each jurisdiction with aprorated share of fees based on distance traveled andweight. In order for states to be eligible to receive certain federal transportation funds they must participate in IRP. In 2013 Substitute House Bill 1883 passed, which was requested by DOL to conso lidate and streamline the law related to fuel tax administ ration and collection.

Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance House Committee on Business & Financial Services Background: Escrow Agent Registration Act . An es- crow agent is a neutral third party that may hold funds ordocuments or other things of value until the occurrence of a specified event or the perfo rmance of a prescribed con- dition. The escrow agent acts for the purpose of effecting or closing the sale, purchase, exchange, transfer, encum-brance, or lease of real or personal property to another. Es-crow agents must be licensed by the Department ofFinancial Institutions (DFI). The applicant for an escrow agent license must in- clude, among other things, the qualifications and the busi-ness history of the applicant and all of its officers,directors, owners, partne rs, and controlling persons; whether the applicant has be en convicted of any crime within the preceding ten years; and evidence of compli-ance with the bonding and insurance requirements. Mortgage Fraud . In 2007 the Task Force for Home- owner Security (task force) convened to evaluate instabil-ity in the mortgage market and minimize the impact inWashington. The task forc e made several recommenda- tions, including increasing the penalties for mortgagefraud. Many of the task for ce's recommendations were en- acted in 2008. It is a criminal offense to engage in deceptive practices in connection with making, brokering, obtaining, or mod-ifying a residential mortgage loan. A person commitsmortgage fraud if the person materially misleads any bor-rower or lender during the lending process; knowinglymakes any misstatement, misrepresentation, or omissionduring the mortgage lending process, knowing that it maybe relied on by the mortgage lender, borrower, or any otherparty to the process; or receives proceeds or anything ofvalue in connection with a residential mortgage closingthat such person knew resulte d from a prohibited misstate- ment, misrepresentation, or omission. The offense of mortgage fraud is a class B felony, which carries a maxi-mum sentence of ten years and a $20,000 fine. Mortgage Broker Practices Act .

A mortgage broker is any person who assists a person in obtaining or applying to ob-tain a residential mortgage loan or performs residentialmortgage loan modification services or who holds himselfor herself out as performing su ch services and does so for direct or indirect compensation. Under MBPA, mortgage brokers must fully disclose the terms of loans, ensure that mortgage broker fees col-lected for third-party servi ce providers are placed into bank trust accounts, and refrain from engaging in unfairand deceptive acts and practices. A mortgage broker licensee must provide the Director of DFI (Director) with an annual report of its mortgagebroker activity. The Director may, by rule, create a sched-ule and format for the annual report. A loan originatormay only take an application on behalf of one mortgagebroker at a time, and the mortgage broker must be clearlyidentified on the application. Consumer Loan Act . The Consumer Loan Act (CLA) authorizes DFI to regulate co nsumer loan companies who conduct business in Washingt on, and it governs the licens- ing of mortgage loan originat ors. Consumer loan compa- nies include mortgage lenders and consumer financecompanies. A mortgage loan originator is an individualwho takes a residential mortgage loan application or offers or negotiates terms of a residential mortgage loan. CLA limits the rates and fees lenders may charge on loans, restricts certain loan provisions such as prepayment penalties, requires lenders to fully disclose the terms ofloans, and prohibits lenders from engaging in unfair and deceptive acts and practices. A violation of either MBPA or CLA is a violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act. Summary: Escrow Agent Registration Act . The Director may waive the licensing provis ions for escrow agents if the Director determines it n ecessary to facilitate com- merce or protect consumers.Senate 48 0 House 83 14 (House amended)Senate 46 1 (Senate concurred)SSB 5299 196Mortgage Fraud . Mortgage lending process and resi- dential mortgage loan modification are defined to includea broad range of activities an d documents involved in the lending process. Filing a false document with the countyrecorder or official registrar of deeds of any county of thisstate constitutes mortgage fraud and is a class B felony. Venue for an action for a mortgage fraud proceeding may be brought: in the county in which the residential property for which the mortgage loan be ing sought is located; in any county in which any act was performed in fur- therance of the violation; or in any county in which a document containing a mis- statement, misrepresentation, or omission was filed. A person who engages in mortgage fraud activities is also liable for civil damages in the greater amount of$5,000 or actual damages, incl uding costs to repair the vic- tim's credit and quiet title on the residential property, andreasonable attorney fees. In a proceeding where there hasbeen a conviction for mortgage fraud, the sentencing courtmay issue orders as necessary to correct the public recordcontaining any false informatio n as a result of the criminal action. Mortgage Broker Practices Act . Licensee is defined to include a person who failed to obtain a license. A non-profit housing organization brokering residential mort-gage loans under housing programs funded in whole or inpart by federal or state programs with the primary purposeof providing housing for low-income residents is exemptfrom the provisions of the MBPA. It is a violation of the MB PA for any person subject to the act to: originate loans from any unlicensed location; solicit or accept from any borrower at or near the time a loan application is take n, and in advance of any foreclosure of the borrower's existing residential mortgage loan or loans, any instrument of convey- ance of any interest in the borrower's primary dwell-ing that is the subject of the residential mortgage loan; or make a residential mortgage loan unless the loan is table funded - a loan is ta ble funded when the mort- gage broker is named on the mortgage or promissory note as the lender, but is immediately sold to a lenderwho will provide the actual funding. The Director may recover the state's costs and expens- es for prosecuting violations of MBPA, including stafftime spent preparing for and attending administrativehearings and reasonable atto rneys' fees, unless, after a hearing, the Director determines no violation occurred. Acease and desist order issued against a licensee may directthe licensee to discontinue any violation and take neces-sary affirmative action; incl ude a summary suspension ofthe licensee's license; and order the licensee to immediate- ly cease the conduct of business under the MBPA. RCW 19.146.290 - requiring a licensee to provide the Director with an annual report of mortgage broker activity,and RCW 19.146.330 - limitin g the number of applica- tions taken by a loan originator, are each repealed. CLA . Any person selling bare property owned by that person who provides financing for the sale when the prop- erty serves as security for th e financing is exempt from the provisions of CLA if the person engages in five or fewertransactions in a calendar year and is not in the business of constructing homes on the property. A surety bond pro-vided by an applicant for licensing under CLA must becontinuous and may be cancelled only upon 45 days writ-ten notice of intent to canc el provided to the Director. In lieu of suspending or revoking a license under CLA, the Director may allow the licensee to have a condi- tional license to allow the licen see to continue business ac- tivities. The Director has the authority to condition, revoke, or suspend only the pa rticular license which is the subject of the violation, or may take action with regard to all licenses issued to the licensee. A residential mortgage loan services licensee must maintain liquidity, operating r eserves, and net worth as de- termined by the Director. The Director may initiate actionif the licensee fails to maintain appropriate liquidity levels. Upon application by the Dir ector, the superior court may appoint a receiver to take over any residential mortgageloan servicer. Several provisions are am ended for consistency with MBPA including: affiliate, licensee, loan, and mortgage loan originator are defined; the Director may recover the state's costs and expenses for prosecuting violations of CLA; and the Director may deny an application for a mortgage loan originator license if the applicant has been con- victed of a gross misdemeanor involving dishonestyor financial misconduct.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5302 C 115 L 15 Addressing the prudent investor rule for Washington state trusts, delegation of trustee duties by trustees of a Wash- ington state trust, and stan dards for authorization and treatment of statutory trust advisors and directed trusteesincident to the establishment of Washington state directed trusts. By Senators Benton and Mulle t; by request of Washington State Bar Association. Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance House Committee on Judiciary Background: A trust is a form of ownership of property that separates responsibility or control of the propertyfrom the benefits of ownership. A trust is created by a trustor, who transfers the proper ty to a trustee. The trustee holds legal title to the proper ty and manages the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries. Delegation . A trustee has many powers provided in statute. In exercising these powers, the trustee may em-ploy other persons (a delegate) to advise or assist the trust-ee or to perform any act. Th e trustee may not delegate all of the trustee's duties and responsibilities; must use rea-sonable care in selecting and retaining the de legate; and is not relieved from liability for the delegate's acts. Trust Investments . The trustee is a fiduciary with re- spect to a trust. In investing, a fiduciary must consider the role that the proposed invest ment or investment course of action plays within the overall portfolio of assets. In ap- plying the total asset manage ment approach, the fiduciary must exercise the judgment and care that a prudent personwould exercise in the management of the fiduciary's ownSenate 49 0 House 77 19SB 5302 199affairs and consider a number of factors. A fiduciary who has special skills is under a duty to use those skills. Summary: Delegation by Trustee . A trustee may pru- dently delegate the trustee' s duties and powers provided the trustee takes reasonable car e, skill, and caution in (1) selecting a delegate, (2) establ ishing the scope and terms of the delegation, (3) review ing and monitoring the dele- gate's performance, and (4) en forcing the delegate's duties. If the trustee acts with that reasonable care, the trustee isnot liable for the delegate's actions. A delegate owes a duty to the trustee to exercise reasonable care and the trust-ee has a duty to require the de legate to account for the del- egate's actions. By acceptin g the delegated duties, the delegate, wherever domiciled, is subject to the jurisdiction of Washington courts. Washington Directed Trust Act - Opt In . The Wash- ington Directed Trust Act (act) is created and applies to atrust only if (1) a will, trust instrument, court order, power of appointment, or agreement (the governing instrument)specifically calls for the act's application and (2) the trustsitus is Washington State. The act allows a trustor to directspecific functions to third-parties - statutory trust advisorsand directed trustees, rather than conferring all authority, duties, and liability upon the trustee. Statutory Trust Advisor-Defined, Powers, Duties, and Compensation . A statutory trust advisor (advisor) is a per- son, including a trust advisor, special trustee, trust protec- tor, or committee who is ex pressly called for under the terms of a governing instrument. The advisor has the pow-er or duty to direct, consent to, or disapprove an action, or has the power or duty that would normally be required ofa trustee. The advisor's po wers and duties include the power to: direct trust investments; direct a trustee to make or withhold distributions to beneficiaries; consent to a trustee's action or inaction relating to investments and distributions; increase or decrease any interest of any beneficiary; grant, terminate, or am end a power of appointment to beneficiaries; modify or amend the governing instrument with respect to tax and other legal matters; appoint or remove a successor trustee, trust advisor, or statutory trust advisor, as allowed in the governing instrument; and change the governing law or principal place of administration of the trust. The advisor has the fiduciary duty to act in accordance with the trust terms and solely in the beneficiaries' inter- ests, and must act in good faith and with honest judgment.The advisor has no duty to monitor the administration of the trust to determine whethe r the power should be exer- cised except upon request of the trustee or a qualified ben-eficiary. The advisor is entitled to reasonable compensation. Remedies Against an Advisor, Court Matters . If an advisor breaches or threatens to breach a fiduciary duty, atrustee or beneficiary may file an action. An advisor whobreached a duty is liable for the greater of (1) the amount lost because of the breach; or (2) the profit made from the breach. The court may excuse an advisor from liability if the advisor acted reasonably and in good faith under thecircumstances known to the advisor. The statute of limita-tions on claims against a statutory trust advisor is general-ly three years from when a report adequately disclosingthe existence of a potential claim and time allowed formaking the claim was delivered. By accepting the ap-pointment the advisor submits to the jurisdiction of Wash- ington courts even if the in vestment advisory or other agreements provide otherwise. Advisor Vacancies, Duty to Inform, and Report . If there is a vacancy, the trus tee may act until a new advisor is appointed; however, a trustee is not liable for failing toact for 60 days from the date the trustee learns of the va-cancy. The trustee may petitio n the court to fill a vacancy if required to be filled un der the governing documents. The advisor must: (1) keep the trustee and the qualifiedbeneficiaries reasonably inform ed; (2) provide the trustee with requested information; an d (3) promptly provide a re- questing qualified beneficiar y with information reason- ably necessary to enable the beneficiary to enforce their rights under the trust with respect to the advisor. Directed Trustee - Defined, Liability, Statutory Trust Advisor Actions . A directed trustee is a trustee who, with respect to a particular duty or function, must follow the di- rection of a statutory trust advisor; may not undertake theduty or function without a statutory trust advisor's direc-tion; or must obtain the consen t of a statutory trust advisor. A directed trustee is not liable for any loss resulting from(1) following the statutory trust advisor's direction or fromactions taken with the adviso r's consent; (2) certain actions or inaction of the statutory trus t advisor; or (3) a failure to take any action proposed by th e directed trustee that re- quires the statutory trust adviso r's prior consent, if the di- rected trustee sought in timel y fashion, but did not obtain the consent. A directed truste e has no duty to monitor, ad- vise, or take other action with respect to the statutory trustadvisor. Trust Investments . The trustee's duties with respect to investment is modified to a Portfolio Management Theory. The trustee must invest and manage the assets as a prudentinvestor would, by considering the purposes, terms, distri-bution requirements, and other circumstances using rea-sonable care, skill, and cautio n. The decisions must be evaluated based on the entire trust portfolio and as part of an overall investment strategy with risk and return objec- tives reasonably suite d to the trust. The trustee must con- sider a number of factors. The trustee must use reasonableSB 5307 200efforts to verify certain fact s. A trustee who has special skills is under a duty to use those skills. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5307 C 230 L 15 Concerning deficit reimbursement agreements with coun- ties owning and operating ferry systems. By Senators O'Ban, Ranker and Dammeier.Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: The Washington State Department of Transportation is allowed to en ter into agreements to reim- burse Pierce, Skagit, and Wh atcom counties for up to 50 percent of any deficit incurre d during the previous fiscal year in the operation and ma intenance of a ferry system that is owned and operated by one of these three counties. The combined amount of fe rry deficit reimbursement to Pierce, Skagit, and Whatcom co unties is capped at $1 mil- lion per biennium. The funding source for ferry deficit re- imbursement is the portion of the motor vehicle fund that is distributed direc tly to counties. Summary: The combined total amou nt of reimbursement to Pierce, Skagit, and Whatcom counties for any deficit in- curred in the operation and maintenance of a ferry systemis increased by $800,000 to $1 .8 million in the 2015-17 bi- ennium. The amount of defi cit reimbursement is indexed to the fiscal growth fa ctor for future biennia. The fares charged by the counties must be at least equal to the fares in place on January 1, 2015; however,fare surcharges are not pa rt of this calculation. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5310 C 39 L 15 E 3 Addressing enforcement actions at facilities sited by the energy facility site evaluation council. By Senators Ericksen, McCoy, Sheldon, Honeyford, Ranker and Clevelan d; by request of Energy Facilities Sit- ing and Evaluation Council. Senate Committee on Energy , Environment & Telecom- municationsHouse Committee on Technology & Economic Develop- ment Background: Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC) . Created in 1970, EFSEC is the permitting and certificating authority for the siting of major energy facil- ities in Washington. An EFSEC site certification agree-ment (SCA) authorizes an applicant to construct and operate an energy facility in lieu of any other permit ordocument required by any ot her state agency or subdivi- sion. As part of the SCA process, EFSEC issues all stateand federal air and water-discharge permits. EFSEC Members . EFSEC is comprised of a chair ap- pointed by the Governor, and representatives from fivestate agencies: the departments of Commerce, Ecology,Fish and Wildlife, and Natura l Resources, and the Utilities and Transportation Commission. Four other departmentsmay each choose to particip ate in EFSEC for a particular project: Agriculture, Health , Transportation, and Military. Finally, local governments must also appoint members toEFSEC for the review of pr oposed facilities located in their jurisdictions. EFSEC Jurisdiction . EFSEC's siting jurisdiction in- cludes nuclear power plants of any size and thermal elec- tric power plants with a generating capacity of 350 megawatts or greater. Energy facilities of any size that ex- clusively use alternative energy resources, such as windpower, can also opt into th e EFSEC review and certifica- tion process. Enforcing Permits in the SCA . EFSEC has the regu- latory authority to enforce compliance with conditions in the SCA through fines or by ceasing construction or oper- ation of the facility. A violation of a permit issued by EF-SEC can be enforced by a fine up to $5,000 per day. Asimilar permit issued by the Department of Ecology (Ecol-ogy), however, is enforceable by a fine up to $10,000 perday. Unlike Ecology, EFSEC does not have authority tolevy an additional fine of up to $100,000 pe r day for dis- charges of oil on the state's waters, and it is not clear thatEcology has authority to impo se this fine on facilities that possess an SCA. Summary: Raises the Maximum Penalty Amount EF- SEC May Impose on Permit Violators . The maximum dai- ly fine EFSEC may impose for a permit violation is raisedfrom $5,000 per day to $10,000 per day, which equalsEcology's authority for violations of similar permits. Clarifies that Ecology ma y Impose Oil-Discharge Fines on Facilities Certificated by EFSEC . Ecology is granted express authority to impose fines up to $100,000per day on EFSEC-certificated facilities that illegally dis-charge oil on the state's waters. Corrects Errors and Makes Other Clarifying Changes . Statutory references are corrected, types of permits are ex-pressly listed, redundant language is removed, and the ap-peal process is clarified.Votes on Final Passage: Senate 48 0 House 97 0 Senate 48 0 House 67 31 (House amended)Senate 43 2 (Senate concurred) Senate 47 02SSB 5311 201Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 2SSB 5311 C 87 L 15 Requiring crisis intervention training for peace officers. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Kohl-Welles, Hasegawa and Jayapal). Senate Committee on Law & Justice Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Public SafetyHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: Law enforcement officers, especially those assigned to patrol duty, respond to incidents involving per-sons in distress or in crisis. During these encounters, per-sons may behave unpredictably, or endanger themselvesor others, due to mental illn ess, substance use, or other causes. Crisis intervention tr aining helps officers recog- nize, understand, and respond effectively to high-risk be-haviors during these events using strategies to reducepotential harm. Summary: The Criminal Justice Training Commission (CJTC) must provide at least eight hours of crisis interven-tion training as part of the basic training academy for all new full-time law enforcemen t officers hired by general authority law enforcement agenci es after July 1, 2017. Af- ter July 1, 2017, CJTC must also require that general au-thority peace officers comple te two hours of annual crisis intervention training and pa ss a written exam to maintain their certification. By July 1, 2021, all general authority peace officers certified before July 1, 2017, must receive crisis interven- tion training similar to the ba sic academy's eight-hour cri- sis intervention training. The Commission must make efforts to provide enhanced crisis intervention training, consisting of 40 hours using a curriculum developed andcertified by CJTC to at least 25 percent of certified officers assigned to patrol duty. CJTC must adopt crisis interven- tion training standards by rule. The act applies only if specific funding is appropriated in the budget.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015SB 5314 C 231 L 15 Modifying the use of local storm water charges paid by the department of transportation. By Senators Benton, Cleveland and King.Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on EnvironmentHouse Committee on Transportation Background: Under current law, local government utili- ties can charge the Washington State Department of Trans- portation (WSDOT) 30 percent of the rate for comparable real property for the construc tion, operation, and mainte- nance of storm water control facilities. Local government utilities must use these funds fo r storm water control facil- ities that directly reduce state highway storm water runoffimpacts or implementation of best management practicesthat will reduce the need for such facilities. Local govern- ment utilities coordinate with WSDOT to develop a planof expenditure for storm water charges each year, and re-port on the use of the char ges assessed for the prior year. The 2014 supplemental transportation budget tempo- rarily expanded the types of storm water control facilities that local governments can address with the storm watercharges received from WSDOT to include facilities that directly reduce runoff impacts, regardless of whether the impacts are related to state highways. Annual local gov- ernment utility planning and re porting requirements on the use of storm water charges from WSDOT are currentlysuspended. These temporary changes are set to expire onJune 30, 2015. Summary: The types of storm wate r control facilities that local governments can address with the storm watercharges received from WSDOT are expanded to includefacilities that directly reduce runoff impacts, regardless of whether the impacts are related to state highways. The au- thority to use charges received prior to the effective date of the act for non-highway storm water runoff facilities isprovided. Annual local gove rnment utility planning and reporting requirements on th e use of storm water charges to WSDOT are eliminated.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: June 30, 2015Senate 45 0 House 78 20 Senate 48 0 House 96 1Senate 48 0 House 92 6E2SSB 5315 202E2SSB 5315 C 1 L 15 E 3 Aligning functions of the co nsolidated technology ser- vices agency, office of the chief information officer, officeof financial management, and department of enterpriseservices.

Senate Committee on Health Care Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: The American Academy of Pediatrics re- leased guidelines for the pr ovision of providing health care services to infants, child ren, and adolescents, known as Bright Futures. Bright Futures guidelines have been supported by the US Department of Health and HumanServices, Health Resources and Services Administrationand were included in the Affo rdable Care Act as required preventive health services for group and individual healthplans. The Bright Futures guidelines include a schedule of recommended universal de velopmental and autism screenings. These include sensory screenings, develop-mental and behavioral hea lth assessments, and physical examinations. Medicaid programs are no t required to follow the Bright Futures guidelines. However, Medicaid includesbenefits under the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagno-sis and Treatment Program ( EPSDT) for enrollees under 21 years of age. EPSDT covers health screening visits for developmental screening for children between 9 and 30months. Screening for autism is covered when a child is36 months of age or younger and is suspected of havingautism. Following the Bright Futures guidelines would al- low for two additional deve lopmental screenings at 9 months and another between 24 and 30 months plus twoautism screenings at 18 and 24 months. The 2012 Legislature directed the Washington State Institute for Public Policy (W SIPP) to assess the costs and benefits of implementing the Bright Futures guidelines re- garding the well-child visit sc hedule and universal screen- ing for autism and developmental conditions. The WSIPPreport, completed in January 2013, suggests children cov- ered in Washington Medicaid may be under diagnosedwith developmental conditions and delays compared with prevalence rates for national prevalence benchmarks. Summary: Effective January 1, 2016, the Health Care Authority must require universal screening and providerpayment for autism and developmental delays as recom-mended by the Bright Futures guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics, as they existed on the effectivedate of this act, subject to the availability of funds. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 27, 2015 SSB 5322 C 88 L 15 Concerning conservation dist ricts' rates and charges. By Senate Committee on Agri culture, Water & Rural Eco- nomic Development (originally sponsored by SenatorsHatfield, Hobbs and Honeyford). Senate Committee on Agriculture, Water & Rural Eco- nomic Development House Committee on Local GovernmentHouse Committee on Finance Background: A conservation district (CD) is a govern- mental subdivision of the state, exercising public powers. However, it may not levy taxes or issue bonds. Besides acceptance of gifts and grants, CDs are fund- ed by one of two options, but not both. Special Assessments . Special assessments are one funding option. Activities an d programs to conserve nat- ural resources are declared to be of special benefit to landsand may be used as the basis to impose special assess-ments. The special assessments are imposed by the countylegislative authority of the c ounty in which the CD lies and for periods not to exceed ten years each. The supervisors of the CD, its governing body, must hold a public hearing on a proposed system of assess-ments. The supervisors then file the proposed system of assessments with the county legislative authority which then holds its public hearing. The findings of the county legislative authority are final and conclusive, specificallythat both the public interest will be served and that the spe- cial assessments will not excee d the special benefit the land will receive from the CD's activities. The system of assessments mu st (1) classify the lands within the CD based on the be nefits incurred; (2) state an annual per-acre rate of assessm ent for each classification; and (3) indicate the total am ount of special assessments proposed to be obtained from each classification. The as-sessment rate must be stated for each classification as ei- ther an annual per-acre amount up to $0.10 per acre or asa flat rate per parcel up to $5 per parcel, or up to $10 perparcel if the population of th e county is over 1.5 million, plus a uniform annual rate per acre. Rates and Charges . Rates and charges are the other funding option. These are approved by resolution of thecounty legislative authority. The CD may propose to the county legislative authority a system of rates and charges which the county may consider, in its discretion. Senate 44 0 Senate 47 0 House 89 3SSB 5328 204The CD's proposed system of rates and charges may consider any matters that present a reasonable differenceas grounds for distinction includ ing the income level of the people served, including seni or citizens and the disabled; property used by nonprofit charities as defined in the fed- eral tax law and the state corporations act; the characterand use of the land; the benefits the land will receive; andthe services the CD will furnish. The assessment rate for rates and charges may be stat- ed as either an annual per-acre amount up to $0.10 per acreor as a flat rate per parcel up to $5 per parcel, or up to $10per parcel if the population of the county is over 1.5 mil- lion, plus an annual per-acre amount. The populations of the following counties are over 480,000 and less than 1.5 millio n: Pierce, Snohomish and Spokane. Summary: In setting its proposed system of rates and charges, a CD may consider the natural resource needswithin the district and the capac ity of the district to provide services, improvements, or both as reasonable differencesjustifying a distinction. An intermediate tier of ra tes and charges is estab- lished. For counties with populations between 480,000 and 1.5 million the maximum per-parcel rate cannot ex-ceed $10. For counties with populations of over 1.5 mil-lion - only King at this time - the maximum per-parcelrate is raised from $10 to $15.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5328 C 212 L 15 Disseminating financial aid information. By Senate Committee on High er Education (originally sponsored by Senators Kohl-Welles, Bailey and Chase). Senate Committee on Higher Education House Committee on Higher Education Background: The State Need Grant (SNG) program as- sists needy and disa dvantaged students by offsetting a por- tion of their higher education costs. To be eligible, a student's family income cann ot exceed 70 percent of the state's median family income , currently $58,500 for a fam- ily of four. Approximately 70,000 low-income recipientsreceived SNG funds during the 2013-14 academic year. However, 33,500 students were unserved for one or moreterms. The Legislature provided the SNG program $308million for 2014-15. In 2014 the Legislature passed SB 6358, requiring the community and technical colleg es to provide financial aid application due dates and information on whether or not fi-nancial aid will be awarded on a rolling basis to admittedstudents at the time of their acceptance. The Legislature encouraged institutions of high er education to post finan- cial aid application dates and distribution policies on theirwebsites. Summary: Public four-year institutions of higher educa- tion must provide financial ai d application due dates and distribution policies on their websites, including whether financial aid is awarded on a rolling basis, for prospective and admitted students.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5337 C 29 L 15 Modifying per diem rates for po rt district officers and em- ployees. By Senators Fraser and Pearson.Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on Local Government Background: In 1911 the Legislature authorized the Port District Act allowing citizens to create port districts. Portdistricts are authorized for the purpose of acquisition, con-struction, maintenance, opera tion, development, and regu- lation of harbor improvements, rail or motor vehicletransfer and terminal facilities, water and air transfer andterminal facilities, or any combination of these facilities. Among the general powers granted to ports are the follow-ing: acquisition of land, prop erty, leases, and easements; condemnation of property and the exercising of emi- nent domain; development of lands fo r industrial and commercial purposes; imposition of taxes, rates, and charges; selling or otherwise conveying rights to property; and construction and mainte nance of specified types of park and recreation facilities. The port district is governed by a three-member board of commissioners elected to staggered six or four-yearterms of office, with at l east one commissioner being elected in each odd-year general election. V oters of a portdistrict with a population of 500,000 or more may autho-rize increasing the size of the board of commissioners tofive members. Port commissioners have the authority to hire employ- ees and set wages, salaries, and benefits. Employees, offi-cers, and commissioners of port districts may be reimbursed for travel and ot her business expenses incurred on behalf of the port district. A port district must adopt aSenate 30 18 House 65 32Senate 49 0 House 96 1 (House amended)Senate 45 0 (Senate concurred)ESSB 5346 205resolution to establish regula tions governing reimburse- ment for travel and other business expenses incurred by port officials and employees on behalf of the district. These regulations may establish that port officials and em-ployees are paid per diem in lieu of actual expenses, butper diem cannot exceed $25 per day. Summary: Per diem rates for port district officials and employees must not exceed th e U.S. General Service Ad- ministration per diem rates.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESSB 5346 C 30 L 15 Providing first responders w ith contact information for subscribers of personal emergency response servicesduring an emergency. By Senate Committee on Hea lth Care (originally spon- and Chase). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Public Safety Background: Personal emergency response systems, or medical emergency response systems, let a person call forhelp in an emergency by push ing a button in a small trans- mitter that can be worn around a person's neck, on a wrist- band or belt, or in a pocket. Many private companies offer personal emergency response systems, such as Life Alertor Lifeline. Most systems are programmed to telephone an emergency response cent er when activated. The 2014 Legislative budget directed the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) to contract with the Area Agencies on Aging to convene a workgroup of firstresponders and companies providing personal emergencyresponse services to develop a proposal to share informa- tion with first responders in the event of a long-term power or telecommunications outage. The workgroup provideda report to the Legislature in November. The analysis con-cluded that there were no concerns related to the federalHealth Insurance Portability and Accountab ility Act (HI- PAA), and any liability concerns could be addressed withlanguage related to the public duty doctrine. DSHS has modified contracts for the 90 00 individuals that receive personal response systems through Medicaid that requirethe companies to provide basic information to first re- sponders in the event of an emergency. The State Board of Health recently completed a Health Impact Review of a pr oposal to requ ire companies providing life alert services to provide the location andknown medical conditions of their customers when re- quested by first responders du ring an emergency. The re-search indicates a majority of customers using a personal emergency response system ar e vulnerable or at-risk and more likely to experience nega tive health outcomes during an emergency. The research in dicated a proposal to share the customer information to inform emergency responses would likely have positive hea lth impacts on customers. The Health Impact Review of this legislation is avail- able at the Washington State Board of Health's website:sboh.wa.gov/Portals/7/Doc/ HealthImpactReviews/HIR- 2015-04-SB5346-esum.pdf. Summary: When requested by first responders during an emergency, employees of companies providing personalemergency response services must provide the name, ad- dress, and any other information necessary for the first re-sponder to contact their subscribers. First respondersmean firefighters, law enfor cement officers, and emergen- cy medical personnel. Emergency means an occurrence that renders the personal emergency response services sys-tem inoperable for a period of 24 hours or more, and thatrequires the attention of first responders. Companies providing personal emergency response services may adopt policies to respond to requests fromfirst responders that may include procedures to verify thatthe requester is a first responder and to verify the requestis related to an emergency. Information received by a fi rst responder is confiden- tial and exempt from public di sclosure. The information may be used only in responding to the emergency thatprompted the request for inform ation. First responders re- ceiving information must destro y it at the end of the emer- gency. It is not a violation if a personal emergency response services company or employee makes a good faith effortto comply. The company or employee is immune fromcivil liability for a good faith effort to comply. Should a company or employee prevail in defense, the company oremployee is entitled to re cover expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees. First responders and their employing jurisdictions are not liable for failing to request the information. This act does not create a private right of action nor any civil liabil-ity on the part of the state or any political subdivision.

By Senate Committee on High er Education (originally sponsored by Senators Bailey, Kohl-Welles, Roach, Con-way, Braun, Baumgartner, Ro by request of Governor Inslee). Senate Committee on Higher Education Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Higher EducationHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: Washington Resident Students. In 2014 Washington removed the one-year waiting period for vet-erans for purposes of receiv ing resident tuition rates at Washington higher educatio n institutions. A Washington state resident student includ es a student who has separated from the military under honora ble conditions after at least two years of service, and who enters an institution of high- er education in Washington within one year of the date ofseparation who: at the time of separation designated Washington as the student's intended domicile; has Washington as the student's official home of record; or moves to Washington and establishes a domicile.Students who are the spouse or a dependant of an in- dividual who separated from the military under the afore- mentioned conditions, are al so resident students. Resident students are eligib le for resident tuition rates at institutions of higher education in Washington. Withsome exceptions, resident students are charged tuition rates that are generally much lower than the tuition rates charged to non-resident students. Veterans Choice Act. The Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 20 14 (Choice Act) requires states to offer in-state tuition rates to all veterans living in that state who have enrolled at an in-state higher education institution within three year s of departing the military. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must disapprove acourse of education for Post -9/11 GI Bill funds disburse- ment at institutions that do not provide resident tuition to all covered individuals under the Choice Act. A coveredindividual includes the following: a Veteran who lives in st ate and enrolls in the school within three years of discharge from a period of active duty service of 90 days or more; a spouse or child using transferred benefits who lives in state and enrolls in the school within three years ofthe transferor's discharge from a period of active duty service of 90 days or more; or a spouse or child using benefits under the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship who lives in state and enrolls in the school within three years of the service member's death in the line of dutyfollowing a period of active duty service of 90 days or more. Washington State does not currently provide resident tuition rates to all covered individuals under the Choice Act. Summary: The definition of resident student is amended to include the following: a student who has separated from the uniformed ser- vices with any period of honorable service after atleast 90 days of active duty service, is eligible for fed- eral veterans education assistance benefits, and who enters an institution of hi gher education in Washing- ton within three years of separation; a student who is a spouse, former spouse, or child and is entitled to veterans administration educational assistance benefits (Benefits) based on their relation- ship to an individual who has separated from the uni- formed services with any period of honorable serviceafter at least 90 days of active duty service, and who enters an institution in Wash ington within three years of separation; or a student who is entitled to Benefits b ased on their relationship with a deceased member of the uni- formed services who comple ted at least 90 days of active duty service and died in the line of duty, andSenate 40 9 House 94 3 (House amended)Senate 36 9 (Senate concurred)SSB 5362 208the student enters an instit ution in Washington within three years of the service members' death. A qualifying student who remains continuously en- rolled at an institution retains resident student status.

By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Senators King and L iias; by request of Utilities & Transportation Commission). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Under current law, the Utilities and Trans- portation Commission (UTC) regulates various transpor- tation industries, including passenger charter andexcursion carriers. A charter party carrier is a service en-gaged in the transportation of a group of persons who un-der a single contract have acquired the use of a motor busto travel together to a specif ied destination or for a partic- ular itinerary. An excursion service carrier is a service,which may be regularly sched uled, engaged in the trans- portation of persons for comp ensation from points of ori- gin to any other locations within the state of Washingtonand returning to that origin.Current law does not specifically state that a service providing transportation of persons by party bus, in whichfood, beverages, or entertainment may be provided, is le-gally engaged in the business of a charter party carrier or excursion service carrier. The following are not subject to charter and excursion carrier regulations: (1) pers ons operating motor vehicles wholly within the limits of in corporated cities; (2) persons operating taxicabs, hotel buses , or school buses; (3) pas- senger vehicles carrying passengers on a noncommercialbasis; or (4) limousine charter party carriers. Summary: Transporting persons by party bus over any public highway is specifically considered in law as engag- ing in the business of a charte r party carrier or excursion service carrier, subject to UTC regulation. The following provisions relating to the consumption of alcohol aboard charter an d excursion carriers are speci- fied: If alcoholic beverages are served or consumed aboard a party bus, the holder of the alcohol permit must (1) be on the party bus or reasonably proximate andavailable to the vehicle du ring the transportation ser- vice, (2) monitor and control party activities to pre- vent driver distraction, and (3) assume responsibility for compliance with the alcohol permit; If the carrier operating the party bus is the permit holder, then the carrier must have a person other than the driver satisfy the alcohol permit holder require-ments; If at any time the carrier operating the party bus believes that the conditions aboard the vehicle areunsafe due to party activiti es involving alcohol, the carrier must remove all alcoholic beverages and lock them in the trunk or other locked compartment; and Any carrier in violation of the alcohol-related provi- sions is subject to a penalty of up to $5,000 per viola- tion. A carrier may not knowingly allow any passenger to smoke aboard a carrier's vehicle. Smoke is defined as thecarrying or smoking of any kind of lighted pipe, cigar, cig-arette, or any other lighted smoking equipment. The exemption from UTC regu lations for persons op- erating motor vehicles wholly within the limits of incorpo-rated cities is removed. Engaging in the business of a charter party carrier or excursion service carrier is clarified to include certain ad-vertising activities. Engaging in the carrier business with- out a valid UTC certificate s ubjects the violator to a penalty of up to $5,000 per violation.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015Senate 49 0 Senate 44 0Senate 44 0Senate 45 0 House 98 0 Senate 42 6 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 44 2 (Senate concurred)SSB 5381 209SSB 5381 C 130 L 15 Creating a protocol for the retu rn of firearms in the posses- sion of law enforcement agencies. By Senate Committee on Law & Justice (originally spon- sored by Senators Billig, Frockt, Pedersen, Kohl-Welles,Rolfes, Liias, Nelson, Fraser, Cleveland, McCoy andMcAuliffe). Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: Superior courts and courts of limited juris- diction can order forfeiture of a pistol found concealed ona person not authorized to ca rry a concealed pistol. The weapon may be returned if the person possessed a validconcealed pistol license (CPL ) within the preceding two years and has not become inelig ible for a CPL in the inter- im. Other circumstances under which the court may order forfeiture of a firearm are when the firearm: was commercially sold to any person without an application; is in the possession of a person prohibited from pos- sessing the firearm; is in the possession or un der the control of a person at the time the person committe d or was arrested for committing a felony or committing a non-felonycrime in which a firearm was used or displayed; is in the possession of a person who is in any place in which a CPL is required, and who is under the influ-ence of any drug or under the influence of intoxicat- ing liquor; is in the possession of a person free on bail or per- sonal recognizance pending tr ial, appeal, or sentenc- ing for a felony or for a no n-felony crime in which a firearm was used or displayed; is in the possession of a person found to have been mentally incompetent while in possession of a fire- arm when apprehended or who is thereafter commit-ted; is used or displayed by a person in the violation of a proper written order of a court of general jurisdiction;or is used in the commission of a felony or of a non-fel- ony crime in which a firearm was used or displayed. The firearm may be returned to the owner if the court finds that there was no probab le cause to believe that one of these circumstances existed or the firearm was stolenfrom the true owner or the owner had no knowledge of norconsented to the act that resulted in the forfeiture. A law enforcement officer may confiscate a firearm found to be in the possession of a person under the samecircumstances. After confisca tion, the firearm must not be surrendered except to the pr osecuting attorney for use insubsequent legal proceedings , for disposition according to an order of a court; or to the owner if the proceedings aredismissed. Summary: Law enforcement agencies must develop no- tification protocols that allow family or household mem-bers to request notif ication before a firearm is returned to the person from whom it was obta ined or to an authorized representative. Notification can be by telephone, email,text message, or other method s that avoid unnecessary de- lay. Once notification can be given if the law enforcement agency is returning more than one firearm to the same in- dividual. An individual who makes a request for notifica-tion based on false informati on may be held criminally liable for making a false or misleading statement to a pub-lic servant, a gross misdemeanor. Information must not be rel eased other than to a fam- ily or household member who has an incident or case num-ber and who has requested to be notified or to other lawenforcement agencies. The in formation provided by the family or household member in the request, including theexistence of the request, is not subject to the Public Re-cords Act. Public and governme nt agencies, officials, and employees are immune from ci vil liability for the release or the failure to release info rmation related to the notifica- tion system as long as the release was without gross negli-gence. A law enforcement agency must provide written no- tice to the individual from wh om it was obtained specify- ing the reason for the hold with in five business days of the individual requesting return of the firearm. Before a law enforcement agency returns a privately owned firearm, theagency must: confirm that the firear m is returned to the person from whom it was obtained or to an authorized repre- sentative; confirm that the pers on to whom the firearm is returned is eligible to possess it; provide notice, within one business day of an individ- ual requesting return of a firearm, to family or house- hold members who have requested notification of the firearm return; if notification has been requested, ensure that 72 hours have elapsed from the time notification wasprovided; or, if no notific ation was requested, ensure that 24 hours have elapsed from the time the firearm was obtained by law enforcement; and ensure that the firearm is not required to beheld in custody or otherwise prohibited from being released. The firearm must be released without unnecessary de- lay once these requirements have been met. Notification toa family or household member must occur within onebusiness day of verifying th at all requirements for return of the firearm have been met.SB 5387 210The provisions do not apply to circumstances where a law enforcement officer has mo mentarily obtained a fire- arm from an individual and would otherwise immediatelyreturn the firearm to the individual during the same inter-action.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5387 C 176 L 15 Creating uniformity in common provisions governing business organizations and other entities. By Senators Pedersen and O'Ban; by request of Uniform Law Commission. Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: Washington's business entity laws divide the most common entities by ty pe: for-profit corporations, nonprofit and mutual corporations, partnerships and limit-ed partnerships, limited liability companies (LLCs), em-ployee cooperatives, cooperat ive associations, corporation sole - church and religious societies, fraternal societiesand their building corporations, and granges. Structurallythese laws contain all of the legal requirements pertainingto each entity type in its own provision. The national Uniform Law Commission recommends a more integrated legal framework for states stemmingfrom its long-term Harmoniza tion of Business Entity Acts Drafting Project. The Uniform Business OrganizationsCode (UBOC) uses a hub-and- spoke model, putting the le- gal requirements common to all entities in one provision. The individual entity acts rema in as spokes containing all entity-specific requirements. UBOC's recently completed Article 1 contains its rec- ommended common hub provisions. Using UBOC'sstructure, a recently completed project in Washingtonidentifies these common hub pr ovisions throughout Wash- ington's business entity laws for possible inclusion in a new Washington business hub provision. Summary: A new section in Title 23 RCW adopts the 2013 UBOC Article 1 common provisions for the Secre-tary of State's oversight of for-profit corporations, non-profit and mutual corporations, partnerships and limitedpartnerships, limited liability companies, employee coop- eratives, cooperative associations, corporation sole -church and religious societies, fraternal societies and their building corporations, and gran ges. The common legal re- quirements for these business entities al so include reserva- tion and registration of entity names, registered agents,foreign entities doing business in Washington, and entity dissolution and reinstatement. The Secretary of State retains its current regulatory authority over business en tities including rulemaking au- thority and authority to set and collect fees from regulated business entities. Each busi ness entity retains its separate law containing its entity-specific legal requirements. Theentity specific sections are amended as necessary to re-move redundant provisions which move to the new com-mon provisions section in Title 23. January 1, 2016, is the effective date for all parts of the proposal. Makes a num-ber of minor technical and housekeeping amendments forclarity and consistency and to correct inaccurate cross ref-erences. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: January 1, 2016 (Part VII Contingent) 2SSB 5404 C 69 L 15 Concerning homeless youth prevention and protection. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators O'Ban, Darneille, Frockt, and Conway;by request of Governor Inslee). Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Early Le arning & Human Services House Committee on Appropriations Background: Programs for Street and Homeless Youth . The Children's Administration of the Department of So-cial and Health Services (DSHS) administers a number ofprograms regarding the care of street and homeless youth.For example, there are the following: HOPE Centers. Hope Centers provide temporary residential placements for street youth under the ageof 18. These are homeless youth living on the street or other unsafe locations. Youth may self-refer to a HOPE Center for services. Payment for a HOPECenter bed does not require prior approval and enter- ing a HOPE Center is voluntary. While residing in a HOPE Center, each youth will undergo a comprehen-sive assessment to include the youth's legal status, a physical examination, a mental health and chemical abuse evaluation, and an educational evaluation of their basic skills, along w ith any learning disabilities or special needs. The purpose of the assessment is to develop the best plan for the youth. The plan willfocus on finding a permanent and stable home for theSenate 49 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 47 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 49 0 (Senate concurred)2SSB 5404 211youth. This plan might include reunifying the youth with the youth's parent(s) or legal guardian and/or getting the youth into a tr ansitional living situation and off the streets; and Crisis Residential Centers (CRC). CRCs are short- term, semi-secure faciliti es for runaway youth and adolescents in conflict with their families. Youth can-not remain in a CRC more than 15 consecutive days. Counselors at a CRC, typica lly in collaboration with a social worker, work with the family to resolve the immediate conflict. Counselors will also help the youth and family develop better ways of dealing with conflict in the future. The goal is to reunite the fam- ily and youth wherever poss ible. The family will also be referred for additional ser vices if other needs are identified. A semi-secure facility is a CRC, or spe- cialized foster family home , operated in a way to rea- sonably assure that youth placed there will not run away. A secure facility is a CRC center that has lock- ing doors, locking windows, or a secured perimeter,designed and operated to prevent a child from leaving without permission of the facility staff. The Department of Commerce (Commerce) operates the Independent Youth Housing Program by providingrental assistance and case management for eligible youthwho have aged out of the state foster care system. Thesefunds are intended to assist in meeting the state goal of en- suring that all such youth avoid experiencing homeless-ness by having access to a decent, appropriate, andaffordable homes in a healthy, safe environment. Partici- pating youth must meet the follo wing criteria to be eligible for assistance: participants must be at least 18 years of age, must have been a depend ent of the state at any time during the four-month period preceding the youth's eigh-teenth birthday, and must have not yet reached the age of23. Priority must be given to individuals who were depen-dents of the state for at least one year. Home Security Fund . There is a $40 document re- cording fee surcharge. The revenue generated supportshomeless housing and assistan ce programs, and the reve- nue is shared between the coun ty that collected the reve- nue and the state. The state's share is deposited into theHome Security Fund. Co mmerce uses these monies to fund a number of homeless housing programs, with atleast 45 percent of the state's share set aside for the use ofprivate rental housing payments. Homeless Families Services Fund . This fund exists within the custody of the State Treasurer and includes aone-time appropriation by the Legislature, private contri- butions, and all other source s deposited into the fund. Commerce may expend monies from the fund to providestate matching funds for housing-based supportive ser-vices for homeless families over a period of at least ten years.Summary: The goal of the Legislature is to reduce and prevent youth and young adult homelessness by increasingand improving priority service areas: (1) stable housing,(2) family reconciliation, (3 ) permanent connections, (4) education and employment op portunities, and (5) social and emotional wellbeing. The Office of Homeless Youth Prevention and Protec- tion Programs (Office) is created. The measurable goalsof the Office is to measur ably decrease the number of homeless youth and young adults, identify the causes ofyouth homelessness, and measurably increase permanen-cy rates among homeless youth caused by a youth's sepa-ration from family or legal guardian. The Office mustprovide management and oversight of HOPE Centers, cri-sis residential centers, and street youth services. The Of-fice also gathers data and outcome measures, initiatesdata-sharing agreements, develops specific recommenda-tions and timelines to address funding, policy, and practicegaps with the state system, and increases system integra-tion and coordinates efforts to prevent state systems from discharging youth into homel essness. An advisory com- mittee must consult with th e Office regarding funding, policy, and practice gaps within and among state pro- grams. The Office must be operational no later than Janu-ary 1, 2016. By December 1, 2016, the Office must submita report to the Governor and Legislature to inform and pro-vide recommendations regarding funding, policy, and bestpractices in the five service areas identified. Other changes made by the Homeless Youth Preven- tion and Protection Act include the following: Regarding HOPE Centers: Commerce must establish HOPE Centers and DSHS licenses them. HOPE Cen- ters notify DSHS when a street youth do not promptly return and DSHS notifies the youth's parents. Beforedependent children can stay at a HOPE Center, prior approval by DSHS is necessary; Regarding CRCs: Commerce must contract for CRCs and DSHS licenses th em. CRCs must record client information into a homeless management infor- mation system specified by Commerce. CRCs mustnotify DSHS if a child leaves without authorization; The Home Security Funds appropriated to carry out the enumerated homeless youth activities are not sub-ject to the 45 percent set aside for the use of private rental housing payments; The Homeless Families Services Fund is renamed the Washington Youth and Families Fund. Revenue can include appropriations from the Legislature in addi- tion to private contributions, and all other sources inthe fund. Commerce may expend monies from the fund to provide state ma tching funds for housing- based supportive services for homeless youth andfamilies; ESB 5419 212 The Office must establish a statewide training pro- gram on homeless youth for criminal justice person- nel; Commerce's ten-year ho meless housing strategic plan is revised to include the reduction in the number of unaccompanied homeless youth; and Local governments using document recording sur- charge fees must collect data regarding the amount of fees expended on, and number of services provided to, unaccompanied homeless youth. The Joint Legislature and Audit Review Committee must conduct a review of state-funded programs that serveunaccompanied homeless yout h to determine what perfor- mance measures exist, what statutory reporting require-ments exist, and whether there is reliable data on the ages of youth served, length of stay, and effectiveness of pro-gram exit and reentry. The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction's biennial report on data of homeless students is expandedto include the number, acad emic performance, and educa- tional outcomes of identified unaccompanied homeless students enrolled in public schools.

By Senators Fain, Mullet, Frockt, Hill, Dammeier, Rolfes, Kohl-Welles Chase. Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education House Committee on Education Background: The Family Educational Rights and Priva- cy Act (FERPA) and state laws give parents and studentsrights with respect to edu cation records. Under FERPA, schools generally must have written consent from the par- ent, or student when the right has transferred, in order torelease any personally identif iable information from a stu- dent's education record. Howe ver, there are exceptions to this consent requirement. Currently there are no Washin gton or federal laws that limit the sharing of personal student information by other entities that provide services to schools and have access to personal student information. The Education Data Center w ithin the Office of Finan- cial Management conducts analyses of early learning, K-12, higher education programs, and education and work-force issues across the educatio nal system in collaboration with other agencies.Summary: School Service Providers . School service providers must take specified actions to protect the per-sonal information of students . School service provider means an entity that operates a school service to the extent it is operating in that capac ity. School service means a website, mobile application, or online service that meets all three of the following criteria: is designed and marketed primarily for use in a K-12 school; is used at the direction of teachers or other employees of a K-12 school; and collects, maintains, or uses student personal informa- tion. Student personal informa tion means information col- lected through a school service that personally identifies an individual student or ot her information collected and maintained about an individual student th at is linked to in- formation that identifies an in dividual student. A school service does not include a website, mobile application, oronline service that is designed and marketed for use by in- dividuals or entities generally, even if also marketed to a United States K-12 school. School Service Pr oviders' Policies . School service providers must provide (1) clear and easy to understand in-formation about the types of student personal information they collect and about how th ey use and share the student personal information, and (2) prominent notice before making material changes to their privacy policies for school services. Where the school service is offered to aneducational institution or te acher, this information and prominent notice may be provid ed to the educational insti- tution or teacher. School service providers mu st facilitate access to and correction of student personal information by students ortheir parent or guardian either directly or through the rele- vant educational institution or teacher. These requirements do no t apply to the Education Data Center, but they do apply to any of its subcontractors. Consent for Use of Studen t Personal Information . School service providers must obtain consent before usingstudent personal info rmation in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the provid er's privacy policy or school contract for the applicable sc hool service in effect at the time of collection. Existing law regarding co nsent, including consent from minors and employees on behalf of educational insti-tutions, is not changed. Collecting, Using, and Sharing Student Personal In- formation . School service providers may collect, use, and share student personal inform ation only for purposes au- thorized by the relevant edu cational institution or teacher, or with the consent of the student or the student's parent orguardian. School service providers may not: sell student personal information; Senate 48 1 House 71 26ESB 5419 213 use or share any student personal information for pur- poses of targeted advertising to students; or use student personal in formation to create a personal profile of a student other than for supporting purposesauthorized by the relevant educational institution or teacher, or with the consen t of the student or the stu- dent's parent or guardian. The prohibition against sellin g student personal infor- mation does not apply to the purchase, merger, or othertype of acquisition of a school service provider, or any as-sets of a school service provid er by another entity, as long as the successor entity continues to be subject to the fore- going provisions with respect to previously acquired stu-dent personal information to the extent that the school service provider was regulated with regard to its acquisi-tion of student personal information. Targeted advertising means sending advertisements to a student where the advertisement is selected based on in-formation obtained or inferre d from that student's online behavior, usage of applications, or student personal infor-mation. It does not include the following: advertising to a studen t at an online location based upon that student's current visit to that location with- out the collection and reten tion of a student's online activities over time; or adaptive learning, personalized learning, or custom- ized education. The foregoing provisions do not apply to the use or disclosure of personal information by a school service pro-vider to: 1. protect the security or integrity of its website, mobile application, or online service; 2. ensure legal or regulato ry compliance or to take pre- cautions against liability; 3. respond to or participate in judicial process; 4. protect the safety of users or others on the website, mobile application, or online service; 5. investigate a matter related to public safety; or 6. a subcontractor, if the school service provider: a. contractually prohibits the subcontractor from us- ing any student personal information for any pur- pose other than providing the contracted service to, or on behalf of, the school service provider; b. prohibits the subcontractor from disclosing any student personal inform ation provided by the school service provider to subsequent third parties unless the disclosure is expressly permitted; and c. requires the subcontracto r to comply with the re- quirements. School service providers must delete student personal information within a reasonable period of time if the rele- vant educational institution re quests deletion of the data under the control of the ed ucational institution unless: the school service provider has obtained student con- sent or the consent of the student's parent or guardian to retain information re lated to that student; or the student has transferred to another educational institution and that e ducational institution has requested that the school service provider retain information related to that student. Information Security Program . School service pro- viders must maintain a comp rehensive information securi- ty program that is reasonably designed to protect thesecurity, privacy, confidentia lity, and integrity of student personal information. The information security program should make use of appropri ate administrative, technolog- ical, and physical safeguards. Adaptive Learning and Customized Education . Noth- ing is intended to prohibit th e use of student personal in- formation for purposes of: adaptive learning or personalized or customized edu- cation; maintaining, developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the school service provider's website, mobile application, online service, or application; providing recommendations for school, educational, or employment purposes within a school service without the response being determined in whole or in part by payment or other consideration from a thirdparty; or responding to a student' s request for information or for feedback without the information or response being determined in whole or in part by payment or other consideration from a third party. Construction of the Act . The act must not be con- strued to: impose a duty upon a provider of an interactive com- puter service to review or enforce compliance by third-party content providers; apply to general audien ce Internet websites, general audience mobile applica tions, or general audience online services even if login credentials created for a school service provider's we bsite, mobile application, or online service may be used to access those ser-vices; impede the ability of students to download, export, or otherwise save or maintain their own student data or documents; limit Internet service providers from providing Inter- net connectivity to schools or students and their fami-lies; prohibit a school service provider from marketing educational products directly to parents so long as the marketing did not result from use of student personal information obtained by the school service providerESB 5424 214through the provision of its website, mobile applica- tion, or online service; or impose a duty on a school service provider of an elec- tronic store, gateway, marketplace, or other means ofpurchasing or downloading software or applications to review or enforce comp liance on those applications or software. Future Contracts . The limitations and requirements only apply to contracts entered or renewed after the effec-tive date of the act and are not retroactive. This act takes effect July 1, 2016.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2016 ESB 5424 C 31 L 15 Allowing public utility district s to produce and distribute renewable natural gas. By Senators King, McCoy, Ericksen and Hobbs.Senate Committee on Energy , Environment & Telecom- munications House Committee on Technol ogy & Economic Develop- ment Background: Public Utility Districts (PUDs) . Formed in 1931 by Initiative 1, PUDs are municipal corporations au-thorized to provide electricity, water and sewer services,and wholesale telecommunicatio ns. There are 28 operat- ing PUDs in Washington, 23 of which provide electricity, 19 provide water or wastewater services, and 13 providewholesale broadband telecomm unications services. PUDs are not generally subject to the jurisdiction of the Utilitiesand Transportation Commission (UTC). In 2007 the Legislature gr anted PUDs the authority to produce and distribute biodiesel, ethanol, and ethanolblend fuels. PUDs were also authorized to enter into crop purchase contracts for dedicated energy crops for the pur-pose of generating electricity or producing biodiesel from Washington feedstocks. Summary: Authorizing PUDs to Produce and Use Re- newable Natural Gas (RNG) for Internal Operations . PUDs are authorized to prod uce and use RNG for internal operations. Authorizing PUDs to Sell RNG Under Specified Con- ditions . PUDs may generally se ll RNG delivered into a gas transmission pipeline located in the state or in pressur- ized containers: (1) at whol cus- tomers if the RNG is deliver ed through a pipeline pursuant to appropriate transportation tariffs, among other condi-tions. PUDs may also sell RNG through a pipeline direct-ly from an RNG production facility to a facility thatcompresses, liquefies, or disp enses natural gas as a trans- portation fuel. Limiting the Authority of PUDs to Sell RNG . PUDs are not authorized to sell RNG delivered by pipeline to anend-use customer of a gas company. Furthermore, PUDsare not authorized to own or operate natural gas distribu-tion pipeline systems used to serve retail customers; how-ever, PUDs may generally own and operate the following:(1) pipelines that intercon nect RNG production facilities to gas transmission pipelines; and (2) pipelines and facili-ties to provide RNG as a transportation fuel if the pipelinesand facilities are located in the county in which the PUD is authorized to provide utility service. Authorizing Limited Jurisd iction Over PUDs by the UTC . PUDs exercising their RNG authority are not sub- ject to UTC jurisdiction ex cept for pipeline safety admin- istration and enforcement. Defining RNG . RNG means a gas consisting largely of methane and other hydrocarbons derived from the de-composition of organic material in landfills, wastewatertreatment facilities, and anaerobic digesters.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5433 C 198 L 15 Requiring Washington's tribal history, culture, and gov- ernment to be taught in the common schools. By Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Educa- tion (originally and Habib). Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education House Committee on Community Development, Housing & Tribal Affairs Background: There are 29 federally recognized Indian tribes whose reservations are lo cated in Washington. In a 2012 report, the Office of Superintendent of Public In-struction (OSPI) reported that 264 school districts in 2010had between 1 and 1095 Native American or Alaskan Na-tive students attending their schools. In 2005 the Legislature encouraged OSPI to help school districts identify federally recognized Indian tribeswithin or near school districts and school districts were en- couraged to do the following: incorporate curricula about tribal history, culture, and government of the nearest federally recognized tribe and work with tribes to develop such materials; Senate 49 0 House 96 2 Senate 48 0 House 97 0SSB 5438 215 collaborate with tribes to create materials, programs, and cultural exchanges; and collaborate with OSPI on curricular areas of tribal government and history that are statewide in nature.In 2011 the Legislature directed OSPI to create the Of- fice of Native Education (ONE). ONE was tasked withseveral duties including facilitating the development andimplementation of curricula an d instructional materials re- garding native languages, culture and history, and the con-cept of tribal sovereignty. ONE posts curriculum andother resources for elementary, middle, and high schoolson its website. Washington's high school graduation requirements in- clude a minimum of one-half credit of Course work inWashington State history and government. Courses de-signed to meet this requirem ent are encouraged to include information on the culture, history, and government of In-dian tribes in Washington. Summary: The legislative direction encouraging OSPI and school districts to collaborate and take certain actionsto develop and incorporate curricula about tribes ischanged to require such collaboration and actions. OSPImust help school districts iden tify federally recognized In- dian tribes within or near school districts, and school dis-tricts must do the following: when reviewing or adopting social studies curricu- lum, incorporate curricula about tribal history, cul- ture, and government of the nearest federally recognized tribe and work with tribes to develop such materials; collaborate with tribes to create materials, programs, and cultural exchanges; and collaborate with OSPI on curricular areas of tribal government and history that are statewide in nature. School districts must meet the requirements of collab- oration and incorporation about tribal history, culture, andgovernment by using the curriculum developed and madeavailable free of charge by O SPI, but they may modify the curriculum in order to incorpor ate elements that have a re- gional focus or in order to incorporate the curriculum intoexisting curricular materials.

By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally Billig and Pedersen). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Generally, all vehicle operators must obey traffic control devices, includin g traffic signals at intersec- tions. Some of these traffic signals are equipped with sen-sors that determine when a vehicle approaches theintersection. Once detected by the sensor, the traffic signal will initiate a change in, or extension of, a traffic signalphase, for instance, a change from a red light to green. However, if a motorcyclist approaches an intersection, including a left turn intersec tion, controlled by a triggered traffic control signal using a vehicle detection device, and that signal is inoperative due to the size of the motorcycle, the motorcyclist must come to a complete stop. If the sig- nal fails to operate after one cycle, the motorcyclist mayproceed through the intersection or turn left after exercis- ing due care. It is not a defense to a traf fic citation for failure to obey a traffic control signal when a motorcyclist proceeds under the belief that a traffic contro l signal used a vehicle detec- tion device, when it did not; or a traffic control signal wasinoperative due to the size of the motorcycle, when the de- vice was in fact operative. Summary: The operators of mopeds, bicycles, and elec- tric-assisted bicycles are authorized to stop and proceedthrough a traffic control signal under the same require-ments and restrictions as motorcycles. It is not a defense to a traf fic citation for failure to obey a traffic control signal when a person operating a bicycle,electric assisted bicycle, or a moped proceeds under thebelief that the signal used a vehicle detection device, whenit did not; or that the signal was inoperative due to the sizeof the bicycle, assisted bicycle, or moped, when the devicewas in fact operative.

By Senate Committee on Hea lth Care (originally spon- sored by Senators Rivers, Frockt, Parlette, Bailey, Con-way, Keiser and Benton). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Medication coordination, or medication synchronization, is an emer ging pharmacy practice fo- cused on patients that ha ve multiple medications for chronic conditions by encourag ing patients to pick up all their recurring monthly prescriptions on the same day,usually once per month. The concept is often paired with an appointment-based model which involves the pharma- cy coordinating medication re fills and scheduling a pick- up date for the patient. An evaluation of the model in amidwest pharmacy indicated some patients demonstrated greater adherence with prescribed medications. Effective January 1, 2014, Medicare began allowing a pro-rated drug copayment for dispensing less than a 30-day supply to assist patients in moving to a synchronized schedule for medication refills. Summary: Health insurance plans, including the self-in- sured Uniform Medical Plan, that provide coverage for prescription drugs must implement a medication synchro-nization policy for the dispensing of prescription drugs forthe 2016 plan year. Medication synchronization means thecoordination of medication ref ills for a patient taking two or more medications for a ch ronic condition to allow the medications to be refilled on the same schedule. If an enrollee requests medication synchronization for a new prescription, the health plan must permit filling the drug for less than a one-month supply of the drug if syn-chronization will require more than a fifteen-day supply of the drug, or for more than a one-month supply of the drugif synchronization will require a fifteen-day supply of the drug or less. The health plan must adjust the enrollee cost sharing for a prescription drug with a co-insurance that is dis- pensed for less than the standa rd refill amount for the pur- pose of synchronizing the medications. The health planmust adjust the cost-sharing for an enrollee for a prescrip- tion with a copay that is dispensed for less than the stan-dard refill amount for the purpose of synchronizing by oneof the following methods: discounting the copaymen t rate by fifty percent; discounting the copayment rate based on fifteen-day increments; or any other method approved by the Office of Insur- ance Commissioner. The prescribing provider or pharmacist must do the following: determine that filling or refilling the prescription is in the best interest of the en rollees, taking into account the appropriateness of synchronization for the drug being dispensed; inform the enrollee that the prescription will be filled to less than the standard refill amount to allow syn- chronizing the medication; and deny synchronization if th ere is a threat to patient safety, or suspected fraud or abuse.

By Senate Committee on Health Care (originally spon- sored by Senator Hatfield). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Lyme disease is an inflammatory disease caused by bacteria that ar e transmitted by ticks. Symp- toms usually include fatigue, restless sleep, pain, achingjoints, speech problems, or d ecreased short-term memory. Lyme disease is usually treated over two or three weeks.Commonly prescribed medi cine includes doxycyline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime axetil. Chronic or persistent Lyme disease occurs if a patient who is treated with antibiotic therapy for the disease con-tinues to experience sympto ms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 10-20 percent ofpatients who are treated with an antibiotic therapy willhave persistent or chronic co nditions. Treatment of chron- ic Lyme disease is often focused on reducing pain and dis-comfort. Pain relievers are of ten used to treat joint pain, and non-steroidal anti-inflam matory medications and in- tra-articular steroids are ofte n used to treat joint swelling. Summary: The Medical Quality Assurance Commission (MQAC) must conduct a study of the effects of long-termantibiotic therapy on patients who have been diagnosed with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome.

By Senate Committee on Hea lth Care (originally spon- sored by Senators Parlette, Cl eveland, Rivers, Keiser, An- gel, Chase and Bailey). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Community pharmacies dispense prescrip- tion drugs and other over-the-counter medications underthe direction of a registered pharmacist. In many rural ar-eas, community pharmacies are the only source for pre- scription drugs and discussion of health-related concerns. Hospital pharmacies can usua lly be found within the premises of a hospital. Hosp ital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specializedand investigational medications , than would be feasible in the community setting. Hosp ital pharmacies typically provide medications for the ho spitalized patients only, and are not retail establishments. Some hospitals do have re- tail pharmacies within them, which sell over-the-counter as well as prescription me dications to the public. Summary: Emergency medication is defined as medica- tion commonly prescribed to emergency room patients, in-cluding controlled substances listed in schedules IIthrough V. Hospitals may allow hea lth care practitioners with prescriptive authority to pr escribe, and both health care practitioners and registered nu rses to distribute, prepack- aged emergency medications to patients being dischargedfrom a hospital emergency department if community orhospital pharmacies are not available within 15 miles by road or if the patient has no reasonable ability to reach the community or outpatient pharmacy. In order to prescribeand distribute prepackaged emergency medications, hos-pitals must develop policies and procedures on the follow-ing: development of a list of the types of emergencymedications to be prepackaged and distributed; requiringthat emergency medications be prepackaged by a pharma- cist; development of the specific criteria under whichemergency prepackaged medications may be prescribedand distributed; ensuring th at the practitioner who is pre- scribing the emergency medication is trained on the pre-packaged medication available and when they may bedispensed; recordkeeping re quirements; permitting only a 48-96 hour supply of emergency medication to be dis-pensed; providing that the prepackaged emergency medi-cations are stored in the emergency room; and ensuringpatient counseling on the medicine before distribution. Hospital pharmacies may engage in intra-company sales, such as sales between divisions, subsidiaries and af-filiated or related companies. They may also sell prescrip-tion drugs for emergency purposes such as to alleviate atemporary shortage. Hospitals with pharmacy licenses may include under its license any individual practitioner's office or multi- practitioner clinic that is owned and operated by the hos-pital and listed on the pharmacy application.

By Senators Warnick, Hatfie ld, Parlette, Hargrove, Rank- er, Hewitt, Fraser and Chase; by request of Department of Fish and Wildlife. Senate Committee on Na tural Resources & Parks House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources Background: Fish Guide and Charter Boat Operator Li- censing . A commercial license is required to act as a food fish or game fish guide, i.e. persons paid to transport or ac- company fishers and share their techniques and expertise. A game fish guide license permits services relating to game fish, e.g. steelhead, bass, and catfish. A food fishguide license permits services relating to food fish, e.g. salmon, sturgeon, halibut, bottomfish, and tuna, in mostfreshwater areas. A charter boat license is required to operate a vessel for a fee in areas where others fi sh for food fish or shellfish in the Puget Sound, Grays Ha rbor, Willapa Bay, the Pacif- ic Ocean, Lake Washington, and the Columbia river below the bridge at Longview. Acting as a fish guide or operating a charter boat with- out the proper license is a gross misdemeanor. Catch Record Cards .

By Senators Becker, Keiser and Conway; by request of Health Care Authority and LEOFF Plan 2 RetirementBoard. Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Appropriations Background: The Health Care Authority (HCA) admin- isters health and other insura nce benefits plans for active state employees, retired state and K-12 employees, andsome active local government and K-12 employees. The Public Employees' Benefit Bo ard (PEBB) approves bene- fit plans and premiums for active employees and retiredparticipants. In general, state employees are eligible for benefits if it is anticipated that they will work an average of 80 hours or more for more than six consecutive months, though theeligibility standards differ fo r some types of employees. Faculty members at institutions of higher education who are expected to work half-time over a period of at leastnine months are eligible for benefits for the entire instruc- tional year. Seasonal employees who are expected to workan average of half-time or more, as defined by PEBB, oversix months of the applicable work season are eligible forthe benefits for the season of employment.In 2009 the Legislature enacted a number of changes to PEBB eligibility rules, in cluding clarifying HCA's au- thority to determine eligibility , as opposed to the employ- ing agency, and moving eligib ility criteria from rule to statute. HCA has the authority to determine eligibility, butmay delegate to an employing agency the task of deter- mining individual employees' eligibility for benefits. Any determination as to whether or not an employee is eligible for benefits is subject to periodic review, and appeals ofagency eligibility determinations are reviewed by HCA. The PEBB statutes provide that members may cover their unmarried dependents under the age of 25. An em-ployee that chooses to cover a dependent with develop-mental or mental disabilities who is incapable of self-support may continue coverage at the same premium as for dependents age 20 or under regardless of the age of the de-pendent with disabilities. Th e federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 provides that for any plan year beginning after September 23, 2010, any healthplan that provides coverage for dependent children mustmake such coverage available until attainment of age 26. Summary: An agency participating in HCA-adminis- tered benefit programs is auth orized to make initial deter- minations of benefits eligibility if directed to do so byHCA. The term employer group is defined to mean thoselocal governments and other entities that obtain employee benefits through a contractua l agreement with HCA. A reference to adult family ho me providers is corrected. Eligibility standards fo r seasonal employees are changed from half-time as defined by PEBB, to 80 hoursper month, consistent with the standard used for other part-time eligibility provisions. The definition of academicyear is clarified to apply to either quarter or semester-based academic calendars. The recognition of domestic partnerships through pre- sentation of a certificate of domestic partnership issued bythe Secretary of State is applied to both same-sex and op-posite-sex domestic partnerships. State-registered domes-tic partners of emergency ser vice personnel killed in the line of duty are all made el igible for PEBB participation, and several provisions refere ncing state-registered domes- tic partners are clarified. State-registered domestic partners of emergency ser- vice personnel killed in the line of duty are eligible to par- ticipate in HCA-administered Medicare supplementalinsurance policies. Dependent coverage provisions in PEBB programs are extended to dependent chil dren up to age 26 in compli- ance with the federal Patient Protection and AffordableCare Act of 2010.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015Senate 46 0 House 94 3 Senate 44 5 House 92 5SB 5468 219SB 5468 C 177 L 15 Authorizing the use of nonappropriated funds on certain administrative costs and expen ses of the stay-at-work and self-insured employer programs. By Senators King, Keiser, Kohl-Welles and Conway; by request of Department of Labor & Industries. Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor House Committee on Appropriations Background: Under the state's industrial insurance laws, employers must insure thro ugh the State Fund adminis- tered by the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) or, if qualified, may self-insure. Self-insurance is a programin which the employer provides any and all appropriatebenefits to the injured work er and manages the claims of its employees. Self-insured employers pay an assessmentto fund administrative expenses of L&I. The Stay-at-Work program was created through legis- lation in 2011. Under the St ay-at-Work program, an em- ployer insured through the State Fund may receive a wagesubsidy and other reimbursements under certain circum-stances for employing an inju red worker at light duty or transitional work. The Stay-at-Work program is fundedthrough an assessment on employers, which is earmarkedto pay benefits and administrative expenses of the pro-gram. An appropriation is not needed to pay Stay-at-Workbenefits, however an appropriation is needed for adminis-trative costs. The Workers' Compensation Advisory Committee (WCAC) is a ten-member co mmittee tasked with studying aspects of the workers' compensation system. Workersand employers are represented on WCAC. Summary: An appropriation is not required for adminis- trative expenses to assist employers with developing aStay-at-Work program and othe r related services that re- spond to employer or employ ee needs. L&I must seek the advice of WCAC prio r to using the funds. A Stay-at-Work Advisory Committee (SWAC) is cre- ated, with six members, three representing employers, andthree representing labor. Members serve without compen-sation, but are entitled to travel expenses, which must bepaid by L&I. SWAC must review L&I rk program funds for admin- istrative expenses and make recommendations to WCAC for their consideration. An appropriation is not re quired for administrative costs for one-time projects re quested by self-insured em- ployers that support the sel f-insured employer program. L&I must seek support from self-insured employers priorto accessing the funds.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015ESB 5471 C 263 L 15 Addressing electronic notices and document delivery of insurance products. By Senators Angel, Mu llet, Litzow and Hobbs. Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Background: The Office of the Insurance Commissioner regulates insurance in the state. This includes the over-sight of insurance companie s and insurance holding com- panies. There are various statutory provisions requiringthat notices and other docume nts be provided to policy- holders. Summary: Electronic Delivery of Insurance Notices and Other Documents Allowed . Any notice or any other doc- ument required under applicable law in an insurance trans- action or that must serve as evidence of insurancecoverage may be delivered, st ored, and presented by elec- tronic means so long as it m eets the requirements of the Washington Electronic Authen tication Act. The delivery may be made to a party who is any required recipient of thenotices or documents. The party may include an applicant,an insured, a policyholder, or an annuity contract holder. Delivery by electronic mean s is delivery to (1) an email address at which the pa rty consented to receive the notices or documents or (2) posting on a electronic net-work or site and sending a notice of the posting by email.Delivery by electronic means is equivalent to any other re-quired delivery methods, such as first-class or certified mail. Requirements for Electronic Delivery . A notice or document may be delivered by electronic means if the par-ty consented to electronic de livery and has not withdrawn the consent. In addition, be fore giving the consent, the party must be provided with a statement informing the par-ty of the following: the right to withdraw the consent and any conditions, or consequences imposed by the withdrawal; the types of notices or documents to which the con- sent would apply; the right to have a notice or document in paper form; how to withdraw the co nsent and update the email address; and the hardware and softwa re requirements needed for electronic delivery. The party must consent electronically or confirm con- sent electronically showing that the party can access theelectronic information. Notice must be provided to the party of changes in the hardware or software requir ements and of the right to withdraw the consent. Failin g to provide notice of chang- es in hardware or software requirements and the right to withdraw may be treated as withdrawal of consent. Senate 48 0 House 89 8SSB 5481 220When verification or acknowledgement of receipt is required under law, the notice or document may be elec-tronically delivered only if the delivery method provides for verification or acknowledgement of receipt. An insurer must deliver a notice or document by other than electronic means if the in surer: (1) attempts electron- ic delivery and reasonable believes the notice or documenthas not been received; or (2) becomes aware that the email address is no longer valid. No Producer Liability . A producer may not be held li- able for harm resulting from a party's election for electron- ic delivery or by an insurer' s failure to deliver a notice or document by el ectronic means. Withdrawal and Preexisting Consent . Withdrawal of consent is effective within a re asonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days, after receip t by the insurer. Certain pro- visions apply if a party gave consent before the effectivedate of the act. Website Posting of Standard Policies . Standard prop- erty and casualty insuranc e policies and endorsements without personally identif iable information may be mailed, delivered, or may be posted on the insurer's web- site. If the insurer elects webs ite posting, the policies and endorsements must be: (1) accessible to the insured andthe producer of record while th e policy is in force; (2) ar- chived for six years after ex piration; and (3) available upon request. The posted po licies must allow for printing and saving by the insured and th e producer of record. The insurer must provide informa tion about obtaining the pol- icy with the initial policy and any renewals. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5481 C 292 L 15 Concerning tolling cust omer service reform. By Senate Committee on Tran sportation spon- sored Bailey, Warnick, Rolfes and Hasegawa). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) uses a photo toll system thatreads a vehicle license plate on several toll facilities within the state, including the Stat e Route 520 Floating Bridge, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, th e State Route 167 High Oc- cupancy Toll Lanes Project, and the I-405 High Occupan- cy Toll Lanes, which is schedul ed to open later in 2015. Vehicle owners are automatically assessed a toll for using any of these toll facilitie s. If the vehicle does nothave a Good to Go pass with WSDOT, the registered own- er of the vehicle receives a to ll bill in the mail. If the reg- istered owner fails to pay this toll bill within 80 days, it becomes a toll violation. A civil penalty of $40 may be as-sessed for a toll violation alon g with administrative fees. A registered owner may contest or dispute a civil pen- alty within 15 days of the date of the notice of civil penalty, and the registered owner may request an in-person admin- istrative hearing. During an administrative hearing, WS- DOT has the burden of establis hing that the toll violation occurred; however, it is not a defense to a toll violation andnotice of civil penalty that a person other than the regis-tered owner was driving the vehicle at the time or that theperson did not know to pay a toll. An administrative lawjudge may consider the foll owing as valid mitigating cir- cumstances and reduce or wa ive any civil penalties: hospitalization; divorce decree or legal separation agreement result- ing in a transfer of the vehicle; an active duty member of the military or National Guard covered by the Civil Relief Act or State Ser- vice Member's Relief Act; eviction; homelessness; the death of the alleged violator or of an immediate family member; or the customer did not receive a toll charge bill or notice of civil penalty. Summary: WSDOT toll bill administration and civil pen- alty adjudication processes are modified as follows: WSDOT, by June 30, 2016, must use electronic mail to inform a pre-paid elec tronic toll account holder that there is an unpaid toll for a registered vehiclelisted on the prepaid electr onic toll account ten days prior to the issuance of a notice of civil penalty, if the customer consents to be contacted via electronic mail; WSDOT, by June 30, 2016, must call a pre-paid elec- tronic toll account holder to inform the account holder that there is an unpaid toll for a registeredvehicle listed on the prepaid electronic toll account ten days prior to the issuance of a notice of civil pen- alty, if the customer cons ents to be contacted via phone; greater discretion is provided to WSDOT and the administrative law judges to waive or reduce the pen- alties associated with the nonpayment of a toll; WSDOT must adopt rules to allow an individual who has been issued a notice of civil penalty to presentevidence of mitigating circ umstances as to why a toll bill was not paid in a timely fashion. WSDOT is authorized to dismiss or reduce the civil penalty and associated fees after having been provided verifiable evidence of a specified mitigating circumstance; Senate 48 1 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred)SB 5482 221 WSDOT must provide a l earning experience to toll customers who incur fees and penalties associated with the late payment of to lls for the first time. As part of the educational opportunity, WSDOT maywaive the civil pena lties and administrative fees if the issue that resulted in the to ll not being timely paid has been resolved; WSDOT must, by June 30, 2016, allow a toll cus- tomer to access its website from a mobile platform to manage all of a customer's toll accounts, regardless ofmethod of payment; any new photo toll system acquired by WSDOT must be able to: (1) connect with the Department ofLicensing's vehicle record system so that a prepaid electronic toll account is automatically updated when a toll customer's vehicle reco rd is updated, if the cus- tomer consents to automatic updates; and, (2) display, in the monthly statement, when any toll is assessed for a vehicle listed in a prepaid electronic tollaccount, regardless of whether the method of pay-ment for the toll is pay-by-mail or a prepaid elec- tronic toll account; and the Secretary of Transportation must issue a letter of apology to a toll customer if a toll charge or civil pen- alty assessed to the custom er is waived due to an error made by WSDOT, or its agent, in reading thecustomer's license plate. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5482 C 91 L 15 Addressing the disclosure of global positioning system data by law enforcement officers. By Senators Roach and Liias.Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on State Government Background: The Public Records Act (PRA), enacted in 1972 as part of Initiative 276, requires that all state and lo- cal government agencies make all public records availablefor public inspection and copy ing unless certain statutory exemptions apply. Every state office, department, division, bureau, board, commission, or other st ate agency is subject to the PRA. The PRA's definition of local agency covers every county, city , town, municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, or special purpose district, or any office, de-partment, division, bureau, board, commission, or agencythereof, or other local public agency. Under the PRA, a public record includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of go vernment or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function prepared,owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency, re-gardless of physical fo rm or characteristics. Over 500 specific references in the PRA or other stat- utes remove certai n information from application of the PRA, provide exceptions to the public disclosure and copying of certain information, or designate certain infor- mation as confidential. The provisions requiring public records disclosure must be in terpreted liberally while the exemptions are interpreted na rrowly to effectuate the gen- eral policy favoring disclosure. Personal information in f iles maintained for employ- ees, appointees, or elected officials of any public agency isexempt from public inspectio n and copying to the extent that disclosure would violate the employee's right to priva-cy. A court must find two elem ents to determine that a per- son's right to privacy is invaded: (1) the disclosure wouldbe highly offensive to a reasonable person; and (2) the dis-closure is not of legitimate concern to the public. Numer-ous court decisions have held that certain information in files maintained for public employees is of legitimate pub- lic concern and therefore not exempt from disclosure un-der the PRA. Various types of informatio n related to law enforce- ment and criminal justice are exempt from public disclo-sure, including the following: intelligence and investig ative information essential to effective law enforcement or for the protection of aperson's privacy; information revealing th e identities of witnesses, vic- tims, or complainants of crime, if disclosure wouldendanger their safety; investigative reports prepared pertaining to sex offenses; applications for concealed pistol licenses; information revealing the identity of child victims of sexual assault; the statewide gang database; data from the electronic sal es tracking system for cer- tain pharmaceutical drugs; information from recipients of the statewide unified sex offender notification system; information relating to local security alarm system and vacation crime watch programs; the conviction database of felony firearm offenders; the identities of public employee whistleblowers; and security threat group status information.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by McAuliffe). Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Early Learning & Human Services House Committee on Appropriations Background: The Department of Social and Health Ser- vices (DSHS) or any person may file a petition in court to determine if a child should be a dependent of the state dueto abuse, neglect, abandonment, or because there is no par-ent or custodian capable of caring for the child. If the court determines that the child is dependent, then the court will conduct periodic review s and make determinations about the child's placement and the parents' progress incorrecting parental deficiencies. Under certain circum-stances, the court may order th e filing of a petition for the termination of parental rights. The Parents for Parents Program was created to in- crease the number of family reunifications, where appro-priate, while decreasing the length of time needed toestablish permanence. The program currently operatesunder DSHS and exists in se ven counties: Grays King, Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish, Spokane, and Thurston/Mason. Summary: The Parents for Parents Program provides peer mentoring for families in the dependency court sys- tem increasing parental engagement, and contributes tofamily reunification. Subjec t to amounts appropriated for this purpose, the program is funded through the Office of Public Defense and is centra lly administered through a pass-through to a Washington State nonprofit lead organi-zation. The program's outreach and support to parents is pro- vided by a \"child welfare parent mentor,\" which means aparent who has successfully resolved the issues that led theparent's child into the care of the juvenile dependency court system, resulting in fami ly reunification or another permanency outcome, and who has an interest in workingcollaboratively to improve the lives of children and fami- lies. Components of the Parents for Parents Program, pro-vided by child welfare parent mentors, must include thefollowing: outreach and support to parents at dependency-related hearings, beginning with the Shelter Care Hearing; a class that educates parents about the dependency system they must navigate in order to have their chil- dren returned, empowers them with tools and resources they need to be successful with their case plan, and provides informa tion that helps them under- stand and support the needs of their children; ongoing support to help parents overcome barriers to success in completing their case plan; and structured, curriculum- based peer support groups. Each local program contract with the lead organiza- tion, and each local program must be locally administeredby the county superior court or a nonprofit organizationthat serves as the host organization. A child welfare parentmentor lead provides program coordination and maintainslocal program information. The lead organization pro-vides ongoing training to the host organizations, statewideprogram oversight and coordi nation, and maintains state- wide program information. Subject to amounts appropriat ed for this purpose, a re- port must be conducted on the program. A preliminary re-port on the program must be provided to the Legislature byDecember 1, 2016, and must contain, at a minimum, sta-tistics showing rates of attend ance at court hearings; com- pliance with court-ordered services and visitation; andwhether participating in the pr ogram affected participants' overall understanding of the dependency court process. A subsequent report must be provided to the Legislature byDecember 1, 2019, and must also include statistics demon- strating the effect of the program on reunification rates andlengths of time families were engaged in the dependency court system before achieving permanency. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5488 C 118 L 15 Concerning applied behavior analysis. By Senate Committee on Health Care (originally spon- sored by Senators Keiser, Jayapal, Parlette and Cleve-land). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & WellnessHouse Committee on AppropriationsSenate 48 0 House 91 6 Senate 48 0 House 83 14SSB 5488 223Background: Central Washington University describes applied behavior analysis (ABA) as a systematic approachto the assessment and evaluation of behavior, and the ap-plication of interventions that alter behavior. In 2014 the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) undertook a sunrise review of the behavior analystprofession. The sunrise review found that some of ABAprovider requirements currently exist solely for insurance reimbursement for autism spec trum disorders (ASD) and other conditions. As a result, some providers have ob- tained counseling or other hea lth care credentials to meet requirements of insurers who cover ABA services. Med-icaid reimbursement requires a state license for medically necessary treatment of ASD and other developmental dis-orders. The Health Care Authority (HCA) and Depart-ment of Social and Health Services (DSHS) regulations for ABA services include credentialing and referral re-quirements. The sunrise review further found that the system pro- vides some level of public protection for individuals usingABA services because the providers must meet minimumcredentialing qualifications and are subject to backgroundchecks and regulatory oversigh t. However, private-pay clients of ABA providers do not have the same protectionsand there are waitlists to access ABA services becausesome qualified providers are limited from practicing. DOH provided the following recommendations: behavior analysts and assistant behavior analysts should be licensed in Washington, since the sunrisereview criteria for a new profession have been met; a bill should clarify that the use of behavior tech- niques alone, such as po sitive reinforcement and antecedent stimuli, does not constitute the practice of ABA; that any bill language use the term applied behavior analysis rather than behavior analysis because it is more commonly understood by other health care pro- viders and the public; and that in the absence of an amended definition of the scope of practice, DOH w ould alternatively recom- mend title protection for the ABA profession. Summary: Three behavior analysis professions are estab- lished in Washington: certified behavior technicians, defined as paraprofes- sionals who implement a behavior analysis treatment plan under the close, ongoing supervision of a licensed behavior analyst or a licensed assistantbehavior analyst, but who do not design or supervise implementation of a treatment plan; licensed assistant behavior analysts, defined as indi- viduals who are licensed to engage in the practice of applied behavior analysis (ABA) under the supervi- sion of a licensed behavior analyst; and licensed behavior analysts, defined as an individuals who are licensed to engage in the practice of applied behavior analysis. Scope of Practice. The practice of ABA includes: the design of instructional and environmental modifi- cations based on scientific research, observation, andmeasurement of behavior; empirical identifica tion of functional relations between behavior and environment factors; and utilization of contextual factors, motivation, stimuli, positive reinforcement, and other consequences to assist individuals. The practice of ABA does not include psychological testing, diagnosis of mental or physical disorders, neuro- psychology, psychotherapy, co gnitive therapy, sex thera- py, psychoanalysis, hypnotherapy, or counseling astreatment modalities. No person may engage in the practice of ABA unless they are licensed. Those no t licensed may not represent themselves as a licensed behavior analyst. Licensure . Applicants for licensure must meet certain requirements. For behavior analysts, requ irements include the fol- lowing: a masters or doctorate in behavior analysis or other related field; completion of a minimum of 225 classroom hours at the graduate level; completion of a supervised experience requirement, consisting of a minimum of 1500 hours; and completion of an examination. For assistant behavior analysts, requirements include the following: a bachelor's degree; 135 classroom hours of instruction in behavior analy- sis topics; and a minimum of 1000 hours of supervised experience. For certified behavior techni cians, requirements in- clude: completion of a training program of at least 40 hours. All three of the professions must demonstrate good moral character, not engage in unprofessional conduct, notbe subject to disciplinary action, and be able to practicewith reasonable skill. Licenses are valid for two years. A temporary license may be granted to a person who does not reside in Washington if they are licensed to prac-tice ABA in another state or province of Canada. A tem-porary license holder ma y only practice for a limited period of time, as defined by the Secretary of DOH. A per-son holding a license in another state or province of Can-ada may receive a Washington license if the other state orESSB 5498 224province have substantially equivalent licensing stan- dards. This license does not prohibit or restrict the following: a person employed by the United States government from acting solely under the direction or control of the agency by which they are employed; an employee of a school acting in the performance of their regular duties, so lo ng as the employee does not offer behavior analytic services; the practice of ABA by a college or university student participating in a course of study, who is supervisedby faculty and clearly indicates their trainee status; implementation of a behavior analysis treatment plan by a family member or legal guardian; or the practice of ABA with animals. Advisory Committee . A Washington State ABA advi- sory committee is established consisting of five members: three who are licensed behavior analysts; one who is a licensed assistant behavior analyst; and one member of the public. It is recommended that one of the advisory committee members be a licensed behavior analyst and have an addi- tional mental health license, such as a psychiatrist. The Secretary of DOH must consult the committee in determining the qualifications for licensure or certifica- tion.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2015 July 24, 2015 (Sections 4 and 16) ESSB 5498 C 214 L 15 Revising the uniform inters tate family support act. By Senate Committee on Law & Justice (originally spon- sored by Senators Pedersen and O'Ban; by request of De-partment of Social and Health Services and Uniform LawCommission). Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: Currently the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) administers the joint state andfederal child support enfo rcement (CSE) program with state funds and matching federal funds. Federal laws re-quire all states to apply uniform child support jurisdic-tional standards in a national model law, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), to qualify for fed- eral matching funds. Many child support enforcement cases involve parents and children living in differentstates. UIFSA's standards prevent interstate legal conflictsand make child support enforcement administratively effi- cient and less expensive for the DSHS CSE program. In addition to enforcing ch ild support obligations, the UIFSA law standardizes the jurisdiction and substantive requirements for establishing, enforcing, or modifyingchild support court orders so that only one state at a time has jurisdiction. The law pr events competing and conflict- ing court orders in multiple states. Under UIFSA the statecourts that do not have juri sdiction over the child support case recognize and refrain from taking action on the case.The law extends the requiremen t that states must give full faith and credit to a lawful court order from another state. The uniform law commission updates UIFSA period- ically. The most recent updates were approved in 2008.Washington uses the 2001 version of UIFSA. The 2008UIFSA amendments address a nationally recognized prob-lem. Parents living outside the U.S. may have past and current child support obligatio ns that they do not pay. For states that may mean that the parent abroad avoids the support obligation and the family here needs public as- sistance to meet basic living needs. In such situations,state and federally funded programs step in and provide fi-nancial support and medical coverage. Under federal andstate laws, the DSHS CSE program pursues the parent fordelinquent support and reimburses the state and federalpublic assistance costs. For families that do not qu alify for public assistance but still are owed child support, it is costly and often not feasible to try to collect un paid support when the paying parent lives abroad. Intern ational child support enforce- ment is becoming a more co mmon issue for the U.S. and for other countries when a pare nt living abroad doesn't pay the child support owed. The U.S. has made country-to-country agreements for colle cting unpaid child support with some countries already - Australia, Canada, CzechRepublic, El Salvador, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Israel,Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In 2007 the U.S. participat ed in a treaty convention, the Hague Convention on Reco very of International Child Support (Convention). The Convention follows the 2001UIFSA law's structure. In effect the Convention adoptsthe UIFSA interstate jurisd iction concepts and applies them, by treaty, across inte rnational boundaries for the countries that sign onto the Convention. The U.S. signedon to the Convention, the U.S. Senate gave its advise and consent, and the President is expected to sign the treaty. In September 2014, Congress passed a federal law re- quiring all states to update their UIFSA laws to incorpo- rate the 2008 amendments so that the U.S. can apply the Convention treaty across all 50 states -.P.L. 113-183, the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act. This law gives a limited amount of time for state leg-islatures to act by adopting the 2008 UIFSA amendments. The law authorizes the federa l Office of Child Support En- forcement to withhold the federal match for the DSHS CSE program and the federal block grant money for theSenate 49 0 House 92 5SSB 5501 225federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program if Washington's law is not updated by June 30, 2015. Summary: Washington courts, ad ministrative agencies, or other Washington tribunals may not enforce any orderissued under foreign law or by a foreign legal system that is manifestly incompatible with public policy. The child support laws incorporate the 2008 UIFSA amendments with an effective date of July 1, 2015. The law provides guidelines an d processes for child support orders when the child and one parent live in the U.S., butthe parent ordered to pay child support lives in a countrythat agrees to the Commission treaty (participating coun- try). The requirements apply to orders for establishingchild support, modifying ch ild support, and enforcing child support. Washington's child custody and visitation laws, and parenting plans for custody and visitation do not change.Parentage determinations are on ly made if necessary to es- tablish a support obligation. The guidelines and processes for U.S. state-to-state or intrastate child support proceed-ings do not change. For child support owed to a participating country or a family from the participati ng country, the DSHS CSE pro- gram must help locate the parent who is here and owes support. The participating co untries must provide similar help to the family, or the DSHS CSE program when they try to locate the non-paying parent for the purpose of col-lecting child support that is owed. The Washington courts must enforce a foreign child support court order from a par ticipating country when it is properly registered in Washingt on. Courts in participating countries must reciprocate by enforcing U.S. child support orders when the paying parent lives in the participating country. A Washington court may refuse to register a for- eign court order for the following reasons: recognition and enforcement of the order is mani- festly incompatible with pu blic policy, including the failure of the issuing foreig n tribunal to observe mini- mum standards of due pro cess, which include notice and an opportunity to be heard; the issuing foreign tribun al lacked personal jurisdic- tion; the foreign order is no t enforceable in the issuing country; the foreign order was obta ined by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure; a record transmitted from the foreign CSE agency lacks authenticity or integrity; a proceeding between the same parties and with the same purpose is pending be fore a Washington court and that proceeding was the first to be filed; the foreign order is incompatible with a more recent support order involving the same parties and havingthe same purpose if the more recent support order is entitled to recognition and enforcement under Wash- ington law; the paying parent has already paid, i.e. the alleged arrears have been paid in whole or in part; the respondent neither appeared nor was represented in the proceeding in the issu ing foreign country, if the law of that country (1) pr ovides for prior notice of proceedings, and the respondent did not have proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to beheard; or (2) does not provide for prior notice of the proceedings. Washington presumes any fo reign order is manifestly incompatible with public po licy when enforcement of the order would result in a violation of any right guaranteed bythe state or federal constitutions . If the federal support en- forcement office finds this section protecting constitution- al rights violates federal law that is a condition to receiving federal matching funds, DSHS must submit a request to waive any federal law conflic t to the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). If HHS denies the waiver, then the section protec ting constitutional rights is inoperable to the extent of the federal law conflict. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 1, 2015 SSB 5501 PARTIAL VETO C 235 L 15 Preventing animal cruelty. By Senate Committee on Law & Justice (originally spon- sored by Senators Fain, Frockt, Kohl-Welles and Chase). Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: Animal Cruelty . Animal cruelty in the first degree is committed when a pe rson: (1) intentionally in- flicts substantial pain on, caus es physical injury to, or kills an animal by a means that ca uses undue suffering; (2) with criminal negligence, starves, dehydrates, or suffocates ananimal, and the animal suffers unnecessary or unjustifiable physical pain or death; or (3) knowingly engages in certainconduct involving a sexual act or sexual contact with ananimal. Animal cruelty in the first degree is a class C fel-ony. Other Crimes Involving Animals . In addition to pro- hibiting animal cruelty, the state's laws regarding the pre-vention of cruelty to animal s prohibits certain specific practices and activities invo lving animals. Among the law's prohibitions are transpor ting or confining animals inSenate 48 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 49 0 (Senate concurred)ESB 5504 226an unsafe manner, engaging an imals in exhibition fighting with other animals, and killin g or stealing animals belong- ing to another person. Unsafe Confinement . Transporting or confining a do- mestic animal in an unsafe manner is a misdemeanor. If a domestic animal is confined without necessary food and water for more than 36 consec utive hours, any person may enter the area in which the an imal is confined and provide food and water. The person providing care to the animal is not subject to liability for th e entry, and is entitled to re- imbursement for the food and wa ter. Investigating officers may, if it is extremely diffic ult to supply food and water, remove the animal and take it into protective custody. Animal Fighting . It is unlawful to possess, sell, or train a dog or male chicken for the purpose of an animalfighting exhibition. It is also unlawful to organize, pro-mote, watch, or wager bets on fights between dogs or male chickens. This offense is punishable as a class C felony. Killing or Harming Livestock . It is unlawful for a per- son to, with malice, kill or cause substantial bodily harm to livestock belonging to another person. A violation con-stitutes a class C felony. Killing or Stealing a Pet Animal . Any person who kills or obscures the identity of a pet animal, or who steals a pet animal worth $250 or l ess, is subject to a mandatory fine of $500 per animal. This conduct also constitutes agross misdemeanor. Enforcement of Animal Cruelty Laws . Law enforce- ment agencies and local animal care and control agenciesmay enforce the animal cruelty law. A law enforcementofficer or animal control offi cer may, with a warrant, re- move an animal to a suitable place for care if the officerhas probable cause to believe the owner has violated theanimal cruelty laws and there is no responsible personavailable who can assume the animal's care. The officermay remove an animal withou t a warrant if the animal is in an immediate life-threatening situation. Summary: It is a class 2 civil infraction to leave or con- fine any animal unattended in a motor vehicle or enclosedspace if the animal could be harmed or killed by exposure to excessive heat, cold, lack of ventilation, or lack of nec- essary water. An animal control officer or law enforce-ment officer is authorized to enter the motor vehicle orenclosed area to remove the animal from such exposure.The officer or employing agency is not liable for any prop-erty damage related to the an imal removal. The maximum penalty for a class 2 civil infr action is $125, plus statutory assessments. The civil infraction does not preclude crim-inal prosecution for animal cruelty. The crime of animal fighting includes causing a minor to commit the same crime. For the crime of animal fight- ing, the definition of an animal is no longer limited to just dogs or male chickens. The value limit on a pet animal, the theft of which is subject to a mandatory $500 fine, is raised from $250 to$750, which is the monetary th reshold for theft in the thirddegree. A person in violation of the statute may also be prosecuted for animal cruelty. Animal cruelty in the fi rst degree is committed when a person intentionally inflic ts substantial pain, causes physical injury, or kills an animal. The cruelty must becommitted by a means causing undue suffering or with ex- treme indifference to life. Animal cruelty also includes causing a minor to inflict su bstantial pain, cause physical injury, or kill an animal.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 Partial Veto Summary: The Governor vetoed language regarding expanded exceptions from the animal cruelty law. The vetoed language would expand the existing ex- ception for accepted husbandry practices for commercialfarming to also include non-commercial farming. VETO MESSAGE ON SSB 5501 May 11, 2015 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 7, Substitute Senate Bi ll No. 5501 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to the prevention of animal cruelty.\" Section 7, by expanding the exceptions for \"accepted husbandry practices\" used in commercial farming to noncommercial farm- ing, could potentially leave live stock and other animals subject to neglect or cruelty. Contrary to th e purpose of this bill, animal con- trol officers and prosecutors will have more difficulty enforcing animal cruelty laws in cases in volving backyard farming and hob- by farms. For these reasons I have vetoed Section 7 of Substitute Senate Bill No. 5501. With the exception of Section 7, Substitute Senate Bill No. 5501 is approved.

By Senators Hewitt and Hasegawa.Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor House Committee on Commerce & Gaming Background: Minors are prohibited from consuming or possessing alcohol and restricted from working or enteringareas where alcohol is served. There are several employ-ment exceptions to these rest rictions. For example, mi-Senate 49 0 House 59 38 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred) ESB 5510 227nors age 18 to 21 may be on an otherwise off-limit location when they are employed as: (1) professional musicians; (2) janitorial staff; (3) police officers and firefighters who are on the premises in the line of duty; and (4) licensedservers handling and selling alcohol in restaurants, snackbars, and private clubs, but not in bars, cocktail lounges, orother areas established as off-limits by the Liquor ControlBoard. These exceptions do not specifically require su-pervision by adults age 21 or older. In other circumstances, mi nors must be supervised when they work with alcohol. Minors age 18 to 21 who are employees of grocery stores or wine and beer specialtyshops may sell and handle beer or wine, but an adult aged21 or older must supervise all sales of alcohol on the prem- ises. Minors age 18 to 21 who are employees of nonretail licensees - wholesalers, manufacturers, breweries, andwineries - may stock, merchandise, and handle beer andwine for their employer but on ly on and around the nonre- tail premises, and only when supervised by an adult age 21 or older. Summary: Employees of a nonretail liquor licensee, age 18 to 21, are generally pr ohibited from handling, trans- porting, or possessing liquor. An exception is provided for the minors to stock, merchandise, or handle any liquorwhile: (1) working at the nonr etail business if they are su- pervised by an adult age 21 or older; or (2) working at aretail licensee's premises, except between the hours of11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., when an adult, employed by theretail licensee, is present at the premises while the work isbeing performed. Acts or omissions in viola tion of the state liquor laws by a nonretail liquor licensee's employee, occurring on thepremises of the retail licensee, is the responsibility of the nonretail employer. Retail li censee employers are still re- sponsible for any violations by their own employees.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESB 5510 C 178 L 15 Simplifying and adding certainty to the calculation of workers' compensation bene fits by creating a working group to develop recommendations. By Senators Braun, Baumgartner, Rivers and Angel.Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor House Committee on Labor Background: Under the state's industrial insurance laws, workers who, in the course of employment, are injured ordisabled from an occupationa l disease are entitled to ben- efits. Depending on the di sability, workers are entitled tomedical, temporary time-loss , and vocational rehabilita- tion benefits, as well as bene fits for permanent disabilities. Time-loss benefits are wage replacement benefits for workers who cannot work beca use of their injury. The amount of time-loss benefits is a percentage of the work- er's pre-injury wages, and ad justs depending on the marital status of the worker and the number of the worker's chil-dren. The monthly wages the worker received from all em- ployment at the time of injury are used to calculate time-loss benefits. The statutor y definition of wages includes medical, dental, and vision benefits; the reasonable valueof room and board, housing, heating fuel, or similar con-siderations received from the employer as part of theworker's income; bonuses rece ived in the last 12 months from the employer of injury; a nd tips reported to the em- ployer for federal income ta x purposes. The monthly wage calculation for seasonal and part-time workers is de-termined using the total wag es earned, including overtime, from all employment in a consecutive 12-month periodpreceding the injury, which fairly represents the employ-ment pattern. Workers who suffer certain types of injuries and work- ers whose injuries preclude any further gainful employ- ment are entitled to permanen t total disability pensions. Pension benefits are paid monthly, and are based on theamount of time-loss compensa tion to which the worker is entitled. Summary: The Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) must convene a benefit accuracy working group, byAugust 1, 2015, to focus on improving the accuracy, sim- plicity, fairness, and consis tency of calculating and pro- viding wage replacement benefits. Workgroup membersare appointed by the director of L&I, and are composed of two members representing labor, two members represent-ing employers, and at least two members representingL&I. The working group must report to the relevant com-mittees of the Legislature by February 1, 2016, and Sep- tember 1, 2016.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015Senate 46 3 House 95 2 Senate 41 8 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 46 1 (Senate concurred)SSB 5518 228SSB 5518 C 92 L 15 Creating procedures to address campus sexual violence. By Senate Committee on High er Education (originally sponsored by Senators Kohl-Welles, Litzow, Frockt,Darneille, McAuliffe, Liias, Dammeier, Fain, Keiser,Hasegawa and Habib). Committee on Higher Education House Committee on Higher EducationHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: State and Federal Laws Related to Campus Sexual Violence . The handling of sexual assaults on col- lege and university campuses is governed by proceduralguidelines under Title IX of the education amendments of1972. The Jeanne Clery Disc losure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Sta tistics Act (Clery Act) and the Violence Against Women Act (V AWA) also require in-stitutions to develop reporting protocols and disciplinaryprocedures for handling sexual violence incidents. Institutions of higher edu cation must develop their own student conduct, disciplinary, and reporting require-ments. Washington State does not have non-criminal statuto- ry requirements for the ha ndling of student-on-student sexual assaults. Public institu tions of higher education each have student codes of conduct codified in the Wash-ington Administrative Code. Title IX . Every college and university that accepts federal funds must comp ly with Title IX. Title IX has been interprete d by the United States Su- preme Court and the United States Department of Educa-tion to require educationa l institutions to maintain policies, practices, and progra ms that do not discriminate against anyone based on sex. A school violates a student's rights under Title IX re- garding student-on-student se xual violence when: (1) the alleged conduct is serious enough to limit or deny a stu-dent's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's educational program; and (2) the school, upon notice, fails to take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to end the sexual violence, prevent its recurrence, and as ap-propriate, remedy its effects. The Department of Educa tion requires institutions to investigate incidence of sexual violence and have griev-ance procedures in place for resolving student and em-ployee complaints of sexual discrimination. Colleges and universities must develop sexual violence procedures thatat the least include the following: notice to students and employees of grievance proce- dures, including where complaints may be filed; application of grievanc e procedures to complaints filed by students or on their behalf; provisions for reliable an d impartial investigation of complaints, including the opportunity for both thecomplainant and alleged pe rpetrator to present wit- nesses and evidence; designated and reasonably prompt time frames for the major stages of the complaint process; notice to the complainan t and alleged perpetrator of the outcome of the complaint; and, assurance that the schoo l will take steps to prevent recurrence of any sexual violence and remedy dis- criminatory effects on the complainant and others. Institutions can lose federa l funds for violating the re- quirements of Title IX. Clery Act . The Clery Act requires institutions of high- er education to record and disclose information about campus crimes to the U.S. De partment of Education. An institution may be fined up to $35,000 per violation or maylose financial aid, if it violat es the Clery Act reporting re- quirements. Violence Against Women Act . The V AWA reauthori- zation in 2013 added new sexual violence offenses toClery reporting requirements including sexual offenses, domestic violence, dating viol ence, and stalking. The re- authorization requires institutio ns to develop a statement of policy describing programs to prevent sexual violenceand education programs to promote awareness. The reau-thorization also requires in stitutions to develop a state- ment of policy regarding procedures for responding to asexual violence complaint. Summary: Various provisions regarding campus sexual violence are included. Disciplinary Process . All institutions of higher educa- tion must refrain from establishi ng a different disciplinary process on the same campus for a matter of sexual vio-lence. The disciplinary process cannot change based onthe status of the student, in cluding membership on an ath- letic team, fraternity or sorority, academic year, or any oth-er characteristic. Confidentiality and Reporting Protocols . Institutions of higher education must ma ke information available on an annual basis to all current and prospective students, em-ployees, and parents of students , regarding the institution's compliance with campus sexua l violence confidentiality and reporting requirements. Resources must also be made available to all campus sexual assault survivors on a con-fidential basis, regardless of whether the survivor chooses to proceed with a formal report. Uniform Campus Climate Survey . The four-year in- stitutions must conduct a campus climate assessment to gauge the prevalence of sexu al assault on their campuses. The State Board for Community and Technical Colleges(SBCTC) must conduct a uniform campus climate assess-ment survey of community an d technical colleges. The surveys should assess: 1. student and employee knowledge of: a. their institution's Title IX coordinator's role;SB 5532 229b. campus policies and pro cedures addressing sexual assault and violence; c. options for reporting sexu al violence as a survivor or witness; d. the availability of resources on and off campus, such as counseling, health, and academic assis- tance; 5. student and employee bystander attitudes and behav- ior; 6. whether survivors reported to the institution or law enforcement and why they did or did not report; or 7. student and employee attitudes and awareness of campus sexual violence, including any recommenda- tions for better addressing and preventing sexual vio- lence. Institutions and the SBCTC mu st report their findings to the Governor and the hi gher education committees of the Legislature by December 31, 2016. The report mustinclude a plan or proposal to undertake a statewide publicawareness campaign on campus sexual violence. An as- sessment conducted to comply with new federal require- ments pertaining to campus climat e assessments fulfills this requirement. Memoranda of Understanding . The SBCTC, Council of Presidents, and independent colleges of Washingtonmust submit reports to the Go vernor and the Legislature's higher education committees by July 1, 2016, on steps tak- en by their institutions to enter into memoranda of under- standing with local law enfo rcement that set forth each party's roles and responsibiliti es related to the prevention and response to sexual assault. Distribution of Policies . Institutions must develop and distribute sexual violence po licies and procedures that in- clude, but are not limited to , information about their Title IX compliance officer or other individual responsible forhandling sexual violence viola tions. Institutions must an- nually distribute these policies and procedures.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5532 C 8 L 15 Modifying certain Washington gift of life award provi- sions.

Senate Committee on Higher Education House Committee on Higher EducationHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: Certified Public Accountants. Certified public accountants (CPAs) are those members of the offi-cially accredited professional body of accountants, certi- fied to practice accounting. The Washington Board ofAccountancy (Board) governs the practice of public ac-countants in the state. In Wa shington, to be licensed as a CPA, an individual must: 1. be of good moral character; 2. meet educational standards established by rule; 3. pass an exam; 4. gain one year of practical experience; a. through the use of accounting, issuing reports on financial statements, management advisory, fi- nancial advisory, tax, or consulting skills;Senate 48 0 House 85 12Senate 48 0 House 96 1SSB 5538 230b. while employed in government, industry, aca- demia or public practice; or c. meeting the competency requirements in a man- ner as determined by the Board; and 4. pay a fee. Washington Board of Accountancy . The Board con- sists of nine members appointed by the Governor includ-ing six who have been licensed CPAs in Washington forthe preceding ten years. Three members are qualified pub-lic members. Members are appointed for terms of threeyears. The Board collects licensure fees from CPAs prac-ticing in Washington State. Cu rrently, the fees that are col- lected can only be used for the costs of administeringlicenses, Board administration, keeping records, and other actions by the Board. Washington CPA Foundation . The Washington CPA Foundation (Foundation) is part of the Washington Soci-ety of Certified Public Accountants, which is an organiza-tion dedicated to serving professional needs of CPAs,educating consumers about CPAs and their services, andencouraging students to study accounting and enter theprofession. The Foundation uses endowment funds to pro-vide scholarships to accoun ting students attending Wash- ington universities. Summary: A certified public accounting scholarship (Scholarship) is established. Scholarships are awarded to eligible students based on merit. The Foundation is also encouraged to consider the level of financial need demo nstrated by applicants who otherwise meet merit-based sc holarship criteria. Scholar- ships are awarded every year. Scholarship awards are forone academic year, and may be reapplied for annually. Ascholarship for any program participant must not exceedthe cost of tuition and fees. Eligible students are those st udents enrolled at an ac- credited Washington-based college or university with adeclared major in accounting, entering their junior year or higher. This includes comm unity college transfer stu- dents, residents of Washington pursuing an online degreein accounting, and students purs uing a masters in tax or ac- counting, or a Ph.D. in accounting. The Board must contract with the Foundation to de- velop and administer the program. The Foundation must establish a separate scholarship award account to receive state funds and disburse scholar-ship awards. The Foundation mu st also annually report to the Board and the Washington Student AchievementCouncil (WSAC) an accounting of receipts and disburse-ments, a list of program pa rticipants, and other outcome measures necessary to assess the impact of the program. The Board, institutions of higher education, WSAC, and other organizations must promote and publicize theprogram. A certified public accounting transfer account is also created in the custody of the State Treasurer to be used forscholarships and the administration of the program. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5538 C 264 L 15 Concerning procedures and re quirements relating to the death of a tenant. By Senate Committee on Financial Institutions & Insur- ance (originally sponsored by Senators Angel and Shel-don). Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance House Committee on Judiciary Background: The Residential Landlord Tenant Act (RL- TA) governs the relationship between the renter of resi-dential property (the tenant) and the property owner or theproperty owner's agent (the landlord). The RLTA outlinesthe specific duties of the land lord and the tenant and estab- lishes procedures for each part y to enforce their rights. The RLTA does not explicitly address what proce- dures a landlord should follow in the case of the tenant's death. In general it is beli eved that under a month-to- month tenancy, notice of the te nant's death acts as a 30-day notice and signals the end of the lease. Under a longerterm lease, the deceased tenant's estate would continue tobe legally responsible for re ntal payments until the lease expires. The law is also silent on what the landlo rd should do with respect to a tenant's property. The RLTA provides aprocedure for landlords to follow in handling a tenant's personal property in the event that the tenant abandons thetenancy. Upon determinatio n that the tenancy has been abandoned, and an accompanying default in the payment of rent, the landlord may take immediate possession of the tenant's personal property and store the property in a rea-sonably secure place. The la ndlord must make reasonable efforts to notify the tenant of the location where the prop- erty is stored, and of any impending sale. If the tenantdoes not come forward to claim the property within 45days of notice, the landlord may sell or dispose of theproperty. The landlord may apply the proceeds againstmonies due to the landlord by the tenant. The landlord must hold any excess income for the benefit of the tenant for one year, after which the balance is property of thelandlord. The Uniform Residential La ndlord and Tenant Act was codified by the Unifor m Law Commission (ULC) in 1972 and subsequently adopted in 21 states, includingWashington. In 2012 the ULC began meeting to addressnew developments affecting residential landlord and tenant law and to codify the best current practices in a re-Senate 45 4 House 98 0 (House amended)Senate 46 1 (Senate concurred)ESSB 5550 231vised act. The ULC anticipat es the act will be ready for approval mid-July of this year and the final version will beavailable for distribution in the fall. Summary: The RLTA provides procedures on how a landlord must dispose of a tena nt's property in the event of a tenant's death. A tenant representative is de fined according to the hi- erarchy of legal authority to act for the estate: a personal representative, if known to the landlord; a successor who has filed an affidavit in a small estate proceeding; a designated person; or a person who provides reasonable evidence that he or she is a successor of the deceased tenant. Upon written request by a la ndlord or on the tenant's own initiative, a tenant may designate a person to act forthe tenant on the tenant's deat h when the tenant is the sole occupant of the property. A designation must be in writingand include the following: contact information of a designated person in the event of the tenant's death; a signed statement allowing the designated person, upon the tenant's death, to access the tenant's unit and property, and to accept the tenant's security depositfor the benefit of the estate; and a conspicuous statement that the designation remains in effect until it is revoked in writing or replaced witha new designation. If a tenant dies and is the on ly occupant of the premis- es, the landlord must send a notice to the personal repre-sentative, designated person, emergency contact, anyknown person reasonably believed to be a successor, andthe deceased tenant at the ad dress of the premises. Con- tents of the notice are prescribed. A tenant representativehas 15 days from the date of the notice or the date through which rent is paid to respond or remove the property. If the property is not remo ved within the 15-day time period, the landlord may put the property in storage and send a second notice to all known contacts and representa-tives with notice that the prop erty will be sold or disposed of in 45 days. During the 15-day period, the tenant representative may make arrang ements to pay rent for an additional 60 days to arrange for orderly removal of the property. If atenant representative makes arrangements to extend thelease, the landlord must send a notice to all known con-tacts and representatives with the name of the representa-tive who made the arrangements to extend the lease, the date through which rent is pa id, and a statement that any property not removed from th e premises may be sold or disposed of at the end of the period through which rent ispaid. If the landlord is contacted during any of the notice pe- riods, the landlord may turn over possession of the proper-ty to any tenant representative if the representative pays the storage costs for the proper ty, gives the landlord a writ- ten inventory of the property removed, and signs an ac-knowledgment that he or sh e has been given possession of the property, but not ownership. The landlord has no obli-gation to identify all heirs or successors in order to releasethe property to a tenant represe ntative. Within 14 days of removal of the property, the landlord must refund any un-earned rent or deposits to the tenant representative. If the landlord is not contact ed in the 45-day period, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property. If thelandlord estimates the value of the property is in excess of $1,000, the landlord must arrange to sell the property in a commercially reasonable manner. Any remaining proper-ty must be disposed of in a reasonable manner. Commer- cially reasonable manner and reasonable manner aredefined. The landlord, employee of the landlord, or family members may not acquire proper ty sold or disposed of. Personal papers and photographs may not be disposed offor 90 days following the da te of sale or disposition. Upon learning of the death of a tenant, the landlord may enter the dwelling and dispose of any perishableitems and turn over any animals to a tenant representativeor animal control. A landlord who violates this section is liable for actual damages; compliance will reli eve the landlord from liabil- ity. The process for abandonment does not apply to thedisposition of property for a deceased tenant.

By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Senators Habib and Fain). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services Background: State law currently provides for the regula- tion of certain private transportation providers, such as op-erators of aeroporters, limousines, for-hire vehicles,taxicabs, and charter and excursion buses. These regula-tions include various insurance requirements. However,current law does not specifica lly provide for the regulation of what are commonly know as ridesharing companies, i.e.companies that use a digital network or software applica- tion to connect passengers to drivers for the purpose ofSenate 49 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred)SB 5556 232providing a prearranged ride, often by use of the driver's personal vehicle. For-hire vehicle operators are currently required under state law to obtain a surety bond or liability insurance pol- icy with the following minimum coverage: $100,000 perperson, accident, and $25,000 for propertydamage. Summary: Commercial transportatio n services providers are defined as businesses that use a digital network or soft-ware application to connect passengers to drivers for the purpose of providing a prearranged ride. However, a com-mercial transportatio n services provider is not a taxicab company, charter or excursio n bus, aeroporter, special needs transportation provider, or limousine. A commer- cial transportation services provider driver is an individualwho uses a personal vehicle to provide services for passen- gers matched through a commercial transportation ser-vices provider's digital netw ork or software application. Commercial transportation services are defined as alltimes the driver is logged in to a commercial transportation services provider's digital network or software applica-tion, or until the passenger leaves the personal vehicle, whichever is later. Commercial transportation services providers, drivers if approved by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner, or a combination of a provider and a driver, must obtain aprimary automobile insurance policy covering every per-sonal vehicle used to provide commercial transportationservices, described as follows: before a driver accepts a requested ride: $50,000 damage; and after a driver accepts a requested ride: a combined single limit liability cove rage of $1,000,000; and underinsured motorist coverage of $1,000,000. Commercial transportation services insurance policies must offer personal injury protection coverage, and under-insured motorist coverage, in line with existing motor ve- hicle insurance law that allows for the insured to reject the coverage options. After July 1, 2016, an insurance company may not deny a claim arising exclusively out of the personal use ofthe private vehicle solely on the basis that the insured, at other times, used the vehicle to provide commercial trans- portation services. The commercial transpor tation services insurance coverage requirements are alternatively satisfied by hav-ing for-hire vehicle or limousine insurance coverage appli-cable to the vehicle being used for commercialtransportation services. Commercial transportation services provider drivers, for-hire vehicle operators, limousine chauffeurs, and taxi-cab operators are exempt fro m workers' compensation re- quirements.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5556 C 34 L 15 Concerning irrigation district administration.

In the al- ternative, the county treasu rer may combine foreclosure of real property tax liens with those of the district's. Noticeand summons to defend or pay must be given to all partiesin interest who are disc losed by the title search. Creation of a board of joint control is authorized in some circumstances for two or more districts to combinein projects perceived by all pa rticipating districts to be of joint benefit. The powers and duties of the districts partic- ipating in a joint board contin ue unaffected within their several districts. Summary: Holders of recorded easements need not be served with notice and summon s and any treasurer's deed subsequently issued is su bject to these easements. Statutes are repealed that require joint boards to pre- pare budgets for the joint boards and provide notice andhearing of those budgets.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESSB 5557 C 237 L 15 Addressing services provided by pharmacists. By Senate Committee on Health Care (originally spon- sored by Senators andHoneyford). Senate Committee on Health Care House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: The 1995 Legislature created the require- ment for all health plans to permit every category of healthSenate 30 18 House 86 12 (House amended)Senate 43 5 (Senate concurred) Senate 48 0 House 97 0E2SSB 5564 233care provider to provide health services included in the Basic Health Plan services. The health care services mustbe within the scope of prac tice for the provider and the providers must agree to health plan standards on such ar-eas as the provision of care, utilization review, cost con- tainment, management and administrative procedures, andthe provision of cost-effectiv e and clinically efficacious care. In general, pharmacists have not been included in health plan networks while health plans have contractedwith pharmacies or pharmacy benefit managers. A 2013Attorney General Opinion conf irmed that pharmacists are health care providers and must be compensated for ser-vices included in the Basic H ealth Plan and within their scope of practice if the phar macist agrees to the stated standards of the health plan. Pharmacists are regulated un- der RCW Chapter 18.64 and are permitted to providehealth care services such as drug therapy management andother services beyond the dispensing of drugs or devices. The Basic Health Plan was a state-sponsored health program that was discontinue d with the Medicaid expan- sion. The covered services included physician services,inpatient and outpatient ho spital services, prescription drugs and medications, chemical dependency services,mental health services, organ transplant services, all ser-vices necessary for prenatal, postnatal, and well-childcare, and wellness, smoking cessation, and chronic diseasemanagement. The federal Affordable Care Act established require- ments for individual and small group health plans to coveressential health benefits, whic h reflect ten general catego- ries tient hospitalization; matern ity and newborn care; mental health and substance abuse disorder services, includingbehavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; preventive and wellness services and chronicdisease management; and pediatric services including oraland vision care. Summary: Health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2017, must not de ny any health care service performed by a pharmacist if th e service is within the phar- macist scope of practice, the plan would have providedbenefits if the service had been performed by a physician, advanced registered nurse pr actitioner, or physician assis- tant, and the pharmacist is in cluded in the plan's network of participating providers. Health plans must includ e an adequate number of pharmacists in the network of participating providers. Theparticipation of pharmacies in the plan network's drugbenefit does not satisfy the re quirement that plans include pharmacists in their networks. For the 2016 benefit year only, health plans that dele- gate credentialing agreements to contracted health care fa- cilities must accept credentialing for pharmacistsemployed or contracted by th ose facilities. Health plansmust reimburse facilities fo r covered services performed by network pharmacists within their scope of practice pernegotiations with the facility. Health plans must permit ever y category of health pro- vider to provide services incl uded in the ten categories of care required in the essential health benefits benchmark plan, if the provider agrees to the health plan standards and if the plan covers such serv ices or care in the essential health benefits benchmark plan. The reference to the es-sential health benefits does not create a mandate to covera service that is otherwis e not a covered benefit. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 E2SSB 5564 PARTIAL VETO C 265 L 15 Concerning the sealing of ju venile records and fines im- posed in juvenile cases. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored McAuliffe). Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Early Le arning & Human Services House Committee on General Government & Information Technology Background: Sealing Juvenile Records . Since 1977, ju- venile offender records have been public unless sealed.Records of non-offender juvenile cases, such as dependen-cy or adoption records, are not open to public inspection. There are two methods by which individuals may seal their juvenile records: an individual may make a motion to seal the official juvenile court record, the social file, and records ofthe court and any other agency in the case; or an individual may have their record sealed during regularly held sealing hearings.Once a juvenile record is sealed, the proceedings in the case must be treated as if they never occurred. Anysubsequent criminal adjudication or adult felony chargeunseals the case. Regular Sealing Hearings . At the disposition hearing of a juvenile offender, courts must schedule an administra- tive sealing hearing after that offender turns age 18 and is anticipated to have complete d any probation and confine- ment. Courts must seal the in dividual's juvenile court re- cord if none of the offenses for which the court is enteringSenate 48 0 House 93 4 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred)E2SSB 5564 234disposition are a most serious offense, a sex offense under chapter 9A.44, or a felony drug offense. Respondentsmust also have completed the terms and conditions of dis-position, including financial obligations, to seal a record during a regular sealing hearing. Motions to Seal Juvenile Records . An individual may also file a motion requesting th at the court seal the individ- ual's juvenile record. An indivi dual is eligible to have the individual's record sealed under this process after remain-ing in the community without further conviction for a pe- riod of time and paying any r estitution associated with the case. For class A felonies, an individual must remain inthe community without convic tion for five years. For class B felonies, class C felonies, and all misdemeanors,an individual must remain in the community without con- viction for two years. Individuals convicted of rape in the first degree, rape in the second degree, and inde cent liberties with forcible compulsion are not eligible fo r record sealing. Other sex offenses are eligible for sealin g, but an individual must be relieved of the obligation to register as a sex offender. Legal Financial Obligations (LFOs) . When an indi- vidual is adjudicated as a ju venile offender, the court may impose LFOs as part of the disposition. LFOs include vic-tim restitution, crime victims' compensation fees, costs as- sociated with the offender 's prosecution and sentence, fines, penalties, and assessments. Interest Rate on LFOs . LFO judgments bear interest from the date of judgment at the same rate that applies tocivil judgments. The rate of interest generally applicable to civil judgments is the greater of 12 percent or fourpoints above the 26-week treasu ry bill rate. As a result of low treasury bill rates, 12 perc ent has been the interest rate on LFOs for over two decades. Interest that accrues on restitution is paid to the victim of the offense. All other accrued interest is split betweenthe state and county as follows : 25 percent goes to the general fund, 25 percent goes to the Judicial InformationSystem Account, and 50 percent goes to the county, 25percent of which must be used to fund local courts. Summary: Restitution . Courts are allowed to modify ju- venile restitution amounts at any time, including the time of a contested record-sealing hearing for good causeshown, including inability to pay. Respondents may also petition for relief from restitutio n. If the court determines that a juvenile has insuffic ient funds to pay and upon agreement of the victim, the court may order performanceof a number of hours of community service in lieu of amonetary penalty, at the rate of the state minimum wageper hour. The court must allo w the victim to determine the nature of the community serv ice to be completed when it is practicable and appropriate to do so. Courts must seal the juvenile records of individuals: who meet the existing criteria for sealing records, and if ei-ther the individual has paid the full amount of restitutionowing to the individual victim named in the restitution or- der or has completed approved community service in full. Information Sharing . Sealed juvenile social files are still available to law enforcem ent, juvenile justice, and care agencies when an inves tigation or case involving the juvenile is being prosecuted, or to agencies when the agen-cy is responsible for supervisin g the juvenile. Juvenile re- cords, whether sealed or not, may be provided withoutpersonal identifiers to resea rchers conducting legitimate research so long as the inform ation is not used to identify an individual with a juvenile record. Juvenile LFOs or Other Fees Modified or Eliminated . The following LFOs or other fees are eliminated for juve-niles: fines for gross misdemea nors related to pet animals; fines for the crime of selling a pet animal to a research institution; penalties for cheating crimes; deferred prosecution or sentence fees; fees for the crime of co mmercial sexual abuse of a minor involving an In ternet advertisement; general fines for felonies and misdemeanors; fines for interference with a health care facility; fines for the crime of unlawful issuance of a bank check; fines for the crime of theft of livestock; fines for the crimes of indecent exposure and prostitu- tion; fines after impoundment of a vehicle upon arrest for prostitution-related and commercial sexual abuse of aminor crimes; appellate costs; interest on financial obligations; penalty assessments for crimes involving domestic violence; juvenile diversion fines; clerk's collection fees; conviction fees; sheriffs' fees; crime lab analysis fees; fees for crimes including driving under the influence, physical control of a vehicl e under the influence, and vehicular homicide or assault; fees for crimes listed in the Uniform Controlled Sub- stances Act; fines for the crime of in tent to manufacture controlled substances; criminal wildlife penalty assessments for the crime of unlawful hunting of big game; and public defense costs. In addition to the elimination of those LFOs, cities, towns, and counties may not impose any LFOs for juve-niles without express statutory authority.ESB 5577 235The victim's penalty assessment must be imposed when the juvenile is adjudica ted of a most serious offense or a sex offense. For all other juvenile offenses that havea victim, the court shall order up to seven hours of commu-nity service, unless the court finds that this would not bepracticable. A juvenile under obligation to pay LFOs other than restitution, the victim penalty assessment, or the crimelaboratory analysis fee may petition the court for modifi- cation or relief from those LFO obligations and interest ac- crued on those obligations for good cause shown,including inability to pa y. The court shall consider factors such as, but not limited to, in carceration and the juvenile's other debts, including restitu tion, when determining a ju- venile's ability to pay. Other Provisions . Access to informa tion on sealed ju- venile court records is expand ed to include criminal jus- tice agencies. County clerks are authorized to interact orcorrespond with an offender, the offender's parents, and any holders of potential assets or wages of the offender tocollect an outstanding LFOs after a juvenile court recordis sealed.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 VETO MESSAGE ON E2SSB 5564 May 14, 2015 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 39(2), Engrossed Second Substitut e Senate Bill No. 5564 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to decreasing the barriers to successful community participation for indi viduals involved with the ju- venile justice system.\" This bill lowers the financial burden on juvenile offenders and their families, making it more likely that they will be able to turntheir lives around and be productive members of society. Section 39(2) eliminates the legal financia l obligation associated with a diversion program. The revenue from the financial obligation in section 39(2) provides substant ial funding for Community Youth Services, a diversion program in T hurston county that is very suc- cessful in providing dive rsion services to juveniles. It is vital to continue to provide adquate [ade quate] funds for these diversion services. For these reasons I have vetoed Section 39(2) of Engrossed Sec- ond Substitute Senate Bill No. 5564.

By Senators Braun and Cleveland.Senate Committee on Health Care Senate Committee on Energy , Environment & Telecom- munications House Committee on Environment Background: The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) direct s the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to manage hazardous wastefrom point of generation, transport, and treatment, to stor-age and disposal. RCRA set s regulations for hazardous waste generators and transporters, as well as for treatment,storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. Treatment, stor-age, and disposal facilities managing hazardous wastesunder RCRA must be permitted to operate. Businessesgenerating dangerous wastes are responsible for properlymanaging, labeling, packaging, and disposing of thewastes. RCRA allows states to implement stricter require-ments as needed. EPA defines hazardous waste as liquid, solid, con- tained gas, or sludge wastes that are dangerous or poten-tially harmful to public he alth or the environment. Hazardous wastes are divided into several categories, withthe major categories being char acteristic wastes and listed wastes. Characteristic hazardous wastes possess traitssuch as flammability, reactivity , corrosivity, and toxicity. Listed hazardous wastes are those that EPA identifies ashazardous waste from certain common industrial or man-ufacturing processes; waste stream; or commercial gradeformulations of unused chem icals. Pharmaceuticals that are designated as hazardous waste under the criteria set inRCRA must be disposed as dangerous waste as required under RCRA. State-only hazardous wastes are designatedas meeting certain state cr iteria for toxicity and per- sistence. EPA delegated the primary responsibility for the haz- ardous waste program to the Department of Ecology(Ecology), which is implemented under the DangerousWaste Regulations. Ecology's dangerous waste rules contain a conditional exclusion for certain state-on ly dangerous wastes. The conditional exclusion allows waste pharmaceuticals that are not a RCRA hazardous waste but a dangerous wasteunder the state's criteria for toxicity and persistence to be excluded from the rest of the Dangerous Waste Regula- tions. The designated state-only pharmaceutical wastemust be incinerated at a fa cility permitted to incinerate municipal solid waste or at a controlled combustion unitunder specified heat and temperature requirements. Ecology developed an interim enforcement policy for managing pharmaceutical wa ste from patient care facili- ties and retail pharmacies. The policy sets forth notice, la-Senate 48 1 House 95 2 (House amended)Senate 46 2 (Senate concurred) SSB 5591 236beling, disposal, staff training, waste management, recordkeeping, and transporter requirements. Summary: By September 1, 2015, Ecology must con- vene a workgroup to identify problems with properly man-aging pharmaceutical waste, and to developrecommendations. Ecology must hire a consultant withexpertise in RCRA to facilita te the workgroup. Work- group members must include representatives of specifiedstate agencies, state-qualified pharmaceutical waste han-dling facilities, statewide asso ciations representing medi- cal doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers, andentities with expertise in managing pharmaceutical waste. Ecology may not use information provided by phar- maceutical waste generators or handling facilities during workgroup meetings for enfo rcement purposes unless an activity performed or conditions at a facility pose an im- minent threat of danger of death or bodily harm, or have aprobability of causing enviro nmental harm. The Legisla- ture encourages Ecology to ex ercise enforcement discre- tion with pharmaceutical wa ste during the workgroup process. By December 31, 2015, the workgroup must recom- mend solutions to improve pharmaceutical waste manage-ment by generators and by treatment and disposalcommercial facilities. The recommendations may include the following: new or revised policies issued by Ecology; consistent interpretation an d implementation of existing rules; statutory amendments ; and implementation of con- sistent regulatory oversight of pharmaceutical waste man- agement facilities that receive waste.

By Senate Committee on Government Operations & Secu- rity (originally sponsored by Senators Liias, Roach, Hase- gawa, Fain, McCoy, Keiser, Pearson, Kohl-Welles,McAuliffe and Conway). Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: Community Assistance Referral and Edu- cation Services (CARES) Programs . Local fire depart- ments may develop CARES programs to providecommunity outreach and assist ance to local residents. CARES programs identify community members who use911 for low-acuity assistance calls - non-emergency ornon-urgent calls - and help direct these citizens to theirprimary care providers, other health care professionals, low-cost medication programs, and other social services.A non-emergency contact number may also be distributedas an alternative resource to the 911 system. Health careprofessionals may be hired as needed to assist with theCARES program. A fire depa rtment may seek grants and private gifts to support its CARES program. Each program that is estab lished must annually mea- sure: (1) the reduction in th e number of phone calls from those that repetitively used th e 911 emergency system; (2) the reduction in avoidable emergency room trips attributedto implementation of the pr ogram; and (3) the estimated amounts of Medicaid funding that would have been spenton emergency room visits if the CARES program had not existed. Upon request the resu lts must be reported to the Legislature or other local governments. Currently, five local fire agencies have established CARES programs: the Kent Regional Fire Authority, theOlympia Fire Department, the Tacoma Fire Department,the SeaTac Fire Department, and Whatcom County FireDistrict #7. Emergency Medical Services . Counties, emergency medical service (EMS) districts, cities, towns, public hos-pital districts, urban EMS districts, regional fire protectionservice authorities, and fire protection districts may autho-rize EMS levies. An EMS levy is a regular voter-approvedlevy which is used to provide emergency medical care oremergency medical services, including related personnelcosts, training for such pers onnel and related equipment, supplies, vehicles, and struct ures needed to provide this care or service. Emergency medical technici ans (EMTs) do non-inva- sive basic life support at the scene of an emergency and enroute to appropriate medical facilities. The permissiblescope of EMT practice is limited to actions taken under theexpress orders of medical program directors. EMTs maynot engage in freestanding or nondirected actions unlessthe situation presents an emergency or a life-threateningcondition. Summary: An EMS provider with tax levying authority or a federally recognized Indian tribe may develop aCARES program, seek grants and private gifts to supportthe program, and contract with health care professionals asneeded to provide the program. EMTs, advanced EMTs, and paramedics may partici- pate in a CARES program if supervised by a medical pro-gram director and the participation does not exceed theEMT's, advanced EMT's, or paramedic's training or certi-fication. EMTs, advanced EMTs, paramedics, and medi-cal program directors are immune from liability for goodfaith acts or omissions as part of participation in a CARES program.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015Senate 48 1 House 97 0 Senate 37 11 House 65 31SSB 5593 237SSB 5593 C 267 L 15 Concerning delivery and payment for health care services by hospitals for inmates and persons detained by law en- forcement. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Dammeier, Padden, Cleveland, O'Ban,Pedersen, Becker and Kohl-Welles). Senate Committee on Law & Justice Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Judiciary Background: Washington law curren tly does not require law enforcement to secure or accompany a hospital patientwho is in custody for a violent or sexual crime. When aviolent suspect or convict is in the hospital, there is a risk of injury to other hospital patients and hospital staff. Hospitals are defined in RCW 70.41.020 to mean an institution, place, building, or agency which provides ac- commodations, facilities, and services over a continuous period of 24 hours or more fo r observation, medical care, and diagnosis. Hospitals tr eat illness, injury, deformity, abnormality, or any other cond ition for which obstetrical, medical, or surgical services would be appropriate for careor diagnosis. Hospitals, as defined, exclude other placesincluding clinics, physician's offices, nursing homes,birthing centers, or institutio ns specifically intended for use in the diagnosis and care of mental illness, intellectualdisability, convulsive disorder s, or other abnormal mental conditions. Hospital policy ma y address safety consider- ations for patients and staff, and that policy may vary ac- cording to institution, facility structure, andcircumstances. Summary: Any individual who is brought to a hospital to receive care and who is in custody for a violent offense orsex offense must be accompani ed or otherwise secured by the officer during the time that the individual is receivingcare at the hospital. An excep tion is provided for individ- uals being supervised by the Department of Corrections inthe community if the custody is solely the result of a sanc- tion for violation of conditions. In addition it is clarified that all current statutes regulating restraints' use for preg-nant women and youth in custody remain unchanged. An individual receiving medical care does not need to be accompanied or otherwise secured if: 1. the individual's medical care provider so indicates; or 2. the officer determines, using the officer's best judg- ment, that: a. the individual does not present an imminent and significant risk of causing physical harm to them- selves or another person; b. there is no longer suff icient evidentiary basis to maintain the individual in custody; or c. in the interest of public safety, the presence of the officer is urgently required at another location andthe officer determines, using the officer's best judgment and in consultation with the officer's su- pervisor, if available on duty, that the public safety interest outweighs the need to accompany or se-cure the individual in the hospital. If the medical care provider determines the individual does not need to be accompani ed or otherwise secured, the officer has no ongoing duty to accompany or otherwise se- cure the individual for the duration of their treatment by the hospital. In that circum stance, the hospital must notify the officer when the individual is expected to be releasedby the hospital. Even after indicating that an individual need not be accompanied or otherwise secured, the hospi- tal may request the presence of an officer if the individual demonstrates behavior that pr esents an imminent and sig- nificant risk of causing phys ical harm to themselves or others. If the officer determines the individual need not be ac- companied or otherwise secure d, the officer must notify the medical care provider that the officer is leaving the in- dividual unattended or unsecure d. In that case, the hospi- tal has no duty to notify the officer when the individual is, or is expected to be, released from the hospital. Additionally if the officer determines that the individ- ual need not be accompanied or otherwise secured, the of- ficer must notify the medical care provider that the individual is unattended or unsecured. If immediate de-parture by the officer is requi red, the officer must notify the medical care provider or other hospital staff that the in-dividual is unattended or unsecured and the officer mustmake a reasonable effort to ensure a replacement officer orother means of accompanying or securing the individual as soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances.The hospital must notify the officer or the officer's desig-nee if the individual is, or is expected to be, released from the hospital prior to the officer, or a replacement officer,returning to resume accompanying or otherwise securingthe individual. Immunity from Civil Liability . Except for actions or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful miscon-duct, the hospital and health care providers are immunefrom liability, including civil liability, professional con-duct sanctions, and administ rative actions resulting from the individual not bein g accompanied or secured. Law enforcement officers, co rrections officers, guards supplied by a law enforcement or corrections agency, andtheir employing departments, agencies, and representa-tives are immune from civil lia bility arising out of the fail- ure to comply with this act, unless it is shown that, in thetotality of the circumstances, the officer or agency acted with gross negligence or bad faith. Medical Payments . A payment rate structure is creat- ed for hospital services provided to patients who are the fi- nancial responsibility of the law enforcement entity. Unless other rates are agreed to by the governing unit and the hospital, the hospital must accept as payment in full bySSB 5596 238the governing units the applicab le facility's percent of al- lowed charges rate or fee schedule as determined, main-tained, and posted by the Washington State Department ofLabor and Industries. These payments are for inpatient,outpatient, and ancillary serv ices for confined persons that are not already paid by the Medicaid Program. When an inmate is screened during booking or in preparation for ente ring jail, general information concern- ing the inmate's ability to pay for medical care must beidentified, including insurance or other medical benefits or resources to which an inmate is entitled. The inmate mayalso be evaluated for Medica id eligibility and, if deemed potentially eligible, enrolled in Medicaid. This informa- tion may be made available to the authority, the governingunit, and any provider of health services. To the extent that federal law allows, a jail or ja il's designee is authorized to act on behalf of a confined person for purposes of applyingfor Medicaid.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5596 C 195 L 15 Creating a special permit for a manufacturer of wine to hold a private event for the purpose of tasting and selling wine of its own production. By Senate Committee on Co mmerce & Labor (originally sponsored by Senators King, Hewitt, Kohl-Welles andMcAuliffe). Senate Committee on Commerce & Labor House Committee on Commerce & Gaming Background: The Liquor Control Board (LCB) issues a variety of special permits fo r selling, serving, and han- dling alcohol at specified even ts or to persons or entities who do not hold a liquor license. Many special permits areof limited duration for a specif ied purpose or event, or are issued for a purpose falling ou tside the commercial activ- ities ordinarily engaged in by a licensee. For example,special permits are issued to allow for the consumption of liquor at banquets and to allow a manufacturer or distrib-utor to donate liquor to delegates and guests at conven-tions and international trade fairs. Unless a fee is specifiedin statute, the fees for permit s are generally established by the LCB. Summary: The LCB is authorized to issue a special per- mit to a wine manufacturer allowing a wine tasting and sales event at a specified loca tion on a specified date. The event may not be open to the general public and the winetasted or sold must be of the winery's own production. Thepermit must be obtained from the LCB for a fee of $10 perevent. The application for th e permit must be submitted at least ten days prior to the event and the permit must beposted during the event. Wine manufacturers are limitedto hosting not more than 12 wine-tasting events per year that require the sp ecial event permit.

By Senate Committee on Hu man Services, Mental Health & Housing (originally sponsored by Senators Dammeier,Keiser, Darneille and Kohl-Welles; by request of Depart-ment of Social and Health Services). Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing House Committee on Judiciary Background: The Abuse of Vulnerable Adults Act (Act) authorizes the Department of Social and Health Services(DSHS) and law enforcement agencies to investigate com- plaints of abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, ne-glect, or self-neglect of vulnerable adults. The Act requires mandatory reporting and investigations. It also allows vulnerable adults to seek protection orders or file civil suits for damages resulting from abandonment,abuse, exploitation, or neglect. A vulnerable adult includes a person who: is 60 years of age or older who has the functional, mental, or physical inability to care for himself or herself; is found to be incapacitated; has a developmental disability; has been admitted to any facility such as an assisted living facility, nursing home , adult family home, sol- diers' home, or residential rehabilitation center; receives services from home health, hospice, or home care agencies; receives services from an individual provider; or who self-directs their own care and receives services from a person aide. Summary: The definition of abuse includes personal ex- ploitation of a vulnerable adu lt. Abuse also includes im- proper use of restraint against a vulnerable adult, whichmeans the inappropriate use of chemical, physical, or me- chanical restraints for conven ience or discipline or in a manner that: (1) is inconsis tent with federal or state li- censing or certification requir ements for fa cilities, hospi-Senate 49 0 House 98 0 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred)Senate 43 5 House 95 2 (House amended)Senate 40 7 (Senate concurred)SB 5603 239tals, or program authorized under chapter 71A.12 RCW; (2) is not medically authorized; or (3) otherwise consti-tutes abuse under this section. Chemical restraint means the administration of any drug to manage a vulnerable adult's or client's behavior ina way that reduces the safety risk to the resident or others,has the temporary effect of restricting the vulnerableadult's freedom of movement, and is not standard treat- ment for the vulnerable adult's medical or psychiatric con-dition. Physical restrain t means the application of physical force without the use of any device, for the pur-pose of restraining the free movement of a vulnerableadult's body. The term physic al restraint does not include briefly holding without undue force a vulnerable adult or client in order to calm or co mfort the client, or holding a vulnerable adult's hand to safely escort him or her from one area to another. Mechanical restraint means any de-vice attached or adjacent to the vulnerable adult's body which the adult cannot easily remove that restricts free-dom of movement or normal access to the adult's body;this does not include the use of devices, materials, orequipment that are medically authorized and used in a manner consistent with federa l or state licensing or certifi- cation requirements. Mental abuse means a willful verbal or nonverbal ac- tion that threatens, humiliates, harasses, coerces, intimi-dates, isolates, unreasonably confines, or punishes a vulnerable adult. Sexual abuse means any form of non-consensual sexual conduct. Hospital means a facility licensed under chapter 70.41, 71.12, or 72.23 RCW and any employee, agent, of-ficer, director, or independent contractor.

Senate Committee on Agriculture, Water & Rural Eco- nomic Development House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Background: Non-potentially hazardous foods prepared in a home kitchen for sale di rectly to the consumer may be licensed as cottage foods by the Washington State Depart-ment of Agriculture (WSDA) if annual gross sales are un-der $15,000 per year. The permit processing fee is $30 per year, paid to WS- DA. In addition there is a pub lic health review fee of $75,and an annual inspection fee of $125 for a total of $230. All fees are paid into the agricultural local fund. Cottage food products are non-potentially hazardous baked goods, jams, jellies, pr eserves, and fruit butters as those terms are defined in fe deral regulations, and other non-hazardous foods as they are identified by WSDA byrule. Cottage food operators are persons who produce cot-tage food products in the ho me kitchen of their primary domestic residence only for sal e directly to the consumer. The annual gross sales ceiling is set by WSDA under statute and requires WSDA to set the amount at $15,000from the beginning of the program, which was establishedin the 2011 legislative session and issued its first permit in June 2012. Beginning January 1, 2013, WSDA must in-crease this amount biennially to reflect inflation. The Cot- tage Food Permit exempts the holder from compliance with the Washington Food Processing Act. Summary: The provisions for initial establishment of the $15,000 ceiling and for its adju stment by inflation are de- leted. The new ceiling is $25,000.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5606 C 120 L 15 Modifying provisions relate d to licensing and scope of practice for dental professionals.

By Senators Benton, Hobbs, Angel, Keiser, Fain, Roach, Hatfield, Conway, Chase and Baumgartner. Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance House Committee on Business & Financial Services Background: Washington regulates the business of pawnbrokers under chapter 19.60 RCW. There is, howev-er, no state licensing requirement for pawnbrokers. Localgovernments may issue licenses for pawnbroker business-es and have the authority to en act provisions that are more restrictive than those in chapter 19.60 RCW. A pawnbro-ker is defined as every person engaged, in whole or in part,in the business of loaning mo ney on the security of pledg- es, deposits, or conditional sa les of personal property, or the purchase and sale of personal property. The statutory term of a pawnbroker loan is 90 days. Every loan transaction entered into by a pawnbroker must be a written agreement, and a copy must be furnished to the pledger of the property. Interest may be charged every30 days, and a preparation fee may be charged once for theterm of the loan. If a pledged article is not redeemed with-in the 90-day term of the loan, the pawnbroker has all rights, title, and interest of that item of personal property.The pawnbroker is not required to account to the pledgerfor any proceeds received from the disposition of thatproperty. A new loan, by agreement of the parties, may bewritten after the 90-day term expires. Pawnbrokers are authorized to receive interest and loan preparation fees up to statutory limits. The schedulefor the maximum amount of interest and fees that pawn-brokers may charge is set out in incremental categories. In- terest charges range from $1.00 per 30-day period for aloan of less than $10.00 to 3 percent of the loan amount for loan amounts of $100 or more. The schedule of loanpreparation fees contains 56 categories of loan amounts,from loans less than $5 to lo ans of $4,500 or more. Thefee for a loan in an amount l ess than $5 is $1.50 and for a loan of $4,500 or more, is $91. The pawnbroker may also charge a general storage fee of $3 and an additional $3 fee for the storage of a firearm. The table below illustrates the maximum interest and fees permitted for certain loan amounts: Summary: The interest and fees allowed for pawnbroker loans are modified. For loan amounts of $100 or more, theinterest charged per 30-day period is increased to 4 percentof the loan. The one-time preparation fee for loans of $50 or more is a gradually decreasing percentage rate based on the amount of the loan. The fee ranges from 15 percent fora loan amount of $50 to $99.99 down to 6 percent for loanamounts of $2,000 or more. The interest for loan amounts of less than $100 remain at 3 percent and incremental feesstay the same for loan amounts less than $50. The general storage fee and the firearm storage fee are each increased to $5. Both storage fees may be charged on a recurring basis, every 30 days. The table below illustrates the maximum interest and fees permitted for certain lo an amounts under this act: The provisions of the bill expire on July 1, 2018.

By Senate Committee on Huma n Services, Mental Health & Housing (originally sponsored by Senators Hargrove,O'Ban, McAuliffe and Conway). Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Public SafetyHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: Community-Based Domestic Violence Programs and Emergency Shelters . A domestic violence program is an agency that provides shelter, advocacy, andcounseling for domestic violen ce victims in a supportive environment. A shelter is defined as a place of temporary refuge, offered on a 24-hour, seven-day-per-week basis tovictims of domestic violence and their children. The Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) . DSHS administers state and federal funds for do- mestic violence programs, which include shelters. DSHSalso establishes minimum stan dards for shelters receiving funds. The shelters must provide certain services, includ-ing food, clothing, housing, client advocacy, and counsel-ing. For nonshelter comm unity-based programs receiving DSHS funding, DSHS must establish minimum standards to enhance client safety and security such as by providing client advocacy, client c onfidentiality, and counseling. Marriage License . The current marriage license fee is $64. Dissolution Filing Fees . Filing fees in Washington for a petition for dissolution, legal separation, or declaration concerning the validity of marriage are established by stat-ute. The statute requires the su perior court clerk to collect an initial $110 fee from the pe titioner for the initial filing. The filing fee may be waived upon showing financialhardship. Superior court clerks must also collect an additional $30 fee. A total of $24 out of the $30 fee must be trans-mitted to the state for depos it in the Dom estic Violence Prevention Account (DV Preven tion Account) in the state treasury. The remaining $6 is retained by the county collecting the fee for the purpose of funding community-based ser- vices for victims of domestic violence within the county. In addition the court may retain 5 percent of the $6 - which equals $0.30 - for administrative purposes. Domestic Violence Prevention Account . DSHS ad- ministers the funds in the DV Prevention Account andmay establish minimum standards for preventive, nonshel-ter community-based services receiving the funds. Reve-nue transferred into the DV Prevention Account must be used to fund nonshelter comm unity-based services for do- mestic violence victims. Preventive, nonshelter commu- nity-based services include services for victims ofdomestic violence from commun ities that have been tradi- tionally underserved or unserved and services for childrenwho have witnessed domestic violence. Client Records . Client records maintained by domes- tic violence programs that provide shelter, advocacy, orcounseling are subject to discovery only by court orderand are exempt from disclosur e under the Public Disclo- sure Act to the extent that disclosure would violate person-al privacy or vital governmental interests. Summary: Community-Based Domestic Violence Pro- grams and Emergency Shelters . A \"community-based do- mestic violence program\" is a nonprofit program ororganization that provides, as its primary purpose, assis-tance and advocacy for domest ic violence victims. Do- mestic violence assistance and advocacy includes: crisisintervention, individual and group support, information and referrals, and safety assessment and planning. Do-mestic violence assistance a nd advocacy may also include, but is not limited to: provisio n of shelter, emergency trans- portation, self-help services, culturally specific services,legal advocacy, economic advocacy, community educa- tion, primary and secondary prevention efforts, and ac-companiment and advocacy through medical, legal,immigration, human services, and financial assistance sys-tems. An \"emergency shelter\" is a place of supportive ser- vices and safe, temporary lodging offered on a 24-hour,seven-day per week basis to victims of domestic violence and their children. The Department of Social and Health Services . The DSHS, in consultation with rele vant state departments, the Domestic Violence Coalition, and individuals having ex-perience in domestic violence issues, including those with experience providing cultura lly appropriate services to populations that have trad itionally been underserved or unserved, must: (1) develop an d maintain a plan for deliv- ering domestic violence victim services and access toemergency shelters across the state; (2) establish mini-mum standards for such programs; (3) receive grant appli-cations; (4) distribute funds; (5) evaluate biennially eachprogram receiving the DSHS fu nds for compliance; (6) re- view the minimum standards ea ch biennium to ensure ap- plicability to community an d client needs; and (7) administer funds available from the DV Prevention Ac- count. The DSHS must establish minimum standards that en- sure that community-based domestic violence programsprovide client-centered advocacy and services designed toenhance immediate and long-t erm safety, victim autono- my, and security by means such as, but not limited to, safe- ty assessment and planning, info rmation and referral, legalSSB 5633 243advocacy, culturally and lingu istically appropriate ser- vices, access to shelter, and client confidentiality. In establishing programs th at provide culturally rele- vant prevention efforts, and age appropriate preventionand intervention services for children who have been ex- posed to domestic violence, or youth who have been vic- tims of dating violence, priority for state funding must begiven to: (1) those programs with a documented history ofeffective work in providing advocacy and services to vic-tims of domestic violence or dating violence; or (2) those agencies with a demonstrated history of effective work with youth partnered with a domestic violence program. For emergency shelter programs receiving the DSHS funding, minimum standards by the DSHS must be estab-lished to ensure services are pr ovided that meet basic sur- vival needs, such as emergency transportation, child careassistance, and safety assessm ent and planning. Emergen- cy shelters receiving grants must provide client-centered advocacy and services designed to enhance client autono- my, client confidentiality, and immediate and long-termsafety. Both community-based dom estic violence programs and emergency shelter programs receiving state fundsmust: (1) provide a location to assist victims of domestic violence who have a need for community advocacy or sup-port services; (2) make availa ble confidential services, ad- vocacy, and prevention programs to victims of domesticviolence and to their children within available resources; (3) require that persons employed by or volunteering for acommunity-based domestic vi olence program protect the confidentiality and privacy of domestic violence victims and their families; (4) recruit, to the extent feasible, per- sons who are former victims of domestic violence to workas volunteers or staff who can also provide culturally and linguistically appropriate servic es; (5) ensure that all em- ployees or volunteers have sufficient training in connec-tion with domestic violence; and (6) refrain from engaging in activities that compromise th e safety of victims or their children. Dissolution Filing Fees . The additional filing fee col- lected by superior court cler ks for dissolution, legal sepa- ration, or declaration concerning the validity of marriageis increased to a $54 fee (this is an increase by $24 over thecurrent $30 fee). A total of $48 out of the $54 fee must betransmitted to the state for de posit in the DV Prevention Account in the State Treasury. The remaining $6 will con-tinue to be retained by the co unty collecting the fee for the purpose of funding community-b ased services for victims of domestic violence within the county; however, each county must annually report to the DSHS on such reve- nues and expenditures by Decemb er 15 of each year. The DSHS must develop a reporting form to be used by coun-ties for uniform reporting purposes. Domestic Violence Convictions . The penalty assess- ment imposed by superior, district, and municipal courtsagainst any person convicted of a crime involving domes-tic violence is increased to a $115 assessment (this is a $15 increase over the current assessment). The $15 assess-ment must be remitted monthly to the State Treasury fordeposit in the DV Prevention Account. Domestic Violence Protection Order Violations . The courts must impose a fine of $15 for any violation of a do-mestic violence protection order. Revenue from the finemust be remitted monthly to the State Treasury for depositin the DV Prevention Account. Domestic Violence Prevention Account . Funds in the DV Prevention Account may be used only for funding: culturally specific prevention efforts and appropriate community-based domestic vi olence services for vic- tims of domestic violence from populations that havebeen traditionally underserved or unserved; age appropriate preven tion and intervention services for children who have been exposed to domestic vio-lence or youth who have been victims of dating vio- lence; and outreach and education efforts by community-based domestic violence programs designed to increasepublic awareness and prevention of domestic and dat- ing violence. Client Records . A court must order that parties of a court order are prohibited from further dissemination ofany parts of records that are discoverable, and that anyportion of any domestic violence program record includedin the court file are to be sealed. Disclosure of domesticviolence program records is not a waiver of the victim'srights or privileges under statutes, rules of evidence, orcommon law. If disclosure of a victim's records is required by court order, the domestic violence program must makereasonable attempts to provide notice to the recipient af-fected by the disclosure, and must take steps necessary toprotect the privacy and safety of the persons affected by the disclosure of the information.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5633 C 216 L 15 Creating a coordinator for the helmets to hardhats program in the department of veterans affairs.

By Senators Hasegawa, Roach, Kohl-Welles, Chase, Keis- er and McAuliffe. Senate Committee on Higher Education House Committee on Higher Education Background: The State Need Grant (SNG) program was established in 1969 to suppor t low-income students and offset the increase of tuition. In 2014-15, to be eligible, a student's family income cann ot exceed 70 percent of the state's median family income , currently $58,500 for a fam- ily of four. Awards are prorated by income categories andfurther prorated for part-time students: 75 percent for stu- dents taking nine to eleven credits, 50 percent for students taking six to eight credits, and 25 percent for students tak-ing three to five credits. In 1990 the Legislature extended SNG eligibility to students enrolled at least half-time - six quarter credits ormore. In 2005 the Legislature directed the former HigherEducation Coordinating Board to develop a two-year pilotproject to assess the need for and feasibility of allowingstudents enrolled for at least four quarter credits to be eli-gible for SNG. Under the pilo t, students attending a par- ticipating school who enrolled fo r four or five credits were eligible to receive a grant as long as they met the other el-igibility criteria for SNG. In 2007 the Legislature extend- ed the part-time student pilot program to students enrolled for at least three quarter credits, or the semester equiva-lent. The pilot program expired on June 30, 2011. Under the 2013-15 operatin g budget, eligibility for SNG includes students enrolled in three to five quartercredits. Summary: Students who are enrolled or accepted for en- rollment for at least three quar ter credits, or the equivalent semester hours, in a qualifyi ng higher education program are eligible for SNG. The expired pilot program allowing less-than-half- time students to be eligible for the SNG program is re- moved from statute. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5647 C 295 L 15 Allowing counties to create guardianship courthouse facil- itator programs. By Senators Conway, Dansel and Fraser.Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing House Committee on Judiciary Background: Any person or entity may petition the court for the appointment of a guar dian or limited guardian for an allegedly incapacitated person. Incapacitated meansthat the individual has a signif icant risk of personal harm based upon a demonstrated inab ility to adequately provide for nutrition, health, housing, or physical safety. Guard- ians can reduce the likelihood of such problems by man-aging finances, arranging for health care, organizing livingarrangements, and assisting in other ways. A guardian may be a lay guardian, generally a family member orfriend of the alleged incapacitat ed person, or a profession- al guardian, who charges a fee to provide guardianship ser-vices. The court has supervisory power overguardianships, and may modify a guardianship or removea guardian upon petition and showing of good cause. A guardian ad litem must be ap pointed to represent an al- legedly incapacitated person during the guardianship pro-ceeding. Any person, including an incapacitated person, may apply to the court for an orde r to modify or terminate a guardianship order or to replace a guardian or limitedguardian. Unless courts direct otherwise, clerks mustschedule hearings within 30 da ys of receiving the requests. Courthouse facilitator prog rams exist in counties across the state and provide information and referrals to litigants who are not represented by attorneys.

Litigants usually meet with facilitatorson a walk-in basis or by pre-scheduled appointments. Fa-cilitators can assist pro se litigants by providing the fol-lowing: information on how to start certain legal actions; information on what forms ar e needed and where to get them; information on court rules, procedures, and case schedules; assistance on fo rms to ensure completeness; and information on other court and community resources. Summary: A court may create a guardianship courthouse facilitator program to provide basic services to pro se liti-gants in guardianship cases. The legislative authority of any county may impose a surcharge of up to $20 or mayimpose user fees, or both, to pay for the expenses of theprogram. Fees collected must be collected and depositedin the same manner as other county funds are collected anddeposited, and must be maintained in a separate guardian-ship courthouse fa cilitator account. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 E2SSB 5649 C 269 L 15 Concerning the involuntary treatment act. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Darneille, Miloscia, Fraser, Keiser, Par- lette, Benton, McCoy and Dammeier). Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on JudiciaryHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: The Involuntary Treatment Act (ITA) al- lows a designated mental health professional (DMHP) todetain a person when the DM HP finds that the person, as a result of a mental disorder, presents a likelihood of seri-ous harm or is gravely disabled , and that the person has re- fused voluntary treatment. The ITA requires persons to bedetained to an evaluation and treatment facility (E&T). An E&T is defined as any facility which can provide di-rectly or by arrangement with other agencies emergencyevaluation and treatment, outp atient care, and timely and appropriate inpatient care to persons suffering from a men- tal disorder, and which is certified as such by the Depart-ment of Social and Health Services (DSHS). When a person is held for initial evaluation in an emergency room, triage facility , or crisis stabilization unit, the DMHP must detain the pers on to an E&T or release the person within six hours of th e time that facility staff deter- mines a DMHP evaluation is necessary, or within 12 hoursfrom arrival at the facility if the person was brought in by a peace officer. In August the Washington Supreme Court decided In re D.W. , 181 Wn.2d 201 (2014), in which the court deter- mined that current statutes and rules under the ITA do notallow DSHS to temporarily certify single E&T beds unlessthe person requires a service which is not available at anE&T, and do not authorize si ngle bed certification based on lack of room at a regularl y certified E&T facility. In re- sponse DSHS enacted emergenc y rule changes in August, September, and December. Washington AdministrativeCode now allows DSHS to grant a single bed certificationif the single bed certification is to a facility that is willingand able to provide timely and appropriate mental healthtreatment, either directly or by arrangement with otheragencies. Examples of faciliti es that may be approved for single bed certifications incl ude community facilities, res- idential treatment facilities, hospitals with psychiatric units, psychiatric hospitals, an d hospitals that are willing and able to provide timely and appropriate mental healthtreatment. Also in response, DSHS collaborated with the Governor's Office and others to make 145 additional reg- ularly certified E&T beds available for detention in King,Pierce, and Snohomish counties by the end of 2014, withadditional expansion of beds planned in 2015. Summary: Regional support networks (RSNs) must pro- vide for an adequate network of E&T services to ensureaccess to treatment for persons who meet ITA detentioncriteria. DSHS must collaborate with the RSNs and theWashington State Institute fo r Public Policy to estimate the capacity needed for E&T services within each regional service area, including consid eration of average occupan- cy rates needed to ensure ac cess to treatment. Each RSN must develop and maintain an adequate plan to provide forE&T service needs. A DMHP must submit a report to DSHS within 24 hours if the DMHP determines that an adult or minormeets ITA detention criteria but there are not any E&Tbeds available to admit the person within the time avail- able for evaluation, and the person cannot be servedthrough a single bed certifica tion or less restrictive alter- native (LRA). DSHS must develop a standardized formfor the DMHP to use to submit this report, including a list of facilities which refused to admit the person. DSHSmust promptly share reported information with the respon- sible RSN and require the RSN to attempt to engage the person in services and report back within seven days.DSHS must track and analyz e these reports and initiate corrective actions, including but not limited to enforce- ment of contract remedies and requiring expenditure of re-serve funds, to ensure that each RSN has implemented an adequate plan to provide for E&T services. An adequateplan may include development of LRAs to involuntarycommitment such as crisis tria ge, crisis diversion, volun- tary treatment, or preventio n programs reasonably calcu- lated to reduce the demand for E&T services. DSHS mustSenate 48 0 House 80 17 (House amended)Senate 47 1 (Senate concurred)SB 5650 246publish quarterly reports on its website summarizing in- formation submitted by DMHPs and the number of singlebed certifications granted by category. DSHS may approve the single bed certification of E&T beds to be used for dete ntion under the ITA, if the bed is located in a facility th at is willing and able to pro- vide timely and appropriate tr eatment to the person, either directly or by arrangement with other public or privateagencies. A single bed certification must be specific to thepatient receiving treatment. A DMHP who submits an ap- plication for single bed certifi cation in good faith at a fa- cility that is willing and able to provide timely and appropriate treatment may presume that the applicationwill be approved for the pur pose of completing the deten- tion process and responding to other emergency calls. The six-hour time limit for a DMHP to complete an evaluation of a person held in an emergency room or triagefacility, or 12-hour time limit to complete the evaluation ifthe person was placed in the facility by a peace officer, must start upon notification to the DMHP of the need forevaluation and must not begin until there is medical clear- ance. Medical clearance mean s a physician or other health care provider has determined th at the person is medically stable and ready for referral to the DMHP. Dismissal of the commitment petition is not an appropriate remedy for violation of these timeliness requirements except in the few cases where the facility st aff or DMHP has totally dis- regarded statutory requirements. The intent of the ITA is u pdated to include protecting the health and safety of persons suffering from mental dis-orders and protecting public safety through use of the pa- rens patriae and police powers of the state. When construing ITA requirements , courts must focus on the merits of the petition, exce pt where requirements have been totally disregarded.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 May 14, 2015 (Sections 1-9 and 11-13) April 1, 2016 (Sections 10 and 14) SB 5650 C 238 L 15 Modifying provisions governing inmate funds subject to deductions.

By Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Educa- tion (originally Rolfes, Jayapal, Par-lette Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education House Committee on Education Background: The Legislature has authorized the State Board of Education (SBE) to establish the minimum staterequirements for high schoo l graduation, within certain parameters established by the Legislature. SBE has estab-lished the state minimum requ irements in the agency's rules. The rules require e ach student to have a High School and Beyond Plan for their high school experience, including what the student expects to do the year follow-ing graduation. Under state special education laws and the federal In- dividuals with Disabilities Ed ucation Act (IDEA), public school districts must provide a free and appropriate educa- tion for students with a disa bility. An appropriate educa- tion is specially designed in struction and related services to address the unique needs, abilities, and limitations of the student with a disability. Under IDEA, an Individual ized Education Program (IEP) guides a student's learni ng while in a special educa- tion program. It describes the amount of time the studentwill spend receiving special education, any related ser-vices the student will receive , and the academic and be- havioral goals and expectations for the year. The IEP isdeveloped and revised annually by an IEP team, which in-cludes the student's parent or guardian, one of the student'sgeneral education teachers, on e special education teacher, a representative of the school district, someone who caninterpret assessment results, and others who may have spe-cial knowledge or expertise. Under IDEA, transition ser-vices must be included in th e IEP beginning at age 16, or earlier if appropriate. The transition services must be de- signed to facilitate the stud ent's movement from school to postsecondary activities incl uding education, vocational education, integrated or supported employment, adult ser-vices, and independent living, as appropriate. The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) collects data on stud ents receiving special educa- tion, which must be submitted annually to the U.S. Depart- m e n t o f E d u c a t i o n . I n N o v e m b e r 2 0 1 4 O S P I r e p o r t e dthere were 9173 students age 14 and 9240 students age 15receiving special edu cation in Washington. Current state law requires OSPI to establish interagen- cy agreements with the Depa rtment of Social and Health Services, the Department of Services for the Blind, and any other state agency that pr ovides high school transition services for special education students in order to foster collaboration among the multiple agencies providing tran- sition services. Summary: The multiple agencies that provide transition services for special education students must do so as soonas educationally and developmentally appropriate. Thetransition services must be addr essed in a transition plan in the IEP of a student with disabilities. Transition planningmust be based on educationa lly and developmentally ap- propriate transition assessment s that outline the student's needs, strengths, preferences, and interests. Transition services include activities to a ssist the student reach post- secondary goals and courses of study to support the goals.Transition activities may includ e instruction, related ser- vices, community experience, employment and other adultliving objectives, daily livin g skills, and functional voca- tional evaluation. As a student gets older, changes in thetransition plan may be noted at the annual update of the student's IEP. A student with disabilities who has a HighSchool and Beyond Plan may use that plan as the requiredtransition plan. To determine the postsecondary goals of the student, a discussion should take place w ith the student, the student's parents, and others, as needed. The goals must be measur-able and based on transition assessments, when necessary.The goals must also be based on the student's needs,strengths, preferences, and interests.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Hill and Angel; by request of Office ofFinancial Management). Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Appropriations Background: The Washington Lottery was established in 1982. The Lottery sells a variety of products, includingscratch-off ticket games, Keno, multi-jurisdictional num-ber-picking games such as Po werball and Mega Millions, and other games of chance. Lottery revenues are used tofund the following purposes: (1) Washington Opportunity Pathways Account; (2) debt payments on stadium bonds;(3) problem gambling education; (4) economic develop-ment; and (5) the general fund. The State Lottery Account is a non-appropriated en- terprise account for all reve nues from the sale of lottery products and expenses for payment of prizes to lotterywinners, cost of sales, and re tailer commissions. The State Lottery Account must be a separate account outside the state treasury. The Lottery Administrative Account is an appropriated account in the state treasury used to fund costs incurred in the operatio ns and administration of the Lottery. Summary: On June 30 of each fiscal year, any balance of unclaimed prizes in excess of $10 million must be trans- ferred to the Washington Op portunity Pathways Account. Funds in the Lottery Administrative Account may be usedto fund Lottery revenue fore casts by the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council. Funds from the State LotteryAccount may be transferred to the Gambling Revolving Account in amounts as directed by the omnibus appropri-ations act.Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015SB 5692 C 270 L 15 Addressing permanency plans of care for dependent chil- dren. By Senators Hargrove and Da rneille; by request of Depart- ment of Social and Health Services. Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing House Committee on Early Le arning & Human Services Background: Permanency Plan . When a child is ordered removed from the home of a parent, the Department of So-cial and Health Services (DSHS) or supervising agencyassumes responsibility for de veloping a permanency plan no later than 60 days afte r assuming responsibility. The permanency planning process must include reasonable ef- forts to return the child to th e home of the parent. The su- pervising agency must submit a written permanency plan to all parties and the court at least 14 days before the scheduled hearing. The permanency plan must identify the primary goal of the case and may identify a lternative goals. These goals could include returning the ch ild to the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian; adoption; guardianship; per-manent legal custody; long-term relative or foster care;successful completion of a responsible living program; orindependent living. Unless the court has ordered the filing of a petition to terminate parent al rights, the plan must in- clude what steps will be taken to return a child home. Allaspects of the plan must include the goal of achieving per-manence for the child. The plan must further spec ify what services the par- ents will be offered to allow them to resume custody, the requirements parents must meet to resume custody, and a time limit for each service and requirement. Dependency Review Hearings . A court must review the status of all children found to be dependent at least ev- ery six months from the date a child was placed out of thechild's parent's home or the date dependency is estab-lished, whichever is first. The purpose of these hearings is to review the progress of the parties and determine wheth-er court supervision should continue. The first review hearing must be an in-court review and be set six months from the beginning date of thechild's placement out of home or no more than 90 daysfrom the entry of the disposition order, whichever is first. A child may not be returned home at a review hearing unless the court finds that a reason for removal no longerexists. If a child is returned home, casework must contin-ue for six months, when there must be a hearing on theneed for continued intervention. If a child is not returned home at a review hearing, the court must establish in wr iting various determinations. Some of these determinatio ns include the following:Senate (Senate insisted on its position House 91 7 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred) Senate 49 0 Senate 44 0Senate 45 0 House 90 8SB 5693 249 whether the supervising agency is making reasonable efforts to provide services to the family and eliminate the need for out-of-home placement; whether the parties comp lied with the case plan; and whether progress was made in correcting the prob- lems that led to out-of-home care. Federal Law . H.R. 4980 which passed into law in 2014, provides that all states must limit the use of another planned permanency living arrangement - i.e. long-termfoster care - to youth ages 16 or older. States have untilOctober 1, 2015, to comply w ith this requirement. Non- compliance would potentially jeopardize future Title IV-E funding. Washington's statute provides for long-term rel-ative or foster care un til the child is age 18. Summary: Children between the ages of 16 and 18 may be placed in long-term relative or foster care under a per-manency plan. Children under 16 may remain placed withrelatives or in foster care when deemed appropriate. If a goal of long-term fost er care has been achieved prior to the permanency planni ng hearing and the court de- termines that the plan for the child's care remains appropri-ate, the court must find that another planned permanentliving arrangement is the best permanency plan for the child and provide compelling reasons why it continues to not be in the child's best inte rest to return home, be placed for adoption, be placed with another legal guardian, or beplaced with a fit and willing rela tive. If the child is at the hearing, the court should ask the child about the child's de- sired permanency outcome.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5693 C 271 L 15 Authorizing the department of social and health services special commitment center to seek eligibility and reim- bursement for health care cost s covered by federal medi- care, medicaid, and veterans health benefits. By Senators Miloscia, Darneille, Fraser and O'Ban; by re- quest of Department of Social and Health Services. Senate Committee on Health Care Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing House Committee on Appropriations Background: The Department of Social and Health Ser- vices (DSHS) operates the Special Commitment Center onMcNeil Island and two secure community transition facil- ities which house persons who have been committed bysuperior court as sexually violen t predators. DSHS is re-sponsible for providing medical care, either directly or by arrangement with other public or private agencies, for res-idents who are committe d to these facilities. A sexually violent predator is a person who has been convicted of or charged with a crime of sexual violenceand who suffers from a mental abnormality or personalitydisorder which makes the person likely to engage in pred- atory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure fa- cility. Summary: DSHS may act on behalf of a resident who is civilly committed as a sexually violent predator for the purpose of applying for Medicare and Medicaid benefits,veteran's health benefits, or other health care benefits orreimbursement available as a result of participation in a health care exchange unde r the Affordable Care Act. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5717 C 122 L 15 Amending the insurer holding company act. By Senators Angel, Mullet and Keiser; by request of Insur- ance Commissioner. Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance House Committee on Busin ess & Financial Services House Committee on Appropriations Background: In 1993 the Legislature amended the insur- ance code to conform to the financial regulation standards and regulatory statutes reco mmended by the National As- sociation of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). In part thelegislation addressed the following: insurance holdingcompanies; insurance company examination procedures;insurer capital and surplus re quirements; limitations upon individual insurance comp any exposure to individual risks; valuation of insuran ce company investments; re- ceivership, liquidation, and rehabilitation of insurance companies; and penalties that may be imposed by the Of-fice of the Insurance Commissioner (Commissioner). The 1993 legislation was codified in RCW chapters 48.31B - Insurer Holding Company Act, and 48.31C -Holding Company Act for Hea lth Care Service Contrac- tors and Health Main tenance Organizations. NAIC updated the model in surance holding company system regulatory act. The updated act will become partof NAIC accreditation standard s starting January 1, 2016. If Washington fails to adopt th is act into state law, OIC will lose accreditation in 2016. The model act: (1) allows new disclosure regarding ente rprise risk and supervisory colleges; (2) updates the pr ovisions for acquisitions, di- vestitures, and examinations ; (3) updates intercompany agreement requirements between insurers and their affili-Senate 48 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred)Senate 47 1 House 89 8SB 5717 250ates; and (4) updates confiden tiality provisions of holding company filings and information. Summary: The provisions of the Insurer Holding Com- pany Act are amended to adopt the NAIC model act. Subsidiaries . A domestic insurer, alone or in cooper- ation with one or more persons, may organize or acquireone or more subsidiaries, which may conduct any kind ofbusiness. The acquisition of su bsidiaries is also subject to certain percentage and investment limitations. Acquisition of, Control of, or Merger with Domestic Insurer .

The re-quired statement must includ e certain information and an agreement that it will provid e an annual report regarding risk and an acknow ledgement that the person and all sub- sidiaries within its control wi ll provide information to the Commissioner upon request as necessary to evaluate en-terprise risk to the insurer. The Commissioner must approve a merger or acquisi- tion unless after a public hear ing the Commissioner deter- mines that the resulting change of control would cause the domestic insurer to fail to meet the necessary standards. Time periods for the public h earing, notice, and the deter- mination are provided. If the proposed acquisition of con- trol will require the approval of more than oneCommissioner, the public hearing may be held on a con-solidated basis upon request. If the Commissioner determines that the person ac- quiring control of the insurer must maintain or restore thecapital of the insurer to the le vel required by rule and law, the Commissioner must make su ch determination no later than 60 days after the date of the notification of change in control. Divestiture . A controlling person of a domestic insur- er seeking to divest its controlling interest must file withthe Commissioner a confidentia l notice of its proposed di- vesture at least 30 days prio r to ceasing control. A copy must be provided to the insu red. The Commissioner deter- mines whether approval for the transaction is required. Registration of Insurers .

Transactions Within In surance Holding Company . Transactions within an insu rance holding company system must be fair and reasonable. Agreements for cost-sharingservices and management must include provisions as re-quired by rule. Some transac tions may not be entered into unless the insurer notifies the Commissioner in writing ofits intention to enter into the transaction. An insurer's officers and directors are not relieved of any obligation or liability app licable under law despite thecontrol of the insurer by any person. The insurer must be managed to assure its separa te operating identity. Re- quirements are provided regarding non-officer/employeeboard members and committees. Examination of Insurers . The Commissioner's power to examine an insurer or its af filiates is expanded to allow the Commissioner to ascerta in the financial condition of the insurer, including the ente rprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate controlling party, by any entity or combina- tion of entities within the in surance holding company sys- tem, or by the insurance ho lding company system. The Commissioner may order any registered insurer to pro-duce information not in the possession of the insurer if theinsurer can obtain access through certain methods. Delaysin compliance may result in $1 0,000 daily fines, and sus- pension or license revocation. Fines are deposited into the general fund. If it appears that any person has committeda violation which prevents th e full understanding of the enterprise risk to the insurer by affiliates or by the insur- ance holding compan y system, the violation may serve as an independent basis for disapproving dividends or distri-butions and for placing the insu rer under an order of super- vision.

By Senate Committee on High er Education (originally sponsored by Senators and Frockt). Senate Committee on Higher Education House Committee on Higher Education Background: Overview of Federal Law . The handling of sexual assaults on college and university campuses is gov-erned by procedural guidelines under Title IX of the edu-cation amendments of 1972. The Jeanne Clery Disclosureof Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act) and the Violence Against Women Act(V AWA) also require institutio ns to develop reporting pro- tocols and disciplinary procedures for handling sexual vi-olence incidents. Institutions of higher educa tion are required to devel- op their own student conduct, disciplinary, and reporting requirements. Washington State does not have non-criminal statuto- ry requirements for the ha ndling of student-on-student sexual assaults. Public institu tions of higher education each have student codes of conduct codified in the Wash-ington Administrative Code. Title IX . Every college and university that accepts federal funds must comp ly with Title IX. Title IX has been interpreted by the United States Su- preme Court and the United States Department of Educa-tion to require educationa l institutions to maintain policies, practices and progra ms that do not discriminate against anyone based on sex. A school violates a student's rights under Title IX re- garding student-on-student se xual violence when: (1) the alleged conduct is serious enough to limit or deny a stu-dent's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's educational program; and, (2) the school, upon notice, fails to take prompt and effective steps reasonably calcu-lated to end the sexual violence, prevent its recurrence,and as appropriate, remedy its effects. The Department of Educa tion requires institutions to investigate incidence of sexual violence and have griev-ance procedures in place for resolving student and em-ployee complaints of sexual discrimination. Colleges and universities must develop sexual violence procedures thatat the least, include the following: notice to students and employees of grievance proce- dures, including where complaints may be filed; application of grievanc e procedures to complaints filed by students or on their behalf; provisions for reliable and impartial investigation of complaints, including the o pportunity for both the complainant and alleged pe rpetrator to present wit- nesses and evidence; designated and reasonably prompt timeframes for the major stages of the complaint process; notice to the complainan t and alleged perpetrator of the outcome of the complaint; and assurance that the schoo l will take steps to prevent recurrence of any sexual violence and remedy dis-criminatory effects on the complainant and others. Institutions can lose federa l funds for violating the re- quirements of Title IX. Clery Act . The Clery Act requires institutions of high- er education to record and disclose information about campus crimes to the U.S. De partment of Education. An institution may be fined up to $35,000 per violation or maylose financial aid, if it violat es the Clery Act reporting re- quirements. Violence Against Women Act . V AWA was reautho- rized in 2013, amending the Clery Act. The V AWA reau- thorization added new sexual violence offenses to Clery reporting requirements includ ing sexual offenses, domes- tic violence, dating violence, and stalking. The reauthori-zation requires institutions to develop a statement of policy describing programs to prevent sexual violence andeducation programs to promote awareness. The reauthori-zation also requires institutions to develop a statement ofpolicy regarding procedures for responding to a sexual vi-olence complaint. Summary: A task force on campus sexual violence pre- vention is created. The task force must include the follow- ing: one representative from the Washington Student Achievement Council; one representative from the State Board for Commu- nity and Technical Colleges; one representative from the Council of Presidents; one representative from the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs; one representative from the independen t colleges of Washington; one representative fro m the nonprofit community who is an advocate for sexual assault victims, selected by the task force chairs from a pool of candi- dates; one representative from the Washington State Attor- ney General's Office; one representative from the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys; and the Title IX coordinator or their designee - a repre- sentative with expertise in Title IX and sexual vio- lence prevention, from each of the four-year institutions.SSB 5721 252The task force must: develop a set of best practices that institutions of higher education may employ to promote the aware- ness of campus sexual vi olence, reduce the occur- rence of campus sexual viol ence, and enhance student safety; develop recommendations for improving institutional campus sexual violence policies and procedures; develop recommendations for improving collabora- tion amongst inst itutions and law enforcement; and report to the Legislature and the institutions of higher education on its goals and recommendations annu- ally.

By Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Educa- tion (originally sponsored by Senators Billig, Dammeier and Jayapal). Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education House Committee on Education Background: The 2014 Legislature defined expanded learning opportunities (ELOs) as school-based programsor community-based programs provided in partnershipwith schools that provide extended learning and enrich-ment for students beyond th e traditional school day, week, or calendar. Additionally an ELO Council was established to advise the Governor, the Legislature, and the Superin-tendent of Public Instructio n (SPI) on a comprehensive ELO system. Members of the Council must have experi- ence with ELOs and include groups and agencies repre-senting diverse student interests and geographicallocations across the state. The Council may include up to 15 individuals. Representatives from 13 different agen-cies, organizations, and higher education are specified. The Council met six times an d submitted its first an- nual report in 2014. The re port provides the following: the vision and mission statements of the Council; the Washington State Quality Standards for After- school and Youth Development adopted for use with state expanded learning programs; the initial components for a statewide ELO frame- work; a work plan to furthe r define each component; and an action plan and funding model for a pilot program to reduce summer learning loss through the use of state funds for additional st udent learning days in ele- mentary schools with significant populations of low-income students. Summary: The ELO Council member ship is expanded to include a person selected by the Office of the Superinten-dent of Public Instruction to represent low-income com- munities or communities of colo r; a person selected by the Educational Opportunity Gap Oversight and Accountabil-ity Committee; and a represen tative of the statewide asso- ciation of public libraries.

By Senate Committee on Agri culture, Water & Rural Eco- nomic Development (originally sponsored by SenatorsWarnick, Hatfield and Hobbs; by request of Department ofAgriculture). Senate Committee on Agriculture, Water & Rural Eco- nomic Development House Committee on Agricultu re & Natural Resources Background: The Washington State Department of Agri- culture (WSDA) has authorit y to adopt administrative rules concerning many matters involving the identification and movement of cattle, including dairy and beef cattle,and horses. Some of this rulemaking authority includes the following: designation of mandator y inspection points for cattle and horses or for furnishing proof that the cattle or horses have been inspected or identified and are being lawfully transported; issuance of individual ho rse and cattle identification certificates; and determination of what constitutes satisfactory proof of ownership. Dairy cattle have a system enacted in 2013, of official individual identification tags , called green tags, that the producer places before the firs t point of sale on bull calves and free-martins - infertile fe male calves - under 30 days of age. WSDA's fees under th is program, except for theSenate 48 0 House 95 2 (House amended)Senate 47 0 (Senate concurred)Senate 47 0 House 70 27 (House amended)Senate (Senate refused to concur)House 87 10 (House amended)Senate 45 2 (Senate concurred)SSB 5740 253beef commission assessment, must be deposited into the animal disease tracea bility account. The Animal Disease Traceability (ADT) program was enacted in 2011. It authorizes WSDA to adopt rules thatrequire the certificate of veteri narian inspection, health pa- pers, permits, or other transportation documents to providea physical address and a time line as to when the animals will be transported directly to that address. Unless exempt by WSDA, it is unlawful to tr ansfer an animal to a location other than the address desi gnated on the transportation documents. Fee authority allows WSDA to charge various amounts to be used to carry out animal disease traceability activities for cattle and to compensate data and fee collec-tion costs. The fee must be paid by all cattle sellers in Washington, the owners of cattle slaughtered in the state,and, unless exempt by WSDA in rule, the owners of cattle exported alive from Washingt on. If a livestock inspection occurs, the fee must be collected in the same manner aslivestock inspection fees. The fee for slaughtered cattle must be collected by the meat processor. WSDA has authority under the ADT program to charge time and mileage for it s inspection of animals and investigations of po ssible violations in order to cover its costs. The fee has an upper limitation of $85 per hour plusmileage at the rate set by th e Office of Financial Manage- ment. There is currently a Washington Administrative Code section that requires all cattle to be inspected for brands or other proof of ownership at any point of private sale, trade,gifting, barter, or any other action that constitutes a changeof ownership, except for individual private sales of un-branded female dairy breed cattle involving 15 head orless. Summary: As an alternative to the mandatory inspection required for cattle, an optiona l electronic livestock trans- action reporting system is established. Use of the system requires a license. Application for the license is made to WSDA , which must include a fee as established by rule. Accurate records of all cattle transac- tions of the licensed property must be kept for three years and made available for inspec tion, upon request, during normal business hours. Provisions are made for WSDA to enter a property at any reasonable time to examin e and inspect cattle and re- cords for purposes of movement verification. Sufficient grounds are stated for WSDA to deny, suspend, or revokea license. If that occurs, th e mandatory lives tock inspec- tion requirements apply. Rulemaking authority is provided, including to set fees, as closely as practicable, to cover the cost of devel-opment, maintenance, fee coll ection, audit, and adminis- trative oversight. Adds that the reporting of each transaction to WSDA must be completed within 24 hours of the transaction.Adds a requirement for WSDA to make annual reports to the Legislature to document , in specified detail, its im- plementation of the system. Re ports are due by July 31, beginning in 2015.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5740 C 240 L 15 Concerning extended foster care services. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Early Le arning & Human Services House Committee on Appropriations Background: In 2008 the Fostering Connections to Suc- cess and Increasing Adoptions Act was signed into federallaw. Among its many provisions, the Fostering Connec-tions legislation created a pathway for states to use TitleIV-E funds, or foster care funding, to extend foster careservices to youth ages 19-21 if the youth engages in cer-tain qualifying activities. In 2011 the Legislature established the Extended Fos- ter Care program in Washingt on. Currently a youth age 19-21 is eligible fo r extended foster care services if the youth: is participating in or completing a secondary educa- tion program or a secondary education equivalency program; is enrolled, or has applied for and demonstrates intent to enroll in a postsecondary academic or postsecond- ary vocational program; has as an open dependency case at age 18 and is par- ticipating in a program or activity designed to pro- mote employment or remove barriers to employment; or engages in employment for 80 or more hours per month, within amounts spec ifically appropriated for this purpose.Extended foster care services may include, but are not limited to, foster care placem ent or placement in a super- vised independent living settin g, medical or dental ser- vices, transitional living se rvices, case management, and assistance meeting basic needs. The court must dismiss dependency cases of foster care youth who turn 18 years of age if they are not partic-Senate 48 1 House 90 7 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred)ESSB 5743 254ipating in one of the qualifying activities. Youth whose dependency cases were dismissed at age 18 or after mayrequest extended foster care services through a V oluntary Placement Agreement (VPA) if they request services be- fore turning 19 years of age. A youth may enter into aVPA only once but may trans ition among eligibility cate- gories, so long as the youth remains eligible during the transition. When the youth is at least 17 years of age but not older than 17 years and six months, the Department ofSocial and Health Services (DSHS) must provide theyouth with written documentation explaining the avail-ability of extended foster care services and detailing in-structions about how to access those services after theyreach age 18. DSHS is relieved of any supervisory dutiesover a youth who is age 18 but has not requested extendedfoster care services. While a youth receives extended fos- ter care services, the youth is under the care and placementauthority of DSHS. Summary: The eligibility for extended foster care ser- vices is expanded to include youth who are not able to en- gage in any of the activities that would make him or her eligible due to a documented medical condition. The lan- guage \"within amounts appropri ated specifically for this purpose\" is removed for purp oses of extended foster care eligibility when a youth is en gaged in employment for 80 or more hours per month. Medical condition is define d to mean a physical or mental health condition as documented by any licensedhealth care provider. The DSHS must make efforts to ensure that extended foster care providers maxi mize Medicaid reimbursement. This must include ensuring that extended foster carehealth and mental health providers participate in Medic-aid. For youth aging out of foster care, the Children's Ad- ministration (CA) must invite representatives from the Di- vision of Behavioral Health and Recovery, the DisabilityServices Administration, the Economic Services Adminis- tration, and the Juvenile Ju stice and Rehabilitation Ad- ministration to the youth's shared planning meeting thatoccurs between age 17 and 17.5 years old that is used todevelop a transition plan.

By Senators Benton and Mullet.Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance House Committee on Business & Financial Services Background: Credit unions doing business in Washing- ton may be chartered by the state or federal government.The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) regu-lates federally chartered credit unions. The Department ofFinancial Institutions (Departm ent) regulates state-char- tered credit unions.Credit Union Governance and Practices . Board of Directors and Supervisory Committee. State-chartered credit unions are governed by a board of directors and a supervisory committee, which monitors the financial c ondition of the credit union and the decisions of the board. Per state law, some duties may be delegated to a committee, officer, or employee with appropriate reporting to the board.Other duties may not be delegated. Director and Superviso ry Committee Compensation. A credit union may pay its directors and supervisorycommittee members reasonable compensation and may also provide them with gifts of minimal value, insurance coverage or incidental services, and reim-bursement for reasonable expenses. Dividends. Dividends may be declared from the credit union's earning after the deduction of expenses,interest on deposits, and the amounts required for reserves, or may be paid from undivided earnings that remain from preceding periods.

Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5760 C 73 L 15 Concerning contracts for ma terials or work required by joint operating agencies. By Senators Brown, Sheldon, Keiser and Dansel.Senate Committee on Energy , Environment & Telecom- munications House Committee on Technol ogy & Economic Develop- ment Background: A joint operating agency is formed by two or more cities or public utility districts for the purpose ofacquiring, constructing, oper ating, and owning facilities for the generation and transmission, or both, of electric en-ergy and power. Purchases made by a joint operating agency in excess of $10,000 for materials, equipment, supplies, and con-struction of generating proj ects and associated facilities, generally must be made by a sealed bid process, with ex-ceptions provided. A competitive negotiation process may be avoided if a contractor has defaulted or if technical knowledge orspecific time limits are needed to achieve economical op- eration of the project. In this process, a request for propos-als stating the requirements to be met is issued, after which proposals are received. Negot iations are conducted in an effort to obtain the best and final offers of finalists. A fixed price or cost-reimbursable contract is awarded to the bidder whose proposal is the most advantageous in terms of the requirements set forth. Purchases in excess of $5,000 but less than $75,000 may be made through a telephone or written quotation pro-cess. Quotations are received from at least five vendors, where practical, and awards are made to the lowest respon- sible bidder. In this process, the agency maintains a pro-curement roster of suppliers and manufacturers who maysupply materials or equipment to the operating agency for the purpose of soliciting quotations. Bid opportunitiesmust be equitably distributed among those on the roster. When it is determin ed that competitio n is not available or is impracticable, such as for replacement parts in sup-port of specialized equipment, purchases may be madewithout competition. Purc hases of any amount may be made without bidding in certain emergency conditions when it is determined that pub lic safety, property damage, or serious financial injury would result if the purchasecould not be obtained by a certain time through the sealed bid process. Summary: The minimum dollar value of a purchase of materials, equipment, or supplies that must be made through a sealed bid process is changed from $10,000 to$15,000 - exclusive of sales tax. The minimum dollar val-ue of work ordered for construction of generating projectsand associated facilities that must be made through a sealed bid process is change d from $10,000 to $25,000 - exclusive of sales tax.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESB 5761 C 9 L 15 Providing for property tax exemption for the value of new construction of industrial/man ufacturing facilities in tar- geted urban areas. By Senators Pearson, Hobbs, McCoy, Bailey and Benton. Senate Committee on Trade & Economic Development Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Technology & Economic Develop- ment House Committee on Finance Background: All real and personal property is subject to property tax each year based on its value, unless a specificexemption is provided by la w. Property tax exemptions authorized for multi-unit hous ing facilities in 1995 were established to increase reside ntial housing and encourage affordable housing opportunitie s within urban areas plan- ning under the Growth Management Act (GMA). Themulti-unit housing property ta x exemption provides ex- emptions for qualified proper ties from 8 to 12 years. GMA is the comprehensive land use planning frameworkfor counties and cities in Wash ington. Originally enacted in 1990 and 1991, GMA establishes land use designationand environmental protection requirements for all Wash- ington counties and cities. Summary: The value of new construction of industrial or manufacturing facilities that me et certain requirements is exempt from local property taxation for ten years. Toqualify, an application for a certificate of tax exemption must be submitted to the gove rning authority before De- cember 31, 2022, and must meet a minimum size of10,000 square feet, an improvement value of at least$800,000 and create at least 25 family wage jobs. Cities with lands zoned for industri al and manufacturing uses as of December 31, 2014, may es tablish targeted areas within or contiguous to an innovation partnership zone, foreigntrade zone, or EB-5 regional center. Qualifying cities musthave a population of at least 18,000 and be located eitherSenate 43 3 House 97 0 Senate 49 0 House 92 5SB 5768 257north or east of the largest city in a county with a popula- tion between 700,000 and 800,000. Currently, the cities ofArlington, Marysville, and La ke Stevens in Snohomish County qualify. The governin g authority must hold public hearings to designate targeted areas. The facility construc- tion must meet all construc tion and develo pment regula- tions of the governing author ity, and be complete within three years from the date of approval of the application. The governing authority may establish an application fee and must develop an appli cation form that collects in- formation, including a descri ption of the project and the expected number of new family wage jobs to be created.To receive the exemption, upon completion of the new construction of a manufacturing or industrial facility, theowner must provide the gove rning authority with a de- scription of the completed work, the number of new familyliving wage jobs to be offere d, and a statement that the work was completed within th ree years of the issuance of the conditional certificate of tax exemption. The govern- ing authority must determine if the work completed and jobs created qualify the project for an exemption, or if the application is denied. The governing authority must ap- prove or deny an application within 90 days of receipt of the application. If the appli cation is approved, the govern- ing authority must issue the property owner a conditional certificate of acceptance of a tax exemption. Applicantsthat have an application denied may appeal to the govern-ing authority within 30 days after receipt of the denial. The exemption does not apply to the state school levy, and the exemption does not apply to any county property taxes unless the governing body of the county authorizes the property to be exempt from county property taxes. Each owner receiving a tax exemption must report an- nually to the governing auth ority granting the exemption. All governing authorities that issue tax exemptions must report annually to the Department of Commerce on thenumber of tax exemptions granted, the number and type ofnew manufacturing or industrial facilities constructed, thenumber of new family wage jobs, and the value of each taxexemption. If a portion of th e property is changed or will be changed to disqualify an owner from receiving a tax ex-emption, the exemption must be canceled, and the tax on the value of the non-qualify ing improvements, a 20 per- cent penalty, and any interest mu st be paid. The additional tax, penalty, and interest beco me a lien on the property un- til paid. Votes on Final Passage: First Special Session Effective: August 27, 2015SB 5768 C 95 L 15 Concerning county electronic public auctions. By Senators Cleveland, Benton, Honeyford and Fraser.Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on Local Government Background: Surplus County Property . Counties may conduct public auctions to sell county property and real and personal property in tax foreclosure proceedings. Pri- or to selling county property , the board of county commis- sioners decides whether real or personal property ownedby the county is surplus to th e needs of the county. Notice and a public hearing regarding the intended sale are re-quired in most circumstances. Written findings and a de-cision regarding whether to sell surplus property must beincluded in the commissioners ' meeting minutes following the public hearing. When the sale of county prop erty has been authorized, it may be sold at a public auction, a privately-operatedconsignment auction that is open to the public, or by sealed bid. The proceeds of the sale of county propertymust be paid to the county tr easurer, except that the pro- ceeds of the sale of used equi pment must be credited to the fund used to originally purc hase the equipment. Counties may establish comprehensive procedures for the manage- ment of county property that includes the sale of surplus county property. Tax Foreclosure Sales . When real property taxes be- come three years delinquent, the county treasurer must filea certificate of delinquency with the county's superior court for all years' taxes, interest, and costs. A certificateof delinquency establishes that the property was subject toproperty tax, the property wa s assessed as required by law, and that the taxes or assessments were not paid at any timebefore the issuance of the certificate. All parties with re-corded interest receive a no tice and summons by certified mail. Notification is also pu blished in a local newspaper. The county treasurer receiv es a tax judgment and or- der of sale from the court forecl osing on the tax lien, which authorizes the sale of the parcel. Parcels included in thetax foreclosure process can be redeemed by the owner or paid by any party with a reco rded interest until the close of business on the day before the sale. A tax foreclosure salemust be made to the highest bidder at a public auction.The minimum bid is set on behalf of the county at the totalamount of taxes due, includin g interest and penalties. The highest successful bidder must pay the amount of taxesowed and the county refund s the excess to the recorded owner of the property. The treasurer is also authoriz ed to sell, at a public auc- tion, personal property which has been obtained for failureto pay personal property taxes. Personal property may in-clude standing timber and mobile homes. Washington law does not ex plicitly authorize counties to conduct tax foreclosure au ctions over the Internet.Senate 48 0 Senate 47 0 House 74 18ESSB 5785 258Summary: A county may conduct a public auction sale by electronic media (electronic auction) via the Internet tosell county property or private property in real or personal property tax foreclosure proceedings. The treasurer mustpublish and post notice of the electronic auction. Invita- tions and bids are submitted th rough an electronic device, including a computer. In an electronic auction, the countytreasurer may: require participants to provide a deposit; accept bids for as long as deemed necessary; and require electronic funds transfers to pay any deposits and winning bids. A deposit from a winning bidder must be applied to the balance due. If the winning bidder does not follow theterms of sale, the deposit is forfeited and credited to the treasurer's operations and main tenance fund. Deposits for nonwinning bids must be refunded within ten businessdays. All property sold is offered and sold as-is. The trea- surer is not liable for conditions of the property, includingbut not limited to errors in the assessor's records. Nor is the treasurer liable for failure of a device not owned, oper- ated, and managed by the county that prevents a personfrom participating in any sale. A statutory provision related to taxes owed in 1926 is stricken.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESSB 5785 FULL VETO Revising the definition of official duties of state officers. By Senate Committee on Government Operations & Secu- rity (originally sponsored by Senators Rivers, Nelson, Dansel, Hatfield, Pearson, Fain, Liias and Hobbs). Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on State Government Background: In 1994 the Legislature enacted the Ethics in Public Service Act (Ethics Act), establishing new andrevised ethics rules, consolidating them in a single RCWchapter, and applying the new chapter to all state officialsand employees of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government. The Ethics Act created theExecutive Ethics Board and Legislative Ethics Board andexpanded the authority of th e Commission on Judicial Conduct. Each of these ethics boards have broad powersto enforce the Ethics Act, an d may investigate and initiate complaints regarding the cond uct of state government em- ployees. Each of these ethics board's activities fall under four broad categories: (1) providing training and educationalmaterials; (2) issuing rules or policies limiting conduct in specified circumstances; (3) issuing advisory opinions; and (4) investigating, hear ing, and determining com- plaints. Generally, a state officer or state employee may not do any of the following in conflict with the proper dischargeof official duties: have a direct or indirect interest, financial or other- wise; engage in a business, transaction, or professional activity; or incur an obligation of any nature. Limitations are also placed on gifts of a non-influen- tial nature. The Ethics Act defines \"official duty\" as a dutywithin the specific scope of em ployment of the state offi- cer or state employee as defined by the officer's or employ-ee's agency or by statute or the state Constitution. State officer generally refers to elected state officials, including the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary ofState, Treasurer, Auditor, Attorney General, Superinten- dent of Public Instruction, Commissioner of Public Lands, and Insurance Commissioner. In the Ethics Act, \"state of- ficer\" means every person ho lding a position of public trust in or under an executive, legislative, or judicial office of the state. This definition includes: Superior Court judg-es; Court of Appeals judges; Supreme Court Justices;members of the Legislature; the Secretary of the Senateand the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives; theGovernor; the Lieutenant Governor; the Secretary of State,the state Treasurer, the state Auditor, the Superintendent ofPublic Instruction, and Insu rance Commissioner; the At- torney General; the Commission er of Public Lands; chief executive officers of state agencies; members of boards,commissions, or committees w ith authority over one or more state agencies or instit utions; and employees of the state who are engaged in supervisory, policymaking, orpolicy-enforcing work. In the Ethics Act, state officer also includes any person exercising or undertaking to exercisethe powers or functions of a state officer. Summary: The definition of \"official duty\" for a state of- ficer holding an elective office is amended to mean those duties prescribed in the state Constitution, state statutes, oragency rules, legislatively funded or mandated authorityand responsibilities, activities described in an agency's publicly released strategic plan or similar document, andtasks or actions directly relate d to carrying out the state of- ficer's other official duties.Votes on Final Passage: Senate 46 3 House 97 0 Senate 45 3 House 67 30 (House amended)Senate 46 1 (Senate concurred)SB 5793 259Effective: VETO MESSAGE ON ESSB 5785 May 18, 2015 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, with out my approval, Engrossed Sub- stitute Senate Bill No. 5785 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to the definitio n of official duties of state officers.\" This bill changes defin ition of official duty for a state officer holding an elective of fice in the state Ethics Act. The definition is expanded to mean not only those dut ies prescribed in the state Constitution, state statutes or age ncy rules, legisl atively funded or mandated authority and resp onsibilities, but also any activities de- scribed in an agency's strategic plan and tasks or action directly related to carrying out the stat e officer's othe r official duties. I believe this is an unnecessary change to th e Ethics Act. First, this legislation creates a differen t standard of ethics for elected of- ficials. While they have different roles, I believe all public employ- ees should be held to the same rules. Moreover, elected officials - as head of agencies - already define much of their job duties. There is no need to create an expanded de finition of official duty. By do- ing so, we unnecessarily risk endangering the public's trust. For these reasons I have vetoed Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5785 in its entirety. Respectfully submitted, Jay Inslee Governor SB 5793 C 124 L 15 Providing credit towards child support obligations for vet- erans benefits. By Senators Darneille, Conway and O'Ban.Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Judiciary Background: Veterans Administration (V A) benefits generally may not be garnished. However, federal statutesand regulations allow for the apportionment of V A bene- fits to provide spouses and de pendents with financial sup- port under some circumstances. The V A may apportion aveteran's pension or compensatio n benefits to the veteran's dependent children if the vetera n is not paying a child sup- port obligation. An appor tionment will generally not be made if it would cause undue hardship to the veteran. The Washington child sup port enforcement statutes provide that when the Social Security Administration pays disability dependency benefits , retirement bene fits, or sur- vivor's benefits on behalf of a child of a disabled, retired,or deceased person, those benefits must be credited towardthe parent's child support ob ligations for the period for which benefits are paid. A si milar provision gives a credit to the parent when worker's compensation benefits are paid by the Department of Labor and Industries on behalfof or on account of the parent's children. Currently the Di- vision of Child Support is no t authorized to grant credit to an obligor parent for the amounts of the parent's V A bene-fits that are apportioned by the V A on behalf of the parent'sdependent children. Summary: V A benefits that are apportioned to pay child support on behalf of a veteran's child must be credited tothe satisfaction of th e veteran's child support obligation for the period for which benefits are paid.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5795 C 96 L 15 Authorizing municipalities to create asses sment reim- bursement areas for the cons truction or improvement of water or sewer facilities. By Senate Committee on Gove rnment Operations & Secu- rity (originally sponsored by Senators Roach and Liias). Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on Local Government Background: Contract for Water or Sewer Facilities . The governing body of any county, city, town, or drainage dis-trict (municipality) may contract with the owners of realestate for the construction of certain water or sewer facili-ties to connect with public water or sewer systems and serve the affected real estate. At the owner's request, amunicipality must contract with the owner for the con-struction or improvement of water or sewer facilities thatthe owner elects to install at their own expense. An own- er's request may only require a contract in certain loca-tions, including the following: where a municipality's ordinances require the facili- ties to be improved or cons tructed as a prerequisite to further property development; locations where the proposed improvement or con- struction will be consiste nt with the comprehensive plans and development regu lations of the municipali- ties through which the facili ties will be constructed or will serve; and within the municipality's corporate limits or within ten miles of the municipality's corporate limits. Additionally, the owner must submit a request for a contract to the municipality prior to approval of the wateror sewer facility by the muni cipality. The contracts must be filed and recorded with the county auditor and must contain conditions required by the municipality in accor- dance with its adopted policies and standards. Unless the municipality notifies the owner of its intent to request a comprehensive plan approval, the owner must Senate 49 0House 97 0SSB 5795 260request a comprehensive plan approval for the water or sewer facility, if required. Co nnection of the water or sew- er facility to the municipa l system must be conditioned upon specified requirements: construction of the water or sewer facility according to plans and specifications approved by the munici- pality; inspection and approval of the water or sewer facility by the municipality; and payment by the owner to the municipality of all of the municipality's costs associated with the water orsewer facility including, but not limited to, engineer- ing, legal, and administrative costs. Contracts between municipalities and real estate own- ers must provide for the pro rata reimbursement to the owner or the owner's assigns for 20 or more years. The re-imbursements must: be within the contract's effective period; be for a portion of the costs of the water or sewer facilities improved or constr ucted in accordance with the contract; and be from latecomer fees received by the municipality from property owners who subsequently connect to or use the water or sewer facilities, but who did not con- tribute to the original cost of the facilities.Unless provided otherwise by ordinance or contract, municipalities that participate in the financing of water orsewer facilities improved thro ugh the contractually-based process are entitled to a pro ra ta share of the reimburse- ment based on the respective contribution of the ownerand the municipality. Muni cipalities seeking reimburse- ments are also entitled to collect fees that are reasonableand proportionate to expenses incurred in complying with contracts with real estate owners for the construction orimprovement of water or sewer facilities. Within 120 days of the completion of a water or sewer facility, the owners of the real estate must submit the total cost of the water or sewer facility to the applicable munic-ipality. This information must be used by the municipality as the basis for determining re imbursements by future us- ers who benefit from the wate r or sewer facility, but who did not contribute to the original cost of the water or sewerfacility. The provisions governing contracts with real estate owners for the construction or improvement of water orsewer facilities do not create a private right of action fordamages against a municipality for failing to comply with specified requirements. A municipality or its officials,employees, or agents may not be held liable for failure tocollect a latecomer fee unless the failure was willful or in-tentional. Failure to comply with requirements for con- tracts with real estate owners for the construction orimprovement of water or sewe r facilities does not relieve a municipality of future compliance requirements.Assessment Reimbursemen t Areas-Street Projects . For road or street improvements, counties, cities, andtowns are currently authorized to create assessment reim-bursement areas without the participation of propertyowners, finance the costs of improvements, and becomethe sole beneficiary of reim bursements for the project. The assessment is formulated by the county, city, or townbased on a determination of wh ich parcels adjacent to the improvements would require similar street improvementsupon development. Reimbursements are a pro rata shareof the construction and admini stration costs of the project, and the share of each property owner is determined usinga method of cost apportionment based on benefits to theproperty owner. Summary: As an alternative to the statutory procedures described above for financing the construction or im-provement of water or sewer facilities, municipalities may create an assessment reimbursement area on their own ini-tiative without the participatio n of a private property own- er. Following the creation of an assessmentreimbursement area, the muni cipality may finance all of the costs associated with th e construction or improvement and become the sole benefici ary of reimbursements. A municipality may only esta blish an assessment reimburse- ment area in locations wher e a municipality' s ordinances require water or sewer facilities to be improved or con-structed as a prerequisite to further property developmentor redevelopment. To create an assessment reimbursement area, a munic- ipality must: define the boundaries of the area based upon a deter- mination of which parcels in the proposed area would require construction or improvement of water or sewer facilities upon develo pment or redevelopment, or would be allowed connection to or usage of con- structed or improved water or sewer facilities; send by certified mail a preliminary determination of the assessment reimbursement area boundaries and assessments, along with a description of property owners' rights and options, to each owner of record ofreal property within the proposed assessment reim- bursement area; and record the final determination of the assessment reim- bursement area boundaries and assessments with the county auditor. Within 20 days of the pr eliminary determination's mailing, property owners within the proposed area maysubmit a written request for a public hearing. If it is sub-mitted, the municipality must ho ld a public hearing on the assessment reimbursement area. Notice of the hearing must be provided to all affected property owners. Any rul-ings of the legislative authority of the municipality are de-terminative and final, but subject to judicial review. A municipality may be reimbursed only for the costs associated with construction or improvements of facilitiesESSB 5803 261that benefit property that w ill connect to or use the water or sewer facilities within th e assessment reimbursement area. Reimbursement may only occur when a property is developed or redeveloped in a manner requiring connec- tion to or use of the water or sewer facilities, or when a property is requesting connection to or use of the water orsewer facilities. The reimbu rsement may be no greater than a property's pro rata sh are of costs associated with construction of the water or sewer facilities required tomeet utility service and fire su ppression standards. The re- imbursement share for each property owner must be basedon the benefit to the property owner from the project. The municipality's administrative and legal costs are not sub-ject to reimbursement. A mu nicipality may not receive re- imbursement of costs for th e portion of construction or improvements that benefit the general public, which is the portion of the water or sewer facilities that only benefitproperty outside of the asse ssment reimbursement area. Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESSB 5803 C 125 L 15 Concerning the notification of parents when their children are below basic on the third grade statewide English lan-guage arts assessment. By Senate Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Educa- tion (originally sponsored by Senators Dammeier, McAu-liffe and Keiser). Senate Committee on Early L earning & K-12 Education House Committee on Education Background: In 2013 the Legislature created a process for school districts to follow wh en a student in third grade scores below basic on the statewide English language arts(ELA) assessment. Below basic means level one in a four-level scoring system. The pr ocess requires a meeting with the student's parent or guardian, teacher, and the school'sprincipal before the end of th e school year to discuss ap- propriate grade placement and recommended strategies toimprove the student's reading sk ills. For the student to be placed in the fourth grade, th e strategies discussed must in- clude a summer program or other options identified by theparents, teacher, and principal to prepare the student forfourth grade. School districts must obtain the parent's orguardian's consent regarding the grade placement and im-provement strategy that mu st be implemented by the school district. Summary: The process addressing third-grade students reading below grade level is changed. The meeting re-quired with the student's parent or guardian, teacher, andthe school's principal before the end of the school year iseliminated. Instead, prior to th e return of the results of the statewide student assessment in ELA, elementary schools must require meetings between teachers and parents ofstudents in third grade who are reading below grade level or who, based on formative or diagnostic assessments and other indicators, are likely to score in the be low-basic level on the assessment. At the me eting, the teacher must in- form the parents of the reading improvement strategiesthat are available for the stud ent before fourth grade and the district's grade placement policy for the following year. Schools that have regularly scheduled parent teacher con-ferences may use those confer ences to comply with the meeting requirement. For stud ents to be placed in fourth grade, the strategies provided by the school district must include a summer program or other options to meet theneeds of the student.

By Senate Committee on Government Operations & Secu- rity (originally sponsored by Senators Roach, Liias andChase; by request of Office of Financial Management). Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on State Government Background: Digital Signatures . Digital signature en- cryption systems are used to both protect the confidential- ity of an electronic document and authenticate its source.These systems operate on the basis of two digital keys, orcodes, created by the person desiring to send encrypted messages. One key is the private key, which is knownonly to the signer of the el ectronic message, and the other is the signer's public key, which is given to individualswith whom the sender wishes to exchange the confidentialor authenticated message. The public key is used to verifyboth that the message was sign ed by the person holding the private key and that the message itself was not alteredduring its transmission. To verify the ownership of public keys, each public key is provided with a computer-based certificate of au-thenticity. These certificates are created by certificationauthorities, which guarantee th at the public keys they cer- tify belong to the people possessing the corresponding pri-vate keys. Washington Electronic Authentication Act . On Janu- ary 1, 1998, the Washington Electronic Authentication Act became effective, allowing th e use of digital signature technology in electronic transactions and creating a pro-cess for licensing certification authorities. Summary: Use of Electronic Signatures by State Agen- cies. Unless otherwise provided by law or agency rule, state agencies may accept el ectronic signatures with the same force and effect as that of a signature affixed by hand. Each state agency may determine whether and towhat extent it will create, generate, communicate, store, process, use, and rely upon electronic records and elec-tronic signatures. A state agen cy is not required to send or accept electronic records or electronic signatures for anagency transaction. The state Chief Information Officer (CIO) must estab- lish standards, policies, or gu idance for electronic submis- sions and signatures. The CIO's standards, policies, orguidance must take into account reasonable access and re-liability for persons participa ting in governmental affairs and transactions. A state agency's policy or rule on elec-tronic submissions and signatur es must be consistent with policies established by the CIO. The CIO must establish awebsite that maintains, or lin ks to, an agency's rules and policies for electronic records and signatures. Miscellaneous Provisions. The requirement to sign an application for a chiropractic or dentistry license by hand is removed. A ballot measure sponsor may submit an af-fidavit to the Secretary of State by electronic means indi-cating that the sponsor is a registered voter. The statuteallowing agencies to accept public works bids electroni- cally is repealed.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESSB 5820 C 13 L 15 E 3 Concerning the sale of certain department of transporta- tion surplus property.

Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Whenever the Department of Transporta- tion (WSDOT) determines to se ll surplus property, it must give public notice by publishing the proposed sale, on thesame day for two consecutive weeks, in the legal notices and classified sections of a legal newspaper of general cir-culation in the area where the pr operty to be sold is locat- ed. WSDOT must provide written notice to counties,cities, and towns with 60 days ' notice of its intent to dis- pose of state agency land. All monies received through the sale of surplus property are deposited into the motor vehi-cle account. When it is in the public interest, WSDOT may use equal value exchanges. These types of transactions ex- change WSDOT land in full or as part of a considerationfor land or improvements, or construction of improve-ments with private entities. In order for WSDOT to ap- prove the purchase of real property with an appraisedvalue of $10,000 or more, WSDOT must first publish a no-Senate 47 0 House 89 8 Senate 48 1 House 96 1SSB 5824 263tice of the proposed sale in a local newspaper in the area where the property is located. The notice must include a description of the property, the selling price, the terms ofthe sale, and the name and address of the WSDOT em-ployee or the the real estate broker handling the transac- tion. The notice must also state that any person may,within ten days after the pub lication of the notice, deliver to the designated WSDOT employee or real estate brokera written offer to purchase the property for not less than 10 percent more than the negotiate d sale price, subject to the same terms and conditions. The subsequent offer must not be considered unless it is accompanied by a deposit of 20percent of the total offer price. If a subsequent offer is re- ceived, the first offeror is in formed by registered or certi- fied mail sent to the address st ated in the offeror's office. The first offeror must then ha ve ten days, from the date of mailing the notice of the increased offer, in which to file a higher offer with the designated WSDOT employee or realestate broker. After the expiration of the ten-day period,WSDOT must approve in writin g the highest and best of- fer. Summary: The requirement for WS DOT to advertise real property auctions in the legal notices and classified sec- tions of newspapers on the same day for two consecutiveweeks is removed. WSDOT is given discretion to deter-mine the most appropriate me thod for advertising the sale of surplus property. The pe riod of time that WSDOT must give cities, towns, and counti es notice of its intent to sell surplus property is reduced from 60 days to 30 days. WSDOT is prohibited from entering into equal value exchange transactions. The requirement for WSDOT to publish a notice of proposed sale in a local newspaper in the area where theproperty is located is removed. The process by which anadditional offeror may bid 10 percent more than the notice of proposed sale price as long as they provide a 20 percent down payment is removed.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Mullet and Benton). Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: Some private sector employers provide their employees with retirement benefits, such as 401(k)plans, while other employers may provide no retirementbenefits to their employees. Some small business employ- ers may not offer the retirement plans due to concernsabout costs, administrative bu rdens, and potential liability. Private sector employers offering retirement plans to their employees must comply with the Employee Retire- ment Income Security Act (ERI SA). In order to qualify for tax benefits available fo r both employers and employ- ees, employers must maintain adequate record keeping,fairness, and funding in thei r retirement plans as specified by ERISA. Private sector employees participate in Social Securi- ty, and also have federally regulated personal retirementinvestment options such as the Individual Retirement Ac-count (IRA); the Payroll Dedu ction IRA; myRA, a Roth- IRA; and the SIMPLE IRA plans, a retirement plan forsmall employers allowing employer contributions. Banks,investment firms, and financial planners advise and assistindividuals in planning an d investing for retirement. Summary: Creation . The Washington small business re- tirement marketplace (marketplace) is created. The direc-tor (director) of Department of Commerce (Commerce)must contract with a private sector entity to establish a pro-gram that connects eligible employers with qualifyingplans. The program must: establish a protocol for reviewing and approving the qualifications of private sector financial servicesfirms seeking to participate in the marketplace; design and operate an In ternet website that includes information about how eligible employers can partic- ipate in the marketplace; develop marketing materials about the marketplace that can be distributed electronically, posted on vari-ous agency websites, or inserted in agency mailers; identify and promote existing federal and state tax credits and benefits for employers and employees thatare related to encouraging retirement savings or par- ticipating in retirement plans; and promote the benefits of retirement savings and finan- cial literacy. Only self-employed individuals, sole proprietors, and employers with fewer than 10 0 qualified employees are el-Senate 48 0 House 97 0 ESSB 5843 265igible to participate in the marketplace. Participation in the marketplace is completely voluntary. Private sector financial services firms that may partic- ipate in the marketplace must be licensed or hold a certif-icate of authority and be in go od standing with either the Department of Financial Institutions or the Office of theInsurance Commissioner and meet all federal laws andregulations to offer retiremen t plans. The director must ensure by rule that there is objective criteria in the protocol and that the protocol does not provide unfair advantage tothe private sector entity establishing the protocol. Types of Plans . The director must approve a diverse array of private retirement plan options, including life in-surance plans that are desi gned for retirement purposes, and at least two types of plans for eligible employer par-ticipation: (1) a SIMPLE IRA-type plan that provides for employer contributions to pa rticipating enrollee accounts; and (2) a payroll deduction in dividual retirement account type plan. The approved plans must meet federal law orregulation for the plans. Product Options . The financial services firms partici- pating in the marketplace must offer a minimum of twoproduct options: (1) a target date or other similar fund,with asset allocations and maturities designed to coincide with the expected date of retirement; and (2) a balancedfund. The marketplace must offer myRA. Rollovers . The approved plans must include the op- tion for enrollees to roll pretax contributions into a differ-ent IRA or another plan afte r ceasing participation in a marketplace plan. The director must address how roll-overs are handled for eligible Washington employers that have workers in other states, and whether out-of-state em-ployees with existing IRAs may roll them into the market- place plans. Fees . Financial service firms may not charge partici- pating employers an administrative fee, or enrollees morethan 100 basis points in total annual fees, and must provideinformation about their plans' historical investment perfor- mance. Rules . The director must adopt rules necessary to al- low the marketplace to operat e as authorized. The rules must be proposed by January 1 of the year of implementa-tion and rules must not be adop ted until after the end of the regular legislative session. Reporting . The director reports biennially to the Leg- islature on the effectiveness and efficiency of the market-place, including the levels of enrollment and theretirement savings levels of participating enrollees. Funding and Ince ntive Payments . In addition to any appropriated funds, the dir ector may use private funding sources, including private fo undation grants, to pay for marketplace expenses. On behalf of the marketplace,Commerce must seek federal and private grants and is au-thorized to accept any funds awarded to Commerce for usein the marketplace.

Senate Committee on Higher Education Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Higher EducationHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: College Bound Scholarship (CBS) Pro- gram . In 2007 the Legislature created the CBS Program to provide a tuition scholarship program for low-income stu-dents. The scholarship is open to seventh and eighth grad- ers who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches and signa pledge to graduate from high school with a 2.0 gradepoint average or higher and no felony convictions. Stu-dents in foster care are automa tically enrolled. At the time of high school graduation, elig ible students must have a family income of 65 percent of the state median family in-come or below. The CBS award amounts are calculated as the differ- ence between public institutio n tuition and required fees, less the value of any state-f unded grant, scholarship, or waiver assistance the student receives, plus $500 forbooks. All scholarship recipients are limited to no morethan four full-time years' wo rth of scholarship awards and the scholarship award must be used within five years of re-ceipt. The Office of Student Financ ial Aid, within the Wash- ington Student Achievement Council (WSAC), is the ad- ministrator of the Program. The Office of Superintendentof Public Instruction (OSPI) must notify elementary, mid- dle, and junior high schools about the Program and towork with WSAC to develop application collection andstudent tracking procedures. Currently OSPI contractswith the College Success Foundation to increase CBSmiddle and high school students' knowledge and aware-ness of post-secondary opportunities. CBS Program Work Group . During the 2014 Session, the Legislature created a work group to make recommen-dations to ensure the CBS pr ogram is viable, productive, and effective. The 11-membe r work group included two senators and two representativ es. The work group met four times in 2014. The final report contains 12 recom-mendations for the CBS progra m within the following cat- egories: data, student suppor ts, communications, statutory changes, and funding. Summary: The Legislature finds that a comprehensive review of the CBS Program in 2014 resulted in unanimousrecommendations to improve and enhance certain compo- nents of the program, including data collection, outreach, and program outcomes. When determining CBS elig ibility, the first quarter of Running Start grades must be excluded from the student'soverall GPA if the student ha s less than a C average and has completed less than two qu arters in the Running Start Program. WSAC must: work with other state agencies, law enforcement, or the court system to verify th at eligible students do not have felonies; notify tenth-grade CBS students and their families of the income requirements for CBS eligibility; develop comprehensive social media outreach with grade-level specific inform ation to keep students on track to graduate and leverage current tools such asthe High School and Beyond Plan and WSAC's Ready Set Grad website; and collaborate with educa tional organizations to map and coordinate mentoring and advising resources across the state, within existing resources. Each college or university is encouraged to tailor ad- vising resources for CBS re cipients. The institutions should identify campus official s and other resources. Beginning January 1, 2015, and at a minimum every year thereafter, WSAC and the colleges and universitiesmust ensure that the data n eeded to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the CBS program is promptly trans- mitted to the Education Research and Data Center. Datareported must include, but no t be limited to the following: the number of students who sign up for the CBS pro- gram in seventh or eighth grade; Senate 46 3 House 65 32 (House amended)Senate 38 9 (Senate concurred)ESB 5863 267 the number of CBS students who graduate from high school; the number of CBS students who enroll in postsec- ondary education; persistence and completion rates of CBS recipients; CBS recipient GPA; the number of CBS recipients who did not remain eli- gible and why; CBS program costs; and impacts to the State Need Grant program. By December 1, 2018, the Washington State Institute for Public Policy (WSIPP) must compete an evaluation ofthe CBS program and report to the Legislature. WSIPP'sreport must complement studies on the CBS program bythe University of Washington or others. To the extent it is not duplicative, the report must evaluate education out- comes emphasizing degree co mpletion rates at both sec- ondary and postsecondary levels. The report must studycertain aspects of the CBS program, including but not lim-ited to the following: CBS recipient GPA; variance in remediation between CBS recipients and their peers; differences in persistence between CBS recipients and their peers; and the impact of ineligibility for the CBS program, for reasons such as moving to Washington after middle school or a change in family income.

Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Under current law, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is directed to ex-pend federal funds, and funds that may be available toWSDOT, to increase diversity in the highway constructionworkforce. To the greatest extent practicable, WSDOTcoordinates with the Apprenticeship and Training Councilusing these funds for the following activities: pre-apprenticeship programs approved by the Apprenticeship and Training Council; pre-employment counseling; orientation on the highway construction industry, including outreach to women, minorities, and other disadvantaged individuals; basic skills improvement classes; career counseling; remedial training; entry requirements for training programs; supportive services and assistance with transporta- tion; child care and special needs; job-site monitoring and retention services; and assistance with tools, protective clothing, and other related support for employment costs.WSDOT, in coordination with the Apprenticeship and Training Council, must submit a report to the transporta- tion committees of the Legislat ure by December 1 of each year. The analysis must show the results of activities thatincrease diversity in the hi ghway construction workforce. Summary: WSDOT must coordinate with the Depart- ment of Labor and Industries, rather than the Apprentice-ship and Training Council, to expend funding forapprenticeship preparation and support services, includinggrants to local Indian tribes, churches, nonprofits, and oth- er organizations. To the greatest extent practicable, WS-DOT must expend funding from sources other than thefederal funds that are used under current law. The servicesthat WSDOT provides to increase diversity in the highwayconstruction workforce is expa nded to include the recruit- ment of women and persons of color to participate in the apprenticeship program at WSDOT. WSDOT must hire and maintain a full-time equivalent position to coordinate depart ment activities that increase diversity in the highway co nstruction workforce and ac- tively engage with communities with populations that are underrepresented in current transportation apprenticeshipprograms.

By Senators Angel, Liias, Roach, McCoy and Chase. Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on Local Government Background: The Growth Management Act (GMA) is the comprehensive land use pl anning framework for coun- ties and cities in Washington. Originally enacted in 1990and 1991, GMA establishes land use designation and en-vironmental protection requi rements for all Washington counties and cities, and a significantly wider array of plan-ning duties for the 28 counti es and the cities within them that fully plan under GMA. GMA defines urban governmental services or urban services to include, in part, storm and sanitary sewer sys-tems, domestic water systems, fire and police protection services, and other public u tilities associated with urban areas and normally not associat ed with rural areas. Cities, towns, and code cities provide water and sewer servicesboth within and outside thei r corporate limits. Counties may provide water and sewer services to unincorporatedareas of the county. Additionally, water-sewer districtsmay provide water and sewer services to incorporated andunincorporated areas. On-site septic systems or on-site sewage systems are the most common method of wastewater treatment for homes, commercial establishments, and other places thatare not connected to a public sanitary sewer system. Anon-site sewage system consists of a network of pipes, a septic tank, and a drain field, and provides subsurface soiltreatment and dispersal of sewage. Summary: A city, town, code city, or county (local juris- diction) with an ordinance or resolution requiring connec-tion to a public sewer system u pon the failure of an on-site septic system must provide an administrative appeals pro- cess to consider denials of pe rmit applications to repair or replace an existing and failing on -site septic system. The administrative appeals process must apply to requests to repair or replace an existing, failing on-site septic systemthat: were for a single-family residence by its owner or owners; were denied solely because of a law, regulation, or ordinance requiring connection to a public sewer sys- tem; and absent the applicable law, regulation, or ordinance requiring connection to a public sewer system upon which the denial was based, would be approved. If the local jurisdiction has an existing administrative appeals process, the local jurisdiction may follow its exist-ing process. The legislative body of the local jurisdiction or an administrative hearings officer must preside over theadministrative appeals process. The administrative appeals process must, at a mini- mum, consider whether: it is cost-prohibitive to require the owner of a single- family residence with an existing and failing on-site septic system to connect to the public sewer system; there are public health or environmental consider- ations; there are public sewer system performance or financ- ing considerations; and there are financial assistance programs or latecomer agreements offered by the city or town or by the state. If the local jurisdiction, fo llowing any appeals process of the jurisdiction, determines that an owner of a single-family residence must connect to the public sewer system,the owner may, in complying with the determination and subject to approval of appropriate permits, select and hirecontractors to perform the ne cessary work to connect to the public sewer system at the owner's expense. Unlessotherwise required by law, a de termination by a local juris- diction that the owner of a si ngle-family residence with a failing on-site septic system mu st connect a residence to a public sewer system is not subject to appeal.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5877 C 266 L 15 Concerning due process for adult family home licensees.

By Senate Committee on Law & Justice (originally spon- sored by Senators Kohl-Welle s, Darneille, Padden, Keiser, Conway, Chase and Hasegawa). Senate Committee on Law & Justice House Committee on Public SafetyHouse Committee on General Government & Information Technology Background: Washington uses a multi-faceted approach to reduce human trafficking and commercial sexual ex-ploitation. The criminal jus tice system pursues the crimi- nals who profit from trafficking and holds themaccountable. The social service, health care, and educa-tion systems support and care for trafficking victims andtheir families. Many nonprofit and community organiza-tions across the state help tr afficking victims with safe housing, transportation, and other necessities. State gov-ernment has the challenging task of coordinating all ofthese efforts as efficiently and effectively as possible. Social media and other emerging technologies serve an important purpose for the criminals in the business of sexual exploitation. Techno logy helps lure victims into the sex trade, and helps market the services to commercial sex consumers. The same te chnologies can help commu- nities fight back through pub lic education and by making resources available online to trafficking victims. Currently Washington h as a commercially sexually exploited children coordina ting committee. The commit- tee sunsets on June 30, 2015. Until June 30, 2004, Wash-ington had a task force agai nst human trafficking. The state's anti-trafficking efforts will improve by re-establish-ing the human trafficking task force and re-authorizing the coordinating committee for chil dren exploited in the sex trade. Summary: Information Cl earinghouse . The Department of Commerce Office of Crime Victims Advocacy (OCV A)must create and maintain an information portal serving as the state government contact regarding human trafficking.The portal is known as the Washington State Clearing-house on Human Trafficking. The clearinghouse must share and coordinate statewide efforts to combat the traf-ficking of persons. The clearinghouse must: coordinate information on all statewide human traf- ficking task forces; publish statewide task force reports; maintain a comprehensive resource directory for traf- ficking victims; and offer current, up-to-date state and federal news, legis- lative efforts, and informa tion on human trafficking.

This task force con-sists of one member from each of the two main caucusesof the House of Representatives and from each of the twomain caucuses of the Senate, representatives from publicagencies, organizations who serve trafficking victims andsurvivors, or work on traffi cking issues, and at least one human trafficking survivor. The OCV A is authorized toadd additional participants to the task force to ensure broad, diverse representation. The task force must: evaluate progress in Washington's anti-trafficking activities and services; consider anti-trafficking services and resources pro- vided by other states; review effectiveness of W ashington's anti-trafficking laws; and recommend needed chang es to the Governor and the Legislature. The commercially sexually exploited children state- wide coordinating committee is authorized through June 30, 2017. The Attorney Genera l's Office must convene the committee with agenda plan ning assistance and adminis- trative and clerical support pr ovided by the Department of Commerce. Three additiona l members join the commit- tee: a representative from organizations providing youthwith inpatient chemical depe ndency treatment, providing mental health treatment, and a survivor of human traffick-ing. In addition to its current du ties the committee must re- view the extent to which the 2010 law on sex crimes in-volving children (chapter 289, Laws of 2010; ESSB 6476) is understood and applied by law enforcement authorities and must research any barriers that exist to full implemen- tation of the 2010 law throughout the state. The Committee must report its findings regarding all aspects of its work, including its review and research re-garding the 2010 law, to the appropriate committees of the Legislature by February 1, 2016. V oluntary Anti-Trafficking Restroom Notice . The OCV A must review and approve a model human traffick-ing notice for use in an anti- trafficking information cam- paign. The OCV A must coor dinate with public entities, private businesses, and commun ity-based nonprofit orga- nizations to develop notice placement policies. The noticeis printed and distributed by anti-trafficking nonprofit or-ganizations. Once the model no tice is available, establish- ments that maintain a public restroom may voluntarily post the anti-trafficking notice.

Within 180 days of the fatality, DSHS must issue a re- port of the results of the review. Reports must be distrib-uted to the Legislature and po sted online. A child fatality review report is subject to public disclosure. DSHS is ex-pressly authorized to redact confidential information con-tained in a review report a ccording to existing state and federal laws protecting the privacy of victims of childabuse and neglect, including laws regarding the confiden-tiality of postmortem and autopsy reports. Near Fatality Child Reviews . In the event of a near fa- tality of a minor in the care of or receiving services fromDSHS or a supervising agency, or a minor who had beenin the care or receiving services from DSHS or a supervis-ing agency, within one year of the preceding near fatality, DSHS must notify the Office of the Family and Children's Ombuds (OFCO). DSHS may conduct a review at its dis-cretion or at the request of the OFCO. A child fatality or near-fatality review is subject to dis- covery in a civil or admini strative proceeding. However, any use or admission into evidence is limited as follows: Employees of DSHS canno t be questioned in a civil or administrative proceeding relating to the work ofthe child fatality review team, the incident under review, or the employee's statements, thoughts, or impressions or those of the review team members orothers who provided inform ation to the review team. A witness may not be examined regarding the wit- ness's interactions with the child fatality or near-fatal- ity review, including whether the person was interviewed during the review, questions asked during the review, and answ ers provided by the per- son. Documents prepared for a review team are inadmissi- ble in a civil or administrative proceeding. Docu-ments that existed before u se or consideration by the review team or that were created independently of a fatality or near-fatality review may still be admissi-ble. The limitation also does not apply to licensing or disciplinary proceedings rela ting to DSHS's efforts to revoke or suspend a license based on allegations ofmisconduct or unprofessional conduct connected with a near fatality or a fatality being reviewed. OFCO . The OFCO was created in 1996 to protect children and parents from harm ful agency action or inac- tion, and to make agency of ficials and state policymakersaware of system-wide issues in the child protection and child welfare system. The OFCO is part of the Governor'sOffice and operates independ ently from DSHS and other state agencies, acting as a neutral fact-finder, not as an ad-vocate. The OFCO's responsi bilities include investigating complaints related to child protective services or child welfare services, monitoring the procedures used byDSHS in delivering family and children's services, and providing information about th e rights and responsibilities of individuals receiving fam ily and children's services and the procedures for providing those services. To performthese duties, the OFCO has authority: to interview children in state care; to access, inspect, and co py all records, information, or documents in DSHS' possession that the OFCO considers necessary to conduct an investigation; and to have unrestricted online access to the case and management information sy stem operated by DSHS. The OFCO must issue an annual report to the Legisla- ture on the implementation of the recommendations from reviews of child fatalities. Summary: In the event of a near fatality of a minor in the care of or receiving services from DSHS or a supervising agency or a minor who had been receiving such care in the preceding three months of the near fatal incident or wasthe subject of an investigation by the department for pos-sible abuse or neglect, DSHS must notify OFCO and con- duct a review of the near fatality. When a case worker or other employee of DSHS re- sponds to an allegation of child abuse or neglect and thereis a subsequent allegation of abuse or neglect resulting in a near fatality within three mo nths of the initial allegation that is screened in and open for investigation by DSHS,DSHS must immediately conduct a review of the caseworker's and case worker's s upervisor's files and actions taken during the initial report of alleged child abuse or ne-glect. The purpose of the revi ew is to determine if there were any errors by the employees under DSHS policy,rule, or state statute. If any violations of policy, rule, orstatute are found, DSHS must conduct a formal employeeinvestigation. The review conducted by DSHS is subjectto the same restrictions go verning admissibility of evi- dence as the fatality reviews and near fatality reviews. Near fatality means an act that, as certified by a phy- sician, places the child in serious or critical condition. The Act is to be known as Aiden's Act.

By Senate Committee on Huma n Services, Mental Health & Housing (originally sponsored by Senators O'Ban andMiloscia). Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Judiciary Background: A criminal defendant is incompetent to stand trial (IST) if the defendant does not have presentability to understand the natu re of the criminal proceed- ings against the defendant or to assist defense counsel. If any party to the criminal proceeding or the court raisescompetency to stand trial (C ST), the court must stay the criminal proceedings and appoint a qualified expert or askthe Department of Social an d Health Services (DSHS) to designate an expert to evaluate the mental condition of the defendant. If the court finds the defendant to be IST after the evaluation, the court may order any felony defendantand most nonfelony defendants to undergo competencyrestoration treatment. Competency restoration treatmentis currently provided exclusively on an inpatient basis bythe state at one of Washington's state hospitals. Washington law establishes performance targets for the timeliness of the comp letion of CST evaluations. These targets are as follows: seven days to extend an offer of admission to a state hospital for a defendant to receive inpatient services related to CST, including evaluation, restoration, or a civil commitment evaluatio n following dismissal of charges; seven days to complete a CST evaluation in jail, including distribution of the evaluation report; and 21 days to complete a CST evaluation in the commu- nity. The time periods measured in the performance targets run from the date at which th e state hospital receives the court referral and supporting information relating to the defendant. The Legislature recognizes that performance targets may not be achievable in all cases, and recognizes a nonexclusive list of circumstances which may placeachievement of a performance ta rget out of reach, includ- ing lack of medical clearance for the defendant to be ad-mitted to the state hospital, the need to acquire medical history information related to the defendant in the custody of a third party, lack of availability or cooperation bycounsel, jail or court personnel, interpreters, or the defen- dant, and unusual spikes in the demand for CST services.These performance targets do not create an entitlement or cause of action related to th e timeliness of CST services,and may not provide the basis for a contempt sanction or a motion to dismiss criminal charges. On April 23, 2014, the Join t Legislative Audit & Re- view Committee issued an audit report reviewing the time-liness of forensic services provided by DSHS incomparison to the performan ce targets. It found that DSHS is not consistently m eeting its performance targets, or assumed evaluator staffing and productivity levels. The report stated that DSHS has struggled to provide accurateand timely performance information. Summary: Maximum time limits are established for the completion of CST services: 14 days to extend an offer of admission to state hospi- tal for a defendant to receiv e inpatient services related to CST; and 14 days to complete a CS T evaluation in jail, plus an additional seven-day extensio n to complete the evalu- ation if necessary for clinic al reasons at the determi- nation of DSHS. These maximum time limits must be phased in over a one-year time period beginning July 1, 2015. The seven- day performance targets for completion of these services are retained. The list of documents that mu st be provided with a re- ferral for CST evaluation is increased to specifically in-clude police reports, the names and addresses of theattorneys, the name of the judge ordering the evaluation, and information about the alleged crime. The nonexclusive list of ci rcumstances in which the Legislature recognizes that performance targets may not be achievable are recharacterized as affirmative defenseswhich the state may offer to defend against an allegationthat the state has exceeded maximum time limits. This listis increased by th e addition of two circumstances: (1) DSHS does not have access to appropriate private space to conduct a competency evaluatio n for a defendant in pretri- al custody; and (2) the defendant asserts legal rights thatresult in a delay in provid ing competency services.

The MWA establishes a minimum wage that must be paid to all em-Senate 48 1 House 84 14SSB 5897 273ployees in the state. Under the MWA, an employee is any individual employed by an em ployer except those specifi- cally excluded in statute. An employer under the MWA isany individual, partnership, association, corporation, busi-ness, trust, or any person or group of persons acting direct-ly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee. Consequently, any individual who is en-gaged or permitted to work fo r an employer is entitled to the state minimum wage, unless specifically exempt. Industrial Welfare Act (IWA) . The IWA regulates hours and conditions of labor and other wage issues notspecifically covered by the MW A. The IWA applies to all employers and employees in the state unless specifically exempt. An employee under the IWA is an employee whois employed in the business of the employee's employer, whether by manual labor or otherwise. An employer un-der the IWA includes any person, firm, corporation, part-nership, business, trust, legal representative, or otherbusiness entity which engages in any business, industry, profession, or activity in the state and employs one ormore employees. Washington's industrial in surance laws do not cover amateur athletes. Summary: For the purposes of the MWA and IWA, the term employee does not includ e an individual who is six- teen to twenty years old, in the individual's capacity as a player for a junior ice hockey team that is a member of a regional, national, or intern ational league and that con- tracts with an arena owned, operated, or managed by apublic facilities district.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SSB 5897 C 100 L 15 Concerning funding for medical evaluations of suspected victims of child abuse.

Senate Committee on Human Services, Mental Health & Housing Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Early Learning & Human ServicesHouse Committee on Appropriations Background: In 1973 the Legislature established the Crime Victims' Comp ensation Fund (CVCF) to cover vic- tims' medical bills and other costs associated with the of-fender's crime. State law requires the CVCF to pay forinitial sexual assault examinatio ns that are conducted forgathering evidence for possible prosecution. These activ- ities are known as the SAFE program. The WashingtonAdministrative Code specifies that the state is the primarypayer of this benefit and the clie nt is not required to file an application with the CVCF to receive this benefit. The Washington Department of Labor and Industries adminis-ters the funds associated with the CVCF. Currently, childsexual abuse exams are eligible for reimbursementthrough the SAFE program, but child physical abuse ex-ams are not eligible for CVCF coverage in the same man- ner as the SAFE program. Summary: Subject to the availab ility of funds appropri- ated for this purpose, the CVCF, secondary to any other in-surance, is available for reim bursement of costs related to the examination of a suspecte d victim of assault of a child when the exam is conducted wi thin 75 days of the filing of a petition for dependency by th e Department of Social and Health Services.

GMA establishes land use designation and environmental protection requirementsfor all counties and cities. Planning jurisdictions may impose impact fees on de- velopment activity as part of th e financing of public facil- ities needed to serve new growth and development. Impact fees may be collected and spent only for qualifyingpublic facilities that are incl uded within a comprehensive plan. Legislation adopted in 2013 - ESHB 1652 - obligated counties, cities, and towns to adopt deferral systems for the collection of impact fees from applicants for residen- tial building permits through a covenant-based process, or through a process that delays payment until final inspec-tion, certificate of occupancy, or equivalent certification.The legislation was vetoed in its entirety by the Governor on May 21, 2013.Senate 47 0 House 91 7 (House amended)Senate 47 1 (Senate concurred)Senate 49 0 House 97 0SSB 5933 274Summary: Counties, cities, and towns that collect impact fees must adopt a system for the deferred collection of im-pact fees from applicants fo r residential building permits by September 1, 2016. The deferral system must includeone or more of the followin g options including deferral of the collection of impact fees until final inspection, certifi- cate of occupancy, or upon the first sale of the property. An applicant seeking a defe rral must grant and record a deferred impact fee lien against the property in favor ofthe local jurisdiction. The amou nt of impact fees that may be deferred is determined by th e fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for a deferral. Unless otherwise pro-vided, payment of deferred impact fees at the time of saleis the seller's responsibility. The term of an impact fee de-ferral may not exceed 18 months from the date of issuanceof the building permit. If impact fees are not paid, the lo-cal jurisdiction may institute foreclosure proceedings torecover unpaid fees. If a local jurisdiction does not initiate foreclosure proceedings for unpaid school impact fees, theschool district may begin foreclosure proceedings. Localjurisdictions may collect reasonable administrative fees toimplement the de ferral system. A county, city, or town with an impact fee deferral pro- cess on or before April 1, 20 15, is exempt from the obliga- tion to establish an impact fee deferral system if the locally adopted deferral process delays all fees and remains in ef- fect after September 1, 2016. Each applicant for an impact fee deferral is entitled to annually receive deferrals fo r the first 20 single-family residential construction build ing permits per jurisdiction. A local jurisdiction may elect to defer more than 20 build- ing permits for an applicant pr ovided that the local juris- diction consults with the sc hool district regarding the additional deferrals and gives substantial weight to their recommendations. If the collection of impact fees is delayed through a deferral process, the six-year timeframe for completingimprovements or strategies to comply with concurrency provisions of the GMA may not begin until after the coun-ty or city receives full payment of all impact fees due. The Department of Commerce must report annually to the Legislature beginning December 1, 2018 on the impactfee deferral process including the number of deferrals re- quested and issued by local jurisdictions, and the number of deferrals that were not pa id. The Joint Legislative Au- dit and Review Committee must review the impact fee de- ferral requirements and submit a report to the Legislatureby September 1, 2021.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: September 1, 2016SSB 5933 C 101 L 15 Establishing a statewide training program on human traf- ficking laws for crimin al justice personnel.

These are more complex than traditional chemically synthesized drugs. Biological products are manufactured from living organisms by programming celllines to produce desired ther apeutic substances. Examples of biological products include human growth hormone, in-jectable treatments for arthr itis and psoriasis, the Hepatitis B vaccine, and stem cell therapy. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly sim- ilar to a biological product, with minor differences in clin-ically inactive components. A biosimilar is considered to be interchangeable with a biol ogical product if it is deter- mined by the Food and Drug Administration that it can beexpected to produce the same clinical result as the refer- ence biological product in any given patient and there is norisk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternatingor switching between the biosimilar and the biologicalproduct. The Affordable Care Act amended the Public Health Services Act to create an ab breviated licensure pathway for biosimilar products that are interchangeable with a Food and Drug Administration-licensed biological prod-uct. This is similar to th e pathway permitted for drug man- ufactures to substitute generic drugs for brand-nameprescription drugs that have been approved under theFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Under this pathway, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may determine abiosimilar to be interchangeabl e with a biological product if it is determined that the biosimilar is expected to pro-duce the same clinical resu lt as the reference product in any given patient or there is not likely to be a risk to safetyor efficacy by switching to the biosimilar. If the biosimilaris interchangeable, a pharmac y may substitute without the intervention of the health care provider. Summary: Every drug prescription form must contain an instruction of whether or not a generic drug or an inter-changeable biological product may be substituted. If dis- pense as written is indica ted, an interchangeable biological product may not be substituted. If substitutionis permitted, the pharmacist must substitute an inter- changeable biological product for the biological productprescribed if the wholesale price of the interchangeableproduct is less than the wholesale price of the biologicalproduct prescribed. Until August 1, 2020, the pharmacist must notify the prescriber if an interchangeab le biological product is be- ing substituted for the drug pres cribed. Notice to the prac- titioner must be made within fi ve days of the substitution and can be accomplished through use of an electronic re-cords system such as an in teroperable electronic medical records system, an electroni c prescribing technology, a pharmacy benefit management system, or a pharmacy re- cord if the practitioner has access to the electronic medical record system. If electronic medical records are not avail-able, notification may then be made through other meth- ods including facsimile or tele phone. Notification is not required for refills or in s ituations where the pharmacisthas communicated with the practitioner before substitu- tion. The Pharmacy Quality A ssurance Commission must maintain a list of interchang eable biological products and all biological products approved as therapeutically equiv-alent by the federal Food and Drug Administration on itswebsite. Pharmacists and pharmacies are provided with protec- tion from liability based on the de cision to dispense the in- terchangeable biological product. Pharmacies must post a sign that interchangeable bio- logical products may be substituted for the drug prescribedby a patient's doctor.

Senate Committee on Higher Education Senate Committee on Ways & MeansHouse Committee on Higher Education Background: Tuition-Setting Authority . In 2011 the Legislature enacted E2SHB 1795, the Higher EducationOpportunity Act, which provid ed four-year institutions the authority to set tuition rates fo r resident undergraduate stu- dents through the 2014-15 acad emic year. In the 2015-16 through 2018-19 academic year s they are granted tuition- setting authority within limits based on a state funding baseline year and funding for similar higher education in- stitutions in the Global Challenge States. When a public baccalaureate institution raises tuition beyond levels assumed in th e operating budget, the insti- tution must remit 5 percent of operating fees back to stu- dents in the form of financial aid. Additionally, to offsetincreased tuition, institutions must provide financial assis- tance to State Need Grant-elig ible students, resident low and middle-income students via a specific formula de-pending on tuition price as a percentage of median familyincome in various income bracke ts up to 125 percent of the median family income. Financial assistance may be pro-vided through various method s with sources from tuition revenue, locally held funds, tuition waivers, or local finan- cial aid programs. Washington's Guaranteed Education Tuition (GET) Program . The GET program is a 529 prepaid college tui-Senate 48 1 House 96 1 (House amended)Senate 47 1 (Senate concurred)2ESSB 5954 276tion plan established in 1997. The GET Program allows purchasers to pre-pay for tuitio n units that will be used at a later date. The state guarantees that 100 GET units willcover one year of resident undergraduate tuition and state-mandated fees at the most expensive Washington public university. GET units do not cover institutionally mandat- ed fees that may be required at each individual school. The current unit price is $172. Unit purchase price is based on an actuarial formula that includes current cost of tuition, estimated future tuitio ns, inflation, investment re- turns, and administrative costs, and the need for a reserveto assist in periods of fluctuating returns or higher-than-average tuition. The current payout value is $117.82 - ef- fective through July 31, 2015. Summary: Public baccalaureate tuition-setting authority for resident undergraduate (R UG) students is removed. In the 2015-16 academic year, th e RUG tuition operating fee for all public colleges and univ ersities is reduced by 5 per- cent from the 2014-15 tuition operating fee. In the 2016-17 academic ye ar, the RUG tuition oper- ating fee for regional universities and The Evergreen StateCollege is reduced by 20 percent from 2014-15 academic year levels. The RUG tuitio n operating fee for research universities is reduced 15 percent from 2014-15 academic year levels. Beginning in the 2017-18 and each academic year thereafter, resident undergradu ate tuition for all public col- leges and universities may grow by no more than the aver- age annual percentage growth rate in the median hourlywage for Washington for the pr evious fourteen years as the wage is determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As a result of changes in tuition fees, four-year public institutions of higher educa tion must not reduce resident undergraduate enrollment below the 2014-15 academic-year levels. Beginning with the 2015-17 operating budget, the Legislature must appropriate to the State Board for Com-munity and Technical Colleges and each four-year institu-tion of higher education an amount that is at least equal tothe total state funds appropri ated in the 2013-15 biennium plus the reduction in net revenues from resident under-graduate tuition operating fe es received for the 2015-17 fiscal biennium under this ac t. The net revenue loss must be adjusted for inflation in subsequent biennia. Addition- ally, the dollar value of the building fee must not be re-duced below the level in th e 2014-15 academic year, adjusted for inflation. Both the State Need Grant and the College Bound Scholarship maximum awards can be reduced by no morethan the percentage reductio n in tuition operating fees. Awards provided to students attending private schools areexempt from this reduction. For the 2015-16 and 2016-17 academic years, the gov- erning body of the GET program must set the payout valuefor units redeemed during that academic year at $117.82 per unit. For academic years after the 2016-17 academic year, the governing body must make the program adjustments itdeems necessary and appropriat e to ensure that the total payout value of each account on the effective date of the act is not decreased or diluted as a result of the initial ap- plication of any ch anges in tuition under the act. In the event the GET Committee or the governing body provides additional units under the act, the GET Committee and the governing body must also increase the maximum number of units that can be redeemed in any year to mitigate the reduction in available account value during any year as aresult of the act. The governing body must notify holdersof tuition units after the adjust ment is made and must in- clude a statement concerning the adjustment. By December 1, 2016, the GET Committee must re- view and report to the Legislature on: the impact of decreasing tuition rates on the funded status and future unit price of the GET program; the feasibility and differ ent options of establishing a college savings program; alternatives and impacts for changing the tuition pay- ment distribution policy from tuition and fees to a cost of attendance metric; and changing the state penalty for GET unit withdrawal. The Education Data Research Center must provide the Legislature a statistical analysis and a report on the time ittakes students to complete their degrees by major by school. The report is due December 1, 2015. The Washington State Institu te for Public Policy must conduct a study on a lternative tuition growth factors in ad- dition to the median wage for the Legislature to determineits preferred metric moving fo rward. The report is due De- cember 1, 2015. Financial mitigation is no lo nger required for institu- tions that increased tuition for resident undergraduate stu-dents above the tuition increases assumed in the budget.The Office of Financial Management is no longer requiredto report annually the total per-student funding level and undergraduate tuition that each represent the sixtieth per- centile of funding and tuition for similar institutions of higher education. This act is known as the College Affordability Pro- gram.

By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored Hobbs, Frockt and Hasegawa). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: The Washington Traffic Safety Commis- sion (WTSC) is the designated highway safety office forWashington. According to th e WTSC, in 2014, there were 67 pedestrian-vehicle collision fatalities, and 283 pedestri- an-vehicle collision serious injuries in Washington. Summary: The WTSC must convene and staff a pedes- trian safety advisory counci l (Council). The Council may include, but is not limited to, the following members: a representative from the WTSC; a coroner from the county where the most pedestrian deaths have occurred; a representative from the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs; a representative from the Department of Transporta- tion; a representative from cities, and two representatives from municipalities in which a pedestrian fatality has occurred in the past three ye ars that are invited by the Council; a traffic engineer; a representative from a pedestrian advocacy group; and representatives from law enforcement who have investigated pedestrian fatalities. The purpose of the Council is to review and analyze data related to pedestrian fa talities and serious injuries to identify points at which the transportation system can beimproved and to identify patte rns in pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries. The Council may examine the statutes, ordinances, and policies governing pedestrians and traffic related tothe incidents, as well as any av ailable relevant information maintained in existing data bases. The Council may also review law enforcement incident reports, victim, witness,and suspect statements, and any other information deter- mined to be relevant for the re view, to the extent such re- view is permitted by law or court rule. Any confidentialinformation, such as personally identifiable information from a medical record, obtain ed by the Council or the WTSC is not subject to public disclosure. The Council must provide a report and make recom- mendations on measures that could improve pedestrian safety by December 31 of each year. The report must beprovided to the Governor, the transportation committeesof the Legislature, and all municipal governments andstate agencies participating on the panel. By December 1, 2018, the Council must report to the Legislature on the strategies that have been deployed to improve pedestriansafety by the Council and make recommendations whetherthe Council should be continued and/or improved. Representatives of the WTSC and the other members of the Council are immune from civil liability for thegood-faith exercise of the duties of the Council related tothe reviewing of fatalities an d serious injuries. Council members, and any other person in attendance at a Councilmeeting or who otherwise participated in the collection ofdata and preparation of Coun cil reports, are prohibited from testifying in a civil action related to matters theCouncil has reviewed. Docume nts prepared by or for the Council are generally inadmissible in a civil or administra-tive proceeding. Nothing in this act is intended to create a private civil cause of action. The Council expires June 30, 2019.

By Senators Roach, Liias, Benton, McCoy, Angel and Chase; by request of Department of Veterans Affairs. Senate Committee on Governme nt Operations & Security House Committee on Community Development, Housing & Tribal Affairs Background: The Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee (V AAC) . The V AAC provides advice and makes recom- mendations to the Governor and the Director of the De- partment of Veterans Affairs (DV A). The Committee has17 members appointed by the Governor to serve four-yearterms. The V AAC consists of the following: one member from the W ashington Soldier's Home in Orting and one member from the Veterans' Home in Retsil; one member from each of the three congressionally chartered and recognized veterans service organiza- tions with the largest me mberships in the state; ten members to represent the congressionally char- tered and recognized vete rans service organizations that have at least one active chapter in the state; and two members who are veterans at large.Senate 48 1 House 57 41 (House amended)Senate 35 9 (Senate concurred)SB 5974 278The Governor must ensure that appointments repre- sent all regions of the state and minority and women's vet-eran viewpoints. State Veterans' Homes . The state Constitution man- dates that the Legislature provide a soldiers' home for hon-orably discharged resident soldiers, sailors, and marineswho were disabled in the line of duty. DV A manages the veterans' homes and must prov ide room and board, medi- cal, dental, domiciliary and nurs ing care, physical and oc- cupational therapy, and recreational activities to residents.There are four veterans' homes in the state: the Washington Soldiers' Home in Orting, established in 1980; the Washington Veterans' Home in Retsil, established in 1907; the Eastern Washington Veterans' Home in Spokane, established in 2001; and the Walla Walla Veterans ' Home, established in 2014. Summary: If the resident council for the Orting or Retsil veterans' home does not nominate a resident to representthe home on the V AAC, the Governor may appoint a mem- ber-at-large in place of that home's representative. TheV AAC must appoint a liaison to any state veterans' home with no representative appoin ted to the committee. The veterans' homes liaisons must share information about V AAC business with the resident council of the veterans'home and ensure that issues ra ised by the veterans' homes residents are included in regular V AAC meetings.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 SB 5974 C 127 L 15 Requiring the insurance commi ssioner to review barriers to offering supplemental coverage options to disabled vet-erans and their dependents. By Senators Benton, Bailey, Hobbs, Chase, Cleveland, Angel, Hasegawa, Roach, Jayapal, Fraser, McCoy andHewitt. Senate Committee on Health Care Senate Committee on Financia l Institutions & Insurance House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: The federal Department of Veterans Affairs offers a health benefits prog ram, the Civilian Health and Medical Program, commonly called CHAMPV A. TheCHAMPV A shares the cost of certain health care servicesand supplies with eligible be neficiaries, with reimburse- ment for most medical expenses including inpatient, out-patient, mental health, pr escription medication, skilled nursing care, and durable medical equipment. Eligible beneficiaries include the spouse or widow or widower and the children of a veteran who: is rated permanently and totally disabled due to a ser- vice-connected disability; was rated permanently and totally disabled due to a service-connected condition at the time of death; died of a service- connected disability; or died on active duty, and the dependents are not eligi- ble for Department of Defense Tricare benefits. Supplemental insurance policies are available to offset some or all out-of-pocket cost s. The supplemental insur- ance policies are sold by private insurance carriers, and avariety of carriers offer policies across the country, butpolicies are not currently ava ilable in Washington State. Current insurance law does allow the supplemental poli-cies. Summary: The Office of the Insurance Commissioner must review current barriers to attracting supplementalplans into the state and report on steps the state and the De-partment of Veterans Affairs can take to promote access tothe supplemental polic ies. The review of the barriers and recommendations must be s ubmitted to the appropriate committees of the Legislature, the Governor, and the De-partment of Veterans Affairs by November 11, 2015.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 2ESSB 5987 C 44 L 15 E 3 Concerning transportation revenue. By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Senators King, Hobbs, Fain, Liias and Litzow). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: 18th Amendment . The 18th Amendment to the Washington State C onstitution requires that the state's motor vehicle fuel ta xes, currently $0.375 per gal- lon; vehicle licensing fees; and all other state revenue in-tended to be used for highway purposes be deposited intothe Motor Vehicle Fund. Moni es in that fund may only be spent for highway purposes, which are defined to includeexpenditures on construction, preservation, maintenance, operation, and administration of highways and ferries. Handling Loss Deduction . Licensed fuel suppliers, distributors, and importers are allowed a handling loss de-duction on motor vehicle fuel as follows: for a motor ve- hicle fuel supplier acting as a distributor, 0.25 percent; and for all other licensees, 0.30 perc ent. Originally this was to account for losses the distributors sustained through evap-oration and handling and was reduced in 1951 from 1 per-cent to the current rate. In 2008 the Joint Legislative AuditSenate 48 0 House 97 0 (House amended)Senate 48 0 (Senate concurred)Senate 48 0 House 97 02ESSB 5987 279and Review reviewed this JLARC Report 09-4: 2008 Expedited Tax Prefer-ence Performance Reviews - an d recommended that the Legislature terminate the mo tor fuel handling loss deduc- tion. Their recommendation was based on current Depart-ment of Ecology regulations concerning the methods andequipment used in the distribu tion of fuel, which allow for little or no handling losses. Transfers to Non-Highway Accounts . Transfers are made from the Motor Vehicle Fund to the ORV and Non-highway Vehicle Account, the Marine Fuel Tax RefundAccount, and the Snowmobile Account for motor vehicle fuel taxes paid by non-highway users. Each of these trans-fers is made based on a calculation that is based on a rateof fuel tax of $0.23 per gallon. Weight Fees . Generally all motor vehicles used on public highways must be registered with the Departmentof Licensing (DOL) annually. Most vehicles, such as pas-senger cars, motorcycles, vans, and cabs, are subject to a$30 license tab fee; a weight fee of $10, $20, or $30 basedon the scale weight of the vehicle; and other fees totaling$3.75. The proceeds from vehicle weight fees are depos-ited to the Multimodal Transp ortation Account. Funds in the Multimodal Transportation Account are used for trans- portation purposes, which is broader than highway pur-poses and can include public transportation and rail. License Fee by Weight . In lieu of the vehicle license fee and weight fees, trucks, buses, and for-hire vehicles aresubject to a license fee based on gross vehicle weight(GVW). The license fee by weight ranges from $38 for a 4000 pound vehicle to $3,400 for a 105,500 pound vehi-cle, in addition to a $3 filin g fee. Proceeds from the li- cense fee by weight are deposited into various accountswithin the Motor Vehicle Fund. Electric Vehicle Fee . In addition to any other fees due at annual vehicle registration, vehicles that are powered by electricity are subject to a licensing fee of $100 which is deposited into the Motor Vehicl e Fund. If in any year pro- ceeds from the electric vehicl e fee are more than $1 mil- lion, 15 percent of the total funds must be deposited to theTransportation Improvement Account and 15 percent mustbe deposited to the Rural Arterial Trust Account. Commercial Driver's Licenses . Any driver over 18 years of age with a valid driver's license can apply for acommercial driver instructio n permit. To receive a com- mercial driver instruction perm it, the person must pass a knowledge test. There is a $10 application fee. Prior tobeing issued a commercial driver's license (CDL) an appli-cant must have successfully co mpleted a course of instruc- tion in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle orhave been certified by an employer as having the skills and training necessary to operate a commercial motor vehiclesafely, and have passed a knowledge and skills test. Anapplicant must pay a fee of no more than $10 for eachknowledge examination and a fe e of no more than $100 for the skills examination; however, if the applicant's primaryuse of a CDL is for public benefit not-for-profit corpora-tions that are federally sup ported head start programs, or public not-for-profit corporations that support early child-hood education and assistan ce programs, then the appli- cant must a pay a fee of no more than $75 for the skillsexamination. A person who has been disqualified fromoperating a commercial motor vehicle may apply for a re-instatement of a CDL with a payment of $20 after the ap-propriate disqualification time period has expired. Enhanced Driver's Licenses and Indenticards . The en- hanced driver license (EDL) or enhanced ID card (EID)may be issued to a Washington resident that is also a Unit- ed States citizen if they ha ve confirmed their identity and citizenship. A person applying for an EDL must be at least 18 years old, and any age for a enhanced ID card and costs$15 in addition to any other fe es due for a driver's license or ID card. Studded Tires . Studded tires may only be used from November 1 until March 31 of each year or during other times of the year if the W ashington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) deem it acceptable. The use of studded tires during any other time of the year is a trafficinfraction. Report of Sale/Transitional Ownership . The owner of a vehicle must notify DOL, the county, or a subagent whenthey sell or otherwise dispose of a vehicle. In order for areport of sale to be considered properly filed, it must in-clude the date of the sale; the name and address of the sell-er and the buyer; the vehicle identification number andlicense plate number; the requir ed fees, $3.75 if it is sub- mitted to the county, or $5 if it is submitted to a subagent; and a date stamp by DOL showing that it was received onor before the fifth business day after the date of transfer. Transportation Benef it District (TBD) . A TBD is a quasi-municipal corporation and independent taxing au-thority that may be established by a county or city for thepurpose of acquiring, constructing, improving, providing,and funding transportation im provements within the TBD. A TBD is governed by the legi slative authority of the ju- risdiction proposing to create it, or by a governance struc-ture prescribed in an interl ocal agreement among multiple jurisdictions. A TBD has inde pendent taxing authority to implement the various revenue measures with voter ap-proval. Additionally a TBD may impose a vehicle fee ofup to $20 annually with a ma jority vote of the governing body if the TBD includes all the territory within theboundaries of the jurisdic tion establishing the TBD. Public Transportation Benefit Area (PTBA) . A PTBA is a special-purpose district authorized to provide public transportation service within all or a portion of a county orcounties. Cities must be wholly included or excluded.The PTBA is the most common type of district providing public transportation service in the state, with 21 currently in existence. A PTBA located on Puget Sound may alsoprovide passenger-only ferry (POF) service after develop-ing an investment plan. A PTBA may collect fares for ser-vice and, with approval of th e majority of the voters within2ESSB 5987 280the area, impose up to a 0.9 percent sales and use tax with- in the area. High Capacity Transp ortation (HCT) Systems . An HCT system is a system of public transpor tation services within an urbanized region operating principally on exclu-sive rights-of-way, and the supporting services and facili- ties necessary to implement the system, including interimexpress services and high occupancy vehicle lanes, which,taken as a whole, provides a substantially higher level of passenger capacity, speed, and service frequency than tra-ditional public transportation systems operating principal- ly in general purpose roadwa ys. In the central Puget Sound region, HCT systems may be established and fi-nanced by a regional transit authority or a regional trans-portation investment district . There is currently one regional transit authority th at has financed an HCT sys- tem, which is Sound Transit. Outside the central Puget Sound region, HCT systems may be established by transit agencies in counties containing an interstate highway that have a population greater than 175,000, which are Benton,Clark, Spokane, Thurston, Whatcom, and Yakima coun-ties. Transit agencies authorized to provide HCT servicemay seek to finance the system and service with the fol-lowing voter-approved revenue measures: an employer tax of up to $2 per month per employee; rental car sales and use tax not to exceed 2.172 per- cent; and sales and use tax not to exceed 0.9 percent. Sound Transit . A Regional Transit Authority (RTA) is authorized to use its tax re venues to develop and operate an HCT system. There is currently one RTA, Sound Tran-sit, which operates light rail , commuter rail service, and express bus service in the central Puget Sound. After theapproval of the most recent system expansion plan in2008, Sound Transit imposes a sales and use tax of 0.9 per-cent, a motor vehicle excise tax of 0.3 percent, and a rentalcar sales and use tax of 0.8 percent within the boundariesof the Sound Transit district. Motor Vehicle Excise Tax (MVET) . An MVET is a tax paid on the value of a mo tor vehicle. For the purpose of determining any locally im posed MVET, the value of a vehicle other than a truck or trailer is 85 percent of themanufacturer's base suggested retail price of the vehiclewhen first offered for sale as a new vehicle, excluding any optional equipment, applicable federal excise taxes, stateand local sales or use taxes, transportation or shippingcosts, or preparatory or delivery costs, multiplied by theapplicable percentage listed in the depreciation schedules. For the purpose of determ ining any locally imposed MVET, the value of a truck or trailer is the latest purchaseprice of the vehicle, exclud ing applicable federal excise taxes, state and local sales or use taxes, transportation orshipping costs, or preparatory or delivery costs, multipliedby the applicable percentage listed in the depreciation schedules based on the year of service of the vehicle sinceits last sale. The latest purchase year is considered the first year of service. Property Tax Levy . The state Constitution limits reg- ular property tax levies to a maximum of 1 percent of theproperty's value - $10 per $1,0 00 of assessed value. The Legislature established indivi dual district rate maximums and aggregate rate maximums to keep the total tax rate for regular property taxes within the constitutional limit. For example, the state levy rate is limited to $3.60 per $1,000 of assessed value, county general levies are limited to$1.80 per $1,000 of assessed va lue, county road levies are limited to $2.25 per $1,000 of assessed value, and city lev- ies are limited to $3.375 per $1,000 of assessed value.These districts are known as senior districts. Junior dis-tricts such as fire, library, hospital, and metropolitan park districts each have specific rate limits as well. The taxrates for most of these senior and junior districts must fit within an overall rate limit of $5.90 per $1,000 of assessedvalue. State statutes contain schedules specifying the pref-erential order in which the va rious junior taxing district levies will be prorated in the event that the $5.90 limit isexceeded. Under this prorating system, senior districts aregiven preference over junior districts. Property Tax Gap . A few regular property tax levies are not placed into the $5.90 aggregate rate limit: emer- gency medical services, conservation futures, affordablehousing, certain metropolitan park districts, county ferry districts, criminal justice, fire districts, and county transit. However, these districts are subject to reduction if therates for these districts, the st ate property tax, and the dis- tricts subject to the $5.90 limit together exceed the consti- tutional limit of $10 per $1,000 of assessed value. Thesedistricts are in what has been called the gap, the $0.50 re- maining after subtracting th e $3.60 state levy and the $5.90 in local regu lar levies from the statutory $10 limit. Summary: Fuel Taxes and Transfers . The motor vehicle fuel tax is increased by $0.119 per gallon as follows: $0.07 per gallon effective August 1, 2015; and $0.049 per gallon effective July 1, 2016. Revenue from the $0.119 per gallon is distributed into the newly created Connecting Washington Account in the Motor Vehicle Fund. The rate used to calculate transfers from the Motor Ve- hicle Fund to the ORV and Non-highway Vehicle Ac-count, the Marine Fuel Tax Refund Account, and theSnowmobile Account for motor vehicle fuel taxes paid bynon-highway users is increased with each increase in mo-tor vehicle fuel taxes to a total of $0.349 per gallon until July 1, 2031, when the rate will be based on the motor ve- hicle fuel tax rate in effect at that time. The handling loss deduction from the motor vehicle fuel tax is repealed.Weight Fees . Beginning July 1, 2016, weight fees are increased with a scale weigh of up to 14,000 pounds as shown in the table below. Beginning July 1, 2022, an additional $10 weight fee is added, which is deposited 2ESSB 5987 281into the Multimodal Transpor tation Fund unless prior to July 1, 2023, a clean fuel standard policy is initiated or adopted by rule, in which case it is deposited into the Connecting Washington Account. FY = Fiscal Year, July 1 thro ugh June 30 of each year. Under the current law, weight fees increase commen- surate with the license fee by weight but under this this act,the vehicles with a scale weight above fee is capped at $72until 2022, and then $82 . As a result the weight fee for ve- hicles 16,000 and above would decrease. License Fee by Weight . Beginning July 1, 2016, the license fee by weight that is imposed on vehicles with aGVW of 10,000 and less is in creased by $15 to $35. Be- ginning July 1, 2022, an add itional $10 fee is added on ve- hicles with a GVW of less than or equal to 12,000, which is distributed to various accounts within the Motor VehicleFund, consistent with the distributing of other license fees by weight. Beginning July 1, 2016, a freight project fee of 15 per- cent of the license fee by weight is added on vehicles sub-ject to a gross weight that have a GVW of more than10,000 pounds. Proceeds from the fee are deposited in theConnecting Washington Account. Driver-Related Fees . The following fee increases are effective July 1, 2016:The skills exam increases do not impact applicants that intend to drive a school bus. Payment of the CDL knowledge exam fee and the CDL classified skills exam fee entitles the individual to take the test up to two times. If an enhanced driver's license or identicard is issued for a period other than six years, the fee is $9 per year. Proceeds from the driver-related fees are deposited into the Highway Safety Fund un less prior to July 1, 2023, a clean fuel standard policy is initiated or adopted by rule, in which case the additional revenue raised from the driv- er-related fee increases in this act are deposited into theConnecting Washington Account. Administrative and Service Fees on Title and Regis- tration Transactions . Beginning July 1, 2016, the services fees that are due on vehicle related registration and titletransactions is expanded to include vessel related transac-tions. Beginning July 1, 2017, service fees, filing fees, li-cense plate technology fees, and license service fees thatare imposed on other titling a nd registration transactions are also applied to report of sale and transitional owner- ship transactions for a total cost of $8.75 as shown in the table below. The bolded numbers represent fees that arenot currently imposed by location. A report of sale that is received by DOL, the county auditor or other agent, or subagent after 21 days becomeseffective on the day it is rece ived by DOL, the county au- ditor or other agent, or subagent. Studded Tire Fee . Beginning July 1, 2016, a fee of $5 is added to the sale of each new studded tire, of which theseller retains 10 percent and the remainder is deposited tothe Motor Vehicle Fund.

Transportation Benefit Districts . A city or county with overlapping boundaries of a TBD may eliminate theseparate entity status and ass ume the rights, powers, func- tions, and obligations of the TBD. A TBD may impose avehicle fee of up to $40 upon a majority vote of the gov-erning body if a $20 fee has b een in effect for at least 24 months and may increase that fee to $50 upon a majorityvote of the governing body if a $40 fee has been in effectfor at least 24 months. Any increase above $40 is subjectto a referendum. The median income threshold that a TBD may provide a rebate of a vehicle fee is increased from 45percent to 75 percent and a TBD must follow a materialchange process if they change a TBD rebate. Community Transit Sales and Use Tax . A PTBA in a county with a population of 700,000 or more, that alsocontains a city with a popula tion of 75,000 or more that operates a municipal transit system, may impose an addi-tional sales and use tax of up to 0.3 percent with approvalof the voters within the area . Based on the current popu- lation and existing public tr ansportation governing struc- tures, the act would only apply to Community Transit inSnohomish County. Kitsap Transit POF District . The governing body of a PTBA only bordering western Puget Sound with a popula-tion of more than 200,000 - cu rrently only Kitsap Transit, may establish one or more POF districts (Districts) withinthe boundaries of the PTBA. The boundaries of a Districtmay include all or a portion of a city or town if the portion to be included is within the PTBA's boundaries. A Districtis considered an independent taxing authority, and is gov- erned by the existing governing body of the PTBA thatcreates the District. A District is authorized to establish,finance, and provide POF service. The District also hasspecific authority to enter in to contracts for POF service, public-private partnerships, design-build or general con-tractor/construction manageme nt, and other alternative procurement processes. A District may also issue certaingeneral obligation and revenue bonds. Prior to implementing POF service, a District must de- velop a POF investment plan that contains specific ele-ments. In order to provide POF service, a majority of thevoters in the District must approve the POF investment plan and the proposed taxes as part of a single vote. A District may collect the following revenues for the purpose of implementing the POF investment plan: up to a 0.3 percent sales and use tax; a commercial parking ta x for counties with a popula- tion of less than 1 million; tolls for passengers, packages, and parking; and charges or licensing fees for advertising, leasing space for services to POF passengers, and other reve- nue-generating facilities.Sound Transit . The following taxes may be imposed by and within the boundary of an RTA in a county with a population of 1.5 million or more if approved by a major-ity of the voters within the boundary of the RTA: An MVET of up to 0.8 percent of the value of the vehicle may be imposed, except trucks with a GVW of more than 6000 pounds, farm vehicles, and com- mercial trailers. The depr eciation schedule remains the same as the MVET schedule in effect for the existing MVET until the bonds are repaid and then the schedule switches to the schedule that is in effect at the time the MVET is approved by the voters. The rental car sales and use tax that can be imposed is limited to the same ratio as the MVET that is imposed bears to the amount of the MVET that is allowed: The maximum sales and use tax rate is increased by 0.5 percent to a maximum rate of 1.4 percent. A property tax levy of up to $0.25 per $1,000 of assessed value may be imposed. If an RTA imposes any of th e taxes authorized above they are prohibited from receiving state grant funding ex- cept for transit coordination grants. Distributions to Cities and Counties . A quarterly transfer of funds from the Multimodal Transportation Ac- count and the Motor Vehicle Fund that is distributed even-ly to cities and counties is established. Tax Preferences . Alternative Fuel Commercial Vehi- cle Tax Credits (HB 1396). A credit is created against busi- ness and occupation tax and public utility tax for the portion of the purchase price of an alternative fuel com- mercial vehicle. Credits ar e limited to $6 million annually and may be earned through January 1, 2021. A quarterlytransfer is established from the Multimodal Transportation Account to the General Fund in amounts equal to the cred- its taken.

By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally Litzow, Braun, Schoesler, Parlette, Wa rnick, Sheldon, Becker and Brown). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Washington State Ferries (WSF) may use design-build as a contracting option for construction ofnew ferries, whereby design an d construction are complet- ed by the bidder. Current de sign-build laws available to WSF include a provision that any vessels constructed mustbe built in Washington. An independent owners' re presentative is a position used by some entities as a th ird-party intermediary to fa- cilitate construction projects. Their roles may includeproject quality oversight an d change-order management. A 2012 audit of WSF vessel construction costs by the State Auditor's Office contained several recommendationsfor improving vessel construction. Summary: Issuing a Request for Proposals . The Wash- ington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) maynot issue a request for proposals (RFP) for vessels withoutspecific authorization from the Legislature. After July 1,2017, if initial bids on a new vessel are greater than 5 per-cent above the WSDOT engineers' estimate for the project, all bids must be rejected and a new request that is not sub-ject to build-in-Washington requirements is issued. Contracting and Process Requirements for Construc- tion of a New Vessel . WSF must use a design-build pur- chasing process for new auto vessels. WSF also must use an independent owners' representative (IOR) as a third-party intermediary during th e development and construc- tion of the first vessel constructed in a new class. The IORis to serve as WSF's primary advocate and communicatorwith the design-build prop osers, perform project quality oversight, manage change orders, and ensure the contractis adhered to. WSF must use a fixed-price contract, which is defined as a contract that requires the contractor to deliver a proj-ect for a set price. Change orders are allowable but should be used on a limited basis. To accommodate change or-ders, WSF must identify up to 10 percent of the contractprice as contingency funds on vessels powered with natu-ral gas, and up to 5 percent of the contract price as contin- gency funds on all other vessels, in their legislativeappropriation request. The Office of Financial Manage- ment must hold these funds in reserve and may approvetheir release. New vessel contracts must include a requirement that all vessel design and drawings are complete and meet the requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard prior to construction beginning. Other Provisions . Options executed on existing con- tracts for new 144-car vessels are exempt from the require-ments in this act. A study of the state's ferry vessel procurement practic- es by the Washington State Institu te for Public Policy is re- quired, with a report due to the Legislature by December 1, 2016.

By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Parlette, Dammeier, Warnick, Sheldon,Hewitt, Becker, Brown and Bailey). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on EnvironmentHouse Committee on Transportation Background: Current law contains various local govern- ment permit requirements an d procedures applicable to state transportation projects. The Washington State De- partment of Transportation (WSDOT) does not have theoption to appeal permits to supe rior courts prior to an ap-peals process heard by local hearing officers or other local appeals processes. Third par ties have the right to appeal permits issued by cities, coun ties, or code cities. Current law is silent on how long local permitting agencies should take to issue permits. Summary: To the greatest extent practicable, a permit must be issued by a city, county, or code city to WSDOTwithin 90 days of WSDOT completing a permit applica- tion for transportation projects under $500 million. WS- DOT is directed to coordinate a state agency workgroup in 2016 that identifie s issues, laws, and regulations relevant to consolidating and coordi nating National Environmental Policy Act processes with State Environmental Policy Actprocesses. The workgroup mu st report by December 31, 2016, to the Legislature with recommendations for legis-lation or rules that would re duce delays and time associat- ed with review by state and federal agencies, includingsuggestions for new ca tegorical exemptions. For projects that address significant public safety risks, the Shorelines Manageme nt Act is amended to allow WSDOT to begin construction 21 days after the date of fil-ing a permit. WSDOT must provide local governments with a plan that avoids and minimizes impacts to shoreline ecological functions. WSDOT is exempt from obtaining asubstantial development perm it under the Shorelines Man- agement Act as long as the proj ects maintain, repair, or re- place elements within the roadway prism. WSDOT mustprovide written notification of projects and activities au-thorized under this section with a cost in excess of $1 mil- lion before the design or plan is finalized with governmentstakeholders, as well as adjacent property owners.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: July 6, 2015 2ESB 5995 C 16 L 15 E 3 Modifying the transportation sy stem policy goal of mobil- ity.

By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Parlette, Dammeier, Warnick, Sheldon,O'Ban, Hewitt, Becker and Brown). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: The development of environmental impact statements at the Washington State Department of Trans- portation (WSDOT) requires working with a variety of stakeholders and permitting agencies. There is no broad,formalized process for WSDOT to follow in statute that ensures an efficient process th at involves the participation of stakeholders along with various permitting agencies. WSDOT's website tracks co nstruction change orders that exceed $500,000, which may include costs due to de- sign errors. Summary: WSDOT is directed to streamline its permit- ting process by developing an d maintaining positive rela- tionships with permitting agen cies and the Indian tribes. The Legislature directs WSDOT to demonstrate the capac-ity to meet its environmenta l responsibilities. Activities that will achieve this result include having qualified WS- DOT staff supervise all envi ronmental documentation in accordance with WSDOT's project delivery tools, holdingpre-bid meetings for environmentally complex projects,and conducting field inspections to ensure that project ac- tivities comply with permit co nditions and environmental commitments. WSDOT must provide an annual report summarizing violations of environmental pe rmits and regulations to The Department of Ecology and the Legislature on March 1 ofeach year for violations occurring during the preceding year. WSDOT must submit a report to the transportation committees of the Legislatur e detailing engineering errors on highway construction projects resulting in project costincreases in excess of $500,000. An initial report is due within 30 days of the occurrence of the engineering error.A full report must be submitted within 90 days of the oc- currence of the engineering error. The full report must in-clude an assessment of how the engineering errorhappened, what employees ma de the error - (without dis- closing the name of the employee or employees), and whatcorrective action was taken.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: July 6, 2015 VETO MESSAGE ON 2ESSB 5996 July 6, 2015 To the Honorable President and Members, The Senate of the State of Washington Ladies and Gentlemen: I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Section 9, Second Engrossed Substitute Se nate Bill No. 5996 entitled: \"AN ACT Relating to Washington state department of trans- portation projects.\" This bill is one of several substan tive transportation reform bills I am signing into law today. The g oal of this partic ular bill is to streamline the environmental de cision making process for trans- portation projects without sacri ficing environmental protections. Section 9 contains additional re porting requirements for the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) on lean efforts and to complete a Ba ldridge assessment. I wholeheart- edly support adequately measuri ng and reporting on performance metrics and lean management effo rts. The transportation invest- ment package, however, already includes a number of studies and reports WSDOT must complete and prioritize within available funding. The unfunded requirements in Section 9 of this bill unnec- essarily hinder efforts to implem ent this and other reform bills. For these reasons I have vetoed Section 9 of Second Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5996. With the exception of Sectio n 9, Second Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5996 is approved.

By Senate Committee on Tran sportation (originally spon- sored by Parlette, Dammeier, Warnick, Sheldon,O'Ban, Hewitt, Becker and Brown). Senate Committee on Transportation House Committee on Transportation Background: Design-build construction is a con- tracting technique that allows the owner of a project tocontract with a single entity for the design and construc- tion of a project. Some construction work can often beginbefore final design is comple te, providing opportunity for cost savings and expedited project delivery. The morecommon project contract, de sign-bid-build, requires de- sign to be complete before the construction portion of the project is awarded. Current law allows the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) to use design-build construc- tion if construction activities are highly specialized, effi- ciency opportunities through the use of a single entity for design and construction are greater, or significant savingsin project delivery time would be realized. A design-buildproject must be over $10 million, except that WSDOT may also use the design-build process on up to five pilot projects costing between $2 and $10 million. Summary: WSDOT is strongly encouraged to use de- sign-build for public works projects over $2 million. The Joint Transportation Committee (JTC) must con- duct a design-build contrac ting review study to examine WSDOT's implementation and use of design-build con-tracting. The JTC must conven e an expert panel to assist in the study. The expert pa nel must be comprised the fol- lowing stakeholders: a consu ltant and at least two nation- ally recognized experts in the field of design-build project delivery; a representative from the association of generalcontractors; a representative from the American Council of Engineering Companies of Washington; a representa- tive of the Professional and Technical Employees local 17;and a representative from WSDOT. The panel must reportto the Legislature and the Governor by December 1, 2016.An expiration date of June 30, 2017, is provided for thestudy and expert panel. WSDOT must develop a construction program busi- ness plan that (1) incorporates the findings of the JTC de-sign-build contracting re view study; (2) outlines a sustainable level of state-employed engineering staff; (3)includes project delivery methods for design and construc-tion; and (4) makes recommendations on the developmentof a strong-owner strategy.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: July 6, 2015 SSB 5999 C 128 L 15 Addressing the caselo ad forecast council. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senator Darneille). Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Appropriations Background: The Essential Needs and Housing Support (ENHS) program was established in 2011 as a successorprogram to the Disability Life line program. The program provides housing vouchers and essential needs items, e.g.personal and home cleaning supplies, to persons who aredetermined by the Department of Social and Health Ser-vices to be unable to work fo r a period of at least 90 days due to physical or mental incapacity and who are homelessor at risk of homelessness. State funding is providedthrough the Department of Commerce to designated enti-ties to serve a county. The designated entity must be a lo-cal government or community-based organization. Theprogram's priority is to ser ve clients who are actually homeless. RCW 43.185C.220 directs appropriations for the pro- gram to be based on a courtesy forecast by the CaseloadForecast Council (CFC) of the Medical Care Services(MCS) population that is actu ally homeless. MCS is a state-funded program that provides limited medical assis-tance for low-income adults wh o are unable to work for at least 90 days due to a physica l or mental incapacity; how- ever, the majority of this pop ulation has been included in health coverage through Medicaid expansion under theAffordable Care Act. The Legislature funds ENHS as ablock grant. Because the ENHS program also serves per-sons who are at risk, but not actually homeless, the courte-sy forecast does not repres ent the full population being served by the program. The Early Childhood Edu cation and Assistance Pro- gram (ECEAP) was created in 1985. Children eligible forECEAP are those not eligible for kindergarten whose fam- ily income is at or below 110 percent of the federal poverty level - $24,250 for a family of four - and those children whose families are eligible for public assistance. All eli-gible children must be served in the 2018-19 school year. The Department of Early Learning and the Office of Fi-nancial Management report to the Governor and appropri-ate committees of the Legislature the funding necessary toachieve statewide implementation in the 2018-19 schoolyear. Senate 49 0Senate 43 2 House 98 0ESB 6013 288The CFC oversees the preparation of and approves of- ficial state caseloads. Caseloads project the number ofpersons expected to meet entitlement requirements and services for the following: public assistance programs; state correctional institutions; state institutions for juvenile offenders; the common school system; long-term care; medical assistance; foster care; adoption support; and the Washington College Bound Scholarship Program. Summary: The CFC must forecast the number of chil- dren eligible for ECEAP. This requirement is removed from the Department of Early Learning and the Office ofFinancial Management. The requirement for the CFC toprepare a courtesy forecast for the ENHS program is re-moved.Votes on Final Passage: Effective: July 24, 2015 ESB 6013 C 32 L 15 E 3 Providing use tax relief for in dividuals who support char- itable activities.

A retail sale is a sale to thefinal consumer or end user of the property, digital product,or service. If retail sales taxes were not collected when theuser acquired the property, digital products, or services, then use taxes apply to the value of property, digital prod-uct, or service when used in this state. Washington's major business tax is the business and occupation (B&O) tax. The B&O tax is imposed on thegross receipts of business ac tivities conducted within the state without any deduction fo r the costs of doing busi- ness. Amounts received from fu ndraising ac tivities by non- profit organizations and libra ries are exempt from the B&O tax. Similarly, sales made by nonprofit organiza-tions or libraries are exempt from the sales tax. However,those who purchase or receive as a prize an article of per-sonal property from a nonprofit organization or library fora fundraising activity owe use tax to the state if the articleof personal property is worth $10,000 or more.

Be cause this appropriation to the Office of Financial M anagement is no longer necessary, I have ve- toed Section 130, page 27, line 29. Section 204(2)(f), pages 58-59, Department of Social and Health Services, Study on Clin ical Role of Psychiatrists This proviso requires the Departm ent of Social and Health Ser- vices, within existing resources, to contract with a consultant to conduct a workload study and to exam ine the clinical role of psy- chiatrists at the state psychiatric hospitals with respect to patientswho are the subject of both forensic and civil commitment. In ad- dition to findings and recommenda tions on those topics, the con- sultant must identify factors other than compensation that are negatively affecting job retenti on for psychiatrists and make rec- ommendations for addressing thos e issues. Although I welcome additional expertise to address fact ors that may influence job re- tention, funding is not provided fo r the cost of an independent con- tractor. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 204(2)(f). Section 501(1)(f), page 126, Superi ntendent of Pu blic Instruc- tion, School Dist rict Accounting Rules and Reporting This proviso requires the Superint endent of Public Instruction to revise the accounting rules for school districts, as well as ac- counting and financial informati on technology systems, to sepa- rate expenditures of levy and loca l effort assistance revenues from all other expenditures. It also requires ad ditional detailed report- ing of school district compensati on data. The Superintendent esti- mated $400,000 would be needed to implement this proviso, and no funding was provided. In addition, the new rules and systemsmust be in place by the 2016-17 school year, leaving no time for the Superintendent to te st the system with pi lot districts prior to implementation. For these re asons, I have vetoed Section 501(1)(f). Section 950(3), page 257, La w Enforcement Officers' and Firefighters' Retirement System (LEOFF) Distribution in 2017 I support funding for the Loca l Law Enforcement Officers' and Firefighters' Retirement System Benefits Impr ovement Account, and included funding for this ac count in my budget proposal. Rather than provide a General Fund--State appropriation to this account, the Legislature transf erred money from the LEOFF re- tirement system pension fund to the benefits impr ovement account. While I am approving this one-tim e transfer, I am concerned that repeated transfers would undermin e the stability of the pension fund and increase the cost of ex isting pension be nefits for plan members, local governments, and the state of Washington. Be- cause I believe that future fundi ng for the benefits improvement account should be made through General Fund appropriations, asenvisioned by the legisl ation that created that account, I am veto- ing language that indicates legisl ative intent for future transfers from the pension fund. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 950(3). Section 963, page 268, Life Sciences Di scovery Fund The Life Sciences Discovery Fund Authority (LSDFA) provides valuable and innovative re search that improves the health of all Washingtonians. I am disappointed the Legislature could not come to an agreement on providing some new funding for the LSDF A. I am concerned that Section 963 unduly restricts the awarding of grants with money currently in th e Life Sciences Discovery Fund and abruptly ends the work of the LSDF A. This prohibition also re- stricts the LSDFA from using ne w revenue provided by marijuana research licenses pursuant to Se nate Bill No. 5121. We must pro- vide maximum flexibility for the LSDF A to carry out its mission and expend all remaining money in the Life Sciences DiscoveryFund. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 963. Section 1213, page 381, lines 6-7, Health Care Authority, Sav- ings Through Waiver Request The budget assumes that the Health Care Authority (HCA) can achieve General Fund--State saving s in state fiscal year 2015 by, among several savings steps, seek ing a waiver from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This waiver would provide federal flexibility in th e area of innovative reimbursement methods. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has in- dicated that it will not approve this waiver request, and therefore, the savings cannot be achieved. Fo r this reason, I have vetoed Sec- tion 1213, page 381, lines 6-7, and directed HCA to place any un- used funds in reserve status. For these reasons I have vetoed Sections 130, page 27, line 29; 204(2)(f); 501(1)(f); 950(3); 963; and 1213, page of Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 6052.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senator Hill). Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Part I - Reinstating Tax Preferences for High-technology research and Development: In 1994 the Legislature created a program of business and occupa-tion (B&O) tax credits for qualified research and develop-ment (R&D) expenditures, and a sales and use tax deferralprogram for high-technology R&D and pilot-scale manu- facturing facilities. The R&D tax preferences expired Jan-uary 1, 2015. Business and Occupation Tax . The B&O tax is im- posed on the gross receipts of business activities conduct- ed within the state, without any deduction for the costs of doing business. Revenues are deposited in the state gen- eral fund. A business may have more than one B&O taxrate, depending on the types of activities conducted. Ma-jor B&O tax rates include 0.471 percent for retailing; 0.484 percent for manufacturing, wholesaling, and ex-tracting; and 1.5 percent for professional and personal ser-vices, and activities not classified elsewhere. Business and Occupation Tax Credit for High Tech- nology Research and Development . Under the program that expired January 1, 2015, qualified research and devel-opment meant R&D performed within this state in the fields of advanced computing, advanced materials, bio-technology, electronic device technology, and environ- ESSB 6057 290mental technology. In 2014 the B&O tax credit available was 1.5 percent of the greater of (1) qualified R&D expen-ditures that exceed 0.92 percen t of the person's taxable in- come; or (2) 80 percent of the compensation received forconducting qualified R&D under contract. Person wasbroadly defined to include, among other categories, indi-viduals, companies, political subdivisions, nonprofits, and federal agencies. No person could take more than $2 mil- lion per year in credit. Qu alified R&D expenditures that were claimable included those directly incurred as operat-ing expenses, partner or owner compensation, benefits,supplies, and computer expenses. Excluded as claimableexpenses were amounts paid to a person other than a pub- lic educational or R&D ins titution to conduct R&D, and capital costs and overhead, including expenses for landand structures. Any credit over claimed or claimed by anineligible person must be repa id, with interest but not pen- alties. Sales and Use Tax Deferral for Certain Construction- Related Expenses . Until January 1, 20 15, application for deferral of sales and use tax es could be made before initi- ation of, construction of, or acquisition of, equipment ormachinery for an investment project. The Department ofRevenue (DOR) was required to issue a sales and use taxdeferral certificate for taxes due on each eligible invest-ment project: Investment project was defined as an investment in qualified buildings or qua lified machinery and equip- ment, including labor and services rendered in the planning, installation, and construction or improve- ment of the project. Eligible investment project was defined as an invest- ment project that either initiates a new operation or expands or diversifies a current operation by expand-ing, renovating, or equipping an existing facility. In the case of an investment project involving multiple qualified buildings, applica tions must be made for, and before the initiation of construction of, each qual- ified building. Qualified building was defined as construction of new structures and expansion or renovation of exist- ing structures for the purpose of increasing floor space or production capacity used for pilot-scalemanufacturing or qualified R&D. Qualified research and development was defined as R&D performed within this state in the fields of advanced computing, advanced materials, biotechnol- ogy, electronic device technology, and environmental technology. Qualified machinery and equipment was defined as fixtures, equipment, and support facilities integral and necessary to a pilot-scale manufacturing or quali-fied R&D development operation.The lessor or owner of a qualified building may be el- igible for the deferral, only if the lessor by written contract agrees to pass the economic be nefit, in an amount no less than the tax deferred, to the lessee, and the lessee agrees inwriting with DOR to complete the required an nual survey. Annual Survey . Taxpayers claiming tax preferences aimed at creating jobs or in creasing industry competitive- ness were required to file an annual survey with DOR.The annual survey included a report of the tax preference amounts claimed each calendar year and information relat- ed to employment positions and wages in Washington. Inaddition if the annual survey or other information caused DOR to find that an investment project, within seven yearsof being certified as operatio nally complete, was used for a purpose other than qualified R&D or pilot-scale manu-facturing, a percentage of th e deferred taxes were immedi- ately due. The sales tax deferral became a waiver of thetax if the business maintained qualified activities for eight years once the facility w as operationally complete. Part II - Extending the Expiration date of Tax Pref- erences for Food Processing: Manufacturers of fresh fruit or vegetables, seafood products, and dairy productsare eligible for exemptions from the B&O tax. The B&O tax exemptions pr ovide an exemption from the manufacturing B&O tax on the value of products sold by fresh fruit or vegetable, seaf ood product, or dairy prod- uct manufacturers; and, generally, an exemption from re-tailing and wholesaling B& O tax for those products manufactured and sold by th e manufacturer to a customer who transports the product outs ide this state in the normal course of business. These exemptions expire June 30, 2015. When they expire, the income is no lo nger exempt from B&O tax but will become subject to a re duced B&O tax rate of 0.138 percent for the manufacturing, retailing, and wholesaling activities. All businesses clai ming the exemptions are re- quired to electronically file an Annual Tax Incentive Sur-vey by April 30 of the year following the year theexemption was claimed. The Annual Survey provides em- ployment and wage informatio n regarding firms claiming the exemptions and also prov ides the tax savings to indi- vidual firms from claiming the exemptions. Part III - Providing a Sales and Use Tax Exemption for Eligible Server Equipm ent Installed in Certain Data Centers: Sales and Use Tax . Retail sales taxes are imposed on retail sales of most articles of tangible person- al property, digital products, and some services. A retailsale is a sale to the final consumer or end user of the prop-erty, digital product, or service. If retail sales taxes werenot collected when the user acquired the property, digitalproducts, or services, then use taxes apply to the value ofproperty, digital products, or services when used in thisstate. The state, most citie s, and all coun ties levy retail sales and use taxes. The state sales and use tax rate is 6.5 percent. Local sales and use tax rates vary from 0.5 per-cent to 3 percent, de pending on the location.ESSB 6057 291Sales and Use Tax Exemption for Eligible Server Equipment . In 2010 the Legislature enacted Chapter 1, 2010 Laws 1st sp. s (ESB 6789) which provided a salesand use tax exemption for server equipment and power in-frastructure for computer data centers. The exemptionwas to expire on April 1, 2018. In order to qualify, a datacenter must be located in a rural county, have at least 20,000 square feet dedicate d to housing servers, and have commenced construction between April 1, 2010, and be-fore July 1, 2011. Additionally, within six years of con-struction, a qualifying bu siness must have created 35 family wage employment pos itions or three family wage employment positions per 20,0 00 square feet of space. Construction of a data center includes the expansion, ren-ovation, or other improvemen ts made to existing facilities, including leased or rented sp ace. A family wage employ- ment position is a new full-time position at the qualifyingdata center requiring 40 hours of weekly work, or theirequivalent, on a weekly basis an d the wage must be greater than 150 percent of the county 's per-capita income of the county where the qualified data center is located. The exemption applied to the original server equip- ment installed after April 1, 2010, and replacement serverequipment which replaces servers originally exempt fromtax and installed prior to April 1, 2018. In 2012 Legislation was en acted that extended the time for eligible data centers and qualifying tenants of data centers to qualify for the sa les and use tax exemption on server equipment and power infrastructure to those thatcommenced construction between April 1, 2012, and July1, 2015. The exemption time is extended for eligible re- placement server equipment placed in new data centersand for qualifying tenants until April 1, 2020. Part IV - Creating a Pilot Program that Provides Incentives for Investments in Washington State JobCreation and Economic Development: Economic de- velopment policies are design ed to improve the economic wellbeing of a community thr ough efforts that include job creation, job retention, in frastructure improvements, workforce training, tax base enhancements, and improve-ments to quality of life. State and local governments mayutilize a variety of tools to a ttract economic investment in their communities. In Washington there are a variety oftax polices including preferentia l tax rates, credits, exemp- tions, deductions, and deferrals that are designed to en- hance economic activity, create or retain jobs, and attract business investments. For example the High Unemploy- ment County Sales & Use Ta x Deferral/Waiver for Manu- facturing Facilities, establishe d in 2010, en courages job creation in areas with high unemployment by offering cer-tain businesses a sales and use tax deferral on constructionof new buildings or purchases of qualifying machineryand equipment. Businesses that maintain a qualified activ-ity for seven years after completion of the project are nolonger required to repay deferred sales and use taxes. Part V - Continuing Tax Preferences for Alumi- num Smelters: In 2004 the Legislat ure passed a packageof tax preferences for the aluminum industry that were scheduled to expire on January 1, 2007. The tax prefer-ences for the aluminum indu stry include the following: a reduced B&O rate from 0.484 percent to 0.2904 percent for manufacturers of aluminum; a B&O tax credit for the amount of property taxes paid on an aluminum smelter; a sales and use tax credit against the state portion of the tax for personal property, construction materials, and labor and services perfo rmed on buildings and property at an aluminum smelter; and an exemption from the brokered natural gas use tax on gas delivered through a pipeline. In 2006 the Legislature extended the tax preferences to 2012, and again in 2010 th e Legislature extended the tax preferences to 2017. The Citizen Commission for Performance Measure- ment of Tax Preferences (Commission) was established bythe Legislature in 2006. The Commission develops aschedule to review nearly all tax preferences at least onceevery ten years. The Commissi on also schedules tax pref- erences with expiration dates to be reviewed two years be-fore the tax preference expires. Tax preference reviews are conducted by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) ac-cording to the schedule estab lished by the Commission. The aluminum tax incentives were reviewed in 2009.JLARC recommended that the Legislature extend the ex- piration date for these tax preferences - which it did - be-cause the public policy goal of preserving family wagejobs is being maintained, and because the high energy prices that brought about the tax preferences were higherand more volatile than when th e tax preferences were orig- inally enacted. The Commission endorsed th e recommendation to ex- tend the expiration dates and further recommended thatthe Legislature consider est ablishing a final expiration date. JLARC is scheduled to review the aluminum industry tax preferences in 2015. Part VI - Concerning the Definition of Newspaper: In 2008 and again in 2012, the Legislature temporarily re- vised the definition of news paper to include electronic versions of newspapers. The effe ct of this is that both the online version of a newspape r and the physical version of a newspaper are taxed at the B&O rate of 0.35 percent un-til July 1, 2015, and 0.2904 percent thereafter. The defini- tion is set to expire July 1, 2015. If the electronic version of a newspaper is not included in the definition of a newspaper, the B&O tax will apply tothe electronic version based on the revenue-generating ac-tivity. For advertising revenu es the rate of 1.5 percent would apply, and for subscrip tion sales the rate of .471 percent would apply. Part VII - Providing a Reduced Public Utility Tax for Log Transportation Businesses: B&O Tax . Wash-ESSB 6057 292ington's major business tax is the B&O tax. The B&O tax is imposed on the gross recei pts of business activities con- ducted within the state, with out any deduction for the costs of doing business. Revenues are deposited in the stategeneral fund. A business may have more than one B&Otax rate, depending on the ty pes of activities conducted. There are a number of different rates. The main rates are0.471 percent for retailing; 0.484 percent for manufactur-ing, wholesaling, and extracting; and 1.5 percent for pro-fessional and personal services, and activities notclassified elsewhere. Public Utility Tax (PUT) . Income from utility opera- tions is taxed under the PUT an d is in lieu of the B&O tax; other income of the utility firm , e.g. retail sales of tangible personal property, is subject to the B&O tax. Unlike the B&O tax which pyramids, the PUT applies only on sales to consumers. Five different rates apply, depending uponthe specific utility activity. The current rates, includingpermanent surtaxes, are as follows: distribution of water, 5.029 percent; generation or distribution of electrical power, 3.873 percent; telegraph companies, dist ribution of natural gas, and collection of sewerage, 3.852 percent; urban transportation and watercraft vessels under 65 feet in length, 0.642 percent; and railroads, railroad car co mpanies, motor transporta- tion, and all other public service businesses, 1.926 percent. In 2009 the Legislature passed ESSB 6170, which re- duced the usual PUT rate on log hauling from 1.926 per-cent to 1.3696 percent of gross income. That reduced rateexpired in June 2013. Part VIII - Concerning Nonresident Vessel Permits and Taxation: Retail sales taxes are imposed on retail sales of most articles of tang ible personal property, digital products, and some services. A retail sale is a sale to thefinal consumer or end user of the property, digital product,or service. If retail sales taxes were not collected when theproperty, digital products, or services were acquired by theuser, then use taxes apply to the value of most tangible per- sonal property, digital products, and some services whenused in this state. Nonresident individuals purchasing a vessel in Wash- ington or piloting a vessel in to Washington waters may be eligible for a special use pe rmit that exempts the purchase or use of the vessel from sales and use taxation. A use per- mit also satisfies vessel registration requirements adminis-tered by the state Department of Licensing (DOL). A usepermit may be obtained by a nonresident individual pur-chasing or using a vessel in Washington if the vessel is atleast 30 feet in length. A use permit is not renewable and costs $500 for vessels 30 to 50 feet and $800 for vesselsgreater than 50 feet in length. A use permit is valid for 12consecutive months from the date of purchase. A nonres-ident business entity, e.g. co rporation, limited liabilitycompany, partnership, etc., is not eligible to receive a use permit. Generally, a nonresident individual or business entity bringing a vessel into Washington waters does not need toobtain a permit from DOL for up to 60 days if the vessel iscurrently registered in another state or the vessel has a cur- rent U.S. Coast Guard Documentation Paper. If a vesselowner is a nonresident individual and will be operating avessel on Washington waters fo r more than 60 days, the owner may apply for a vessel permit on or before the six-tieth day of the visit to remain in the state for an additional 60 days. The person may renew the vessel permit once foran additional 60 days. When the renewed permit expires,the vessel owner must either register the boat in Washing-ton or remove the boat from Washington waters. A non-resident business entity owning a vessel is not eligible to receive a vessel permit. Part IX - Concerning Distribution and use of Air- craft Excise Taxes: Current law requires the collection of an annual aircraft excise tax. The amount of the tax varies by the type of aircraft and generally ranges from $20 for a home-built aircraft up to $1 25 for a turbojet multi-engine fixed wing plane. Of the taxe s collected, 90 percent is de- posited into the general fund and 10 percent is retained in the aeronautics account to cover administrative expenses.This distribution has been the same since 1987, prior tothat 100 percent of the aircraft excise tax was depositedinto the general fund. The Aviation Division of the Washington State De- partment of Transportation (WSDOT) annually awardsgrants to public use airports in the state for pavement, safe-ty, planning, and security. Awards are funded from theaeronautics account. Aerona utics account state funds are typically used to leverage additional federa l funds beyond those already received by WSDOT. A fuel tax administration bill (SHB 1883) passed in the 2013 legislative session, and which becomes effective July 1, 2015, erroneously e liminated the aeronautics ac- count. Part X - Providing a Business and Occupation Tax Credit for Businesses That Hire Veterans: Washing- ton's major business tax is the B&O tax. The B&O tax is imposed on the gross receipts of all business activitiesconducted within the state, without any deduction for the costs of doing business. Revenues are deposited in thestate general fund. There are several rate categories, and a business may be subject to more than one B&O tax rate,depending on the types of activities conducted. The B&O tax code contains many exemptions and de- ductions for specific types of business activities and reve- nue. Tax credits, which prov ide a dollar-for-dollar offset against tax liability, are also authorized in certain circum- stances. Some existing B&O tax credits were enacted forthe specific purpose of encouraging employment growth.For example, a credit against the B&O tax is provided for firms that create employment positions in rural counties or community empo werment areas.ESSB 6057 293The public utility tax (PUT) applies to the gross in- come derived from the operation of public and privatelyowned utilities. The tax is in lieu of the B&O tax and ap-plies to the genera l categories of tr ansportation and the supply of energy and water. The federal government recently had a program that provided a tax credit for hiring various groups, includingqualified veterans, known as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. It expired December 31, 2013. Part XI - Defining Honey Bee Products and Ser- vices as an Agricultural Product: A B&O tax on the gross receipts of all in-state business activities, except util- ity activities, is imposed on every person who has a sub- stantial nexus to the state for the act or privilege of doingbusiness. The B&O tax does not apply to farmers (personsproducing agricultural products for sale) selling agricul- tural products at wholesale or growing agricultural prod-ucts owned by others, such as custom feed operations. In 2008 and 2013 the Legislature enacted temporary tax exemptions related to apiarists and honey bee prod-ucts. Honey bee products are defined as queen honeybees, packaged honey bees, honey, pollen, beeswax, prop-olis, or other substances obtained from honey bees. Honeybee products do not include manufactured substances orarticles. The following is a lis t of tax exemptions set to ex- pire on July 1, 2017: wholesale sales of honey bee products that do not otherwise qualify for the ge neral agricultural product exemption (B&O); bee pollination services to a farmer using a bee col- ony owned or kept by the person providing the polli- nation services (B&O); sales of honey bees to eligible apiarists (retail); sales of feed to eligible apiarists to raise a bee colony to make honey bee products (retail); use of honey bees by eligible apiarists (use); and use of feed by eligible apiarists in raising a bee col- ony to make honey bee products (use). Part XII - Providing Sales and Use Tax Exemptions to Encourage Coal-Fired Electric Generation Plants orbiomass Energy Facilities to Convert to Natural Gas-Fired Plants: Emission Performance Standards (EPS) were adopted for electric generation plants to meet green-house gas emission standard s adopted in Washington in 2008. In 2009 the Governor issued an executive order di- recting the Department of Ecology (Ecology) to work withthe existing coal-fired plant within Washington to estab- lish an agreed order to apply the EPS to the facility by nolater than December 31, 2025. The agreed order must in-clude a schedule of major decision making and resourceinvestment milestones. In 2011 the Legislature estab- lished a schedule for applying the EPS to the Centraliacoal-fired electric generation facility. State and local sales and use taxes are levied on the sale of tangible personal property and certain services.Exemptions from sales and u se taxes have been estab-lished to create jobs and encourage investments in Wash- ington, including, for exam ple, the exemptions for manufacturing machinery and equipment and investments in aerospace manufacturing facilities. Part XIII - Providing Use Tax Relief for Individu- als Who Support Charitable Activities : Retail sales tax- es are imposed on retail sales of most articles of tangiblepersonal property, digital products, and some services. Aretail sale is a sale to the final consumer or end user of theproperty, digital product, or service. If retail sales taxeswere not collected when the user acquired the property,digital products, or services, then use taxes apply to the value of property, digital product, or service when used inthis state. Washington's major business tax is the B&O tax. The B&O tax is imposed on the gr oss receipts of business ac- tivities conducted within the state without any deduction for the costs of doing business. Amounts received from fundr aising activities by non- profit organizations and libraries are exempt from theB&O tax. Similarly, sales made by nonprofit organiza-tions or libraries are exempt from the sales tax. However,those who purchase or receive as a prize an article of per- sonal property from a nonprofit organization or library fora fundraising activity owe use tax to the state if the articleof personal property is worth $10,000 or more. This ex-emption is set to expire July 1, 2017. Part XIV - Revising a Property Tax Exemption for Veterans with total Disab ility Ratings and Their Sur- viving Spouses or Domestic Partners: All real and per- sonal property is subject to property tax each year based onits value, unless a specific exemption is provided by law. Some senior citizens and persons retired due to disabilityare entitled to a property tax exemption for their principal residences. To qualify a person must be age 61 in the yearof application; retired from employment because of a dis-ability or 100 percent disabled due to military service; own the person's principal residence; and have a disposable in-come of less than $35,000 per year. Persons meeting thiscriteria are entitled to partial property tax exemptions and a property valuation freeze. A surviving spouse or domes-tic partner of a person rece iving the exemption may retain the exemption if the survivor is at least age 57 and other- wise meets the eligibility requirements. Disposable income is defined as adjusted gross in- come, in addition to the followi ng: capital gains; pension and annuity receipts; military pay and benefits other than attendant-care and medical-ai d payments; veterans' bene- compensa tion, and dependency and indemnity compensation; federal Social Security Act and railroad re- tirement benefits; dividend re ceipts; and interest received on state and municipal bonds, less amounts deducted forloss and depreciation.

Retail sales taxes are imposed on retail sales of most articles of tangi-ble personal property, digita l products, and some services. A retail sale is a sale to the final consumer or end user ofthe property, digital product, or service. If retail sales tax-es were not collected when the user acquired the property,digital products, or services, then use taxes apply to the value of property, digital product, or service when used inthis state. The state, most cities, and all counties levy retailsales and use taxes. The state sales and use tax rate is 6.5 percent; local sales and use tax rates vary from 0.5 percentto 3.0 percent, depending on the location. Local Sales Tax Changes . In general, local sales and use tax changes can take effect no sooner than 75 days af- ter the DOR receives notice of the change and only on thefirst day of January, April, July, or October. A local sales and use tax that is a credit against the state tax can take effect no sooner than 30 days after DORreceives notice and only on the first day of a month. Part XVII - Providing Reasonable Tools for the Ef- fective Administration of the Public utility DistrictPrivilege Tax: Public utility district (PUD) privilege tax is an in-lieu-of property tax. It applies to electricity gen- erating facilities for the privilege of operating in this state.The tax rate has several components including gross in-come derived from the sale of electricity, the number ofkilowatt hours of self-generated energy which is either dis- tributed to consumers or reso ld to other utilities, and the wholesale value of energy pr oduced in thermal generating facilities. The PUDs report the facts pertinent to the calculation of the privilege tax to the DOR once per year. The DORcalculates the tax owed and collects the taxes paid by the PUDs. The following distribution requirements apply to the PUD privilege tax collected on electricity generating ordistribution facilities - other than the nuclear power planton the Hanford reservation. The State Treasurer deposits4 percent of the proceeds from the basic tax rate to the stategeneral fund. The remaining 96 percent is distributed as follows: 37.6 percent to the state general fund for public schools; and 62.4 percent to th e counties to be redistribut- ed. A county must distribute funds to each taxing district in the county, except school districts, in a manner the county deems most equitable. However, a city within the county must receive an amount at least equal to 0.75 per-cent of the gross revenues ob tained from the sale of elec- tricity within the city. Part XVIII - Concerning a Hazardous Substance Tax Exemption for Certain Hazardous Substances thatAre Used as Agricultural Crop Protection Productsand Warehoused but not Otherwise Used, Manufac-tured, Packaged, or Sold in this State: The tax imposed on hazardous substances was initiated in the late 1980s, first by the Legislature an d then by Initiative 97.ESSB 6057 295The tax base of the hazardous substance tax created by the Model Toxics Control Act (MCTA) is the wholesalevalue of substances defined as hazardous. It is a privilegetax imposed on the first posse ssion in Washington State of petroleum products under th e federal Comprehensive En- vironmental Response, Comp ensation, and Liability Act; pesticides registered under th e Federal Insecticide, Fungi- cide, and Rodenticide Act; and substances designated byrule by the Washington State Department of Ecology topresent a threat to human health or the environment. The tax rate is 0.7 percent. The proceeds, up to $140 million since July 1, 2013, are deposited into two ac- counts: 56 percent to the st ate toxics control account; and 44 percent to the local toxics control account. Any amount over $140 million is deposite d into the environmental leg- acy stewardship account. The purpose of MCTA is to raisesufficient funds to clean up all hazardous waste sites andto prevent the creation of fu ture hazards due to improper disposal of toxic wastes into the state's land and waters.The 2014 proceeds of $195,010,885 are $3,452,782 lessthan those of 2013. There are exemptions from the hazardous substance tax, one of which includes pe rsons and activities that the state is prohibited from taxing under the United StatesConstitution. This prohibition applies to materials in in-terstate commerce under article 1, section 8, clause 3, of the Constitution. This clause empowers Congress \"to reg-ulate commerce with foreign nations, and among severalstates, and with the indian tribes.\" Agricultural crop protection products that meet the definition of pesticides un der MCTA are sometimes man- ufactured at an out-of-state location and then are shipped to Washington warehouses. Sometimes the product isshipped from the Washington warehouse to a Washington retailer for sale to the Washin gton farmer or certified pes- ticide applicator. These produc ts are subject to the hazard- ous substance tax because they are not items in interstate commerce. A question has arisen when the product is shipped out of Washington from the wareho use. The DOR rules allow the exemption if the product in the warehouse is already owned by the out-of-state reci pient when the product is re- ceived at the warehouse. Under any other shipping scenar-io, DOR levies the tax on th e product even though it is ultimately sold out of state. Part XIX - Concerning the Taxation of Certain Rented Property Owned by Nonprofit Fair Associa-tions: Property Tax . All real and personal property in this state is subject to the property tax each year based on itsvalue, unless a specific exempt ion is provided by law. The tax bill is determined by mu ltiplying the assessed value by the tax rate for each taxing di strict in which the property is located. The county treasure r mails a notice of tax due to taxpayers and collects the tax. Property Tax Exemption Fo r Nonprofit Fair Associa- tions . Generally, the real and personal property of a non- profit fair association that sponsors or conducts a fair orfairs eligible to receive supp ort from the fair fund and al- located by the director of the Department of Agriculture isexempt from property taxation. The property must be usedexclusively for fair purposes. Property Tax Exception . Property that would not oth- erwise qualify may be exempt from taxation if the non-profit fair association had purchased or acquired themajority of such property between 1995 and 1998. Thisexception cannot be claimed after 2018. Leasehold Interest . Leasehold interest means an inter- est in publicly owned real or personal property which ex-ists by virtue of any lease, permit, license, or any otheragreement, written or verbal , between the public owner of the property and a person who would not be exempt fromproperty taxes if that pers on owned the property in fee, granting possession and use, to a degree less than fee-sim- ple ownership. Leasehold Excise Tax . A leasehold excise tax is lev- ied on the act or privilege of occupying or using publiclyowned real or personal property or real or personal prop- erty of a community center th rough a leasehold interest on and after January 1, 1976, at a rate of 12 percent of taxablerent. A tax credit is available against the county tax for the full amount of any city tax imposed on the same taxable event. Part XX - Improving the Administration of Un- claimed Property: The Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (Act) governs the disposition of property that is unclaimed by its owner. A business that holds unclaimed property(holder) must report and transfer the property to the DORafter a holding period set by statute. The holding periodvaries by the type of property, but for most unclaimedproperty, such as abandoned bank accounts, stocks, and bonds, the holding period is th ree years. After the holding period has passed, the holder in possession of the property transfers the property to DOR. A holder who willfullyfails to file a report, or deliver property, as required underthe Act is subject to a $100 per-day penalty plus an addi-tional 100 percent penalty base d on the value of the prop- erty that should have been reported. DOR's duty is to find the rightful owner of the proper- ty, if possible. Most property reported is intangible prop- erty and holders remit the cash value to DOR. With someexceptions, DOR will sell tangible property that is still un- claimed within five years after it is received. State law re- quires DOR to hold stocks, bo nds, and other securities for a period of time - usually three years - before being sold.When the unclaimed property is sold, the sale proceeds aredeposited in the state general fund. The owner of unclaimed property may come forward at any time to claim the property. If the property has al-ready been sold by DOR, the owner is generally entitled to the proceeds of the sale, plus any interest accruing as partof the security, less administrative costs. However, ifabandoned stock or other securities are sold before the ex-piration of the three-year holding period by DOR, the owner is entitled to the greater of the market value of theESSB 6057 296security at the time the claim is made or the proceeds of the sale, less any administrative costs. Summary: Part I - Extending the Expiration Date of Tax Preferences for Food Processing: The B&O tax ex- emptions for food processors are extended from July 1, 2015, to July 1, 2025.

Part III - Creating a Pilot Program that Provides Incentives for Investments in Washington State JobCreation and Economic Development: The Invest in Washington pilot program is est ablished to evaluate the ef- fectiveness of providing a tax incentive for businesses that invest in manufacturing fac ilities and equipment and rein- vest those tax savings in employee training programs. Thepilot program consists of up to five qualified industrial fa- cilities, of which at least two must be located in easternWashington. An eligible inve stment project includes up to $10 million in sales and use tax on construction costs orpurchases of qualified machinery and equipment. Amounts paid for the construc tion of qualified buildings, machinery, and equipment are eligible for a sales and use tax deferral.

There is no interest charged on deferred taxes, and the taxe s may be repaid over a ten- year period in equal annual payments.Deferred taxes, when repaid , are deposited in the new- ly created Invest in Washingt on Account. The Invest in Washington Account, administ ered by the State Board for Community and Technical Colleg es, must be used to sup- port customized job training programs, job skills pro-grams, job readiness training, workforce professionaldevelopment, and to assist employers with state-approvedapprenticeship programs for manufacturing and produc- tion occupations. The DOR must notify the State Treasur-er by June 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, the amount ofrepaid deferred taxes contribute d to the Invest in Washing- ton Account. The JLARC must measure the effectiveness of the credit for creating or retaining jobs and providing fundingfor job training. Part IV - Continuing Tax Preferences for Alumi- num Smelters: The aluminum industry tax preferences that are set to expire in 2017 are extended for ten years to2027. A tax preference statement is included that directs JLARC to measure the effectiveness of the exemption inpreserving employment positio ns within the industry by evaluating the change in the number of aluminum industryemployment positions in Washington State.

A veteran is a person who has received ageneral discharge under honorable conditions, including adischarge for medical reasons with an honorable record, oris currently serving honorably; and who has served as amember in any branch of the armed forces, including theNational Guard and armed fo rces reserves. Unemployed means that the veteran was unemployed for at least 30days immediately preceding the date on which the veteranwas hired by the person claiming the credit. The credit isequal to 20 percent of wages and benefits paid up to a max-imum of $1,500 for each qu alified employment position filled by an unemployed vetera n. The credits are available on a first-in-time basis not to exceed $500,000 in any fis- cal year. Credits disallowed in one year can be carriedover to the next fiscal year. Priority is given to credits car- ried over from a previous fiscal year. Credits may be earned fo r tax reporting periods through June 30, 2021, and no credits may be claimed afterJune 30, 2022.

If, in its review, it finds that the number of unem-ployed veterans has decreased by 30 percent, then the Leg-islature intends to extend the expiration date of the credits. Part X - Defining Honey Bee Products and Services as an Agricultural Product: The definitions of agricul- tural product and farmer are amended to include apiaristsand honey bee products. Therefore, the tax exemptionsprovided to agricultural prod ucts and farmers are extended to apiarists and honey bee products and are intended to bepermanent.

Part XIII - Concerning the Taxation of Certain Rented Property Owned by Nonprofit Fair Associa-tions: Property Tax Exception . The exception for proper- ty purchased or acquired by the nonprofit fair associationfrom a county or a city between 1995 and 1998 does notexpire after 2018. If any portion of the property is know-ingly rented for more than 50 days, the exemption still ap-plies but the rental income is subject to leasehold excisetax. Leasehold Interest . Leasehold interest also includes portions of property owned by a nonprofit fair associationexempt from property tax but rented for periods of 50 daysor more. Leasehold Excise Tax . The leasehold excise tax ap- plies to the rental income of nonprofit fair association- owned land rented for 50 or more days. Taxable rental in-come or rent means contract rent. The rents or donationsreceived for the use of the re nted property must be reason- able and may not exceed the maintenance and operationexpenses of the property. Part XIV - Improving the Administration of Un- claimed Property: The penalty provisions of the Act are restructured. The current 10 0 percent penalty for willful failure to file a report or pr ovide notice to apparent prop- erty owners is replaced w ith the followi ng penalties: 10 percent for failure to f ile a report or pay or deliver property under a report; and 10 percent assessment pe nalty with an additional 5 percent penalty if the assessment is not paid by the due date. Provides immunity for inte rest and late penalties for holders that voluntarily repo rt and pay or deliver un- claimed property to the Department of Revenue beforeNovember 1, 2016. the holder must file a completed waiv-er requires with the Department before November 1, 2016. Gift certificates presumed abandoned and compliant with the gift certificate laws do not need to be reported as unclaimed property. DOR may publish notice to apparent owners of un- claimed property on the online version of a printed news-paper of general circulation. Enforcement action on assessments is subject to a three-year statute of limitation. Holders must file reports of lost property and remit funds to DOR electronically beginning July 1, 2016. DOR2ESSB 6080 298may waive this requirement for good cause, which is de- fined as a circumstance or condition that prevents the holder from electronically filing reports or remitting pay-ments, or a DOR determinatio n that relief from the elec- tronic filing requirement supports the efficient or effectiveadministration of the Act. A refund process is established allowing holders to re- acquire erroneously reported and delivered property, sub- ject to a six-year limitation period. A review and appealprocess is established, includ ing appeal rights to Thurston County Superior Court, for asse ssments or denials for a re- fund or the return of property. DOR may waive or canceldelinquent penalties and inter est under certain circum- stances. All unclaimed amounts and pr operty identified in any assessment issued by DOR must be paid or delivered with-in 30 days of issuance. If a petition for review of an as- sessment is filed and receive d in writing by DOR before the due date of the assessm ent, only the uncontested amounts and property must be paid or delivered to the de- partment within 30 days of issuance. DOR's authority to enter into settlement agreements with holders is clarified. Information obtained duri ng examinations is confi- dential, except as necessary for the administration of theAct.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: July 1, 2015 June 30, 2015 (Part XII)August 1, 2015 (Part VII) September 1, 2015 (Parts IV, VI, VIII, and XIX) October 1, 2016 (Part X)January 1, 2016 (Section 1105) January 1, 2019 (Part XX except section 2004) January 1, 2022 (Section 2004) Contingent (Section 2108) 2ESSB 6080 C 41 L 15 E 3 Financing public school fa cilities necessary to support state-funded all-day kindergarten and class size reductionin kindergarten through third grade. By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Dammeier, Keiser, Honeyford, Conwayand Pedersen). Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Capital Budget Background: The state Legislature enacted class-size re- duction goals to reach one teacher to 17 students in kinder-garten through third grade (K-3) by the 2017-18 school year. A potential barrier to reaching the intent of thoseclass-size reduction objectives is a shortage of classrooms. The school construction assistance program (SCAP), administered by the Office of Superintendent of Public In- struction (OSPI), provides school districts with financialassistance to expand and mode rnize school facilities. The amount of financial assistance is based on a formula that considers the amount of square feet needed for the number of students in elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools; multiplied by an assumed cost per squarefoot for construction; multiplie d by a state fund matching rate. The SCAP match rate depends on the relative valueof assessed property in the dist rict per student. SCAP only funds permanent school buildings, not portables. The state Constitution authorizes school districts to is- sue bonds for the purpose of constructing schools.Schools are owned, designed, constructed, and maintainedby local school districts. Authorization of general obliga-tion bonds require a 60 percent majority vote. Summary: K-3 Class Size Reduction Construction Grant Pilot Program . To help school dist ricts expand the number of classrooms in support of the K-3 class-size reduction objective, the K-3 class size reduction construction grantpilot program is created. The pilot program will be admin-istered by OSPI. The K-3 class-size reduction grants are determined by a four-step process: A verified count of necessary added classrooms in a district must be completed by the Washington State University extensio n energy office. If the number of needed classrooms is 12 or more, it is assumed that the added classrooms are provided by constructing a new school. If fewer than 12 class- rooms are needed, it is as sumed that the additional classrooms are provided with modular or portable classroom additions. The state grant amount must be calculated. If a new school is required, the cost is calculated at $615,083 per added classroom. If modular or portable class- room additions are required, the cost is estimated at$210,000 per classroom. These amounts are in 2014 dollars and are inflated based on inflation rates assumed in the SCAP budget. The state match rate is the SCAP match rate plus 20 percent of the district's rate of free and reduced school lunch students. The school district must be ready to proceed, and the Office of Financial Management (OFM) must con- firm the grant calculations prepared by OSPI before K-3 class-size reduction grants can be awarded. Prioritization criteria is pr ovided if applications for additional classrooms exceed the funding available for the pilot program. OSPI must an nually report to OFM and the appropriate legislative comm ittees information about theSenate 10 House 77 212ESB 6089 299grants, grantees, project statuses, and class size reductions due to the new classrooms. The pilot program expires July1, 2017. Development of K-3 Class Size OFM, and the Legisl ature, will recommend an improved funding formula for calculating future K-3 class size reduction grants by December 1, 2015, a process forcreating a single prioritized lis t for future K-3 class size re- duction grants, and statutory and rule changes to ensureappropriate coordination betw een the K-3 class size reduc- tion grants and the SCAP. These recommendations will be provided to OFM and the ap propriate legislative commit- tees. Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: July 14, 2015 2ESB 6089 C 33 L 15 E 3 Concerning the health benefit exchange. By Senator Hill.Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Health Care & Wellness Background: The Health Benefit Exchange (Exchange) is established in statute as a public-private partnership to serve as an insurance marketplace for individuals, fami-lies, and small businesses. The Exchange, through theWashington Healthplanfinder , provides access to multiple insurance plans and federal premium tax credits for indi-viduals with incomes between 138 and 400 percent of thefederal poverty level. RCW 43.71.030 requires the Exchange be self-sus- taining after December 31, 20 14. Self-sustainability in- cludes federal grants, federa l premium tax subsidies and credits, charges to health carri ers, premiums paid by en- rollees, and premium taxes paid on qualified health plans. Other than federal grants, the Legislature determines the expenditure leve l allowed by the Exchange. The Ex- change is funded with prem ium taxes on qualified health plans sold through the Exchange and federal Medicaidfunds. If the tota l funds generated th rough premium tax and other funds deposited in the dedicated account, alongwith other funds authorized by the Legislature, such asMedicaid, do not provide the level of funding authorizedby the Legislature to fund the operations of the Exchange,the Exchange is allowed to collect assessments from qual-ified health plan carriers to make up the difference be-tween the amount authorized by the Legislature and the amount available through premium tax and other availablefunds. The Legislature currently appropriates premium taxes and Medicaid funding, but not federal grants. The original duties of the Exchange allowed for aggre- gation of premiums collected from individuals purchasingqualified health plans. These premiums were collected atthe Exchange and forwarded to carriers. This process be-gan January 1, 2014. Throughout the first year of opera-tions, the Exchange encountered a number of systemdifficulties including transmis sion of payment information to health plans that resulted in coverage and claims prob- lems for individuals and carriers. In December 2014, after review of several options, the Exchange board voted to cease premium aggregation andremove premium collection and invoicing from the indi-vidual Exchange. The project planning and system rede-sign have begun for the 2016 open enrollment period. Summary: Additional reporting responsibilities are cre- ated for the Health Benefit Exchange, including a five-year spending plan that iden tifies potential reductions in Exchange spending; metric s that capture the current spending levels and five-year benchmarks for spending re-ductions; detail capturing the an nual cost of operating per enrollee; and a strategic plan for the development, mainte- nance, and improvement of Ex change operations that in- clude comprehensive five-yea r and ten-year plans with defined outcomes and goals, as well as detailed salary andexpense reports. The five-year spending pl ans must identify specific reductions in the following areas: call center, information technology, and staffing, and must be submitted by Janu- ary 1, 2016, to the Legislature, the Governor's Office, andthe Board, with annual updat es. The metrics must be de- veloped by January 1, 2016, and must be posted on theweb site, and quarterly updates must be provided to the ap-propriate committee of the Legislature and the Board. Ad-ditional budget detail with the annual cost of operating, per enrollee, must be tracked and reported to the Legisla-ture and the Board on an annual basis. The strategic plan for the development, maintenance, and improvement of Exchange operations must be devel-oped and must include comprehensive five-year and ten-year plans with defined outcomes and goals; plans forachieving the outcomes; strate gy for achieving st akeholder and external com- munication plans; the identification of funding sourcesand a plan for allocation; a detailed report on salaries ofall current employees; salary , overtime, and compensation policies; expense reports with beginning and ending fundbalance by fund source; any contracts or contract amend-ments; and a description of staff required for operation ofthe program broken out by full-time positions, contractedemployees and temporary staff. The strategic plan must besubmitted by September 30, 2015, and annually thereafter,and the expense reports mu st be submitted quarterly.Senate 42 7 Senate 44 1 House 98 0ESB 6092 300The Exchange must verify qualifying documentation for enrollees seeking special enrollment due to a qualify- ing event as established by the Insurance Commissioner. Notification requirements ar e modified related to en- rollees that enter a grace peri od, as defined in federal law for Exchange enrollees who receive a premium tax creditand miss premium payments. The Exchange must check eligibility for enrollees in the grace period to determine if the enrollee may be eligible for Medicaid, and must con- duct outreach with Medicaid information. Health care providers may encourage the enrollee in a grace period topay delinquent premiums and provide information on the impact of nonpayment of pr emiums on access to health care services. Issuers of qualified health plans must in-clude a statement in a delinquency notice to the enrolleeexplaining the impact of nonpayment of premiums, and in-clude a statement in the term ination notice when the grace period is exhausted about other coverage options such asMedicaid, and how to report ch anges in income or circum- stances and any deadlines. Upon transfer of premium col-lection to the qualified health plans, each qualified health plan must provide detailed re ports on enrollees in the grace period data to enable the Exchange to complete re- ports to the Legislature.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 ESB 6092 C 6 L 15 E 2 Adding certain commissioned court marshals of county sheriff's offices to the definition of uniformed personnelfor the purposes of public em ployees' collective bargain- ing. By Senator Roach.Senate Committee on Ways & Means House Committee on Labor Background: Employees of cities, counties, and other political subdivisions bargain their wages and workingconditions under the Public Employee's Collective Bar- gaining Act (PECBA). For certain uniformed personnel, PECBA provides for binding interest arbitration if negoti-ations for a contract reach im passe and cannot be resolved through mediation. Under the interest arbitration process, the director of the Public Employment Relations Commis- sion (PERC), in consultation with the mediator, certifies alist of unresolved mandatory subjects of bargaining for animpartial third-party arbitrat or to consider and resolve. Uniformed personnel currently entitled to interest arbitra- tion as a process for dispute resolution include police offi-cers and state troopers, certain correctional employees, firefighters, security forces at a nuclear power plant, and publicly employed advanced life support technicians. Superior and district courts are authorized by statute to collect filing fees and other fees for court services. De- pending on the type of filing and court, revenue from court fees is shared with the state. In every district court, thereis a small claims department to hear cases to recoverymoney only if the amount claimed does not exceed $5,000.The statutory filing fee for a small claims action is $14 andcounty legislative authorities are allowed to impose a sur- charge up to $15 for the purpose of funding dispute reso-lution centers. Between July 1, 2009, and July 1, 2013, the state imposed a $10 surcharge on each small claims action, of which 25 percent was retain ed by the county and 75 per- cent was remitted to the State Treasurer for deposit into the judicial stabilization trust account. Summary: Court marshals of any county are added to the list of uniformed personnel entitled to use interest arbitra-tion under PECBA, provid ed the marshals are: employed by, trained for, and commissioned by the county sheriff; and charged with the respon sibility of enforcing laws, protecting and maintainin g security in all county- owned or contracted property, and performing any other duties assigned to them by the county sheriff or mandated by judicial order.

By Senate Committee on Ways & Means (originally spon- sored by Senators Becker, L itzow, Parlette, Bailey, Hill, Fain, Dammeier, Brown, Rivers, Roach and McAuliffe). Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: Life Sciences Discovery Fund . In 2005 the Washington Legislature created the Life Sciences Discov-ery Fund Authority with the purpose of promoting life sci-ences research to foster a preventive and predictive vision of the next generation of hea lth-related innovations, to en- hance the competitive position of Washington in this sec- tor of the economy, and to improve the quality and delivery of health care for th e people of Washington. TheSenate 26 22 Senate 41 3 House 96 2 Senate 38 10 Senate 34 10 Senate 35 9 House 62 33SSB 6134 301Authority is governed by an 11-member board, with seven members appointed by the Go vernor and four members appointed by the Legislature. Using funds from a 1998settlement with tobacco compan ies and various states, the Authority funded a broad spectrum of life sciences re-search. Tobacco settlement funds for research grants wereexpected to be available through 2017. Tobacco Use Surcharges . In the 2013-15 biennial op- erating budget, the Legislatur e directed the Public Em- ployment Benefits Board (PEBB) to implement a $25 permonth tobacco use surcharge for state employee memberswho use tobacco products, which includes cigars, ciga-rettes, chewing tobacco, snuff, and other tobacco products.Tobacco surcharges are used to discourage use of tobaccoproducts and cover additional health care costs associated with tobacco use. Under the PEBB surcharge program,users of tobacco products have ceased using tobacco prod-ucts for two months or have enrolled in the members' med- ical plans' tobacco cessation program. Summary: Cancer Research Endowment Authority . The cancer research endowment authority (Authority) is creat-ed. The Authority has general powers. The Authority must have a 13-member board of trustees appointed by the Governor. The trustees serve terms of four years and may only be appointed for up to two consecutive terms. Mem- bers are representatives of re search universities, cancer re- search institutions, patient advocacy organizations, businesses engaged in commercialization of life sciencesor cancer research, health care delivery systems, the Leg-islature, fund dono rs, and the public. The Authority must develop and annually update a plan for the allocation of projected funds. The Authoritymust issue an annual report to the public including the grants that have been awarded, associated research and ac-complishments, cancer preven tion efforts, and the future program direction. The Auth ority must include an endow- ment plan for the ongoing support of the Authority in itsinitial report. The Authority and Commerce must retainthe services of an independent auditor to conduct a perfor- mance audit of the program and the program administratorat least once every three years. A program administrator will provide services to the Authority. Duties of the program administrator includesoliciting grants, gifts, and donations; managing funds;distributing grants; and implementing other activities di-rected by the Authority. Cancer Research Program . The Authority will over- see a cancer research endowment program. The purposeof the program is to make gran ts to public and private en- tities, including commercial entities, to fund or reimbursethe entities for cancer research to be conducted in the state. The Authority must establish one or more scientific re-view and advisory committees for the purposes of evaluat- ing grant proposals for cancer research and makingrecommendations for funding. CARE Fund . The program administrator must also establish the CARE fund outsid e the state treasury for the deposit of grants and contributions received from publicand private sources. Assets in the CARE fund are not con- sidered state revenue. Funds must be used to fund grants for the cancer research progra m. The program administra- tor must take such action as necessary to enable the CAREfund to accept charitable contributions. Cancer Research Endowment Fund Match Transfer Account . The cancer research endowment fund match transfer account is created in the custody of the State Trea-surer. Funds in the account are used to provide matching funds for the CARE fund and administrative costs. The Director of Commerce may make expenditures from theaccount for deposit into the CARE fund upon proof ofnonstate or private contributions to the CARE fund. Ex-penditures may not exceed the to tal amount of nonstate or private contributions. Tobacco Tax Enforcement . Beginning July 1, 2016, the cancer research endowment fund match transfer ac-count may receive up to $10 million each fiscal year from tax collections and penalties generated from enforcement of state taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products.The program administrator may provide technical assis-tance, information, and traini ng to private employers and other potential donors to esta blish programs that facilitate charitable contributions to th e CARE fund, including to- bacco use surcharge programs.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 SSB 6134 C 34 L 15 E 3 Exempting pretrial electronic alcohol monitoring pro- grams from statutory limitations on pretrial supervision costs. By Senate Committee on Law & Justice (originally spon- sored by Senator Padden). Senate Committee on Law & Justice Background: Costs in criminal cases are expenses spe- cially incurred by the state in prosecuting the defendant or in administering the deferred prosecution program or pre-trial supervision. They can not include expenses inherent in providing a constitutionally gu aranteed jury trial or ex- penditures in connection with the maintenance and opera-tion of government agencies that must be made by thepublic irrespective of specific violations of law. The court may require a defendant to pay costs. Costs may be imposed only upon a convicted defendant, exceptfor costs imposed up on a defendant's entry into a deferredSenate 45 1 House 98 0ESSB 6138 302prosecution program, costs imposed upon a defendant for pretrial supervision, or costs imposed upon a defendant forpreparing and serving a warrant for failure to appear. Ex- penses incurred for serving of warrants for failure to ap- pear and jury fees may be included in costs. Costs for preparing and serv ing a warrant for failure to appear may not exceed $100. Costs for administering adeferred prosecution may not exceed $250. Costs for ad-ministering a pretrial supervision may not exceed $150. Costs of incarceration imposed on a defendant con- victed of a misdemeanor or a gross misdemeanor may notexceed the actual cost of incarce ration. In no case may the court require the offender to pay more than $100 per dayfor the cost of incarceration. Payment of other court-or- dered financial obligations, in cluding all legal financial obligations and costs of supervision take precedence overthe payment of the cost of incarceration ordered by the court. The court cannot order a defendant to pay costs unless the defendant is or will be able to pay them. In determin- ing the amount and method of payment of costs, the courtmust take account of the financial resources of the defen-dant and the nature of the burden that payment of costswill impose. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount due will impose manifest hardship on the defendant or the defendant's immediatefamily, the court may remit all or part of the amount due incosts, or modify the method of payment. In State v. Hardtke , the defendant was required to wear an alcohol monitoring bracele t while waiting for trial. He wore the bracelet as required, but objected to paying forthe cost. Upon conviction, th e trial court imposed the cost of $3,972 for pretrial alcohol monitoring. The Court ofAppeals affirmed, holding that Superior Court CriminalRule 3.2 gave the trial cour t authority to require that Hardtke pay the cost because th e court rule authorized the trial court to order pretrial electronic monitoring. The Washington State Supreme Court disagreed. The court found that sentencing issues authorizing costs aresubstantive rather than proced ural, so they are controlled by statute rather than court rule. While pretrial supervi-sion is not statutorily defined, the definition of pretrial re-lease program includes supe rvision which specifically includes work release, day monitoring, or electronic mon-itoring. By statute, costs assessed for administering pretri-al supervision may not exceed $150. The court held thatthe trial court exceeded its st atutory authority when it im- posed the $3,972 cost fo r electronic monitoring. Summary: The $150 limitation on costs for pretrial su- pervision does not apply to tho se for pretrial electronic al- cohol monitoring, drug monito ring, or the 24/7 sobriety program. In cases involving driving under the influence orbeing in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence, if electronic monitoring or alcohol absti-nence monitoring is ordered, the court must specify (1)who will provide the monitori ng services, (2) the termsunder which the monitoring is performed, and (3) upon conviction, the court may requ ire as a condition of the sen- tence that the defendant re imburse the providing agency for the costs of the electron ic monitoring or abstinence monitoring.Votes on Final Passage: Second Special Session Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015 ESSB 6138 C 5 L 15 E 3 Increasing state revenue through improved compliance methods and elimina ting tax preferences for royalties and certain manufacturing equipment.

Senate Committee on Ways & Means Background: PART 1 - Preferential Business & Occu- pation (B&O) Tax Rate for Royalty Income: Currently, royalty receipts are apportione d using a single factor re- ceipts method and taxed at a rate of 0.484 percent. The0.484 percent rate was adopted in 1998 (lowered from 1.5percent) to align software ro yalty receipts with the rates for software manufacturing. Royalty income is compen- sation for the use of intangib le personal property such as copyrights, patents, licenses, franchises, trademarks, andsimilar items. PART 2 - Nexus: As currently interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, the commerce clause of theUnited States Constitution prohibits states from imposingsales or use tax collection oblig ations on out-of-state busi- nesses unless the business has a substantial nexus with thetaxing state. Under the Court's decision in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota (1992), a substantial nexus for sales and use tax collection purposes requires that the taxpayer have aphysical presence in the taxing state. Physical presencecan be established through a taxpayer's own activities inthe taxing state, or indirectly, through independent con-tractors, agents, or other representatives that act on behalfof the taxpayer in the taxing state. Currently, Washington cannot impose wholesaling B&O tax on sales of goods that originate outside the stateunless the goods are: received by the purchaser in this state; and the out-of-state seller has physical presence nexus (i.e., the same physical nexus requirement that is used for sales tax purposes). Senate 41 3 Senate 42 2 House 92 6SB 6145 303Both the criteria must be me t for the seller to be sub- ject to Washington B&O taxation. In 2010 Washington adopted an economic presence test for nexus with respect to service-related activities but not wholesaling or retailing ac tivities. For these classifi- cations, a business does not n eed to have a physical pres- ence to have nexus and be subject to Washington tax. Economic nexus is established by having sales in excess of $267,000 to Washington custom ers. (The threshold is ad- justed from year-to-year based on inflation.) PART 3 - Manufacturing Machinery Equipment Exemption for Software Manufacturers: In 1995, the legislature enacted legislatio n that exempted machinery and equipment used by a manufacturer in a manufacturingoperation from the retail sales ta x. This exemption applies to firms that manufacture software. Summary: PART 1 - Preferential B&O Tax Rate for Royalty Income: The preferential B&O tax rate for roy- alty income is eliminated. Th is income is subject to the 1.5 percent B&O tax rate and would qualify for the in-creased small business credit. PART 2 - Nexus: The \"physical presence\" standard is eliminated and replaced with an \"economic nexus\" stan- dard for wholesaling activities. Wholesale businesses thatlack physical nexus but gross $267,000 or more in sales toWashington customers, $50,000 in payroll, or $50,000 inproperty in any calendar year are subject to B&O tax. For purposes of collecting sales tax and paying the B&O tax, remote sellers are d eemed to have nexus in this state if the remote seller ente rs into an agreement with a Washington resident for a commission or other consider-ation to directly or indirectly refer potential customers, by a link on an Internet website or other method, to the remote seller. The remote seller must also have at least $10,000in sales to this state in the preceding year. PART 3 - Manufacturing Machinery Equipment Exemption for Software Manufacturers: The manufac- turing machinery and equipm ent exemption does not ap- ply to: an affiliated group or member of an affiliated group that was registered to do business in Washington prior to 1981; the affiliated group has a combined employment exceeding forty thousand full and part time employ- ees in the state; and the business activities of the affiliated group primar- ily include the developmen t, sales, and licensing of computer software and services. PART 4 - Late Payment Penalties: The penalties for late payment of excise taxes are increased 4 percent ateach level of delinquency. The penalty rates will go from 5 percent, 15 percent, and 25 percent to 9 percent, 19 per-cent, and 29 percent. Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: August 1, 2015 September 1, 2015 (Part II) SB 6145 C 42 L 15 E 3 Delaying for two years the hi gh school graduation require- ment of meeting the state standard on the high school sci-ence assessment. By Senators Fraser, Kohl-We lles, Pedersen, Hatfield, Science Assessment Re- quirements . Under federal and state law, Washington school districts must assess student achiev ement on the state science standards once in the elementary grades, once in the middle school gr ades, and once in the high school grades. State Assessments Required for High School Gradua- tion. Under state law, since 2008 students have been re- quired to meet the state stan dard on specified statewide high school assessments to graduate from a Washingtonpublic high school. This requ irement is in addition to oth- er state-established high school graduation requirements.Current law requires that beginning with students in thehigh school graduating class of 2015 students must alsomeet the state standard on the statewide science assess-ment, which is an end-of-course biology assessment. School Calendars . According to the website of the Of- fice of Superintendent of Public Instruction, the last day ofschool in the 2014-15 school year for all 295 school dis-tricts occurred in June 2015. Summary: Legislative intent is pr ovided to delay for no more than two years, but not to eliminate, the high school graduation requirement of meeting the state standard onthe high school science assessment. Instead of students in the graduating class of 2015 be- ing required to meet the state standard on the state science assessment to graduate from hi gh school, the requirement to meet the state standard on the science assessment is de-layed for two years. The dela y applies retroactively to stu- dents in the graduating class of 2015. Beginning with the graduating class of 2017 students must meet the state stan-dard on the state science as sessment to graduate from high school.Votes on Final Passage: Third Special Session Effective: October 9, 2015Senate 35 10 House 60 38 Senate 39 5 House 89 1SJM 8008 304SJM 8008 Calling for a National Guard St ryker Brigade stationed on the west coast.

Thesunset process provides for the automatic termination of selected state agencies, program s, units, subunits, and stat- utes. Unless provided otherwis e in legislation, the entity made subject to sunset revi ew must formulate the perfor- mance measures by which it will ultimately be evaluated.One year prior to an automatic termination, the Joint Leg- islative Audit and Review Committee and the Office of Fi-nancial Management conduct program and fiscal reviews.These reviews are designed to assist the Legislature in de-termining whether agencies and programs should be ter-minated automatically or reau thorized in either their current or a modified form pr ior to the termination date. Summary: Legislation modified the sunset review for al- ternative processes used by th e University of Washington for awarding contracts rega rding buildings and facilities for critical patient care or specialized medical research. The termination date for the processes is extended from June 30, 2015, to June 30, 2017. The repeal date for thestatutes establishing the processes is extended from June30, 2016, to June 30, 2018. Programs for which Sunset Review is Extended The sunset review is extend ed for alternative processes used by the University of Washington for awarding con-tracts regarding buildings an d facilities for critical patient care or specialized medical research: 2EHB 1115 (C 3 L2015 E3).Senate 48 0 OVERVIEW Operating Only Background to the 2015-17 Budget Context The Legislature entered the 2015 session seeing increased revenue along with rising maintenance level costs (the cost of carrying forward the ongoing 2013-15 budget programs and services into the 2015-17 biennium). Other pressing issues included the need to consider court cases related to mental health, the Supreme Court's McCleary decision (K-12 funding), and other fiscal and policy issues. Projected Revenue Forecasted revenue in the Near General Fund-State and Opportunity Pathways accounts (NGF-P) based on the May 2015 forecast, before 2015 legislation, is projected to increase from $34.28 billion in the 2013-15 biennium to $37.45 billion in the 2015-17 biennium. This is an increase of approximately $3.17 billion. In addition, the operating budget for 2015-17 assumes legislation that would decrease revenue by $37 million. Projected Spending At the same time, the cost of continuing current programs and meeting other statutory obligations increased as well. The estimated maintenance level cost for 2015-17 is $39.2 billion. This is $5.4 billion higher than the $33.8 billion appropriated for the 2013-15 biennium. Net increases in K-12 accounted for $4.3 billion of the $5.4 billion, or about 80 percent of the maintenance level increase from the previous biennium. The 4.3 billion increase includes $2.0 billion NGF-P being the estimated cost to implement Initiative 1351 (I-1351) (adopted by the voters in November 2014), $741 million for materials, supplies and operating costs required by House Bill 2776 (Chapter 236, Laws of 2010) and related to the McCleary decision; and funding for Initiative 732 (education cost-of-living increases), increased enrollment, and continuation of funding for basic education enhancements previously made in the 2013-15 biennium. The operating budget for 2015-17 also includes $2.0 billion in additional policy enhancements. Some of the largest items include: 1) $744 million for K-12 public schools (in addition to the $4.3 billion maintenance level increase described above); 2) $351 million for higher education including financial aid, compensation increases, and a tuition reduction; 3) $158 million for early learning and related child care programs; 4) $104 million for mental health related programs; 5) $115 million for home care worker compensation, training and benefits; 6) $173 million for state employee compensation; and 7) $370 million in all other policy increases. Finally, the Legislature anticipates that revisions to the caseload forecast made in June 2015 will result in anticipated costs of $36 million for the 2015-17 biennium (and that those would be recognized in a 2016 supplemental budget). Projected Shortfall (Before 2015 Actions) A budget shortfall is projected when estimated costs exceed estimated revenues. For the 2015-17 Biennium, before any legislative action was taken in the 2015 legislative session, the estimated cost of continuing current programs and complying with current laws exceeded forecasted revenue (after the required Budget Stabilization Account transfer) by approximately $2.1 billion. This is sometimes referred to as the maintenance level shortfall. 306Combining the maintenance level shortfall of $2.1 billion NGF-P with the policy increases in the enacted budget, legislation that reduces revenue, and leaving an ending fund balance of $343 million NGF-P, the combined budget problem statement is approximately $4.5 billion. Enacted 2015-17 Operating Budget The operating budget appropriates a total of $38.2 billion from Near General Fund-State plus Opportunity Pathway and addresses the budget problem statement through: fund transfers and revenue redirections of $178 million; reduced spending of approximately $2.95 billion ($2.04 billion by modifying I-1351); utilizing a portion of the $910 beginning balance; changes in the budget and other adjustments that increase resources by $83 million; assumed reversions of $172 million; and legislation that increases revenues by $217 million . Policy Level Spending Reductions Policy level spending increases are described in the projected spending section (above). Policy level spending reductions assumed in the budget include: (1) $2.04 billion by modifying I-1351; (2) $66 million in savings within the economic services program of DSHS; (3) $152 million by extending and modifying the hospital safety net; (4) $235 million by utilizing marijuana related revenues to support existing programs; (5) $115 million from an enhanced federal match for low income health care for certain children; (6) $72 million from shifting costs for selected programs to dedicated revenue sources; and (7) $267 million in other savings. In addition, it is assumed that agencies will generate reversions of $172 million in the 2015-17 Biennium. (Because appropriations represent the maximum amount that state agencies may spend, actual expenditures are typically less than the appropriated amounts. The amount of unspent funds is typically referred to as reversions.) Fund Transfers and Other Revenue/Resource Changes Revenue legislation that decreases revenues is noted in the projected revenue section (above) and detailed in the Revenue section of this document. Revenue legislation that increases revenues totals $217 million in the 2015-17 Biennium. Significant provisions include unclaimed lottery prizes, defining nexus for tax purposes, and various information technology related items. These are detailed in the revenue section of this document. Fund transfers assumed to take place during the 2015-17 biennium include: $73 million from the Public Works Assistance Account; $62 million related to the Life Sciences Discovery Fund; $42 million in total from various accounts (including Treasurer's Service, Criminal Justice Treatment, Flood Control, Liquor Revolving, and Energy Freedom accounts) Other provisions impacting revenue include (for 2015-17): $37 million in budget driven revenue (primarily from increased tobacco enforcement efforts by the Liquor and Cannabis Board as well as reduced commission rates offered by the State Lottery); and $41 million in anticipated prior period balance sheet adjustments 307Finally, in accordance with Chapter 2, Laws of 2015, 3rd Sp.s. (Engrossed House Bill 2286), certain extraordinary revenue growth during the 2013-15, 2015-17, and 2017-19 biennia will be transferred back to the state general fund. The estimated amounts are: (1) $38 million for 2013-15; (2) $5 million for 2015-17; and (3) $516 million for 2015-17. Projected Ending Balance and Outlook The budget, after partial vetoes and including appropriations made in other legislation, leaves $1.237 billion in projected total reserves ($343 million in NGF-S ending fund balances and the remaining $894 million in the Budget Stabilization Account) for the 2015-17 Biennium. Before gubernatorial vetoes, projected total reserves were $1.26 billion ($362 million in NGF-S ending fund balances and the remaining $894 million in the Budget Stabilization Account). The budget, under the provisions of the statutory four-year outlook Chapter 8, Laws of 2012, 1st sp.s (SSB6636), is projected to end the 2017-19 biennium with negative $23 million in NGF-P and $1.367 billion in the Budget Stabilization Account (total net reserves of $1.344 billion). Before vetoes, the outlook was projected to end the 2017-19 biennium with $1.41 billion in total reserves ($47 million in NGF-P and the remainder in the Budget Stabilization Account). The projected ending balances in 2015-17 and 2017-19 include the impact of the June 2015 caseload revisions (even though those would be in a 2016 Supplemental Budget). In accordance with Engrossed House Bill 2267, the state expenditure limit is temporarily suspended to facilitate compliance with the Supreme Court opinion in McCleary v. State . Veto The governor vetoed several sections of Engrossed Substitute Bill 6052 (Chapter 4, Laws of 2015, 3rd Sp.). In fiscal year 2015, changes to general fund appropriated levels for the Health Care Authority (HCA) were vetoed. This had the impact of increasing appropriations by $110 million of which the HCA was directed to place $90.4 million in reserve. The Governor also vetoed a provision stating that the legislature did not intend to appropriate $50 million into the local public safety enhancement account in the 2017-19 biennium. Several other provisions were also vetoed. Additional Information The 2015 legislature also amended the budget for the 2013-15 Biennium. On February 19, 2015, the Governor signed Substitute House Bill 1105 (Chapter 3, Laws of 2015). That bill made a series of appropriations for fiscal year 2015 which were additive to the then current budget. On June 30, 2015, the Governor signed Engrossed Substitute Bill 6052 (Chapter 4, Laws of 2015, 3rd Sp.) which made additional modifications to appropriated levels for the 2013-15 Biennium. The agency detail section of this report shows the cumulative impact of both bills.

This represents a 9.2 percent increase in revenues over the 2013-15 biennium. General Fund revenue-related issues of the 2015 session included K-12 funding, the taxation of marijuana, the extension of several significant soon-to-expire tax preferences, and additional revenue options for local governments. Chapter 70, Laws of 2015, 3rd sp.s. (2SSB 5052) extended the regulatory framework for recreational marijuana to medical marijuana. This change is expected to significantly increase marijuana tax collections by applying to medical marijuana many of the same regulatory and taxation requirements currently applicable to recreational marijuana. Chapter 4, Laws of 2015, 3rd sp.s. (2E2SHB 2136) simplifies the taxation of marijuana by creating a single tax rate at the retail level, providing a sales and use tax exemption for qualifying medical marijuana patients, distributing a portion of state marijuana tax collections to local governments, and making other regulatory changes. A portion of the increased revenue assumed in the enacted operating budget for 2015-17 comes from tax changes in Chapter 5, Laws of 2015, 3rd sp.s. (ESSB 6138). This legislation increases state revenue by eliminating a preferential tax rate for royalty income, narrowing a sales and use tax exemption for machinery and equipment, increasing penalties related to delinquent taxes, and modifying nexus standards for certain out-of-state businesses doing business with Washington customers. These changes are estimated to increase General Fund- State revenues by $185.2 million in the 2015-17 biennium. Several significant tax preferences were set to expire on July 1 of this year. Chapter 6, Laws of 2015, 3rd sp.s (ESSB 6057) is an omnibus tax preference bill that extends or creates thirteen tax preferences. Additionally, the bill addresses administrative changes for unclaimed property reporting requirements.

Funds will be used to staff the Washington State Task Force on Human Trafficking created by Chapter 273, Laws of 2015 (ESSB 5884) and to operate an information portal to coordinate statewide efforts to combat the trafficking of persons. Funds are also provided to develop a training program for state criminal justice personal on the state's human trafficking laws pursuant to Chapter 101, Laws of 2015 (SSB 5933). Reductions to Commerce programs include the elimination of grants to counties and cities for costs related to aerospace and other manufacturing facility permitting activities ($2.5 million) and grants for state drug task forces ($1.3 million). Information Technology Agencies Chapter 1, Laws of 2015, 3rd sp. s (2SSB 5315) merges certain information technology functions of the Department of Enterprise Services (DES) and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) into the Consolidated Technology Services agency (CTS). The reorganization is intended to improve and streamline information technology project oversight, policies and delivery. The reorganization also results in $2.4 million in administrative savings. 331The OCIO is provided with $1.45 million to develop and oversee a statewide strategy for time capture, payroll and payment, eligibility and authorization processes for public assistance programs. $1.6 million is also provided to the OCIO to continue development of the Washington Business One-Stop Portal. Liquor & Cannabis Board Funding is provided for the implementation of Chapter 70, Laws of 2015, Partial Veto, (2SSB 5052) which addresses the medical marijuana industry. Funds are also provided to implement Chapter 4, Laws of 2015, 2nd sp. s. (2E2SHB 2136), which makes changes to the taxation of marijuana and other market reforms. The Liquor & Cannabis Board (LCB) will conduct additional rulemaking, update information technology, and implement licensing activities related to medical and recreational marijuana production, distribution, and sales. Expenditure authority from the Dedicated Marijuana Account is increased by $5 million to reflect these costs. Additionally, expenditure authority from the Liquor Revolving Fund is increased by $2.6 million on an on-going basis to fund twelve additional enforcement officers to reduce the amount of smuggled, contraband, and otherwise untaxed cigarette and tobacco products. With these additional resources for the enforcement of cigarette and other tobacco tax laws, the Department of Revenue is expected to generate an additional $25 million in state and local revenues during the 2015-17 biennium. Savings of $4.8 million from the Liquor Revolving Account are achieved through the elimination of vacant positions and other administrative efficiencies. Office of Financial Management The Office of Financial Management is provided $2 million through a new state agency central service charge for planning and preparation efforts to replace the state's core financial systems. The Office is also provided $13.8 million to pre-pay the debt service for the statewide Time, Leave, and Attendance system (TLA), a project that is discontinued. Administrative efficiencies, eliminating several vacant positions, and removing excess expenditure authority also result in $1.4 million of savings. State Lottery Commission In order to generate an additional $12 million of revenue for the Opportunity Pathways Account, which is used to fund higher education, the Lottery is directed to adjust lottery retail sales commissions from an estimated 6.1 percent of sales to 5.1 percent of sales. State lottery advertising expenses are also directed to be reduced by $2 million. Chapter 31, Laws of 2015 (SSB 5681) authorizes the transfer of State Lottery Account funds to the Gambling Revolving Fund as directed in the omnibus appropriations act. A transfer of $1 million was directed for the support of the Washington State Gambling Commission's regulation and law enforcement programs. Additionally, the legislation directs that any balance of unclaimed prizes in excess of $10 million be transferred to the Washington Opportunity Pathways Account on June 30 of each fiscal year. This results in an estimated $14.8 million transfer during the 2015-17 biennium and each biennium thereafter. Public Disclosure Commission Ongoing state general funds of $305,000 are provided to the Public Disclosure Commission to upgrade in-house information technology systems. The Commission will invest in a hosted, cloud-based communications platform and case management system to improve efficiency and customer services. 332Office of the Secretary of State Federal Help America Vote Act (HAVA) funds used to maintain and operate the statewide voter registration database ended in the 2013-15 biennium. Therefore, $3.17 million on-going state general funds are provided to replace the federal funds. To finance the replacement and upgrade of TVW cameras and other video equipment throughout the Capitol campus, $1.7 million in state general funds is provided to the Secretary of State. Financing costs are expected to be repaid over the next five years. Additionally, $1.5 million is provided to purchase statewide online access to an Information Technology Academy to allow public access to online courses and learning resources through public libraries. Revenues to the Washington State Heritage Center Account are anticipated to be lower during the 2015-17 biennium. In response, Chapter 28, Laws of 2015, 3rd sp. s. (HB 2195) increases the surcharge collected by county auditors or recording officers for recording instruments from $2 to $3. This surcharge will generate an estimated $2.9 million, which will be deposited into the Washington State Heritage Center Account to be used to fund State Library programs. Department of Revenue Funding is provided for Certificate of Participation (COP) financing to complete the next phase of the replacement of the core tax collection and licensing systems. The Department of Revenue will replace these legacy systems to reduce operational risks and increase available features.

To address deficiencies in communications infrastructure for 911 dispatch, $1.9 million in Disaster Response Account funds is provided to Okanogan and Ferry counties on a one-time basis. Funds will be used to replace failing radio dispatching hardware within 911 dispatch centers; build interoperability between each county's dispatch centers such that each can serve as a back up to the other; and build a wireless microwave network for 911 calls, dispatch centers, and first responder radio operations. Utilities and Transportation Commission In order to implement reforms in oil by rail safety pursuant to Chapter 274, Laws of 2015 (ESHB 1449), expenditure authority from the Public Service Revolving Account is increased for staffing to increase grade crossing inspections and adopt rules for private grade crossings. 333DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL AND HEALTH SERVICES Children and Family Services The Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) Children's Administration (CA) administers Child Protective Services (CPS), which responds to reports of child abuse or neglect through investigations or Family Assessment Response (FAR). FAR is an alternative to the investigative response that aims to safely avoid out-of- home placement by providing basic needs and engaging families in services. CA also administers the foster care system for children in out-of-home placements with caregivers and the adoption support program for special needs children adopted from state foster care. Dependent youth with high-level needs may be served through Behavioral Rehabilitative Services (BRS). Additionally, CA contracts for a variety of prevention, intervention, and other services to children and families involved in the child welfare system. A total of $1.2 billion ($668 million General Fund-State) is provided for services to children and families. This represents a $90 million increase (8.1 percent) in total funds from amounts appropriated in the 2013-15 biennial budget. A total of $16.7 million ($12.5 million General Fund-State) is provided to fund the mediated legal agreement with the Foster Parents Association of Washington State (FPAWS). Under the agreement, basic foster care maintenance rates are increased from a monthly average of $500 to $649 per child to reflect the estimated costs of the child's shelter and other basic needs. An increase of $7.3 million total funds ($6.4 million General Fund-State) is provided to support compliance with the Braam Settlement, which established performance outcomes for foster care services; to promote closure of CPS investigations within 90 days; and to expand the CPS FAR pathway to additional CA field offices. A total of $5.1 million ($3.9 million General Fund-State) is provided to increase BRS vendor rates by 3 percent effective July 1, 2015, and an additional 3 percent effective July 1, 2016. A total of $5.9 million ($4.2 million General Fund-State) is provided to support and expand Extended Foster Care (EFC). EFC provides monthly maintenance payments and other supports to eligible young adults age 18-21 who were dependent at age 18. Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration A total of $191.9 million ($183.4 million General Fund-State) is provided for the Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration (JRA) for treatment and intervention services for juvenile offenders. The JRA system is budgeted to provide incarceration for a monthly average of 494 juvenile felons in residential facilities and supervision to a monthly average of 306 youth on parole. Funding is also provided for grants to county juvenile courts and communities for alternative dispositions, evidence-based treatment, and other prevention and intervention services. The JRA funded level represents an increase of 2.6 percent from the 2013-15 biennium. The budget achieves savings of $3.3 million by using marijuana tax revenue provided through a memorandum of understanding with the DSHS Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery in lieu of General Fund-State for juvenile offender substance abuse treatment. Mental Health Mental health services for those living with severe, chronic, or acute mental illnesses are administered primarily through DSHS. These services include operation of two adult state hospitals that deliver psychiatric treatment to 334clients on civil or forensic commitment orders and for the Child Study Treatment Center, which is a small psychiatric inpatient facility for children and adolescents. In addition, DSHS contracts with 11 Regional Support Networks (RSNs) as local administrative entities to coordinate crisis response, community support, and residential and resource management services through a network of community providers. Services for Medicaid-eligible consumers within each RSN are provided through a capitated Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan. Limited services that cannot be reimbursed through the Medicaid program are provided within available state and local resources. A total of $2.3 billion ($1.1 billion in General Fund-State) is provided for operation of the public mental health system. This reflects an increase in total funds of $427.4 million (23 percent) from the 2013-15 biennium. A net increase of $174.9 million in total funding to maintain Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and adjust Medicaid rates to comply with federal requirements for actuarially sound rates. The expansion allowed some low-income individuals that were previously ineligible for Medicaid to enroll in Medicaid effective January 2014. An increase of $57.2 million in total funds ($39 million in General Fund-State) is provided in additional resources to reduce psychiatric boarding as required under D.W. v. DSHS. This includes $49.6 million for increased community evaluation and treatment beds and $7.6 million for a 30-bed civil commitment ward at Western State Hospital. An increase of $40.9 million in total funds ($38.9 million in General Fund-State) is provided in additional resources to meet timely completion of competency evaluation and restoration services for in-custody defendants as required under Trueblood v. DSHS and as provided under legislation enacted during the 2015 session. This includes funding for 90 competency restoration beds, 18 staff for improving the timeliness of competency evaluations and other requirements related to implementation of: Chapter 5, Laws of 2015 (SSB 5889), which sets the maximum time limits for competency to stand trial services; and, Chapter 7, Laws of 2015 1st sp.s. (2ESSB 5177), which establishes an Office of Forensic Mental Health within DSHS and allows prosecutors to dismiss charges when competency to stand trial is raised as a defense and refer the defendant for assessment. An increase of $23 million in total funds ($14.3 million in General Fund-State) is provided for the implementation of legislation enacted during the 2015 session to improve community mental health services. This includes the following: Chapter 258, Laws of 2015 (E2SSB 5269), which allows for a family member, guardian, or conservator to petition the court for review of a decision to not detain a person under the involuntary treatment act; and, Chapter 250, Laws of 2015 (E2SHB 1450), which provides for involuntary treatment in an outpatient setting. An increase of $9.4 million in General Fund-State is provided to improve safety at state hospitals. This funding includes creation of psychiatric intensive care units (PICUs), psychiatric emergency response teams (PERTs), and staff training. Savings of $54.3 million in total funds ($37.5 million in General Fund State) are to be achieved by a variety of savings strategies including reducing RSN Medicaid rates, eliminating non-Medicaid funding for former residents of the Program for Adaptive Living Skills, and re-financing community inpatient bed days that were previously paid for with state dollars through a federal waiver. Aging and Disabilities Services (Developmental Disabilities and Long-Term Care) Within DSHS, the Aging and Long Term Support Administration administers the Long Term Care (LTC) Program and the Developmental Disabilities Administration administers the Developmental Disabilities (DD) Program. These programs provide long-term supports and services to vulnerable adults and children in residential, community, and in-home settings. While these programs serve two distinct populations, they are both institutionally-based Medicaid entitlement programs with options for home and community services that share some vendors including represented home care workers and adult family homes. The entitlement program in LTC 335is the nursing home or skilled nursing facility program. The entitlement program in DD is the state-operated Residential Habilitation Centers (RHCs). Total funding for these two programs combined accounts for 50 percent of the DSHS budget, and is approximately $7.0 billion total ($3.2 billion General Fund-State) in budgeted expenditures for the 2015-17 biennium. This represents an 18.1 percent increase from the 2013-15 funded level, predominately due to the collective bargaining agreement for home care workers. The 2015-17 operating budget includes the following items (which impact both programs): A total of $260 mi llion ($116 million General Fund-State) is provided to fully fund the 2015-17 collective bargaining agreement for individual providers. This includes phased-in changes and increases to the wage scale, increases in health care contributions, increases in the training contribution, an increase in personal time, and a retirement benefit contribution. This includes funds to meet statutory parity requirements for home care agencies. A total of $40 million ($17 million General Fund-State) is provided to fully fund the 2015-17 arbitration award for adult family homes. Beginning July 1, 2015, the vendor rate is increased by 5 percent. Beginning July 1, 2016, the vendor rate is increased by 10 percent. A total of $16 million General Fund-State is provided to fully restore the portion of Lean management savings distributed to LTC and DD. A total of $8 million ($4 million General Fund-State) is provided to increase the vendor rate for assisted living providers by 2.5 percent, beginning July 1, 2015. The following items from the 2015-17 operating budget are unique to each program and are therefore described separately: Developmental Disabilities A total of $40 million ($20 million General Fund-State) is provided to increase the benchmark rate for supported living providers, group homes, and licensed staff residential providers. Beginning July 1, 2015, the vendor rate is increased by 4 percent. Beginning July 1, 2016, the vendor rate is increased by 8 percent. Funding is also provided to standardize administrative rates and develop an electronic rate setting module in the Comprehensive Assessment Reporting Evaluation System. A total of $14 million ($7 million General Fund-State) is provided for additional staff to ensure compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements for habilitation, nursing care, staff safety, and client safety at the RHCs. Funding is provided for specialized services, such as community access and therapies, required by CMS as a result of Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review Assessments. A total of $4 million ($2 million General Fund-State) is provided to develop short-term community-based respite services across the state for individuals with developmental disabilities as an alternative to using respite services in an institutional setting. Long Term Care A total of $77 million ($7 million in General Fund-State savings) is provided to delay the scheduled rebase on nursing facility payment rates, maximize the safety net assessment for nursing facilities, and implement a new methodology for calculating nursing facility rates. A total of $10 million ($5 million General Fund-State) is provided to lower the ratio of case-carrying staff to clients at the Area Agencies on Aging from 1-to-75 to 1-to-70 during the 2015-17 biennium. 336Economic Services Administration The Economic Services Administration (ESA) operates a variety of programs for low-income persons and families. These programs include the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), the State Food Assistance Program, the Aged, Blind, or Disabled Assistance Program, the WorkFirst/Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program, and assistance to refugees. ESA also determines eligibility for a variety of state assistance programs. A total of $2.1 billion ($854 million General Fund-State) is provided to ESA for administration of programs and delivery of services. This reflects an increase in total funds of $58.9 million (2.8 percent) from the estimated amount needed to maintain the current level of services and activities. State general fund savings of $84.4 million are achieved through forecasted caseload reductions in the TANF Program and the Working Connections Child Care (WCCC) Program, reductions in funding for work activities to reflect under-expenditures in those programs, and the use of unexpended federal grant and contingency funds to offset state expenditures. This includes savings assumed in the 2015 supplemental operating budget as well as the 2015-17 operating budget. Other major policy changes for the 2015-17 biennium include: The monthly grant for recipients of TANF is increased by 9 percent ($30.6 million General Fund-State). In accordance with Chapter 7, Laws of 2015 (2E2SHB 1491), eligibility periods for the WCCC program are increased to 12 months effective July 2016 ($22.1 million General Fund-State). A 2 percent base rate increase is provided for WCCC providers ($9.7 million General Fund-State). The monthly benefit for the State Food Assistance Program, which provides assistance to legal immigrants, is increased to 100 percent of the federal SNAP benefit level ($9.6 million General Fund- State). Funding for incentive payments that were never implemented to TANF parents who participate in mandatory WorkFirst activities is eliminated (savings of $15.9 million General Fund-State.) 90 FTEs at local community service offices are eliminated as a result of reduced ability to claim federal Medicaid and other policy steps (savings of $15.6 million total funds.) Funding is reduced to reflect under-expenditures in incapacity exams and the Diversion Cash Assistance program (savings of $7.6 million General Fund-State). Funding for the Washington Telephone Assistance Program which provides subsidized telephone assistance and community voicemail for eligible public assistance recipients is eliminated (savings of $4.1 million General Fund-State). Alcohol and Substance Abuse The Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program coordinates state efforts to reduce the impacts of substance abuse and problem gambling on individuals and their communities. DSHS contracts with counties and community organizations to provide prevention, treatment, and other support services for individuals with problems related to alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and gambling. Effective April 1, 2016, most outpatient and residential services will shift from fee-for-service contracts and grants to managed-care contracts with Behavioral Health Organizations. DSHS also manages government-to-government contracts with 29 tribes for prevention and treatment services for Native Americans. 337A total of $631.3 million ($129.7 million General Fund-State) is provided for alcohol and substance abuse services. This reflects an increase in total funds of $180.9 million (40 percent) from the 2013-15 biennium. Major budget increases for the program include: An increase of $110.2 million ($13.9 million General Fund-State) to maintain Medicaid expansion under the ACA and adjust Medicaid rates to comply with federal managed care requirements for actuarially sound rates. An increase of $14.2 million ($12.3 million Dedicated Marijuana-State) for new services, research, and technical assistance for the prevention and treatment of alcohol and substance use disorders. An increase of $6.8 million ($2.3 million General Fund-State) to increase Medicaid rates for a variety of treatment providers. An increase of $3.1 million in total funds ($1.3 million in General Fund-State) for the increased substance use disorder treatment costs associated with implementation of Chapter 250, Laws of 2015 (E2SHB 1450), which provides for involuntary mental health treatment in an outpatient setting. In addition, savings of $16.5 million in General Fund-State will be achieved by utilizing some revenues from excise tax and fees on the sale of marijuana for substance use disorder treatment services previously funded through the general fund. 338OTHER HUMAN SERVICES Low-Income Medical Assistance A total of $16.5 billion is provided to pay for medical and dental services for an average of 1.9 million low-income children and adults each month by the end of the 2015-17 biennium. This is a $3.5 billion (27 percent) increase from the funding levels provided in the 2013-15 biennium for these services. Of the $16.5 billion, $4.6 billion are state funds; $11.6 billion are federal funds, primarily from Medicaid; and the rest are local government funds provided for purposes of collecting Medicaid matching funds. Of the $4.6 billion in state funds, $3.9 billion is from the state general fund and $690 million is from the Hospital Safety Net Assessment Fund created in 2010. The state general fund spending is $431 million (10 percent) less than the 2013-15 biennium. Washington exercised the option under the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) to expand the Medicaid program to cover adults under 65 years of age with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) effective January 1, 2014. This resulted in an increase to the number of people covered by the state Medicaid program by approximately 550,000 since January 2014. This is a 42 percent increase over forecasted levels for 2015 without the Medicaid expansion. The Hospital Safety Net Assessment (HSNA) Program, set to expire at the end of fiscal year 2017, was established to generate additional state and federal funding to support payments to hospitals for Medicaid services. As provided in Chapter 5, Laws of 2015, 2nd sp.s. (2EHB 2151), the HSNA Program will continue until the end of fiscal year 2019. In addition, the incremental phase-down beginning in fiscal year 2016 was removed, supplemental payments and increased managed care premiums for hospital services were increased, and family medicine and integrated psychiatry residency slots were provided. The state general fund appropriation is reduced by $292 million as a result of these changes. Department of Corrections A total of $1.9 billion is provided to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for the operation of prisons and community supervision of offenders for the 2015-17 biennium. The prison system is budgeted to provide monthly average incarceration for 17,681 prison and work release inmates and 717 offenders who have violated the terms of their community supervision. The community supervision program is budgeted to provide supervision to a monthly average of 17,440 offenders who have either received sentencing alternatives or have served their sentences and have been released into the community. The 2015-17 DOC funding level represents an increase of $155.8 million (9.1 percent) from the 2013-15 budget, and an increase of $62.5 million (3.5 percent) from the revised 2015-17 maintenance level. A total of $15 million is provided to manage increased medical costs within the prison system: $12.6 million is provided to use new and more effective drug protocols to treat offenders with Hepatitis C as appr oved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration; and $2.4 million is provided to account for increased costs due to inflation for all other prescription drugs. A total of $3.4 mill ion is provided to backfill unrealized savings assumed in the 2014 supplemental budget through DOC contract changes with local jails housing offenders that have violated the terms of supervision. The contract changes involved moving away from the practice of fractional billing for offenders serving multiple holds at the same time (local or federal jurisdiction or DOC Secretary Warrant). Though most contracts were successfully changed, the ongoing savings assumed in the 2014 supplemental budget were not fully achieved. 339 Savings of $1.7 million is achieved through changes to DOC policy on punishment for offender infractions in prison. Currently, offenders can earn \"good time\" off the end of their sentences based on good behavior while in prison. Offenders can also lose portions of that earned time as punishment for various infractions. With this policy change, DOC will reduce reliance on loss of earned good time as punishment for infractions in favor of more immediate loss of privileges such as visitation rights, television or commissary use, etc. The policy is intended to model similar incentive structures for offenders in prison as Swift and Certain Sanctioning does for those on community supervision. Savings of $1.7 million is achieved by requiring that offenders serving time on community supervision who are enrolled in Medicaid receive any necessary chemical dependency treatment services through the managed care system overseen by the Department of Social and Health Services, beginning April 1, 2016. Department of Health The DOH has a total budget of $1.1 billion ($116.8 million General Fund-State) to provide educational and health care services, administer a variety of health care licensure programs, regulate drinking water and commercial shellfish production, respond to infectious disease outbreaks, support local public health jurisdictions, and operate the state's public health laboratory. A total of $15 million in Dedicated Marijuana Account funds are provided to DOH for a marijuana and tobacco education and public health program ($14.5 million), and to increase funding for the Washington Poison Center ($500,000). In addition, one-time savings of $7.1 million are achieved by increasing the use of dedicated funds in lieu of General Fund-State (Fund Balance Utilization, $5.6 million and Drinking Water - Fund Swap, $1.5 million). Criminal Justice Training Commission The budget provides $35.9 million from the General Fund-State to the Criminal Justice Training Commission (CJTC) for training and certification of local law enforcement and corrections officers and pass-through funds to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs (WASPC). This funding reflects a 13.9 percent increase from the 2013-15 budget. The budget assumes funding for fourteen basic law enforcement academies in fiscal year 2016 and ten academies in fiscal year 2017. $1.7 million is provided to enhance training for local law enforcement officers: $1.2 million pursuant to Chapter 87, Laws of 2015 (2SSB 5311) to implement crisis intervention training for all certified law officers, emphasizing resources and appropriate responses for dealing with individuals in distress due to mental illness or substance abuse. All certified law enforcement officers must be trained by July 1, 2021; and $500,000 to provide training to local law enforcement agencies on instilling the \"guardian\" culture in their agencies. $858,000 in General Fund-State support is provided for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, which works to identify, arrest, and convict individuals who victimize minors using the Internet, pursuant to Chapter 84, Laws of 2015 (2SSB 5215). This support is in addition to any resources generated for the task force from fines for depicting sexually explicit images of minors under Chapter 279, Laws of 2015 (2SHB 1281). 340NATURAL RESOURCES Land Management State Parks The State Parks and Recreation Commission is provided $16.0 million of state general fund for the operating costs of state parks. This amount funds cost increases for current staffing and other operating costs as well as permanently continuing funding that was provided on a one-time basis in the 2013-15 biennium. In addition, $4.4 million of state general fund is provided to increase the numbers of park aides, park rangers, and maintenance mechanics throughout the park system. Fire Suppression and Geological Hazards State general fund support of $1.2 million is provided to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for increased fire response through additional fire engine crews, specialized helicopter crews, and incident command and business support staff. State general fund of $648,000 is also provided to implement Chapter 182, Laws of 2015 (ESHB 2093), which creates a local wildland fire liaison and Wildland Fire Advisory Committee and requires DNR to coordinate a master list of qualified wildland fire suppression contractors. DNR is provided $4.6 million to establish a statewide contract for LiDAR, a remote sensing technology used to create high-resolution geological maps, and to increase staffing related to geological hazards. Oil Transportation The Department of Ecology (Ecology) is provided $1.0 million from the Oil Spill Prevention Account (OSPA) for activities required by Chapter 274, Laws of 2015 (ESHB 1449) related to railroad oil spill contingency plans and advance notice of transfers of crude oil. A total of $1.4 million is provided from the OSPA to continue work on area-specific oil spill response plans and oil spill risk analysis that began in 2014. A total of $500,000 from the OSPA is provided to conduct and periodically update vessel and rail traffic risk assessments. A total of $1.9 million from the State Toxics Control Account is also provided for oil spill response equipment grants to local governments. Water Resources and Watershed Protection Forests and Fish DNR is provided $5.9 million from the state general fund for research and monitoring projects in the Forest Practices Adaptive Management Program. This funding corresponds with the Forest Practices Habitat Conservation Plan and a 2012 legal settlement agreement, and will inform Forest Practices Board rules related to water quality and fish habitat protection. Puget Sound The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) is provided $1.5 million from the Environmental Legacy Stewardship Account (ELSA) to expand toxics monitoring for several Puget Sound fish species. WDFW is also provided $800,000 from the Aquatic Lands Enhancement Account (ALEA) to continue research on the decline of Puget Sound steelhead. ALEA funding of $1.0 million is provided to the Puget Sound Partnership to increase monitoring activities for a number of indicators of Puget Sound ecosystem health, including birds, estuaries, and Pacific herring. ELSA funding of $1.0 million is provided to DNR to continue a creosote removal program in the Puget Sound. 341Agricultural Lands The State Conservation Commission is provided $7.6 million from the Public Works Assistance Account to fund the Voluntary Stewardship Program (VSP) in the 26 counties that have opted in to the program but not yet received funding. The VSP was created in 2011 as an alternative means of fulfilling Growth Management Act requirements to protect wetlands and other critical areas on agricultural lands. Stormwater Ecology is provided $864,000 from the State Toxics Control Account for the Washington State University Stormwater Center to conduct studies of the sources of toxics in stormwater and stormwater impacts on salmonids.

2015 Supplemental Transportation Budget bill, Second Engrossed Substitute House Bill (2ESHB) 1299, provides the resources and authority to continue legislative transportation priorities and to implement several new priorities. The 2015-17 appropriation authority in 2ESHB 1299 is $7.6 billion, with $3.8 billion for capital projects, $2.3 billion for operating programs, and $1.5 billion for debt service. The total amount appropriated is a reduction from the $8.4 billion appropriated in the 2015 supplemental budget for the 2013-15 biennium. This reduction reflects the nearing completion of the Transportation 2003 (\"Nickel\") and Transportation Partnership Act (TPA) capital programs. The \"new law\" spending bill, Second Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill (2ESSB) 5988, is discussed further below under \"Connecting Washington Transportation Funding Package.\" 2013-15 Biennium - 2015 Supplemental Budget The second supplemental transportation budget provides funding for emergent concerns and reduces the funding authority for certain capital programs in which work has been delayed. Emergent concerns include $2.0 million in extraordinary repair costs for the state ferry vessels and terminals and $1.6 million in financial assistance for unexpected caseload costs in the Ignition Interlock Program. Delays in construction schedules in the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Highway Construction program, along with changes in other capital programs, have contributed to a net decrease of about $700 million in spending in the current biennium. Most of this spending is shifted to the 2015-17 biennium. 2015-17 \"Current Law\" Biennial 1299 for the 2015-17 biennium include completion of significant components of the Nickel and TPA packages, maintaining the existing investments and systems, delivering several new legislative priorities, and looking ahead. The Nickel and TPA Packages Are Nearing Completion By the end of the 2015-17 fiscal biennium, much of the Nickel and TPA package construction will be complete. Major highway work anticipated in the biennium under the \"current law\" budget includes: Construction of a new six-lane State Route 520 (SR 520) floating bridge and some of the associated work on the west side of the bridge ($379 million); Completion of the SR 99 tunnel replacement for the Alaskan Way Viaduct and completion of design and permitting work on other aspects, including the demolition of the Viaduct ($640 million); Commencing construction of the next two miles of the widening of I-90 from the Keechelus Dam to the Stampede Pass interchange vicinity, including the construction of a wildlife overcrossing ($108 million); Completion of several projects associated with the US 395/North Spokane Corridor development, including the relocation of the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe (BNSF) mainline from Freya Street to Rowan Street and the grading from Spokane River to Francis Avenue ($36 million); and Completion of parts of the Interstate 5 (I-5) high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes in Tacoma, including from M Street to Portland Avenue ($275 million). By the end of the 2015-17 biennium, only $0.5 billion of the $19 billion TPA and Nickel investment will remain to be spent. 361Maintaining Existing Investments and Systems Significant amounts are allocated in the 2015-17 biennial transportation \"current law\" budget for the maintenance, preservation, and administration of investments, systems, and programs previously established. For the Washington State Ferry (WSF) system, $260 million is provided to address various projects, including the completion of the third Olympic Class ferry boat - allowing the state to maintain the existing fleet of Puget Sound ferries at 23 vessels - and continued work on the Seattle and Mukilteo terminal projects. $1 million is added in order to support the WSF reservation system. Freight rail grant funding of $1.4 million is provided in 2015-17 for seven miles of track upgrade work on the Palouse River and Coulee City railroad track in Spokane County.

The JTC must also study areas of prominent road-rail conflicts and recommend a corridor-based prioritization process for addressing impacts. The Economic Partnerships program at WSDOT is directed to evaluate the potential public- private partnership opportunities for the toll booths on the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Through the WSDOT Highways and Local Programs program, $500,000 is provided for an analysis of at-grade train crossings alternatives for the City of Edmonds. The Freight Mobility Strategic Investment Board (FMSIB) is provided $250,000 for a study of freight infrastructure needs, including an update of the long-term marine cargo forecast. Finally, the Transportation Commission is provided $300,000 to further evaluate aspects of a potential road usage charge system. Connecting Washington Transportation Funding Package In order to provide for significant additional transportation infrastructure improvements and additional investment in programs, the Legislature passed a package of bills in 2015 referred to as the Connecting Washington package. Included were several policy bills aimed at improving the delivery of transportation projects and programs and at reducing costs; an omnibus transportation revenue bill containing numerous state tax and fee increases, state tax incentive programs, and local revenue options; a two-year \"new law\" spending bill, with references both to a long-term capital plan and to a 16-year commitment to various programmatic initiatives; and a bond bill. The package is estimated to provide a total of $16.3 billion in resources over 16 years for transportation projects and programs. Project an d Program Delivery Improvement and Cost Reduction The Connecting Washington package included several measures and policies intended to streamline and improve transportation project and program delivery and/or to reduce transportation costs. These include the following: 2ESSB 5992, relating to modifying certain requirements for ferry vessel construction. The bill makes a number of changes relating to vessel procurement, including allowing for out-of-state construction under certain conditions; the use of an owner's representative to oversee the contracting process; the requirement that vessel procurement contracts be fixed-price contracts; and the requirement that vessel design meet United States Coast Guard specifications before construction begins. 2ESB 5993, relating to public works contracts and projects. The bill raises the cost threshold, from $2 million to $3 million, above which the apprenticeship utilization requirements apply; the increased threshold expires in 2020. The bill also allows contractors an electronic option of completing Department of Labor and Industries wage surveys. 3632ESSB 5994, relating to permits for state transportation projects. The bill exempts the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) from certain requirements under the Shoreline Management Act (SMA) for state highway maintenance, repair, replacement activities, and construction if in response to extraordinary circumstances. The bill requires local governments, to the greatest extent practicable, to issue local permit decisions within 90 days for projects of value $500 million or less. 2ESB 5995, relating to the transportation system policy goal of mobility. The bill expands the goal to include congestion relief and improved freight mobility. 2ESSB 5996, relating to environmental permit requirements. The bill requires WSDOT to continue to use a multiagency permit program for the purposes of environmental permit streamlining. The bill also creates a preference for the removal of local government-owned fish passage barriers as compensatory mitigation on highway projects. 2ESSB 5997, regarding transportation project delivery. The bill strongly encourages WSDOT to use design- build contracting on projects with value of $2 million or more. The bill requires a study of WSDOT's implementation of design-build contracting processes and the development of a business plan that incorporates recommendations from the study. HB 1219, regarding expedited permitting and contracting for state system bridges that are structurally deficient. The bill exempts such bridges from certain requirements of the State Environmental Policy Act. ESHB 2012, concerning the implementation of practical design for state highway projects. The bill encourages the use of practical design engineering in state transportation project development and designates any construction-related savings, relative to costs otherwise incurred under conventional engineering approaches, for a new transportation future funding program to offset costs of highway improvement and preservation projects beginning in fiscal year 2024. 2ESSB 5987, concerning transportation revenue. The bill includes an offset to transportation spending of $518 million from the state general fund over a period of 12 years, beginning in fiscal year 2020. New Transportation Revenue / Resources The Connecting Washington transportation funding package includes the enactment of 2ESSB 5987, an omnibus transportation revenue bill with a number of state tax and fee increases, state tax incentive programs, and several local revenue options. In conjunction with the new bond authority provided in ESSB 5989, the two bills are expected to provide $16 billion in new resources for transportation purposes over the next sixteen fiscal years. The principal sources of new revenue in 2ESSB 5987 are an 11.9 cent per gallon fuel tax increase; an increase in passenger vehicle weight fees; and weight fees on trucks. Together, these changes raise over $9 billion over the 16 year period, more than 75 percent of the new revenue (excluding bonds) in the plan. The fuel tax is increased in two steps: a 7 cent per gallon increase on August 1, 2015, and a 4.9 cent per gallon increase on July 1, 2016. The total state tax rate after the phase-in is 49.4 cents per gallon. The passenger vehicle weight fee increases take effect on July 1, 2016. Currently, if the vehicle is at or below a weight of 4,000 lbs., the owner is required to pay an annual weight fee of $10; if the vehicle is above 4,000 lbs. but at or below 6,000 lbs., $20; if the vehicle is above 6,000 lbs. but at or below 8,000 lbs., $30. On July 1, 2016, these amounts will be increased by $15, $25, and $35, respectively, to totals of $25, $45, and $65. For passenger vehicles with weights above these classes, the annual fee will be $65 for most vehicles beginning July 2016. On July 1, 2022, owners of all passenger vehicle classes will be required to pay an additional $10 increase annually. For owners of light trucks, annual fees increase on July 1, 2016 by $15 to $35 annually, depending on weight. An additional annual fee of $10 is assessed beginning July 1, 2022. For owners of heavy trucks, a new freight project fee equal to 15 percent of the existing license fee by weight is required. The Connecting Washington package includes a $5.3 billion bond bill (ESSB 5989) to allow for the financing of the various transportation capital projects included in the package. For the first time, the transportation bond bill 364pledges the repayment of principal and interest both from fuel taxes and certain vehicle-related fees, in addition to the full faith and credit of the state. The expected revenue by broad source category is shown in the table below both for the fiscal 2015-2017 biennium and for the 16-year transportation package period. Connecting Washington: Resources (Dollars in millions) Resource Category 2015-17 Fiscal Biennium 16 Year Total Fuel Tax Increase 549 6,236 Passenger Vehicle Weight Fee 79 1,958 Truck Weight Fee 43 850 Reallocate Existing Funding 96 1,730 General Fund Transfer - 518 Bonds - 4,762 Other - 233 Total 767 16,287 Planned Expenditures The Connecting Washington package includes a sixteen year spending plan covering highway improvements; highway preservation; multimodal spending, including projects and programs for public transportation, rail, bicycles and pedestrians, and off-road users; city, county, and other local entity-sponsored projects; the state ferry system; the State Patrol; fish passage culvert modifications. The package includes several tax incentive programs and several local transportation revenue options. The package also covers the expected debt service during the 16 year period on expected bond issues. State highway improvements constitute the bulk of the planned spending in the Connecting Washington package, with over $8.4 billion allocated for projects across the state. Major projects include: $1.875B for the Puget Sound Gateway project, featuring on the south end the construction of a new four lane alignment on SR 167 between I-5 in Tacoma and SR 161 in Puyallup and on the north end the connection of SR 509 south from SeaTac to I-5. $1.642B for the SR 520 Seattle Corridor Improvements - West End project, completing corridor improvements between I-5 and the West High Rise. $1.225B for the I-405 Renton to Lynnwood project, continuing the widening of the I-405 corridor between Renton and Bellevue, implementing Express Toll Lanes (ETL), and rebuilding impacted interchanges. $878.9M for the US 395/North Spokane Corridor, completing the corridor from Francis Avenue to an interim connection with I-90. $494M for the I-5 JBLM Corridor Improvements project, implementing southbound hard shoulder running between the Berkeley and Mounts Rd interchanges, reconstructing the Thorne and Berkeley interchanges, and subsequently adding northbound hard shoulder running. $426M for the I-90 Snoqualmie Pass - Widen to Easton project, completing the widening from the end of the existing funded projects (MP 62) to Easton. In addition to the state system facilities, the package provides funding assistance to a number of local projects. Significant allocations are provided to the Duportail Bridge project in Richland; the Covington Connector in Covington; the 228th & Union Pacific Grade Separation in Kent; the Orchard Street Connector in Bellingham; the East-West Corridor Overpass and Bridge in Yakima; and several others. In all, $388 million is provided to help advance these local priorities over the package time frame. 365State highway preservation, operations, maintenance, and facilities are emphasized relative to the previous two transportation funding packages. At over $1.4 billion allocated for these purposes, the amount of expected spending for the 16-year time frame is almost double that of the Transportation Partnership Act (TPA) in percentage terms. The Connecting Washington package includes several multimodal components, the funding for which is show in the table below. Several existing public transportation grant programs receive funding, including the Special Needs, the Regional Mobility, the Rural Mobility, and the Vanpool grant programs. In addition, a number of transit projects receive direct funding assistance, and some funding is allocated for the purpose of transit coordination in the Puget Sound region. The Complete Streets grant program, created in 2011, is funded for the first time. The Safe Routes to Schools and Bicycle and Pedestrian Grant programs, already in place, receive additional funding in the package, and several bicycle and pedestrian projects receive direct assistance. For the Palouse River and Coulee City state-owned railroad, $47 million is set aside for track preservation and maintenance. Another $33 million is allocated for slope stabilization. The Freight Rail Assistance Program (FRAP) is allocated an additional $31 million, and local rail projects receive $63 million in direct assistance. Finally, off-road users will be able to get a full refund of the fuel tax increase, or 11.9 cents per gallon when fully in effect.

Funding is provided to continue the Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) tax credit program, an existing program that allows employers a limited amount of business and occupation tax or public utility tax credit for employee participation in the CTR program. Additional funds are provided to continue the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Sales and Use Tax Exemption, allowing purchasers of certain high-mileage vehicles to buy them tax-free. Finally, a new credit is created against business and occupation tax and public utility tax for the portion of the purchase price of an alternative fuel commercial vehicle. Other aspects of the state transportation system also receive funding under the package. Additional revenue is directed both to the State Patrol and to the State Ferry operations to address chronic funding imbalances. Additionally, over $300 million in funding is provided to the State Ferry System for a fourth Olympic class vessel and to complete the rehabilitation of the Seattle and Mukilteo terminals. To address fish passage barrier removal needs, $300 million is provided for improved culverts. The Connecting Washington package establishes an electric vehicle infrastructure bank for the first time. Based on recommendations from a 2014 JTC-led study, an account is set up and funded by an additional $50 fee on electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The purpose of the bank is to provide financial assistance to leverage private investment for the installation of publicly accessible electric vehicle charging stations in Washington. Local governments receive both direct and indirect funding under the package. Over the 16 year span of the package, cities and counties receive an additional $375 million in direct distributions of fuel taxes and multimodal funds. Cities and counties and other local entities are indirect beneficiaries of additional grant authority provided to the Transportation Improvement Board (TIB), The County Road Administration Board (CRAB), and the Freight Mobility and Strategic Investment Board (FMSIB). Local Transportation Revenue Options The Connecting Washington package was enacted with several local transportation revenue options. Foremost among these in breadth are the additional options provided to a regional transit authority (RTA). The package authorizes an RTA - Sound Transit is the only such entity in the state currently - to impose a motor vehicle excise tax of up to 0.8 percent of the vehicle value; to increase sales and use taxes by an additional 0.5 percent; and, for the first time, to levy a regular property tax of up to 25 cents per $1000 of assessed valuation. For a transportation benefit district, the governing body is given the authority to impose a vehicle fee of up to $50 without a public vote, subject to several restrictions. Community Transit is authorized to increase its sales and use tax by 0.3 percent, subject to voter approval. Kitsap transit is authorized to establish a passenger-only ferry (POF) district within its boundaries, supported by several revenue options, including a 0.3 percent sales and use tax. The creation of the POF district, along with the supporting revenue measures, must be approved by the voters that live within the boundaries of the proposed district. Transportation Appropriations in Other Legislation A total of $32.6 million in compensation increases is provided from transportation accounts in the 2015-17 Omnibus Operating Budget (Chapter 4, Laws of 2015, 3rd sp.s. and as referenced in LEAP Transportation Doc ument 713-2015T).

The model calculates the actual debt service on outstanding bonds and estimates future debt service based on certain assumptions including revenue growth, interest rates , rate of repayment, rate of bond issuance and other factors. Based on assumptions adopted by legislative budge t writers, the projected bo nd capacity for the 201517 biennium is $2.309 billion. In addition there is $24.2 million in capacity remaining from bonds previously authorized for the Chehalis River Basin Flood and the Columbia River Basin Water Supply programs. TOTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND REMAINING BOND CAPACITY The 201517 Capital Budget and the 2015 Supp leme ntal Capital Budget were enacted as Chapter 3, Laws of 2015, 3rd sp.s, Partial Veto (2EHB 1115). Legislation authorizing the issuance of bonds to finance the bondsupported portion of the capital budget was enacted as Chapter 37, Laws of 2015, 3rd sp.s (ESH B 1166 ). In the 201517 Capital Budget, new appropriations total $3.9 billion, including $2.22 billion from new state general obligation bonds, $24 million from previously authorized bonds, and $1.7 billion from a variety of dedicated fees and taxes, federal funds, timber revenue, and the building fee portion of student tuition payments. Included in the $1.7 billion is $225 million in authorizations for state agencies to enter into a variety of alternative financing contracts. Additionally, reappropriations for uncompleted projects approved in prior biennia total $2.9 billion. In the 2015 Supplemental Capital Budget, new appropriations total $68.6 million in bonds and a decrease of $182.5 million in other funds, for a net decrease to the 201315 Capital Budget of $113.9 million. Approximately $89.4 million in 201517 bond capacity is reserved for a 2016 supplemental capital budget. TRANSFERS AND REDIRECTIONS TO THE OPERATING BUDGET Approximately $321 million is transferre d or redirected from the capital budget to the operating budget for 2015 17. $73 million in cash from the Public Works Assistance Account (PWAA) is transferred. In addition, continuing the statutory redirections approved by the Legislature in 2012 and 2013, $177 million in solid waste collection, real estate excise, and public utility tax revenues are directed to the operating bu dget instead of to the PWAA for use in the capital budget. The Legislature also continues to require nearly $68 million of higher education facility maintenance to be funded in the capital, rather than the operating budget. $3.3 million is transferred from the Energy Freedom Accoun t to the state general fund for fiscal year 2016. 3722015 17 Capital Budget Highlights GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS Drinking Water Loans ($173 million) A pool of $173 million is provided for lowinterest loans to publicly and privatelyowned water systems statewide for preconstruction activities, and for designing, financing, and constructing improvements aimed at increasing public health protection and compliance with drinking water regulations.
