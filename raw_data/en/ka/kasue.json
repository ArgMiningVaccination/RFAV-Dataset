Meditation can unearth so many unexpected sources of wisdom and knowledge. It is an experience that takes place inside and outside of your being. It seeks to heal us physically and reaches out positively into one's emotions and heart to heal our spirit. One of the best reasons to try meditation is because it gives us a little extra boost of calm in our lives and makes us happier. In addition, by meditating, you become more focused every day as it will make your mind less stressed and, in a way, more organized. The Healing Effects of Meditation on the Body Improves Body Fitness Physical and mental health are interconnected. You cannot have a sound body without a sound mind. If your mind is filled with negative and toxic thoughts, you will not benefit from your workout and yoga routine. Meditation helps to remove harmful and toxic thoughts, calms the mind, and supplies it with positivity regularly, resulting in a healthy brain and body. Therefore, your overall fitness regime should include regular nutritious food, physical workout, and meditation. Improves Various Disorders in Teens and Adults The NCCIH in the US has conducted a few studies and found that practicing meditation can improve stress-related disorders in adolescents and adults. In addition, it has a long-term positive effect on migraines, headaches, psoriasis, and hypertensive conditions. Moreover, meditation was compelling in reducing anxiety and depression in both teens and adults. Improves Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Studies conducted by the American College of Gastroenterology suggested that meditation reduces IBS. Meditation can be a great healing tool to tackle short- and long-term IBS as it significantly reduces pain and bloating in individuals. Improves Immunity Meditation can strengthen your immune system. As a result, your body gains the ability to fight infections better and prevent illnesses. Studies have shown that regular meditation increases lymphocyte count (white blood cells) in the body and acts as a prevention against cancer-causing cells. Thus, meditation can help you prevent dangerous diseases. Improves Your Memory Meditation rejuvenates your mind and makes you feel younger. Unfortunately, scientists have shown that we increasingly suffer from memory loss problems as we get older. Instead of letting nature take its course, however, people may be able to fight off these symptoms with a meditation practice. Meditation practices like Kirtan Kriya can help improve memory in dementia patients. If you're ready to start meditating, email us at jacquieglsh@gmail.com or call us at (408) 393-1157.
