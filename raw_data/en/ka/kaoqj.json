FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: This rulemaking is not anticipated to have any fiscal impact on the state general fund because the FY 2020 budget has already been set by the Legislature, and approved by the Governor, an ticipating the existence of the rules and fees being reaut horized by this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was not feasible because of the need to adopt the rules as temporary, a nd because these existing chapters of IDAPA are being re-published and re-authorized. Negotiated rulemaking also is n ot feasible because of the need to implement these rules before they expire; the rules form the regulatory framewo rk of the laws of this state and have been previously promulgated and reviewed by the Legislature pursuant to the Ida ho Administrative Procedures Act, Chapter 52, Title 67, Idaho Code; and because engag ing in negotiated rulemaking f or all previously existing rules will inhibit the agency from carrying out its ability to serve the citizens of I daho and to protect their h ealth, safety, and welfare.

Compute the Shelter Adjustment. Add the current Food Stamp Prog ram Standard Utility Allowance to the community spouse's shelter costs. Shelter costs include rent, mortgage princip al and interest, ho meowner's taxes, insurance, and condominium or c ooperative maintenance charges. The Standard Utility Allowance must b e reduced by the value of any utilities included in maintenance charges for a condominium or cooperativ e. Subtract the Shelter Standard fr om the shelter and utilities. T he Shelter Standard is thirty percent (30%) of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of one-twelfth (1/12) of the income official poverty line defined by the Federal Offi ce of Management and Budget (OMB) for a fam ily of two (2) persons. The Shelter Adjustment is th e positive balance remaining. 09.Community Spouse Allowance: Step b.Compute the Community Spou se Need Standard (CSNS). Add the Shelter Adjustment to th e minimum CSNS. The minimum CSN S equals one hundred fifty percent ( 150%) of one-twelfth (1/12) o f the income official poverty line defined by the OMB for a family unit of t wo (2) members. The minimum CSNS is revised annual ly in July. The total CSNS ma y not exceed the maximum CSNS . The maximum CSNS i s computed by multip lying one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) by the percentage in crease in the consumer price index for all ur ban Consumers (all items; U.S. c ity average) between September 1988 and the Se ptember before the current cal endar year. The maximum CSNS is revised annually in January. 10.Community Spouse Allowance: Step c.Compute the Community Spouse Allowance. Subtract the community spouse's gross income from the CSNS. The community spouse's income includes income produced by his resou rces. Round any remaining cents to the next higher dollar. Any positi ve balance remaining is the CSA. The CSA is subtracted as actually paid to the community spouse, up to the computed maximum. A larger spouse support amount must be used as the CSA, if cour t-ordered. The CSA ordered by a court is no t subject to the CSA limit.TABLE 725 - INCOME D EDUCTIONS FOR PART ICIPANT IN FACILITY Step ProcedureIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03. 05 - Rules Governing Eligibility for Department of Health and Welfare Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled (AABD) Section 725 Page 2336 11.Family Member Allowance (FMA)Compute the family member's gross income. Subtract the family m ember's gross income from the minimum CSNS . Divide the difference by three (3).Round cents to the next higher dollar. Any remainder is the FMA for that family member. The FMA is all owed, whether or not it is actually p aid by the participant. A family member is, or could be claimed, as a dependent on the Federal income tax return of either spouse. The family member must be a minor or dependent child, dependent paren t or dependent sibling of either spouse.

FAIR HEARING ON CSA DECISION. Either spouse may ask for a fair hearing, to show the community spouse needs a higher CSA. The hearing officer must consider if, due to unusual conditions, using the computed CSA causes significant financial hardship for the community spouse. If the fair hearing decision finds the commun ity spouse needs more income than the CSA, the CSA must include the additional income. (7-1-99) 728. -- 730. (RESERVED) 731.

FEDERAL SPOUSAL IMPOVERISHMENT (FSI) METHOD OF COUNTING INC OME AND RESOURCES OF A COUPLE. The FSI method must be used to compute income and resources of a married participant, who requires long-term care as defined in Section 005 of these rules, and who has a communi ty spouse. The participant must have entered long- term care on or after September 3 0, 1989. Terms used in the FSI method are listed in Subsections 735.01 through 735.05 of this rule. (4-2-08) 01. Long-Term Care Spouse . The long-term care spouse must be in a medical institution or nursing facility, or be an HCBS participant, for thirty (30) consecutiv e days, or appear likely to meet the thirty (30) days requirement. (7-1-99) 02. Community Spouse . The community spouse is the husband or wife of the long-term care participant. A community spouse is not in long-term care and is not an HCBS participant. (7-1-99) 03. Continuous Period of Long-Term Care . A continuous period of long-term care is a period of residence either in a medical i nstitution with nursing facility services, or at home with HCBS. A continuous period of long-term care is also a combinat ion of institution and persona l care services likely to l ast at least thirty (30) consecutive days. Absence from the institution, or a lapse in H CBS eligibility, of thirty (30) consecutive days breaks continuity. The thirty (30) cons ecutive days of long-term care must not begin on a day the participant is hospitalized. If the participant is hospitalized a f t e r t h e f i r s t d a y o f t h e t hirty (30) consecutive days, the hospital stay does not interrupt the thirty (30) consecutive days. (7-1-99) 04. Start of Continuous Period . The start of a continuous period of long-term care is the fir st month of long-term care or HCBS. (7-1-99) 05. Nursing Facility Services . Nursing facility services are s ervices at the nursing facilit y level or the intermediate care for persons wit h intellectual disabilities le vel provided in a medical institution. (7-1-99) 736. ASSESSMENT DATE AND COUNTING FSI RESOURCES. The assessment date is the start date of the first continuous p eriod of long-term care. The Department does a one-time assessment to determine the valu e of the couple's community and separate resources as of t h e d a t e o f t h e f i r s t continuous period of long-term care. The resource assessment is done at the request of either spouse, after one spouse is in long-term care or meets the level of care for HCBS, wheth er or not the couple has applied for Medicaid. State laws relating to community property or the division of marital property are not applied in determining the FSI total combined resources of the couple. (4-2-08) 737. TREATMENT OF RESOURCES FOR ASSESSMENT. The resource rules used in determining eligibility for AABD cas h and Medicaid are also used in determining the couple's total combined resources for the FSI resource assessme nt with the following exceptions: (4-2-08) 01. Resources For Sale . Excess resources offered for sal e, are not excluded from the couple's total combined resources for the FSI resource assessment. (3-30-07) 02. Jointly Owned Real Property . Jointly owned real property that is not the principal residen ce of the participant, is not exclude d, if the community spouse is th e joint owner. (3-30-07) 03. Long-term Care Partnership Policy . Resources excluded because of a participant's qualified long-term care policy are not exc luded for the FSI resource ass essment. (4-2-08) 04. Excluded Home . As defined in 42 U.S.C. 1396r-5(c)(5), an excluded home place d in trust retains its exclusion for purpo ses of the resource assessment. (3-30-07) 738. ONE-HALF SPOUSAL SHARE. The spousal share is one-half (1 /2) of the couple's total combi ned resources on the assessment date. The spousal share does not change, even if the par ticipant leaves long-term care and then enters long-term care again. The Department must inform the couple of the resources counted in the assessme nt and the value assigned. The couple must sign theIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03. 05 - Rules Governing Eligibility for Department of Health and Welfare Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled (AABD) Section 742 Page 2341 assessment form under penalty of perjury. The signature require ment may be waived for the long-term care spouse if he or his representative says he is unable to sign the resource s assessment. A copy of the assessment form must be provided to each spouse when eligibility is determined or when either spouse requests a assessment prior to application. (7-1-99) 739. -- 741. (RESERVED) 742. COMMUNITY SPOUSE RESOURCE ALLOWANCE. The CSRA protects resources for the community spouse. The CSRA is determined by subtracting the greater of the minimum resource allowance, or th e spousal share from the coupl e's total combined resour ces as of the first day of the application month. The deduction must not be more than the maximum resource allowance at the time eligibility is determined. (4-11-06) 743. RESOURCE ALLOWANCE LIMITS. The maximum resource allowance is computed by multiplying sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (a ll items; U.S. city average) between September 1988 and the September before the cur rent calendar year. The minimum resource allowance is computed by multiplying twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (all items; U.S. city average) betw een September 1988 and the Septem ber before the current cale ndar year. If the result is not an even one hundred dollar ($100) amount, round up to the n ext one hundred dollars ($100). The couple's resources exceeding the CSRA are counted for the long-term care spouse. (7-1-99) 744. INCOME COUNTED FIRST FOR CSRA REVISION. Income is determined prior to determining resources. If the cou ple's income is more than the minimum CSNS, the CSRA cannot be increased. If the community spouse has less inco me than the minimum CSNS, the CSRA may be increased as provided in Section 745 of these rules. Couple inc ome is the community spouse's gross income plus the long-term care spouse's income. The long-term care spouse's inc ome is his gross income less the AABD cash income exclusions and his patient liability income deductions, but not the CSA deduction. (4-2-08) 745. UPWARD REVISION OF CSRA. If the community spouse's income, including income from his CSA and income-producing resources in his CSRA, is less than the minimum CSNS, the CSRA may be increased. The CSRA is increased by enough resources, transferred from the long-term care spouse, to raise the community spouse's income to the minimum CSNS Resources included in the transfer are presumed to produce income at the treasury rate, whether or not the resources produce income. If the community spouse shows he is making reasonable use of his i ncome and resources, to generate income, the Department may waive the treasury rate requirement. Actual inco me produced by the resour ces transferred to the community spouse is used to comp ute the CSA. A higher CSA can b e requested under Section 727 of these rules. If the transferred resources produ ce more than the treasury rate, the actual income produced is used to determine the additional resources that can be transferred to the community s pouse in the CSRA. The long-term care spouse must transfer the resources to the co mmunity spouse, or the CSRA is not revised. (4-2-08) 746. RESOURCE TRANSFER ALLOWANCE (RTA). The resource transfer allowance (R TA) is computed by subtractin g the community spouse's resources, at the time of application, from the CSRA. The community spouse must own less than the CSRA to get an RTA. The long term care spouse may transfer the RTA to the community spouse without an asset transfer penalty. If the institutional spouse transfers more than the RTA, the amount of the couple's resourc es over the CSRA counts as the institutional spouse's resources. After the month a long -term care spouse is determine d Medicaid eligible under FSI, resources of the community spouse are not considere d available to the him while he remains in long -term care. (7-1-99) 747. PROTECTED PERIOD FOR RTA TRANSFER. The long-term care spouse has sixty (60) days, from the date hi s application is approved, t o transfer his ownership of the RTA resources to the community spouse. The long-term care s pouse must state, in writing, his intent to transfer the RTA resources to the communit y spouse, within the protected period, before he can be Medicaid eligible. Resources not transferred within the sixty (60) day protected p eriod are available to t he long-term care spouse, effective the day he enter ed the facility. (7-1-99) 748. EXTENSION FOR RTA TRANSFER.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03. 05 - Rules Governing Eligibility for Department of Health and Welfare Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled (AABD) Section 749 Page 2342 The protected period can be extended beyond sixty (60) days if necessary because of the par ticipant's circumstances. (7-1-99) 749. RESOURCE ELIGIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY SPOUSE. When the community spouse is a Medicaid participant, the spouse 's resources are counted using Medicaid rules. The FSI rules apply only to the long-term care spouse. For the mont h the couple stopped living together, resources of the community spouse available for his Medicaid eligibility are the resources owned by the couple. (7-1-99) 750. INCOME ELIGIBILITY F OR COMMUNITY SPOUSE. When the community spouse is a M edicaid participant, the spouse 's income is counted using Medicaid rules. The FSI rules apply only to the long-term care spouse. The community sp ouse may choose between the SSI and CP methods for determining income for Medicaid eligibility. (7-1-99) 751. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES. The FSI method of calculating inco me and resources stops the fi rst full calendar month after a change in circumstances resulting in a coup le no longer hav ing a communit y spouse and a long-term care spouse. (7-1-99) 752. NOTICE AND HEARING. The Department must tell the participant the CSA, the family me mber allowance, the CSRA and how it was computed, and RTA. Any hearing requested about the CSRA or the RTA must be held within thirty (30) days of the date of the request for hearing. (7-1-99) 753. -- 760. (RESERVED) 761. CHOICE OF SSI OR CP METHODS. A married participant, not using FSI, must be furnished a writt en explanation of SSI and CP income and resource counting methods. The couple ch ooses the most useful method, ba sed on their circumstances. The same method must be used for both spouses. (7-1-99) 762. SSI METHOD OF COUNTING INCO ME AND RESOURCES OF A COUPLE. The SSI method is the same method used to count income and reso urces for AABD cash. Income and resources of the participant and spouse are count ed as mutually available. This method must be used for months either spouse gets SSI or AABD cash, or an SSI and/or AABD application is filed and ap proved. This method must be used for Medicaid eligibility, and liability for the cost of long-term care, whet her one (1) or both spouses apply for Medicaid. For long- term care, the couple's income and resources are mutually avail able when one (1) or both spouses apply during the month they separated, because one (1) or both left their mutual home to enter a long-ter m care facility. (7-1-99) 763. COMMUNITY PROPERTY (CP) METH OD OF COUNTING INCOME AND RESOU RCES OF A COUPLE. A married participant in long-term care, whose spouse is not in the community , can use the CP method. A married participant using the FSI method, but not income eligible using FSI, may choose the CP method for income eligibility. The CP method must not be used for the FSI partici pant's resource eligibility or patient liability. (7-1-99) 764. CP METHOD. The CP method gives each spouse has an equal one-half (1/2) sha re of the couple's community income and resources. Each spouse also has his or her own separate income and resourc es. Whether the spouses live together or, if not living together, the length of time they have lived apart, does not ch ange the way income and resources are counted. A spouse's property includes income, personal property and real p roperty. The income and resources of a married couple acquired during the marriage are presumed to be communit y property of the couple. The couple can give evidence to rebut the presumptio n that property acquired during the marriage is community property. (7-1-99) 765. TRANSFER OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE INCOME NOT V ALID. An agreement between spouses, tr ansferring or assigning rights to future income from one (1) spouse to the other, is not valid for eligibility for Medicaid. (7-1-99) 766. CP METHOD NEED STANDARD. The participant is budgeted as a single person if his spouse is not a Medicaid applicant, i s not living with him, or wasIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03. 05 - Rules Governing Eligibility for Department of Health and Welfare Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled (AABD) Section 767 Page 2343 not living with him on the first day of the month. The particip ant and spouse are budgeted as a couple if they both apply, and live together, or if t hey were living together on th e first day of the month. (7-1-99) 767. CP METHOD RESOURCE LIMIT. The participant's resource limit is two thousand dollars ($2,00 0) if his spouse is not a Medicaid applicant, is not living with him, or was not living with him on the first day of the month. The participant and spouse have a resource limit of three thousand dollars ($3,000) if they both apply, an d live together, or if they were living together on the first day of the month. (7-1-99) 768. CP METHOD INCOME DISREGARDS. The participant gets the twenty dollar ($20) standard disregard if his spouse is not a Medicaid applicant, is not living with him, or was not living with him on the first day of the mo nth. If the participant has earned income, he gets the sixty-five dollar plus one-half ($65 + 1/2) of the remainder ea rned income disregard.

ASSET TRANSFER LOOK-BACK PERIOD.

For any asset transferred prior to February 8, 2006, the look-back period is thirty-six (36) months, unless the transfer is to or from a trust. If the transfer is to or from a trust, the look-back period is sixty (60) months. If the person is ent itled to Medicaid or HCBS services, the look-back period is counted from the month long-term care or HCBS service s began, or would have begun, were it not for a penalty. If the person is not entitled to Medicaid, the look-ba ck period is counted from the month prior to the month the application was submitted. (3-30-07) 02. Transfers On or After February 8, 2006 . Any asset transferred on or after February 8, 2006, regardless of type, is subject to a look-back period of sixty ( 60) months.

PERIOD OF RESTRICTED COVERAGE FOR ASSET TRANSFERS. The period of restricted coverage is the number of months compu ted by dividing the net uncompensated value of the transferred asset by the statewide average cost of nursing faci lity services to private patients. The cost is computed for the time of the participant's most recent request for Medicaid. If the spouse becomes eligible for long-term care Medicaid, the rest of the period of restricted coverage is divi ded between the participant and spouse. (4-2-08) 835. APPLYING THE PENALTY PER IOD OF RESTRICTED COVERAGE. Restricted coverage continues until the participant or spouse r ecovers all the assets, receives fair market value at the time of the transfer for all of the assets, or the period of re stricted coverage ends. The penalty continues whether or not the participant is in long-te rm care. The penalty period fo r asset transfers is applied as follows: (3-30-07) 01. Penalty Period for Transfer Prior to February 8, 2006 . For assets transferred prior to February 8, 2006, there is no penalty if the amount transferred is less than the cost of one (1) month's care. The penalty period begins running the month the t ransfer took place. The month the transfer took place is counted as one (1) of the penalty months. A penalty perio d is computed for each transfer. A penalty period must expire before the next begins. Each partial month before the end of consecutive penalty period s is a penalty month. A partial month at the end of consecutive penalty periods is dropped. (3-30-07) 02. Penalty Period for Transfers On or After February 8, 2006 . For assets transferred on or after February 8, 2006, the penalty period begins running the first d ay of the month after the m onth the transfer took place or was discovered to have take n place, or the date the individu al would have been eligible for long-term care services or HCBS, if not for the transfer , whichever date is later in ti me. The value of all asset tran sfers made during the look- back period is accumulated for th e purpose of calculating the p enalty. If an additional transfer is discovered after the penalty has been served, a new penalty period begins the month following timely notice of closure of benefits. When a penalty period ends after the first day of the month, eligibi lity for long-term care servi ces begins the day after the penalty period ends. (4-4-13) 836. MULTIPLE PENALTY PERIODS APPLIED CONSECUTIVELY. A penalty period is computed fo r each transfer. One (1) penalty period must expire before the next begins. (3-30-07) 837. LIFE ESTATE AS ASSET TRANSFER. 01. Transfer of a Remainder Interest . When a life estate in real pr operty is retained by an individ ual, and a remainder interest in the property is transferred during the look-back period for less than the fair market value of the remainder interest transf erred, the value of the uncompe nsated remainder is subject t o the asset transfer penalty as described in Sections 831 through 835 of these rules. To com pute the value of the life estate remainder, multiply the fair market value of the real property at the time of trans fer by the remainder factor for the participant's age at the time of transfer listed in the following table:IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03. 05 - Rules Governing Eligibility for Department of Health and Welfare Aid to the Aged, Blind, & Disabled (AABD) Section 837 Page 2354 (4-2-08) 02.

(3-30-07)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 Department of Health & Welfar e Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits Section 405 Page 2446a. Medicaid Cost Limits for Dates of Service Prior to a Current Ye ar. The reimbursable reasonable costs for services rendered prior to the beginning of the princ ipal year, but included as prior period claims in a subsequent period's co st report, will be sub ject to the same op erating cost limits as the claims under settlement. (3-30-07) b. Application of the Medicaid Cost Limit. In the determination of a hospital's reasonable costs for inpatient services rendered after the effective date of a princ ipal year, a hospital infla tion index, computed for each hospital's fiscal year end, will be applied to the operating co sts, excluding capital costs and other allowable costs as defined for the principal year a nd adjusted on a per diem basis for each subsequent year und er the hospital inflation index. (7-1-18) i. Each inpatient routine service cost center, as reported in th e finalized princip al year end Medicare cost report, will be segregated in the Medicaid cost limit calc ulation and assigned a share of total Medicaid inpatient ancillary costs. The prorated an cillary costs will be determine d by the ratio of each Medicaid routine cost center's reported costs to total Medicaid inpatient routine service cost s in the princip al year. (3-30-07) ii. Each routine cost center's to tal Medicaid routine service co sts plus the assigned share of Medicaid inpatient ancillary costs of the principal year will be divided by the related Medicaid patient days to identify the total costs per diem in the pr incipal year. (3-30-07) (1) The related inpatien t routine service cost center's per diem capital and graduate medical education costs plus the prorated share of inpatient ancillary capital co sts will be subtracted from the per diem amount identified in Subsection 405.02.b. ii. of this rule to identify each inpati ent routine service cost center per diem cost limit in the principal year. (3-30-07) (2) If a provider did not have any Medicaid inpatient utilizatio n or render any Medicaid inpatient services in an individual inpati ent routine service cost center in the fiscal year serving a s the principal year, the principal year for only those routine cost centers without util ization in the provider's principal year will be appropriately calculated using the information available in the next subsequent year in wh ich Medicaid utilization occurred. (3-30-07) iii. Each routine cost center's co st per diem for the principal year will be multiplied by the hospital inflation index for each sub sequent fiscal year. (7-1-18) iv. The sum of the per diem cost limits for the Medicaid inpatie nt routine service cost centers of a hospital during the principal year, as adjusted by the hospital inflation index, will be the Medicaid cost limit for operating costs in the current year. (7-1-18) (1) At the date of final settlement, reimbursement of the Medica id current year inpatient routine cost centers plus the assigned ancillary costs will be limited to th e total per diem operating costs as adjusted for each subsequent fiscal year after the principal year through the cur rent year by the hospital in flation cost index. (7-1-18) (2) Providers will be notified of the estimated inflation index periodically or hospital inflation index (CMS Market Basket Index) prior to final settlement only upon writte n request. (7-1-18) 03. Adjustments to the Medicaid Cost Limit . A hospital's request for review by the Department concerning an adjustment to or exemption from the cost limits i mposed under the provisions set forth in Section 405 of this chapter of rules, must be granted under the following c ircumstances: (3-30-07) a. Adjustments. Because of Extraord inary Circumstances. Where a pr ovider's costs exceed the Medicaid limit due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the co ntrol of the provider, the provider can request an adjustment to the cost limit to the extent the provider proves such higher costs result from the extraordinary circumstances including, but not limited to, increased costs at tributable to strikes, fires, earthquake, flood, or similar, unusual occurrences with substa ntial cost effects. (3-30-07) b. Reimbursement to Public Hospitals. A public hospital that provi des services free or at a nominalIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 Department of Health & Welfar e Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits Section 405 Page 2447charge, which is less than, or e qual to fifty percent (50%) of its total allowable costs, will be reimbursed at the same rate that would be used if the h ospital's charges were equal to , or greater than, i ts costs. (7-1-18) c. Adjustment to Cost Limits. A hospital is entitled to a reasonab le increase in its Medicaid cost limits if the hospital shows that its p er diem costs of providing serv ices have increased due to increases in case- mix, the adoption of new or changed services, the discontinuation of ser vices or decrease in average length of stay for Medicaid inpatients since the principal year. Any hospital maki ng such showing is entitled to an increase commensurate with the increas e in per diem costs. (7-1-18) i. The Medicaid operating cost limit may be adjusted by multiply ing cost limit by the ratio of the current year's case-mi x index divided by the principal year's c ase-mix index. (7-1-18) ii. The contested case procedure set forth in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"R ules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulin gs,\" is available to larger ho spitals seeking such adjustm ents to their Medicaid cost limits. (7-1-18) d. Adjustment to the Proration of Ancillary Costs in the principal year. Where the provider asserts that the proration of ancillary costs does not adequately reflect th e total Medicaid cost per diem calculated for the inpatient routine service cost centers in the principal year, t he provider may submit a detailed analysis of ancillary services provided to each partici pant for each type of patient day during each participant's stay during the principal year. The provider will be granted this adjustment only once up on appeal for the first cost reporting year that the limits are in effect. (3-30-07) 04. Payment Procedures . The following procedures are applicable to in-patient hospita ls: (3-30-07) a.

QIO review will be governed by provisions of the QI O Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended. If a review identifies that an admission or continued stay is not medically necessary, then no Medicaid payment will be made. Failure to obtain a timely QIO review as required by Sect ion 402 of this chapter of rules, and as outlined in the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended, will result in t he QIO conducting a late review. After a QIO review has determined that the hospital stay was medically nece ssary, Medicaid will assess a late review penalty to the hospital as outlined in Section 405 of this rule. (7-1-18) i. All admissions are subject to QI O review to determine if cont inued stay in inpatient status is medically necessary. A QIO continued stay review is required wh en the participant's length of stay exceeds the number of days certified by the Q IO. If no initial length of st ay certification was issued b y the QIO, a QIO continued stay review is require d when the admission exceeds a number of days as specified by the Department. (3-30-07) ii. Reimbursement for services originally identified as not medi cally necessary by the QIO will be made if such decision is reverse d by the appeals process requir ed in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declar atory Rulings .\" (3-30-07) iii. Absent the Medicaid particip ant's informed decision to incu r services deemed unnecessary by the QIO, or not authorized by the QIO due to the negligence of the provider, no payment for denied services may be obtained from the participant. (3-30-07) b. In reimbursing licensed hospitals , the Department will pay the lesser of customar y hospital charges or the reasonable cost of semi-pr ivate rates for in-patient hos pital care as set forth in th is rule, unless an exception applies as stated in Section 402 of these rules.

(3-19-07) b. Payment by the Department for the cost of long-term care exclud es the date of the participant's discharge, unless the day of discharge occurs on the same day a s admission; then, one (1) day of care is deemed to exist. When a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, the date of death is covered, rega rdless of the time of death. (3-21-12) 224. NURSING FACILITY: POST-ELIGIBILITY TREATMENT OF INCOME. Where an individual is determine d eligible for medical assistan ce participation in the cost of his long term care, the Department must reduce its payment to the long term care facili ty by the amount of his income considered available to meet the cost of his care. This determination is made in acc ordance with IDAPA 16.03.05, \"Eligibility for Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD),\" Sections 721 through 726. The amount that the medical assistance participant receives from SSA as reimbursement for his payment of the premium for Part B of Title XVIII (Medicare) is not considered income for patient liability under IDAPA 16.0 3.05, \"Eligibility for Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD), \" Section 317.

Overall management and evaluation of the care plan. The develop ment, management, and evaluation of a resident's care pl an, based on the physician's orders, constitute skilled services when, in terms of the patient's physical or mental condition, such development, manag ement, and evaluation necessi tate the involvement of technical or professional personnel to meet his needs, promote his recovery, and assure his medical safety. This would include the management of a plan involving only a variety of pe rsonal care services where, in light of the patient's condition, the aggregate of such services necessitates the invo lvement of technical or prof essional personnel. Where the patient's overall condition would support a finding that hi s recovery and safety could be assured only if the total care he requires is planned, managed, and evaluated by technica l or professional personnel, it would be appropriate to infer that skilled services are being provided. (3-19-07) b. Observation and assessment of t he resident's changing condition . When the resident's condition is such that the skills of a licen sed nurse or other technical or professional person are required to identify and evaluate the patient's need for possible modification of treatment and t he initiation of additional medical procedures until his condition is stabilized, such services constitute skilled servi ces. (3-19-07) 03. Direct Skilled Nursing Services . Direct skilled nursing services include the following: Intravenous injections; intravenous feedings; intramuscular required one (1) shift; (3-19-07) b.

PREADMISSION SCREENING AND ADDITIONAL RESIDENT REVIEW PROGR AM (PASARR). All Medicaid certified nursing f acilities must participate in, cooperate with, and meet all requirements imposed by, the Preadmission Screening and Additional Resident Review progr am, (PASARR) as set forth in 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart C. (3-19-07) 01. Background and Purpose . The purpose of these provisions is to comply with and impleme nt the PASARR requirements imposed on th e state by federal law. The pu rpose of those requirements is to prevent the placement of individuals with men tal illness (MI) or intellectu al disabilities (ID) in a nursing facility unless their medical needs clearly indicate th at they require the level of c are provided by a nursing f acility. This is accomplished by both pre-admission screening (PAS) and additional resident r eview (ARR). Individuals, f or whom it appears that a diagnosis of MI or ID is likely, are identified for further scr eening by means of a Level I screen. The actual PASARR is accomplished through a Level II screen where it is determine d whether, because of the individual's physical and mental condition, he requires the level of services provided by a nursing facility. If the individual with MI or ID is determined to require a nursing facility level of care, it must also be determined whether the individual requires specialized services. PASARR appl ies to all individuals enterin g or residing in a nursing facility, regardless of payment source. (3-19-07) 02. Policy . It is the policy of the Departm ent that the difficulty in pro viding specialized services in the nursing facility setting makes it generally inappropriate to pl ace individuals needing sp ecialized services in an nursing facility. This policy is supported by the background an d development of the federal PASARR requirements, including the narrow definition of mental illness adopted by fe deral law. While recognizing that there are exceptions, it is envisioned that most indivi duals appropriate for nursing facility placement will not r equire services in excess of those required to be provided by nursing facilities by 42 CFR 4 83.45. (3-19-07) 03. Inter-Agency Agreement . The state Medicaid agency will enter into a written agreement with the state mental health and intellectual disabilities authorities a s required in 42 CFR 431.621(c). This agreement will, among other things, set forth re spective duties and delegation of responsibilities, and any supplemental criteria to be used in making determinations. (3-19-07) a. The \"State Mental Health Authori ty\" (SMHA) in the Division of F amily and Community Services of the Department, or its s uccessor entity. (3-19-07) b. The \"State Intellectual Disabilit ies or Developmental Disabilit ies Authority\" (SDDA) in the Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. (3-19-07) 04. Coordination for PASARR . The PASARR process is a coordinated effort between the state Medicaid agency, the SMHA and SDDA, independent evaluators and the nursing facility. PASARR activities will be coordinated through the Regional Medicaid Services (RMS). RMS i s responsible for record retention and tracking functions. However, the nursing facility is responsible for ass uring that all screens are obtained and for coordination with the RMS, independent MI evaluators, the SMHA and SDDA, and their designees. Guidelines and procedures on how to comply with these requirem ents can be found in the \"Stat ewide PASARR Procedures ,\" a reference guide. (3-19-07) a. All required Level I screens and reviews must be completed and submitted to the RMS prior to admission to the facility. (3-19-07) b. When a nursing facility identifies an individual with MI or ID through a Level I screen, or otherwise, the nursing facility is responsible for contacting t he SMHA or SDDA (as approp riate), and assuring that a Level II screen is completed prior to admission to the facility , or in the case of an existing resident, completed in order to continue residing in the facility. (3-19-07) c. Additional Resident Reviews (ARR). An individual identified wit h MI or ID must be reviewed and a new determination made promptl y after a significant change in his physical or mental condition. The facility must notify the RMS of any such change within two (2) working days o f its occurrence. For the purpose of this section, significant change for the partic ipant's mental condition means a change that may require the provision of specializedIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 228 Page 2584services or an increase in such services. A significant change in physical condition is a change that renders the participant incapabl e of responding to MI or D.D. program inter ventions. (3-19-07) 228. NURSING FACILITY: COORDINATION OF NURSING FACILITY ELIGIBIL ITY AND THE NEED FOR SPECIALIZED SERVICES. Determinations as to the need f or nursing facility care and det erminations as to the need for specialized services should not be made independently. Such determinations must ofte n be made on an individual basis, taking into account the condition of the resident and the capability of the facility to which admission is proposed to furnish the care needed. When an individual id entified with MI and ID is ad mitted to a nursing facil ity, the nursing facility is responsible for meetin g that individual's n eeds, except for the provision of specializ ed services. (3-19-07) 01. Level of Care . (3-19-07) a. Individual determinations must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. (3-19-07) b. Categorical determinations. Recognizing that individual determi nations of level of care are not always necessary, those categories set forth as examples at 42 CFR 483.130(d) are hereby adopted as appropriate for categorical determinati ons. When nursing facility level of care is determined appropriate categorically, the individual may be conditionally admitted prior to completion of the determ ination for specialized services. However, conditional admissions cannot ex ceed seven (7) days, except for respite admissions which cannot exceed thirty (30) consecutive days in one (1) calendar year. (3-19-07) 02. Specialized Services . Specialized services for menta l illness as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(1), and for intellectual disabilities as defined in 42 CFR 483.120( a)(2), are those services provided by the state that due to the intensity and scope can only be delivered by personnel and programs that are not in cluded in the specialized rehabilitation services required of nursing facilities under 42 CFR 483.45. The need for specialized services must be documented and included in both the resident assessment instrum ent and the plan o f care. (3-19-07) a. Individual determinations must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. (3-19-07) b. Categorical determinations that specialized services are not ne eded may be made in those situations permitted by 42 CFR 483.130. (3-19-07) 03. Penalty for Non-Compliance . No payment will be made for any services rendered by a nursin g facility prior to completion of the Level I screen and, if requ ired, the Level II screen. Fa ilure to comply with PASARR requirements for all individuals admitted or seeking admission may also subject a nursing facility to other penalties as part of certification action under 42 CFR 483.20. (3-19-07) 04. Appeals . Discharges, transfers, and pr eadmission PASARR determinations may be appealed to the extent required by 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart E, and under Secti on 67-5229, Idaho Code. Appeals under this paragraph are made in accordance with the fair hearing provisio ns in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declar atory Rulings .\" (3-19-07) a. A Level I finding of MI or ID is not an appealable determinatio n. It may be disputed as part of a Level II determinatio n appeal. (3-19-07) b. In the event that the PASARR program is eliminated or made non- mandatory by an act of Congress, the provisions of Sec tion 227 of these rules will cea se to be operative on the eff ective date of any such act, without further action. (3-19-07) 229. NURSING FACILITY: PREPAYMENT SCREEN AND DETERMINATION OF EN TITLEMENT TO MEDICAID PAYMENT FOR NURSING FACILITY CARE AND SERVICES. The level of care for Title XIX and Title XXI payment purposes is determined by the De partment. Necessity for payment is determined in accord ance with 42 CFR 483 Subpart C a nd Section 1919(e) (7) of the Social Security Act. In the event a required Level II screen was not accomplished pr ior to admission, entitlement for Medicaid payment asIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 230 Page 2585established by the RMS will not be earlier than the date the Le vel II screen is completed, indicating that nursing facility placement is appropriate. (4-2-08) 01. Information Required for Med ical Evaluation Determination . A current Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be provided to the Department. Additional supporting information may be requested. (3-19-07) 02. Information Required for Level I and II Screen Determination . An accurate Level I screen and when required, a Level II screen. (3-19-07) 230. NURSING FACILITY: PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS AND DUTIES. 01. Provider Application and Certification . A facility must apply to participate as a nursing facility. (3-19-07) 02. Licensure and Certification . (3-19-07) a. Upon receipt of an application fr om a facility, the Licensing a nd Certification Agency determines the facility's compliance with certification standards for the type of care the facility proposes to provide to medical assistance participants. (3-19-07) b. If a facility proposes to partici pate as a skilled nursing faci lity, Medicare (Title XVIII) certification and program participation is required before the facility can b e certified for Medicaid. The Licensing and Certification Agency must determ ine the facility's compliance w ith Medicare requirements and recommend certification to the Med icare Agency. (3-19-07) c. If the Licensing and Certificati on Agency determines that a fac ility meets Title XIX certification standards for nursing facility care. The Department must certif y to the appropriate branch of government that the facility meets the standards for nursing facility level of care . (3-19-07) d. Upon receipt of the cer tification from the Li censing and Certif ication Agency, the Department may enter into a provider agreemen t with the long-t erm care facilit y. (3-19-07) e. After the provider agreement ha s been executed by the Facility Administrator and by the Department, one (1) copy must be sent by certified mail to the facility and the original is to be retained by the Department (3-19-07) 232. -- 234. (RESERVED) 235. NURSING FACILITY: PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT. 01. Payment Methodology . Nursing facilities will be reimbursed in accordance with the payment methodologies as described in S ections 236 through 295 of these rules. (3-19-07) 02. Date of Discharge . Payment by the Department for the cost of long term care is t o exclude the date of the participant's discharge. I f a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, his date of death is covered regardless of the time of occurrence. If an adm ission and a discharge occur o n the same date, then one (1) day of care will be deemed to exist. (3-21-12) 236. NURSING FACILITY: REA SONABLE COST PRINCIPLES. To be allowable, costs must be r easonable, ordinary, necessary and related to patient care. It will be expected that providers will incur costs in such a manner that economical and efficient delivery of quality health care to participants will result. (3-19-07) 01. Application of Reasonable Co st Principles . (3-19-07)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 237 Page 2586a. Reasonable costs of any services are determined in accordance w ith this chapter of rules found in Sections 236 through 295 of these rules, and Provider Reimburse ment Manual (PRM), Sections 100 through 2600, as modified by the exceptions conta ined herein, is used to identif y cost items to be included on Idaho's Uniform Cost Report. (3-19-07) i. Reasonable cost takes into acco unt both direct and indirect c osts of providers of services, including normal standby costs. (3-19-07) ii. The objectives of these methods are that: first, the costs w ith respect to individuals covered by the program will not be borne by others not so covered. Second, the costs with respect to individuals not covered will not be paid by the program. (3-19-07) b. Costs may vary from one instituti on to another because of a var iety of factors. It is the intent of the program that providers will be r eimbursed the actual operating costs of providing high qual ity care, unless such costs exceed the applicable maximum base rate developed pursuant to p rovisions of Title 56, Idaho Code, or are unallowable by application of promulgated regulation. (3-19-07) c. Implicit in the intention that actual operating costs be paid t o the extent they are reasonable is the expectation that the provider s eeks to minimize its costs and t hat its actual operating co sts do not exceed what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer pays for a given item or servi ce. (3-19-07) d. If costs are determined to exceed the level that such buyers in cur, in the absence of clear evidence that the higher costs were unavo idable, the excess costs are no t reimbursable. (3-19-07) 02. Costs Related to Patient Care . These include all necessary a nd proper costs in developing an d maintaining the operation of pat ient care facilities. Necessary and proper costs related to patient care are usually costs that are common and accepted occu rrences in the field of the pr ovider's activity. They include costs such as depreciation, interest expense, nursing costs, maintenance cost s, administrative costs, costs of employee pension plans, normal standby costs, and others. Example: Depreciation is a method of systemat ically recognizing the declining utility value of an asset. To the extent that the ass et is related to patient care, reasonable, ordinary, and necessary, the related expense is allowable when reimbursed bas ed on property costs accord ing to other provisions of this chapter. Property related e xpenses are likewise allowable. (3-19-07) 03. Costs Not Related to Patient Care . Costs not related to patient care are costs that are not appropriate or necessary and prope r in developing and maintaini ng the operation of patient care facilities and activities. Such costs are not allowable in computing reimbursa ble costs. Example: Fines are imposed for late remittance of federal withholding taxes. Such fines are not rel ated to patient care, are not necessary, and are not reflective of prudent cost conscious management. Therefore, suc h fines and penalties are not allowable. (3-19-07) 04. Form and Substance . Substance of transactions will prevail over the form. Financi al transactions will be disallowed to the extent that the substance of the tran saction fails to meet reasonable cost principles or comply with rules and policy. Example: Lease-Purchase agreements are c ontracts that are executed in the form of a lease. The wording of the contract is couched in such a manner as to give the reader the impression of a true rental-type lease. However, the substance of this contract is a purchase of the pr operty. If a lease contract i s found to be in substance a purchase, the related payments ar e not allowable as lease or re ntal expense. (3-19-07) 237. NURSING FACILITY: NOTICE OF PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENT.

Nursing facility rates are pro spective, with new rates effectiv e July 1st of each year, and are recalculated annually with quarterly adjustments for case mix. The rate for a nursing facility is the sum of the cost components described in Subsection 257.04 through 257.08 of this rule. In no case will the rate be set higher than the charge for like services to private pay patients in effect for the period for which payment is made as computed by the lower of costs or customary charges. For the rate year of July 1, 2011, through J une 30, 2012, rates will be calculated using audited cost reports ended in calendar year 2010 wi th no allowance for inflation to the rate year of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012. For the rate years beginning July 1, 2012, and annual ly thereafter, rates will be calculated using audited cost reports for periods ended in t he preceding calendar year with n o allowance for inflation to the prospective rate period. (4-4-13) 01. Applicable Case Mix Index (CMI) . The Medicaid CMI used in esta blishing each facility's rate is calculated based on the most recent assessment for each Medicai d resident in the nursing facility on the first day of the month of the preceding quarter (for example, assessments as of April 1are used to establish the CMI needed to establish rates for the quarter beginning July 1st). Facility-w ide CMI is calculated based on the most recent assessment for all residents in the nursing facility. The CMI i s recalculated quarterly and each nursing facility's rate is adjusted accordingly. A facility-wide CMI is also established e ach year by averaging four (4) calendar quarter CMIs for the cost reporting period fr om historical data to represent each fiscal quarter in the cost reporting period (for example, an October 1 CMI would represent the fiscal quarter en ded September 30th). (3-19-07) 02. Applicable Cost Data . The cost data used in establis hing the cost components of the r a t e calculation are from the audited o r unaudited cost report that ended during the previous calendar year (for example, cost reports ending during the period from January 1, 1998 - De cember 31, 1998 are used in setting rates effective July 1, 1999). The draft audit of a cost report submitted by a facility will be issued by the Department no later than five (5) months after the date a ll information required for com pletion of the audit is filed with the Department. (3-19-07)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 258 Page 259403. Interim Rates . Nursing facilities with unaudited cost reports are given an i nterim rate established by the Department until a rate is calculated based on an audite d cost report. When audited data are available, a retroactive adjustment to the pa yment rate is made through the calculation of the final ized rate. (3-19-07) 04. Direct Care Cost Component . The direct care cost component of a nursing facility's rate i s determined as follows: (3-19-07) a. The direct care per diem cost lim it applicable to the rate peri od for a nursing facility type (free- standing and urban hospital-based nursing facility, rural hospi tal-based nursing facility, free-standing and urban hospital-based behavioral care unit, or rural hospital-based be havioral care unit) is identi fied. The identified direct care cost limit is divided by the statewide average CMI for the cost reporting period, and then multiplied by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting per iod to derive the adjusted d irect care per diem cost limit. (4-4-13) b. The adjusted direct care per die m cost limit is compared to the nursing facility's i nflated direct care per diem costs. The lower of the two (2) amounts is then case m ix adjusted. (3-19-07) i. If the adjusted direct care pe r diem cost limit is lower, the adjusted limit is divided by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period, and then multiplied by the nursi ng facility's most recent quarterly Medicaid CMI for the ra te period to arrive at the dir ect care cost component. (3-19-07) ii. If the inflated direct care pe r d i e m c o s t s a r e l o w e r , t h e s e costs, minus raw food and Medicaid related ancillary costs, are divided by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period, then multiplied by the nursing facil ity's most recent quarterly Medi caid CMI for the rate period. Raw food and Medicaid related ancillary costs are then added back to arrive at the di rect care cost com ponent. (3-19-07) 05. Indirect Care Cost Component . The indirect care cost componen t of a facility's rate is the lesser of the facility's inflated indirect care per diem costs, or the indirect per diem cost limit for that type of provider -- free - standing and urban hospital-based nursing facilities including behavioral care unit nursing facility providers, or rural hospital-based nursing facilities including behavioral care uni t nursing facility providers. (4-4-13) 06. Costs Exempt From Limitation .

Revenues from products or services provided to nonpatients wi ll be offset from the corresponding rate componen t(s) as described in Section 257 of this rule. (4-4-13) 258. NURSING FACILITY: COST LIMITS BASED ON COST REPORT. Each July 1st cost limitations will be established for nursing facilities based on the most recent audited cost report with an end date of June 30th of the previous year or before. C alculated limitations will be effective for a one (1) year period, from July 1 through Jun e 30th of each year, which is th e rate year. For the rate year of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012, the direct and indirect cost limits were calcula ted using the most recent aud ited cost reports adjusted to the midpoint of the cost reporti ng year's end in calendar year 2010, to allow for no inflation to the rate year. For rate years beginning July 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, the dire ct and indirect cost limits will be calculated using the most recent audited cost reports adjusted to the midpoint of ea ch provider's cost reporting year that is used to set the July 1 rate, to allow for no inf lation to the rat e year.

Prior to establishing the first \"shadow rates\" at July 1, 1999, the estimated Medicaid payments under the previous retrospective system for the year period fro m July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, will be calculated. This amount will then be used to model the estimate d payments under the case mix system set forth in Sections 255 through 257 of thes e rules. The percentages above the bed-weighted median, for direct and indirectIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 259 Page 2595costs, will be established at a l evel that approximates the sam e amount of Medicaid expendi tures as would have been produced by the retrospective sy stem. The percentages will also be established to approximate the same distribution of total Medicaid dollars between the hospital-based and freest anding nursing facilities as existed under the retrospective system. (4-4-13) b. Once the percentage is established, it will be used to calculat e the limit by multiplying the bed- weighted median per diem direct c ost times the calculated perce ntage for that class of provi der. There will be a direct and indirect percentage that is applied to freestanding and urb an hospital-based nursing f acilities, and a higher direct and indirect percentage that is a pplied to rural hospital-based nursing facilities. (4-4-13) c. Beginning with rates effective October 1, 2012, additional dire ct care cost limit categories will be added for free-standing and urba n hospital-based behavioral car e units and rural hospital-ba sed behavioral care units. Percentages previously established for other provider class typ es not considered a behavioral care unit will remain unchanged. Once established, these percentages will remain in e ffect for future rate setting periods. (4-4-13) 02. Direct Cost Limits . The direct cost limitation will be calculated by indexing the selected cost data forward by the inflation adjustment from the midpoint of the co st report period to the midpoint of the period for which the limit will be applicable. The indexed per diem costs will then be normalized and arrayed from high to low, with all nursing facilities includ ed in the same a rray, and the bed-weighted median will be computed. (4-4-13) 03. Indirect Cost Limits . The indirect cost limitation will be calculated by indexing t he selected cost data forward by the inflation adjustment from the midpoint of t he cost report period to the midpoint of the period for which the limit will be applicable. The indexed per diem costs will then be arrayed, with all nursing facilities included in the same array, and the bed-we ighted median will be computed . (4-4-13) 04. Limitation on Increase or Decrease of Cost Limits . Increases in the direct and indirect cost limits will be determined by the limitations calculated in the most re cent base year, indexed forward each year from the midpoint of the base year to the midpoint of the rate year by t he inflation factor plus one percent (1%) per annum. The calculated direct and indirect c ost limits will not be allowed to decrease below the limita tions effective in the base year. The maximum rate of growth on the cost limits, and the mi nimum cost limitation, will be examined by the oversight committee periodically to determine which factors to use in the calculation of the limitations effective in the new base year and forward. (3-29-10) 05. Costs Exempt From Limitations . Costs exempt from limitations include property taxes, propert y insurance, and utilities. These c osts will be reimbursed on a p er diem basis and will not be included in the calculation of the direct or indir ect care component. H owever, property tax es and property insurance will be subject to minimum occupancy levels as defined in S ection 278 of these rules. (3-19 -07) 259. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF NEW BEDS. Facilities that add beds after July 1, 1999, will have their re imbursement rate subjected to an additional limitation for the next three (3) years. This limitation will apply beginning with the first rate setting period that utilizes a cost report that includes the date when the beds were added. (3-19-07) 01. Limitation of Facilities Rate . The facility's rate will be lim ited to the bed-weighted avera ge of the following two (2) rates: (3-19-07) a. The facility's current prospective rate cal culated in accordanc e with Section 257 of these rules; and (3-19-07) b. The current median rate for nursi ng facilities of that type, fr ee-standing, rural hospital-based, or urban hospital-base d, established each J uly 1st. (3-19-07) 02. Calculation of the Bed-Weighted Average . The current calculated facility rate is multiplied by the number of beds in existence prior to the addition. The median r ate is multiplied by the number of added beds, weighted for the number of days in the cost reporting period fo r which they were in servi ce. These two (2) amounts are added together and divided by the total number of beds, wit h the new beds being weighted if they were only in service for a portion of the year. The resulting per diem amoun t represents an overall limitation on the facility'sIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 260 Page 2596reimbursement rate. Providers w ith calculated rates that do not exceed the limitation receiv e their calculated rate. (3-19-07) 03. Exception to New Bed Rate . The following situations will not be treated as new beds for reimbursement purposes: (3-19-07) a. Any beds converted from nursing facility beds to assisted livin g beds, can be converted back to nursing facility beds within three (3) years and not be classif ied as new nursing facility beds. When a nursing facility bed has been converted to an assisted living bed for three (3) or more concurrent years and the bed is converted back to a nursing facility bed, it mu st be treated as a new nursing facility bed. (3-19-07) b. Beds added as a result of expansi on plans, that the Department was aware of prior to July 1, 1999, will not be treated as new beds. The facility must have already expended significant resources on the purchase of land, site planning, site utility planning, and development. Th e existence of adequate land or space at the nursing facility does not by itself constitute a significant expenditur e of resources for the purposes of expansion. A written request with adequate supporting documentation for an exception under this provision must have been received by the Department no later than December 31, 1999. In no case will beds added after July 1, 2003, qualify for this exception to the new bed criteria. (3-19-07) c. Beds that are decertified as a re quirement of survey and certif ication due to deficiencies at the facility can be re-certified as existing beds with the approval of the Department. (3-19-07) d. When a facility can dem onstrate to the Department that adding b eds is necessary to meet the needs of an under served area, these b eds will not be treated as new beds. For an existing facility the new beds are reimbursed at the same reimburse ment rate for th at facility's e xisting beds. For a new facilit y, the reimbursement rate is negotiated with the Department. (3-19-07) 260. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF NEW FACILITIES. Facilities constructed subsequent to July 1, 1999, will be reim bursed at the median rate for skilled care facilities of that type (freestanding or hospital-based) for the first three (3) full years of operation. During the period of limitation, the facility's rate will be modified each July 1st to reflect t he current median rate for skilled care facilities of that type . After the first three (3) full years, the facility will have it s rate established at the next July 1st with the existing facilities in accordance with Sectio n 257 of this rule. (3-19-07 ) 261. NURSING FACILITY: TREATME NT OF A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP. New providers resulting from a change in ownership of an existi ng facility will receive the previous owner's rate until such time as the new owner has a cost report that qualifies for the rate setting criteria est ablished under t hese rules. If the Department determines that such a facility is operationally or financially unstable, the Department may negotiate a reimbursement rate di fferent than the rat e then in effect for the facility. (5-8-09) 262. NURSING FACILITY: OUT-OF-STATE NURSING HOMES. The Idaho Medicaid Program will reimburse for out-of-state nurs ing home placements when services are not available in Idaho to meet the p articipant's medical need, or i n a temporary situation for a limited period of time required to safely transport the participant to an Idaho facili ty. Reimbursement for out-of- state nursing homes will be at the per diem rate set by the Medicaid Program in the state w here the nursing home is located. Special rates will be allowed according to Section 27 0 of these rul es. (3-19-07) 263. NURSING FACILITY: DISTRESSED FACILITY. 01. Determination . If the Department determines t hat a facility is located in an under-served area, or addresses an under-served need, the Department may negotiate a reimbursement rate different than the rate then in effect for that facility. (5-8-09) 02. Discretionary Factors . The fact that a facility may be located in an under-served ar ea or meets an under-served need does not guara ntee increased rei mbursement. I n exercising its discretion to apply a higher rate, the Department will consider the fact ors as described in Subsection s 263.02.a. through 263.02.e . of this rule. (5-8-09) a. Prudent Spending Patterns. The facility has exercised prudent s pending and cost allocationIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 264 Page 2597practices, as evidenced by a thor ough and comprehensive review of the facility's accoun ts by the Department. (5-8-09) b. Reasonable Attempts to Remedy Problems. The facility must persu ade the Department that it has conscientiously and diligently attempted to cover its costs of care, hire qualified staff and otherwise operate effectively and efficiently, bu t for causes beyond the facility 's reasonable control, it h as not been able to do so. (5-8-09) c. Facility Already Receives Special Rates. When a facility alread y receives special rates for certain difficulty-of-care patients from the Department, the same costs of care that were used to determine special rates will not be applied toward a determina tion of distressed facility st atus, because the special rate meets that need. (5-8-09) d. Direct and Indirect Costs of Care Apportioned to Patient Care. The Department reimburses the costs of patient care, and does n o t p a y f o r i n d i r e c t c o s t s n o t associated with patient car e. The determination of distressed status will focus on wh ether the facility's distress stems from patient care cost s, or whether the distress arises from expenses unrelated to patien t care costs. (5-8-09) e. Existing Cost Limits.Under no circumstances may a facility's re imbursement exceed the lower of its actual costs or customary charge to private-pay patients, a s required by federal law, s ubject to the ex ceptions in federal law. The Department's cost caps can be exceeded through the distressed facility process, but to an amount no greater than the federal upper payment limit. (5-8-09) 03. Annual Review . Distressed facility payments are assumed to be short-term in nature. Each distressed payment must be re-requested and re-justified for ea ch subsequent fiscal year that the facility desires the distressed facility rate. (5-8-09) 04. Prospective Application . Distressed facility status will be applied only to facilities t h a t a r e currently distressed or entering a period of distress. Distress ed facility status will not be applied to retroactive rate years. (5-8-09) 05. Facility-by-Facility Basis . Each facility must independently establish distress on its ow n merits, whether or not other facilities with a common owner may also be experiencing distress. (5-8-09) 264. NURSING FACILITY: INTERIM ADJUSTMENTS TO RATES AS A RESULT OF NEW MANDATES. Certain costs may be excluded from the cost limit calculations, may be subject to retrospective settlement at the discretion of the Department, and may result in changes to the prospective rates as provided in this Section to assure equitable reimbursement: (3-19-07) 01. Changes of More Than Fifty Cents Per Patient Day in Costs . Changes of more than fifty cents ($.50) per patient day in costs otherwise subject to the cost l imitations incurred by a facility as a result of changes in state or federal laws or rules w ill be reported separately on t he cost report until such time as they can be properly reflected in the cost limits. (3-19-07) a. The provider will report these co sts on a separate schedule or by notations on the cost report so that these costs can be identified and reconciled to the provider's general ledger. These costs will be reported separately and will not be reimbursed through the rate setting process unt il the costs are fully represented in the cost data used to establish the cost limita tions and rates. (3-19-07) b. If more than one (1) increase occurs as a result of one (1) or more law or rule changes, the costs from each event are to be rep orted separately. (3-19-07) c. The computation of the cost incr ease amount or amounts is to be presented in detail on a supplementary schedule or schedul es unless the Department state s otherwise. (3-19-07)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 265 Page 259802. Interim Rate Adjustments . For interim rate purposes, the provider may be granted an inc rease in its prospective rate to cover such cost increases. A cost state ment covering a recent period may be required with justification for the increased costs. The actual amount relate d to such increases will be determined at audit and may be retrospectively settled. (3-19-07) 03. Future Treatment of Costs . After the initial deadline has passed for all providers to fi le cost reports for reporting periods beginning on or after the date ce rtain cost increases were fi rst required, the Department will, at it's option, include all of the previously excluded co sts related to those increases in the calculation of costs subject to the cost center limits. The intent of this provision is for costs to be exempt fro m the cost limits until these costs are able to be fully and equitably incorporated into the data base used to project the cost limits. When cost increases that have been exclude d from the cap are incorporated in the inflation indices used to set the cost limits, the cost indices will be adjusted t o exclude the influence of such changes if the amount included in the index is identified. When the cost limits are set to include previously excluded amo unts, any adjustments made to the indices related to the previously excluded cost s will be removed. (3-19-07) 265. NURSING FACILITY: MDS REVIEWS. The following Minimum Data Set ( MDS) reviews will be conducted: (3-19-07) 01. Facility Review . Subsequent to the picture date, each facility will be sent a copy of its resident roster (a listing of r esidents, their RUG classification, case mix index, and identification as Medicaid or other). It will be the facility's responsibility at that time to review the ros ter for accuracy. If the roster is accurate, the facility will sign and return the roster for rate setting. If any errors are detected, those errors will be communicated to the Department in writing along with any supporting documentation. If the signed resident roster is not returned and no errors are communicated to the De partment, the original residen t roster will be used for rate setting. Once the resident roster has been used for rate se tting, it will be considered fi nal unless modified by subseq uent Departmental review. (3-19-07) 02. Departmental Review . If a departmental review of the MDS data reveals errors that result in an incorrect case mix index, the pr ovider's rate will be retroacti vely adjusted, for all quarters containing the incorrect assessment, and an amount due to or from the Department will be calculated. This does not include residents who received the default classificat ion due to incomplete or incons istent MDS 266. (BCU) AND RATE STRUC TURE. Effective October 1, 2012, the additional direct care costs ass ociated with BCU residents will remain in direct care costs subject to the direct car e cost limitation. Those qualify ing BCU nursing facility provi ders may have a direct care cost limitation higher than non-BCU nursing facility providers. BCU nursing facility provi ders will not receive an increased indirect care co st limitation. (4-4-13) 01. Determination . The BCU must have a qualifying program and have been providin g care in the BCU to behavior residents as of July 1, 2011. Nursing facility providers that meet the BCU criteria will have BCU direct care costs included in d irect care costs subject to the cost limit. The direct care co st limitation may be higher than a non-BCU nursing facility. (4-4-13) 02. BCU Routine Customary Charge . If the cost to operate a BCU is included in a nursing facilit y's rate calculation, the nursing facility must report its usual an d customary charge for semi- private rooms in both the BCU and general nursing facility. A weighted average routine cu stomary charge is computed to represent the composite of all Medicaid nursing facility residents in the nur sing facility based on the type of rooms they occupy, including the BCU. (4-4-13) 03. Prospective Rate Setting . Beginning October 1, 2012, the direct care cost limit calcula tion for any special rate revenue offsets in t he prior year related to one-t o-one (1:1) staffing ratios, BCU, or increased staffing, will be reversed before calculating the cost limit. This revenu e offset reversal excludes revenues related to special rate add-ons for ventilator-dependent or tracheostomy services. Rate s will be calculated using the cost report ended in the calendar year prior to each July 1 rate setting period with the BCU's direct care costs in cluded in direct care costs subject to the higher BCU cost limit. (4-4-13) 04. Rates Effective October 1, 2012 . For rates effective October 1 , 2012, a nursing facility desig natedIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 266 Page 2599as a BCU during each n ursing facility provider's cost report en ded in calendar year 2011 must be identified. (4-4-13) a. Days approved for a BCU during th e 2011 cost repor t year must b e identified. (4-4-13) b. To qualify as a BCU, Medicaid BCU days identified in Subsection 266.04.a. of this rule, are divided by total days in the nursing facility and that calculat ion must equal or exceed a m inimum of fifteen percent (15%). (4-4-13) 05. Annual Rates Beginning July 1, 2013 . For annual rates beginning July 1, 2013, once a rate has been set as provided in Subsection 266.03 of this rule, the fol lowing process will be used to determine BCU eligibility. A nursing facility must apply for BCU eligibility on an annual basis. Eligibility is determined by: (4-4-13) a. BCU days, regardless of payer source, are divided by the total occupied days in the nursing facility and that calculation must equal or exceed a minimu m of twenty p ercent (20%). (4-4-13) b. The BCU nursing facility provider must provide a list of all re sidents they believe were qualified for BCU status for the previous year; (4-4-13) i. The Department will select a sample of Idaho Medicaid partici pants from the submitted list. The nursing facility provider must s end the MDS for each selected s ample participant, al ong with related census information, and other requested information to the Department. (4-4-13) ii. The Department will review this information to determine tha t the participants meet the requirements of Subsection 266.06 of this rule and calculate th e percentage of BCU days to the total occupied days in the facility to determine whether the facility meets the BCU el igibility requirement in Subsection 266.05.a. of this rule. (4-4-13) 06. Participant Characteristics . All participants in a BCU must meet the criteria for nursing facility level of care, and have the follo wing characteristics as provid ed in the participants' MDS assessment: (4-4-13) a. Medically based behavior disorder that causes a significantly d iminished capacity for judgment, retention of information, or decision making skills, or medical ly based mental health disorder of diagnosis and has a high level resource use; and (4-4-13) b. Must have a history or demonstrate need for additional resource s to provide for disruptive behaviors requiring e nhanced resource use from nursing facility staff, evidenced by one (1) or more of the following: (4-4-13) i. Wandering behaviors; (4-4-13) ii. Verbally abusive behaviors; (4-4-13)iii. Physically abusive behaviors; (4-4-13) iv. Socially inappropriate or disruptive behaviors, such as verb al or vocal symptoms like disruptive sounds, noises, screaming, physical symptoms like self-abusive acts, public sexual behavior or disrobing in public, smearing or throwing food or bodi ly wastes, hoarding, rummaging through belongings of other residents; (4-4-13) v. Behaviors that resist care; or (4-4-13) vi. Does not meet unit discharge criteria outlined in Subsection 266.13 of this rule. (4-4-13) c. A behavior baseline pr ofile must be establ ished for each partic ipant; (4-4-13) d. A behavior intervention progra m must be in place for each parti cipant, designed to reduce or control the inappropriate behavi ors to enhance the participant' s quality of life, functional and cognitive status or safety. (4-4-13)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 266 Page 260007. BCU Annual Renewal . The facility must request continuation in the BCU program ann ually. The request must include the following: (4-4-13) a. A description of the facility's program that includes the requi red components in Subsections 266.05 and 266.06 of this rule; and (4-4-13) b. A profile of the types of behavio r of participants served and a ny restrictions the facility has adopted. (4-4-13) 08. Administrative and Staffing Requirements . (4-4-13) a. Staffing must be at a level n ecessary for the facility to be ab le to provide direct supervision of participants as needed. (4-4-13) b. Psychiatrist or physician extender must be available to consult as needed for initial and on-going assessments and for twenty-four h ours a day/seven days a week ( 24/7) emergency services. Consultants must make at least quarterly site visits and be available to participate in Behavior Management Team m eetings as needed. (4-4-13) c.

(4-4-13) 14. Termination of BCU Status . If a provider opts to leave th e BCU program, the Department m ust be notified so the direct care cap can be adjusted t o that of a no n-BCU provider, beginning with the next rate year. (4-4-13) 15. Refusal of Admissions . These rules do not preclude a nursing facility from refusing to admit a participant whose needs cannot be met by the nursing facility. ( 4-4-13) 267. NURSING FACILITY: TREATMENT OF NEWLY LICENSED FACILITIES WI TH BEHA VIORAL CARE UNITS. 01. Criteria to Qualify as a New BCU On or After September 1, 20 17. Facilities licensed on or after September 1, 2017, must meet the qualifications for a BCU Subsections of these rules. BCU facilities existing prior to this date that receive a new license due to a change in ownership will not be subject to the provisions of this rule. (3 -28-18) 02. Reimbursement for Years One (1) Through Three (3) . Beginning with the first day of the first month following approval of the BCU license and when the provid er can demonstrate that BCU days from a minimum of sixty (60) calendar days, regardless of payer source , divided by total census days for that same sixty-dayIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 268 Page 2602(60) period, equals or exceeds a minimum of twenty percent (20% ), the provider's rate will change to reflect BCU services. The provider will be r eimbursed at the median rate fo r BCU facilities of that type, either freestanding or hospital-based, for the remaining period within the first three (3) full years of operation. If there are no facilities of the same type (for example, no other hospital-based BCUs), the prov ider will receive the median rate for their type, but the direct cost portion of the rat e will be revised to the medi an rate of existing BCUs. The rate change to reflect BCU services will not be retroactive to rate quarters paid prior to meeting the twenty percent (20%) BCU occupancy requirement. (3-28-18) a. A nursing facility must apply for BCU eligibility on an annual basis in accordance with Subsection 266.07 of these rules. If the provider did not meet the BCU qua lifications described in Sec tion 266 of these rules, with the exception of Subsections 266.01 and 266.04, for a full cost report year corresponding to the initial application year, the twenty percent (20%) BCU day requirement will apply o nly to days beginning with the first day of BCU eligibility to the end of the year. (3-28-18) b. During the period of limitation, the facility's rate will be mo dified annually on July 1st to reflect the current median rate for skilled care facilities of that type. A fter the first three (3) complete years of operations, the facility will have its rate established at the next July 1st wi th the existing facilities in accordance with Subsections 266.03 and 266.05 of these rules. (3-28-18) c. During the period of limitation, providers must demonstrate ann ually that BCU days were equal to or exceeded twenty percent (20% ), as described in Subsection 26 7.02 of this rule. Providers must provide a report to the Department with a calculati on of BCU days for each month du ring the period being reviewed. If the twelve- month (12) average falls below twenty percent (20%), then the B CU reimbursement will revert back to the median rate per Section 260 of these rul es. Once the Department has es tablished the provider has met the requirements of Subsection 267.01 of this rule th ey will be eligible for a new rate outlined in Subsecti on 267.02.b. of this rule. (3-28-18) 268. NURSING FACILITY: EXISTING PROVIDER ELECTS TO ADD BEHA VIORA L CARE UNIT (BCU). An existing nursing facility pr ovider that elects to add a BCU on or after September 1, 201 7, may be deemed eligible after meeting the followin g requirements: (3-28-18) 01. Meet Criteria for BCU . The nursing facility provider must meet the criteria for a BC U described in Section 266 of these rules. (4-4-13) 02. BCU Eligible Days . The provider must demonstrate that BCU days from a minimum of sixty (60) calendar days, regardless of payer source, divided by total cen sus days for that same sixty (60) day period, equals or exceeds a minimum of twenty percent (20%). (3-28-18) 03. BCU Payments . Once the provider has met the requirements of Subsections 268 .01 and 268.02 of this rule, beginning with the first day of the first quarter fo llowing approval of the BCU l icense, the provider's rate will change to reflect BCU servi ces. At no time will the rate b e adjusted mid-quarter. The rate will be calculated as follows. (3-28-18) a. The indirect costs, costs exempt from limitations, and property cost will be reimbursed in the same manner as all other nursing fac ilities in accordance with reimb ursement provisions contained in IDAPA 16.03.10, \"Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits.\" (3-28-18) b. The direct cost portion of the rate will be reimbursed as a pro spective rate not subject to a change from an interim rate to a final rate. The direct cost portion o f the rate will be calculated by determining the median direct cost portion for BCU fac ilities of that type (freestandi ng or hospital-based) effective on July 1 of the rate year. If there are no facilities of the same type (for example no oth er hospital-based BCUs), th e direct cost portion of the rate will be set at the median rate of existing BCUs. The direc t cost portion of the rate will be updated on July 1 of each rate year until the provider has a qualifying twelve-month (12) cost report, as descri bed in Subsection 268.03.d. of this rule. (3-28-18) c. The provider's total calculated rate will be subject to customa ry charge limitations and any otherIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 269 Page 2603rate reductions implemented f or other providers. (3-28-18) d. Once the provider has a twelve-month (12) cost report that cont ains a full year of BCU costs, their rate will be calculated in the same manner as other providers i n accordance with IDAPA 16.03.10, \"Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits.\" (3-28-18) e. A nursing facility must apply for BCU eligibility on an annual basis in accordance with Section 266 o f t h e s e r u l e s . I f t h e p r o v i d e r w a s n o t a B C U f o r a f u l l c o s t r eport year, the twenty percent (20%) BCU day requirement will apply only to days beginning with the first da y of BCU eligibility to the end of the year. (3-28-18) 269. NURSING FACILITY: NEW OWNER OF AN EXISTING NURSING FACILITY W I T H A BEHA VIORAL CARE UNIT (BCU). 01. New Owner Elects to Continue BCU . An existing nursing facility that is considered a BCU will continue to be a BCU, if the new owner elects to continue to pr ovide these services. The new owner will receive a rate calculated according to the current change of ownership ru les in Section 261 of these rules. The prior owner's cost report will be used until the new owner has a qualifying c ost report. They BCU will continue to qualify for the higher direct care cost limit the previous owner was allowed. (4 -4-13) 02. New Owner Does Not Elect to Continue BCU . If the new owner does not elect to operate the BCU, the prior owner's cost report will be used. The direct car e cost limit will be adjusted down to that of the non- BCU nursing facility. (4-4-13) 270. NURSING FACILITY: SPECIAL RATES. A special rate consists of a facility's daily reimbursement rat e for a patient plus an add-on amount. Section 56-117, Idaho Code, provides authority for the Department to pay facili ties an amount in addition to the daily rate when a patient has needs that are beyo nd the scope of facility service s and when the cost of providing for those additional needs is not adequately reflected in the rates calculated. This special rate add-on amount for such specialized care is in addition to any payments made in accordance with other provi sions of this chapter and is excluded from the computation of payments or rates under other provisions in thes e rules. (4-4-13) 01. Determination . The Department determines to a pprove a special rate on a pati ent-by-patient basis. No rate will be allowed if reimbursement for these needs is ava ilable from a non-Medicaid source. A special rate request must be based on an iden tified condition that will cont inue for a period greater th an thirty (30) days. (3-4-11) 02. Effective Date . Upon approval, a special rate is effective on the date the ap plication was received. (3-4-11) 03. Reporting . Costs equivalent to payments for special rate add-on amounts must be removed from the cost components subject to lim its, and be reported separate ly by the provider. (3-19-07) 04. Limitation . A special rate cannot exceed the provider's charges to other patients for similar services. (3-19-07) 05. Prospective Rate Treatment . Prospective treatment of speci al rates became effective July 1, 2000. Subsections 270.06 and 270.07 of this rule provide clarificatio n of how special rates are paid under the prospective payment system. (4-4-13) 06. Determination of Payment for Qualifying Residents . Special rate add-on a mounts are calculated using one (1) of the methods des cribed in Subsections 270.06.a. through 270.06.c. of this rule. (4-4-13) a. One Hundred Percent (100%) Special Care Facility Existing July 1, 2000. If on July 1, 2000, an entire facility was a special care unit that included Medicaid residents, the facility's direct care cost per diem will not be subject to the direct care co st limit. However, the direct c are costs are case mix adjusted based on the ratio of the facility's Medicaid CMI for the rate period to the facility-wid e CMI for the cost reporting period. (3-19-07) b. Equipment and Non-Therapy Supplie s. Equipment and non-therapy s upplies not addressed inIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 271 Page 2604Section 225 of these rules as determined by the Department, are reimbursed in accordance with IDAPA 16.03.09, \"Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits,\" Section 755, as an add-on amoun t. (4-4-13) c. Ventilator Dependent Residents a nd Residents Receiving Tracheos tomy Care. Nursing facilities providing care to residents who a re ventilator-dependent or who receive tracheostomy care are eligible to submit requests for the fixed add-on amount, in addition to the facili ty's rate for residents receiving this type of care. Approved requests are effective the date the type of care is ne eded by the participant, or no earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the date the request is received by the Departmen t. The rate includes the cost for equipment and supplies and for additional registered nurse and certified nursing assis tant hours, as appropriate fo r each type of care. Costs for equipment and supplies will be adjusted annually for inflation, and registered nursing and certified nursing assistant costs will be adjusted according to the annual Weighted Average Hourly Rates (WAHR) survey results. (7-1-19) i. Approved add-on rates for ventilator-dependent residents and residents receiving tracheostomy care are subject to annual reviews by the Department to ensure that the add-on rate remains necessary for the type of care needed by the resident. (7-1-19) ii. The provider must inform the department if an approved add-o n rate is no longer needed or if the resident requires a change from one type of care to another. (7- 1-19) d. Ventilator Dependent Residents and Residents Receiving Tracheos tomy Care in Out-of-State Nursing Facilities. For residents who are ventilator-dependent or receive tracheostomy care in an out-of-state facility, the add-on amount to the facility' s rate is effective the date this type of care is needed by the participant or no earlier than sixty (60) days prior to th e date the reque st is received by the Department. The add-on rate will include:(7-1-19) i. Calculation of a staffing add-on for the cost, if any, for ad ditional direct care staff required in meeting the exceptional needs of these residents. The hourly ad d-on rate is equal to the current WAHR CNA or current WAHR RN wage rate plus a benefits allowance based on an nual cost report data, then weighted to remove the CNA minimum daily staffing time a djusted for the appropriate sk ill level of care staff; and (4-4-13) ii. Calculation of an add-on for equipment and non-therapy suppl ies following the provisions in Subsection 270.06.b. of this rule. (4-4-13) 0 7 . T r e a t m e n t o f t h e S p e c i a l R a t e C o s t f o r F u t u r e R a t e S e t t i n g P eriods . Special rates are established on a prospective basis similar to the overall facil ity rate. When the cost report used to set a prospective rate contains special rate costs, an adjustment is made to \"off set,\" or reduce costs by an amount equal to total incremental revenues, or add-on payments received by the provid er during the cost reporting period. The amount received is calculated by multip lying the special rate add-on a mount paid for each qualifyi ng resident by the number of days that were paid . No related adjustmen t is made to the fa cility's CMIs. (4-4-13) 08. Special Rate for Providers t hat Change Ownership or Close . When a facility changes ownership or closes, a closing cost report is not required. Spe cial rate payments made in the closing cost reporting period may be reviewed by the Department. (4-4-13) 271. NURSING FACILITY: OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. The Director will appoint an oversight committee to monitor imp lementation of the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for nursing facility reimbursement. The committee will be made up of at least one (1) member representing each of the following organizations: the Department, the state associations representing free standing skilled care facilities, and the state associations representing hospital-ba sed skilled care facilities. Th e committee will continue to meet periodically subsequent to the implementation of the PPS. ( 5-8-09) 272. NURSING FACILITY: LEGAL CONSULTANT FEES AND LITIGATION COST S. Costs of legal consultant fees and litigation costs incurred by the provider will be hand led in accordance with the following: (3-19-07) 01. In General . Legal consultant fees unrelated to the preparation for or the taking of an appeal of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, or lit igation costs incurred by the provider in an action unrelated to litigati on with the Department of Health and Welfa re, will be allowed as a part of the total per diem costsIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 273 Page 2605of which the Medicaid Program w ill reimburse a portion accordin g to the percentage of Medicaid patient days. (3-19-07) 02. Administrative Appeals . I n t h e c a s e o f t h e p r o v i d e r c ontesting in administrative appe al the findings of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, the costs of the pr ovider's legal counsel will be reimbursed by the Medicaid Program only to the extent that t he provider prevails on the issues involved. The determination of the extent that the provider prevails will be based on the ratio of the total dollars at issue for the audit period at issue in the hearing to the total dollars ultimately awarded to the provider for that audit period by the hearing officer or subsequent adjudicator. (3-19-07) 03. Other . All other litigation costs incurred by the provider in action s against the Department of Health and Welfare will not be re imbursable either directly or indirectly by the Medicai d Program except where specifically ordered by a court of law. (3-19-07) 273. NURSING FACILITY: PATIENT FUNDS. The safekeeping of patient funds, under the program, is the res ponsibility of the provider. Accordingly, the administration of these funds re quires scrupulous care in recor ding all transactions for the patient. (3-19-07) 01. Use . Generally, funds are provided for personal needs of the patie nt to be used at the patient's discretion. The provider agrees t o manage these funds and rende r an accounting but may no t use them in any way. (3-19-07) 02. Provider Liability . The provider is subject to legal and financial liabilities fo r committing any of the following acts. This is only a partial listing of the acts contrary to federal regulations: (3-19-07) a. Management fees may not be charged for managing patient trust f unds. These charges constitute double payment as manag ement is normally performed by an employ ee of the provider and their salary is included in reasonable cost reimbursement. (3-19-07) b. Nothing is to be deducted from these funds, unless such deducti ons are authorized by the patient or his agent in writing. (3-19-07) c. Interest accruing to patient fund s on deposit is t he property o f the patients and is part of the personal funds of each patient. The interest from these funds i s not available to the provider for any use, including patient benefits. (3-19-07) 03. Fund Management . Proper management of such funds would include the following a s minimum: (3-19-07) a. Savings accounts, maintained sep arately from faci lity funds. (3- 19-07) b. An accurate system of supporting receipts and disbursements to patients. (3-19-07) c. Written authorization for all deductions. (3-19-07) d. Signature verification. (3-19-07) e. Deposit of all receipt s of the same day as received. (3-19-07) f. Minimal funds kept in the facility. (3-19-07) g. As a minimum these funds must be kept locked at all times. (3-19 -07) h.

Allowable compensation to owners and persons related to owners who provide any administrative services will be limited based on the schedule in this section. (3-19-07) 01. Allowable Owner Administrative Compensation . The following sched ule will be used in determining the maximum amount of owner administrative compensa tion allowable for the calendar year ending December 31, 2002. (3-19-07) 02. The Administrative Compensation Schedule . The administrative compen sation schedule in this Section will be adjusted annually based upon the change in aver age hourly earnings in nursing and personal care facilities as published by Data Resources Incorporated, its suc cessor organization or, if unavailable, another nationally recognized f orecasting firm. (3-19-07) 03. The Maximum Allowable Compensation . The maximum allowable compensation for an owner providing administrative services is determined from the schedu le in Subsection 274.01 of these rules . Allowable compensation will be determined as follows: (3-19-07) a. In determining the number of beds applicable on the schedule, a ll licensed beds for which the individual provides administrative services will be counted, re gardless of whether they a re in the same facility. (3-19-07) b. For an owner providing services to more than fifty (50) beds, t he amounts shown on the schedule for the applicable number of bed s will determine the upper limi t for allowable comp ensation. (3-19-07) c. For owners providing services to less than fifty-one (51) beds, such services related to administrative duties will be reimbursed at the hourly rate all owable if the owner was providing services to fifty-one (51) beds. Additionally, services other than administrative ser vices may be performed by the owner and will be allowable at the reasonable market rate for such services. To b e allowable, hours for each type of service will be documented. In no event will the total compensation for adminis trative and non-administrative duties paid to an owner or related party to an owner of a facility or facilities with fifty (50) licensed beds or less exceed the limit that would be applicable to an owner with the same number of points providing administrative services to facilities with fifty-one (51) beds as set forth in the schedule of Subsection 274.01 of these rules. (3-19-07) 04. Compensation for Persons Related to an Owner . Compensation for persons related to an owner will be evaluated in the same manner as for an owner. (3-19-07) 05. When an Owner Provides Services to More Than One Provider . When an owner provides services to more than one (1) provider compensation will be dis tributed on the same basis as costs are allocated for non-owners. (3-19-07) 06. More Than One Owner or Relat ed Party May Receive Compensatio n for Hours Actually Worked . Services must be actually performed, documented and necessary . Total compensation must be reasonable,Licensed Bed Range Upper limit 51 - 100 86,951 101 - 150 95,641 151 - 250 129,878 251 - up 186,435IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 275 Page 2607and not greater than the amount for which the same services cou ld be obtained on the open market. The standard by which full time compensation is measured will be two thousand e ighty (2,080) hours. Compensation of an owner or a party related to an owner is subject to other provisions of thi s chapter, and will not exceed the compensation determined from the Administrative Compensation Schedule, and, on an hourly basis, will not exceed the compensation determined in the Administrative Compensation Sche dule divided by two thousand eighty (2,080). (3-19-07) 275. NURSING FACILITY: PROPERTY RENTAL RATE REIMBURSEMENT. Free standing nursing facilities other than hospital based nurs ing facilities will be paid a property rental rate. Property taxes and property insurance will be reimbursed as costs exempt from limitations. The property rental rate includes compensation for major movable e quipment but not for minor mova ble equipment. The property rental rate is paid in lieu of payment for amortization, depreciation, and interest fo r financing the cost of land and depreciable assets. Prior to final audit for free-standing nursing facilities, an interim rate for property reimbursement will be set to approximate the property rental r ate as determined by Sections 56-108 and 56-109, Idaho Code. (3-19-07) 01. Property Rental Rate . The property rental rate is based upon current construction c osts, the age of the facility, the type of facility, and major expenditures made to improve the facility, or a rate based upon property costs as of January 1, 1985. Th e amount paid for each Medicaid day of care will be phased in according to Section 275.01 of these rules, and, beg inning April 1, 1985, will be: (3 -19-07) R = \"Property Base\" x 40 - \"Age\" / 40 x \"change in building cos ts\" where: (3-19-07) a. \"R\" property (3-19-07) b. \"Property Base\" = thirteen dolla rs and nineteen cents ($13.19) beginning October 1, 1996 for all freestanding nursing facilities. (3-19-07) c. \"Change in building costs\" = 1.0 from October 1, 1996, through December 31, 1996. Beginning January 1, 1997, \"change in building costs\" will be adjusted ea ch calendar year to reflect the reported annual change in the building cost index for a class D building in the wester n region, as published by the Marshall Swift Valuation Service or the consumer price index for renter's costs whicheve r is greater. For freestanding nursing facilities, the index available in September of the prior year will be used. (3- 19-07) d. \"Age\" of facility - The effectiv e age of the facility in years will be set by subtracting the year in which the facility, or portion thereof, was constructed from th e year in which the rate is to be applied. No facility or portion thereof will be assigned an age of more than thirty (30 ) years, however: (3-19-07) i. If adequate information is not submitted by the facility to d ocument that the facility, or portion thereof, is newer than thirty (30) years, the age will be set a t thirty (30) years. Adequate documentation will include, but not be limited to, such documents as copies of building per mits, tax assessors' r ecords, receipts, invoices, building contract, and original notes of indebtedness. An age w ill be determined for each building. A weighted average using the age and square footage of the buildings will become the effective age of the facility. The age of each building will be based upon t he date when construction on that building was completed. This age will be adjusted to reflect major building expansion or remodeling prio r to April 1, 1985, if that expenditure was large enough to reduce the ag e of the facility by two (2) or more yea rs according to the follo wing formula: (3-19-07) Where:r = A x E / S x C r = Reduction in the age o f the facility in years. A = Age of the building at the time when construction was comple ted. E =Actual expenses for the construc tion provided that the total co sts must have been incurred within twenty-four (24) months of the completion of th e construction. S = The number of square feet in the building at t he end of cons truction.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 275 Page 2608If the result of this calculatio n, \"r\" is equal to or greater t han 2.0, the age of the building in years will be reduced by this number, rounded to the nearest whole number for rate setting purposes. In no case will the age be less than zero (0). (3-19-07) ii. Historical nursing home constr uction cost per square foot fo r purposes of evaluating facility age. (3-19-07) iii. For rates paid after June 30, 1989, the effective age of a facility will be further adjusted when the cost of major repairs, replacemen t, remodeling, or renovation o f a building initiated after April 1, 1985, results in the change in age by at least one (1) year when applied to the form ula in Subsection 275.01.d.i. of these rules. However, such change will not decrease the effective age of a facility b eyond the point where the in crease in the property rental rate is greater than three-fourth s (3/4) of the difference betw een the property rental rate \"r\" for a new facility at the time of the proposed rate revision and the property rental rate for which the facility was eligible immediately before the adjustment. The cost used fo r \"C\" will be adjusted accordin g to costs published by Marshall Swift Valuation Service to reflect current const ruction costs for average Class D convalescent hospitals. It is the provider's responsibility to notify the Department and document costs. The Department will adjust the age after documentation of costs. (3-19-07) iv. In the event that new requirements are imposed by state or f ederal agencies, the Department will reimburse the expenditures direct ly related to these requiremen ts as an increase in the property rental rate if the expense is in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) per bed. If the cost related to the requirement is less than one hundred dollars ($100) per bed, the Department will, within twe lve (12) months of verification of expenditure, reimburse the Medicaid share of the entire cost of such new req uirements, as a one (1) time payment to the facility. (3-19-07) v. At no time will the property re ntal rate paid to a facility b e less than the greater of the rate allowable to that facility on December 31, 1988, the rate allowable immed iately following the first opening of a new facility after December 31, 1988, or the ra te allowable immediately foll owing the last, if any, age revision after December 31, 1988. However, subsequent to the application of this provision, before any property rental rate increase may be made for current or successor operator s, the final settlement amount of any increase in the prope rty rental rate will first be offset by an amount equal to the impact on final settlement of any rate decrease that would have occurred if the provisions of Subsections 275.01.d.iii. and 275.01.d.iv. of the se rules had not been applied. This is intended to allow the postponement of the financial burden to providers of proper ty rental rate decreases and t o allow an equal offset of the financial burden to the state of subsequent property rate i ncreases for a current or successor provider. (3-19-07) vi. Effective July 1, 1991, for freestanding nursing facilities, \"age of facility\" will be a revised age that is the lesser of the age established under other provisions of this Section or the age that most closely yields the rate allowable to existing facilities as of June 30, 1991, under Sub section 275.01 of these rules. This revised age will not increase over time.

Grandfathered Rate . A \"grandfathered property re ntal rate\" for ex isting free-stan ding nursing facilities will be determined by dividing the audited allowable annualized property costs, exclusive of taxes and insurance, for assets on hand as of January 1, 1985, by the tot al patient days in the period July 1, 1984, through June 30, 1985. (3-19-07) a. Prior to audit settlement, the int erim rate for property costs allowable as of January 1, 1985, will be used to approximate the gr andfathered rate. (3-19-07) b. The grandfathered prop erty rental rate will be adjusted to comp ensate the facility for the property costs of major repairs, replacem ent, expansion, remodeling or r enovation initiated prior to April 1, 1985, and completed during calendar year 1985. (3-19-07) c. Beginning July 1, 1989, facilities receiving grandfathered rate s may have those rates adjusted for modifications related to major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling, or renovation initiated after January 1, 1986, if the cost of these modifications would be sufficient to reduce the age of the facility by one (1) year or more according to Subsection 275.01.d.i .of these rules. The grandfat hered rate will be revised after completion of modifications and will be the greater of: (3-19-07) i. The grandfathered rate previously allowed; or (3-19-07) ii. The actual per diem property co sts of amortization, deprecia tion and interest not applicable to the modifications for the audit period in which the modifications w ere completed plus the per d iem rate of the first year amortization of the cost of these modifications when amortized over American Hospital Association guideline useful life or lives. However, no change in the grandfathered rate wil l be allowed to change that rate by more than three- fourths (3/4) of the difference between the previous grandfathe red rate and the property rental rate that would be paid for a new building at the time of the proposed rate revision. (3 -19-07) d. The facility will be reimbursed a rate that is the higher of th e grandfathered property rental rate as determined according to provisions of Subsection 275.02 of thes e rules or the property rental rate determined according to Subsectio ns 275.01, 275.03, or Freestandin g Nursing Facilities . Freestanding nursing facilities with leases will not be reimbursed in the same manner specified in Subsections 275.01 a nd 275.02 of these rules. Provisions in this section do not apply to reimbursement of home office costs. Home office costs will be paid based on reasonable cost principles. (3-19-07) a. Facilities with leases entered i nto on or after March 30, 1981, are to be reimbursed in the same way as owned facilities with ownersh ip costs being recognized inste ad of lease co sts. (3-19-07) b. Facilities with leases entered into prior to March 30, 1981, wi ll not be subject to reimbursement according to the provisions of S ubsections 275.01 or 275.02 of these rules. Their property rental rate per day of care will be the sum of the annualized allowed lease costs and the o ther annualized property costs for assets on hand as of January 1, 1985, exclusive of taxes and insurance when paid sep arately, divided by total patient days in the period June 30, 1983, through July 1, 1984. (3-19-07) i. Effective July 1, 1989, the property rental rates of leased n ursing facilities with leases entered into prior to March 30, 1981, may be adjusted to compensate for incr eased property costs resulting from facility modifications related to major repairs, replacement, expansion, remodeling, or renovation initiated after January 1, 1985, if the cost would be suffic ient to reduce the age of the facility by one (1) year or more according to Subsection 275.01.d.i. of these rules. The r ate will be revised after the completion of such modifications and will be the greater of the property rental rate previously allowed under Subsection 27 5.03, or the actual per diem property costs for the amortization, depreciation, and interest not applicable to the modifications for the reporting period in which the modifications were completed, plu s the per diem o f the first ye ar amortization of the modif ication expenses using the American Hospital Association gui deline useful life of lives. H owever, no such rate change will increase the allowable property rental rate by more than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the previous rate and the property rental rate that would b e allowed for a new building a t the time of the proposed rate revision. (3-19-07)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 278 Page 2610ii. Where such leases contain pro visions that bind the lessee to accept an increased rate, reimbursement will be at a rate per day of care that reflects t he increase in the l ease rate. (3-19-07) iii. Where such leases bind the lessee to the lease and allow th e rate to be renegotiated, reimbursement will be at a rate per day of car e that reflects an annual incre ase in the lease rate not to exceed the increase in the consumer price index for renters' costs. After April 1, 1985, i f such a lease is terminated or if the lease allows the lessee the option to terminate other than by an option to purch ase the facility, the property rental rate will become the amount \"R\" determined by the formula in Subsection 275.01 of th ese rules as of the date on which the lease is or could be terminated.

(3-19-07) 276. -- 277. (RESERVED) 278. NURSING FACILITY: OCCUPANCY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. In order to equitably allocate fi xed costs to the Medicaid pati ents in cases where a facility is not maintaining reasonable occupancy levels, an a djustment will be made. No occ upancy adjustment will be made against the costs that are used to calculate the p roperty rental rate; however ad justment will be made against all other property costs. The adjustment will be made as follows: (3-19-07) 01. Occupancy Levels . If a facility maintains an aver age occupancy of less than eig hty percent (80%) of a facility's capacity, the total property costs not includin g cost paid under the property rental rate, will be prorated based upon an eighty percent (80%) occupancy rate. Property cos ts and property rental rates are defined in Section 013 of these rules. The facility' s average occupancy percentage will be subtracted from eighty percent (80%) and the resultant percentage will be taken times the total fixed costs to determine the nonallowa ble fixed costs. (3-19-07) 02. Occupancy Adjustment . For purposes of an occupancy adjustment, facility capacity wi ll be computed based upon the greater o f the largest number of beds f or which the facility was licensed during the period being reported on or the largest number of beds for which the f acility was licensed during cal endar year 1981, except where a portion of the facility has been converted to use for n onroutine nursing home activities or the facility is newly constructed and has entered the Medicaid Program subsequent to January 1, 1982. If the facility's designed capacity has been changed, the number of beds used to determine occupanc y will be lowered by the amount of capacity being converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. Facility capac ity for a new facility will be based on the number of beds approved by the certificate of need process less any capac ity converted to nonroutin e nursing home activities. (3-19-07) 03. Fixed Costs . For purposes of an occupancy adjustment fixed costs will be c onsidered all allowable and reimbursable costs reported under the property cost categor ies. (3-19-07) 04. Change in Designed Capacity . In cases where a provider changes the designed capacity of a facility, the average occupancy for the period prior to the cha nge and subsequent to the change will be computed and each period will be adjusted sep arately. If the designed capaci ty is increased, the increased number of beds will not be subject to this adjustment for th e first six (6) months followi ng their licensure. (3-19-07) 05. New Facility . In the case of a new facility being licensed and occupied, th e first six (6) months occupancy level will not be subject to this adjustment.

In establishing the initial plan of care, the member of the bas ic interdisciplinary group who assesses the patient's needs must meet or call at least on e (1) other gr oup member (nurse, physician, medical social worker, or counselor) before writing the initial plan of care. (3-19-07) b. At least one (1) of the persons involved in developing the init ial plan must be a nurse or a physician. This plan must be established on the same day as the assessment if the day of assessment is to be a covered day of hospice care. (3-19-07) c. The other two (2) members of the basic interdisciplinary group must review the initial plan of care and provide their input to the process of establishing the plan of care within two (2) calen dar days following the day of assessment; input may be p rovided by telephone. (3-19-07) 455. HOSPICE: PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS AND DUTIES. All services must be performed by appropriately qualified perso nnel, but it is the nature of the service, rather than the qualification of the person who pr ovides it, that determines th e category of the s ervice. (3-19-07) 456. HOSPICE: PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT. With the exception of payment for physician services under Sect ion 458 of these rules, Medicaid reimbursement for hospice care will be made at one (1) of five (5) predetermined rates for each day in which a participant receives the respective type and intensity of the services furnished under t he care of the hospice. The fiv e (5) rates are prospective rates; there will be no retroactive rate adjustments other than the application of the \"cap\" on overall payments, the service intensity add-on, and the limitation on payments for in patient care, if applicable. A description of the payment for each level of care is describ ed in Subsections 456.01 throu gh 456.04 of these rules. (3-29-17) 01. Routine Home Care . The hospice provider will be p aid one (1) of two (2) routine home care rates for each day the patient is in r esidence, under the care of the hospice, and not receiving continuous home care. The rate is paid without regard to the volume or intensity of routi ne home care services provided on any given day. The two-rate payment methodology will result in a higher based paym ent for days one (1) through sixty (60) of hospice care and a reduced rate for days sixty-one (61) to end-of-care. If a participant leaves hos pice care and then later is placed back on hospice care, regar dless of hospice provider, a minimum of a sixty (60) day gap in hospice services is required in order for the routin e home care rate to be paid at the higher base payment rate. If there is not a minimum of a sixty (60) day gap in hospice services being provided, the hospice provider will be paid at the rate for which the participant is qualified. (3-29-17) 02. Continuous Home Care . Continuous home care is to be provided only during a period o f crisis. A period of crisis is a period in which a patient requires contin uous care that is primarily nursing care to achieve palliation and management of acute medical symptoms. Care must be provided by either a licensed registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse and a nurse must provide care for at least half the total period of care. A minimum of eight (8) hours of care must be provided during a twenty-four ( 24) hour day that begins and ends at midnight. ThisIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 457 Page 2660care need not be continuous and uninterrupted. If less skilled care is needed on a continuous basis to enable the person to remain at home, this is covered as routine home care. For every hour or part of an hour of continuous care furnished, the hourly rate will be reimbursed to the hospice up to twenty-four (24) hours per day. (3-19-07) 03. Inpatient Respite Care . The hospice will be paid at th e inpatient respite care rate f or each day that the participant is in an approved inpatient facility and is rec eiving respite care. Payment f or respite care may be made for a maximum of five (5) days at a time including the date of admission but not counting the date of discharge in any monthly election period. Payment for the sixth and any subseque nt day is to be made at the appropriate rate routine, continuous, or general inpatient rate. (3-19-07) 04. General Inpatient Care . Payment at the inpatient rate will be made when general inpat ient care is provided. No other fixed payment rates will be applicable for a day on which the particip ant receives hospice general inpatient care except as described in Section 458 of these rule s. (3-19-07) a. Date of discharge. For the day of discharge from an inpatient u nit, the appropriate home care rate is to be paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. When the pa tient is discharged as deceas ed, the inpatient rate, either general or respite, is to be paid for the discharge date. (3-19- 07) b. Hospice payment rates. The Medi caid hospice payment rates are t he same as the Medicare hospice rates, adjusted to disregard cost offsets attributable to Medic are coinsurance amounts. U nder the Medicaid hospice benefit, no cost sharing may be i mposed with respect to hospice services rendered to M edicaid participants. (3-19-07) c. Obligation of continuing care. After the participant's hospice benefit expires, the patient's Medicaid hospice benefits do not expire. The hospice must conti nue to provide that participant's care until the patient expires or until the participant revokes the election of hospic e care. (3-19-07) 05. Service Intensity Add-On . For hospice services with dates of service on and after Janua ry 1, 2016, a service intensity add-on payme nt will be made for a visit by a licensed registered nurse (RN) or social worker when provided in the last seven (7) days of life. Payment for the se rvice intensity add-on is in addition to the routine home care rate and is calculated by multiplying the continuous home care rate per fifteen (15) minutes by the number of units for the combined visits for the day. Payment must not exc eed sixteen (16) units per d ay, and is adjusted for geographic differences in wages. Phone time for a provider's so cial worker is not eligible for a service intensity add- on payment. (3-29-17) 457. HOSPICE: LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS FOR INPATIENT CARE. Payments to a hospice for inpa tient care must be limited accord ing to the number of days of inpatient care furnished to Medicaid patients. During the twelve (12) month period begin ning November 1st of each y ear and ending October 31st of the next year, the aggregate number of inpatient days ( both general inpatient days and inpatient respite care) may not exceed twenty percent (20% ) of the total number of days of hospice care provided to all Medicaid participants during the same per iod by the designated hospice o r its contracted agent(s). (3-19-07) 01. For Purposes of Computation . If it is determined that the inpatient rate should not be pai d, any days for which the hospice recei ves payment at a home care rate will not be counted as inpatient days. The limitations on payment for inpatient days are as follows: (3-19-07) a. The maximum number of allowable inpatient days will be calculat ed by multiplying the total number of a provider's Medicaid hospice days by twenty percent (20%). (3-19-07) b. If the total number of days of inpatient care to Medicaid hospi ce patients is less than or equal to the maximum number of inpatient days computed in Subsection 457.01 of these rules then no adjustment is made. (3-19-07) c. If the total number of days of i npatient care exceeds the maxim um number of allowable inpatient days computed in Subsection 457.01 of these rules then the paym ent limitation will be determined by: (3-19-07)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 458 Page 2661i.

The amount by which interim paym ents for inpatient care exceeds the amount calculated as in Section 459 of these rules is due from the hospice. (3-19-07) 458. HOSPICE: PAYMENT FOR PHYSICIAN SERVICES. The basic rates for hospice care represent full reimbursement t o the hospice for the cost s of all covered services related to the treatment of the participant's terminal illness, including the administrative and general activities performed by physicians who are employees of or working under a rrangements made with the hospice. These activities would generally be performed by the physician servin g as the medical director and the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group. Group activities include p articipation in the establishment of plans of care, supervision of care and services, periodic review and updating of plans of care, and establishment of governing policies. The costs for these ser vices are included in the reim bursement rates for routine home care, continuous home care, and inpatient res pite care. (3-19-07) 01. Hospice Employed Physici an Di r e c t P a t i e n t S e r v i c e . Reimbursement for a hospice employed physician's direct patient servi ces that are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made i n accordance with the usual Idaho Medicaid reimbursement methodology for physician services . These services will be billed by the hospice under the hospice provider number and, the related payments wil l be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount per Section 459 of these rules has been exce eded. The only physician services to be billed by a hospice for such services are dir ect patient care services. Lab oratory and X-ray services are included in the hospice daily rate. (3-19-07) 02. Volunteer Physician Services . V olunteer physician services are excluded from Medicaid reimbursement with the following exceptions: (3-19-07) a. A hospice may be reimbursed on behalf of a volunteer physician for specific direct patient care services that are not rendered on a volunteer basis. The hospic e must have a liability to r eimburse the physician for those services rendered. In determining whether a service is pr ovided on a volunteer basis, a physician must not distinguish which services are p rovided voluntarily on the basi s of the patient's ability to pay. (3-19-07) b. Reimbursement for an independent physician's direct patient ser vices that are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with the usual Idaho Me dicaid reimbursement methodology for physician services. These services will not be billed by the hospice unde r the hospice provider number and they will not be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount p er Section 459 of these rules has been exceeded. The only services to be billed by an attending physician are th e physician's personal profe ssional services. Costs for services such as laboratory or X-rays are not to be included on the attending physician's billed charges to the Medicaid program. The aforementi oned charges are included in th e daily rates paid and are expressly the responsibility of the hospice. (3-19-07) 459. HOSPICE: CAP ON OVERALL REIMBURSEMENT. Aggregate payments to each hospi ce will be limited during a hos pice cap period per Subsection 451.05 of these rules. The total payments made for serv ices furnished to Medicaid part icipants during this period will be compared to the \"cap amount\" for this period. Any payments in excess of the cap must be refunded by the hospice. (3-19-07) 01. Overall Cap . The overall cap will be compared t o reimbursement after the inp atient limitation is computed and subtracted from total reimbursement due the hospic e. (3-19-07) 02. Total Payment for Services . Total payment made for services furnished to Medicaid partici pantsIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 460 Page 2662during this period means all payments for services rendered dur ing the cap year, regardless of when payment is actually made. (3-19-07) 03. Calculation of Cap Amount . The \"cap amount\" is calculate d by multiplying the number of participants electing certified hospice care during the period by six thousand five hundred dollars ($6,500). This amount will be adjust ed for each subsequen t cap year beginning November 1, 1983, to reflect the percentage increase or decrease in the medical care expenditure category of the Con sumer Price Index (CPI) fo r all urban consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor S tatistics. It will also be ad justed as per Subsection 459.07 of these rules.(3-19-07) 04. Computation and Application of Cap Amount . The computation and application of the \"cap amount\" is made by the Departmen t after the end of the cap peri od. (3-19-07) 05. Report Number of Medicaid Participants . report the number of Medicaid participants electi ng hospice care during th e period to the Dep artment. (3-19-07) a. This must be done within thirty (30) days after the end of th e cap period: and (3-19-07) b. If the participant is transferred to a non-certified hospice no payment to the non-certified hospice will be made and the certified ho spice may count a complete par ticipant benefit period in their cap amount. (3-19-07) 06. Certified in Mid-Month . If a hospice certifies in mid-month, a weighted average cap a mount based on the number of days fa lling within each cap period woul d be used. (3-19-07) 07. Adjustment of the Overall Cap . Cap amounts in each hospice's cap period will be adjusted to reflect changes in the cap periods and designated hospices duri ng a participant's election period. The proportion of each hospice's days of service to the total number of hospice d ays rendered to the participant during their election period will be multiplied by the cap amount to determine each h ospice's adjusted cap amount. (3-19-07) a. After each cap period has ended, t he Department will calculate the overall cap within a reasonable time for each hospice participa ting in the Idaho Medicaid Progr am. (3-19-07) b. Each hospice's cap amoun t will be computed as follows: (3-19-07) i. The share of the \"cap amount\" that each hospice is allowed wi ll be based on the proportion of total covered days provided by each hos pice in the \"cap period.\" (3-19 -07) ii. The proportion determined in Section 457 of these rules for each certified hospice will be multiplied by the \"cap amount\" sp ecified for the \"cap period\" i n which the participant firs t elected hospice.(3-19-07) c. The participant must file an initial election during the period beginning September 28 of the previous year through September 27 of the current cap year in o rder to be counted as an electing Medicaid participant during the current cap year. (3-19-07) 08. Additional Amount for Nu rsing Facility Residents . An additional per diem amount will be paid for \"room and board\" of hospice re sidents in a certified nursin g facility receiving routine or continuous care services. In this context, the term \"room and board\" includes all assista nce in the activities of daily living, in socializing activities, administration of me dication, maintaining the clean liness of a resident's room, and supervision and assisting in the use of durable medical equipment and prescribe d therapies. The additional payments and the related days are not subject to the caps specified in Sections 457 and 459 of these rules. The room and board rate will be ninety-five percent (95%) of the per diem interim reimbursement rate assigned to the facility for those dates of service on which the p articipant was a resid ent of that facilit y. (3-19-07) 460. HOSPICE: POST-ELIGIBILITY TREATMENT OF INCOME. Where a participant is determine d eligible for medical assistan ce participation in the cost of long term care, the Department must reduce its payments for all costs of the hospic e benefit, including the supplementary amounts for room and board, by an amount det ermined according to Section 22 7 of these rules.

To be allowable, costs must be r easonable, ordinary, necessary and related to patient care. It will be expected thatIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 590 Page 2689providers will incur costs in such a manner that economical and efficient delivery of quality health care to beneficiaries will result. (3-19-07) 01. Application of Reasonable Cost Principles . (3-19-07) a. Reasonable costs of any services are determined in accordance w ith rules found in the Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM), Sections 100 through 2600, as modif ied by the exceptions con tained herein, is used to identify cost items to be inc luded on Idaho's Uniform Cost R eport. (3-19-07) i. Reasonable cost takes into acco unt both direct and indirect c osts of providers of services, including normal standby costs. (3-19-07) ii. The objectives of these methods are that: first, the costs w ith respect to individuals covered by the program will not be borne by others not so covered. Second, the costs with respect to individuals not covered will not be paid by the program. (3-19-07) b. Costs may vary from one instituti on to another because of a var iety of factors. It is the intent of the program that providers will be r eimbursed the actual operating costs of providing high qual ity care, unless such costs exceed the applicable maximum bas e rate developed pursuant to p rovisions of Title 56, Chapter 1, Idaho Code, or are unallowable by application of promulgated regulation. (3-19-07) c. Implicit in the intention that actual operating costs be paid t o the extent they are reasonable is the expectation that the provider s eeks to minimize its costs and t hat its actual operating co sts do not exceed what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer pays for a given item or servi ce. (3-19-07) d. If costs are determined to exceed the level that such buyers in cur, in the absence of clear evidence that the higher costs were unavo idable, the excess costs are no t reimbursable.

Example: Depreciation is a method of systemat ically recognizing the declining utility value of an asset. To the extent that the ass et is related to patient care, reasonable, ordinary, and necessary, the related expense is allowable when reimbursed bas ed on property costs accord ing to other provisions of this chapter. Property related e xpenses are likewise allowable. (3-19-07) 03. Costs Not Related to Patient Care . Costs not related to patient care are costs that are not appropriate or necessary and prope r in developing and maintaini ng the operation of patient care facilities and activities. Such costs are not allowable in computing reimbursa ble costs. Example: Fines are imposed for late remittance of federal withholding taxes. Such fines are not rel ated to patient care, are not necessary, and are not reflective of prudent cost conscious management. Therefore, suc h fines and penalties are not allowable. (3-19-07) 04. Form and Substance . Substance of transactions will prevail over the form. Financi al transactions will be disallowed to the extent that the substance of the tran saction fails to meet reasonable cost principles or comply with rules and policy. Example: Lease-Purchase agreements are c ontracts that are executed in the form of a lease. The wording of the contract is couched in such a manner as to give the reader the impression of a true rental-type lease. However, the substance of this contract is a purchase of the pr operty. If a lease contract i s found to be in substance a purchase, the related payments ar e not allowable as lease or re ntal expense. (3-19-07) 590. ICF/ID: ALLOWABLE COSTS.

The Maximum Allowable Compensation . The maximum allowable compensation for an owner providing administrative services is determined from the schedu le in Subsection 597.01. of these rules. Allowable compensation will be determined as follows: (3-19-07) a. In determining the number of beds applicable on the schedule, a ll licensed beds for which the individual provides administrative services will be counted, re gardless of whether they a re in the same facility. (3-19-07) b. For an owner providing services to more than fifty (50) beds, t he amounts shown on the schedule for the applicable number of bed s will determine the upper limi t for allowable comp ensation. (3-19-07) c.

(3-19-07) 598. -- 599. (RESERVED) 600. ICF/ID: OCCUPANCY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR. In order to equitably allocate fi xed costs to the Medicaid pati ents in cases where a facility is not maintaining reasonable occupancy levels, an a djustment will be made. No occ upancy adjustment will be made against the costs that are used to calculate the p roperty rental rate; however ad justment will be made against all other property costs. The adjustment will be made as follows: (3-19-07) 01. Occupancy Levels . If a facility maintains an aver age occupancy of less than eig hty percent (80%) of a facility's capacity, the total property costs not includin g cost paid under the property rental rate, will be prorated based upon an eighty percent (80%) occupancy rate. Property cos ts and property rental rates are defined in Section 013 of these rules. The facility' s average occupancy percentage will be subtracted from eighty percent (80%) and the resultant percentage will be taken times the total fixed costs to determine the nonallowa ble fixed costs. (3-19-07) 02. Occupancy Adjustment . For purposes of an occupancy adjustment, facility capacity wi ll be computed based upon the greater o f the largest number of beds f or which the facility was licensed during the period being reported on or the largest number of beds for which the f acility was licensed during cal endar year 1981, except where a portion of the facility has been converted to use for n onroutine nursing home activities or the facility is newly constructed and has entered the Medicaid Program subsequent to January 1, 1982. If the facility's designed capacity has been changed, the number of beds used to determine occupanc y will be lowered by the amount of capacity being converted to nonroutine nursing home activities. Facility capac ity for a new facility will be based on the number ofIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 601 Page 2696beds approved by the certificate of need process less any capac ity converted to nonroutin e nursing home activities. (3-19-07) 03. Fixed Costs . For purposes of an occupancy adjustment fixed costs will be c onsidered all allowable and reimbursable costs reported under the property cost categor ies. (3-19-07) 04. Change in Designed Capacity . In cases where a provider changes the designed capacity of a facility, the average occupancy for the period prior to the cha nge and subsequent to the change will be computed and each period will be adjusted sep arately. If the designed capaci ty is increased, the increased number of beds will not be subject to this adjustment for th e first six (6) months followi ng their licensure. (3-19-07) 05. New Facility . In the case of a new facility being licensed and occupied, th e first six (6) months occupancy level will not be subject to this adjustment. (3-19-07 ) 601. ICF/ID: RECAPTURE OF DEPRECIATION. Where depreciable assets that were reimbursed based on cost and were used in the Medicai d Program by a facility subsequent to January 1, 1982, and for which depreciation has b een reimbursed by the Pro gram, are sold for an amount in excess of their net book value, depreciation so reimb ursed will be recaptured fr om the buyer of the facility in an amount equal to reimbursed depreciation after January 1, 1982, or gain on the sale, whichever is less. (3-19-07) 01. Amount Recaptured . Depreciation will be recaptured in full if a sale of a deprec iated facility takes place within the first five (5) y ears of a seller's ownership. Credit will be given for the period of ownership prior to January 1, 1982. For every year the asset is held beyond the fi rst five (5) years, the total depreciation recaptured will be reduced by ten percent (10%) per year of the total depreciat ion taken. (3-19-07) 02. Time Frame . Depreciation will be recaptured by the Medicaid Program from the buyer of the facility over a period of time not to exceed five (5) years fro m the date of sale, with not less than one-fifth (1/5) of the total amount being r ecaptured for each year a fter such date.

The Department will not pay for a claim in behalf o f a Participant unless the i nformation on the claim is consistent with the information in the Department's computer el igibility file. (3-19-07) 622. ICF/ID: PRINCIPLE PROSPECTIVE RATES. Providers of ICF/ID facilities will be paid a per diem rate tha t, with certain exceptions, is not subject to an audit settlement. The per diem rate for a fiscal period will be based on audited historical costs adjusted for inflation. The provider must report these cost items in accordance with other provisions of this chapter or the applicable provisions of PRM consistent with this chapter. Sections 622 through 628 o f these rules provide procedures and specifications necessary to implement the provisions and accomplish the object ives of the payment system for ICF/ID providers. Total payment will include the following components: Property r eimbursement, capped costs, exempt costs, and excluded costs. Except as otherwi se provided in this section, r ates calculated for state fi scal year 2012 (July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012) will be calculated by using finalized co st reports ended in calendar year 2009 with no cost or cost limit adjustments for inflation to the rate period of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012. Rates effective July 1, 2012, and every July 1 thereafter, will be calculated by using audited cost reports ended in the calendar year two (2) years prior to each July 1 (July 1, 2012, rates will use cost r eports ended in calendar year 2010 and so forth), with no cost or cost limit adjustments for inflation. (4-4-13) 623. ICF/ID: PROPERTY REIMBURSEMENT. Beginning October 1, 1996, ICF/ID property costs are reimbursed by a rental rate or based on cost. The following will be reimbursed based on cost as determined by the provision s of this chapter and applicable provisions of PRM to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter: ICF/ID living un it property taxes, ICF/ID liv ing unit property insurance, and major movable equipment not related to home office or day t reatment services. Reimbur sement of other property costs is included in the property rental rate. Any property cos t related to home offices and day treatment services are not considered property costs and will not be reported in the p roperty cost portion of the cost report. These costs will be reported in the home office and day treatment section of the cost report. Property costs, including costs that are reimbursed based on a rental rat e, will be reported in the prop erty cost portion of the cost report. The Department may require and utilize an appraisal to establish those components of property costs that are identified as an integral part of an appraisal. Property costs include the following components: ( 3-19-07) 01. Depreciation . Allowable depreciation based on straight line depreciation. (3 -19-07) 02. Interest .

This Section defines items and procedures to be followed in determin ing allowable and exempt costs and provides the procedures for extracting cost data from historical cost report s, applying a cost forecasting market basket to project cost forward, procedures to be followed to project costs forwar d, and procedures for computing the median of the range of costs and the ICF/ID cap. (3-19-07)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 624 Page 270501. Costs Subject to the Cap . Items subject to the cap include all allowable costs except p roperty costs identified in Section 623 of these rules and exempt costs or excluded costs identified in Section 627 or 628 of these rules. Property costs rela ted to a home office are admini strative costs, will not be reported as property costs, and are subject to the cap. (3-19-07) 02. Per Diem Costs . Costs to be included in this category will be divided by the total participant days for the facility for the cost reporting period to arrive at all owable per diem costs. If cost s for services provided some or all non-Medicaid residents are not included in the total cos ts submitted, the provider must determine the costs and combine them with the submitted costs in order that a total per diem cost for that facility can be determined both for both the purposes of determining the ICF/ID cap and of computin g final reimbursement. (3-19-07) 03. Cost Data to Determine the Cap . Cost data to be used to deter mine the cap for ICF/ID faciliti es will be taken from each provide r's most recent final cost repor t available sixty (60) days before the beginning of the period for which the cap is being set. Cost reports are final w hen the final audit report is issued, or earlier if the Department informs the facility t he report is final for rate se tting purposes. The selected fin al cost report will be used to establish the facility's prospective reimbursement rate. How ever, the final cost reports covering a period of less than twelve (12) months will be in cluded in the data for determ ining the cap at the option of the Department. (3-19-07) 04. Projection . Per diem allowable costs will be inflated forward using a cos t forecasting market basket and forecasting indices according to t he same table as u sed for free standing facilities. (3-19-07) a. The projection method used in Section 624 of these rules to set the cap will also be used to set non property portions of the prospect ive rate that are not subject to the cap. (3-19-07) b. Forecasting indices as developed by Data Resources, Incorporate d, will be used unless they are unavailable. In such case, indices supplied by some other natio nally recognized forecaste r will be used. (3-19-07) 05. Costs That Can be Paid Directly by the Department to Non ICF /ID Providers . Costs that can be paid directly by the Department to non ICF/ID providers are excluded from the ICF/ID p rospective rates and ICF/ ID cap: (3-19-07) a. Direct physician care costs. Physicians who provide these servi ces must bill the Medicaid program directly using their own pr ovider numbers. (3-19-07) b. Costs of services covered under t he Early and Periodic Screenin g Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) portion of the Medicaid Program. Items such as eyeglass es and hearing aids are covered under IDAPA 16.03.09, \"Medicaid Basic Plan Be nefits.\" The cost of these ser vices is not includable as a part of ICF/ID costs. Reimbursement can be made to a professional providing these ser vices through his billing the Medicaid Program on his own provider number. (4-11-19) c. Costs of services covered by othe r parts of the Medicaid Progra m. Examples of these items include legend drugs and ambulance trans portation. These items must be billed to the Medicaid Program directly by the provider using his own provider number. (3-19-07) 06. Cost Projection . Allowable per diem costs will be projected forward from the m idpoint of the Base Period to the midpoint of the Target Period. \"Base Period\" is d efined as the last available final cost report period. \"Target Period\" is defined as the effective period of the prosp ective rate. Procedures for i nflating these costs are as follows: (3-19-07) a. The percentage change for each cost category in the market bask et will be computed from the beginning to the end of the Base Period. These percentages will then be divided by two (2) and the resultant percentages will be used to project forward allowable per diem costs for each cost category from the midpoint to the end of the Base Period. (3-19-07) b. The percentage change for each cost category in the market bask et will be computed for the periodIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 626 Page 2706from the end of the Base Period to the beginning of the Target Period. These percentages will then be used to project forward the allowable per diem c osts for each cost category, as determined in Subsection 624.06.a. of these rules, from the end of the Base Period to the beginning of the Target Period. (3-19-07) c. The percentage change for each c ost category in the market bask et will be computed for the beginning to the end of the Target Period. These percentages wi ll then be divided by two (2) and the resultant percentages will be used to project forward the allowable per d iem costs as determined in Subsection 624.06.b. of these rules from the beginning to the midpoint of the Target Pe riod. (3-19-07) 07. Cost Ranking . Prior to October 1st of each y ear the Director will determine the that percent above the median that will assure aggregate payments to ICF/ID provid ers will approximate but not exceed amounts that would be incurred using Medicare cost principles of reimburseme nt. That percentage will apply to caps and rates set after September 30th of each year . Projected per diem costs as determined in this section and subject to the cap will be ranked from the highest to the lowest. The cap will be set at a percent of the bed-weighted median for each rate period. The initial cap will be set as of October 1, 1996. (3-19 -07) a. The median of the range will be computed based on the available data points being considered as the total population of data points. (3-19-07) b. The cap for each ICF/ID facility with a fiscal year beginning O ctober 1, 1996, will be computed prior to the beginning of that year. For those facilities with a fiscal year ending on a date other than September 30th, the first cap will be computed for the period beginning October 1, 1996, and ending on the fiscal year end date. (3-19-07) c. Facilities with cost reports that transcend the period from Oct ober 1, 1996, through September 30, 1997, will be retrospectively settled using the previous reimbu rsement system for the period of the report up to September 30, 1996. There will not be a retrospective settlemen t on the portion of these cost reports attributed to October 1, 1996 through the end o f the cost repor t period unles s provisions of Section 626 of these rules apply. (3-19-07) d. Cost reports for periods beginning on or after October 1, 1996, will not be subject to retrospective settlement except as required by other provisions of this chapt er. (3-19-07) e. A new cap and rate will be set on an annual basis for each faci lity the first of July every year. (3-19-07) f. The cap and prospective rate wi ll be determined and set on an a nnual basis for each facility July first of every year and will not be changed by any subsequent e vents or information with the exception that if the computations were found to contain mathematical or clerical err ors, these errors will be co rrected and the cap will be adjusted using the corr ected figures. (3-19-07) g. Payment of costs subject to the cap will be limited to the cap unless the Department determines the exclusions found in Section 628 o f these rules apply. (3-19-07) h. A facility that commences to off er participant care services as an ICF/ID on or after October 1, 1996, will be subject to retrospective settlement until the fir st prospective rate is set. Such facility will be subject to the ICF/ID cap as determined in this chapter. The first prospec tive rate for this provider will be set by the Department based on quarterly cost statements and final cost reports submi tted for periods following the first three (3) months of operation. This first prospective rate may be set after the beg inning of the second fiscal year of the provider. For the second year the provider will be paid a rate to be settled retr ospectively unless both the D epartment and the provider agree to a prospective rate or rates covering th at fiscal perio d. (3-19-07) 625. (RESERVED)626. ICF/ID: RETROSPECTIVE SETTLEMENT. When retrospective settlement is applicable, it is based on all owable reimbursement in accordance with this chapter and based on an audit report. Retrospective settlement will be subject to the same caps and limits determined forIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 627 Page 2707prospective payments. (3-19-07) 01. A Provider's Failure to M eet Any of the Conditions . A provider's failure to meet any of the conditions of participation set forth in 42 CFR 483, Subpart I, may subject that provider to retrospective reimbursement for the fiscal year , or any portion thereof, duri ng which the condition is not met. The provider's projected per diem rate may be adjusted to reflect actual reimb ursable costs subject to cost limits. (3-19-07) 02. A First Time Provide r. A first time provider operating a new ICF/ID living unit wil l be subject to a retrospective settl ement for the first fiscal year and until the first subsequent period wherein a prospective rate is set in accordance with Sections 603, 6 05, and 606 of these rules an d this chapter. A budget based on the best available information is required prior to opening for participant care s o an interim rate can be set. (3-19-07) 03. New ICF/ID Living Unit . A new ICF/ID living unit for an existing operator is subject to first time facility requirements if the new living unit reflects a net inc rease in licensed beds, otherwise the Department may set a prospective rate with the non-p roperty rate components based on similar components of rat es most recently paid for the participants moving into the facility. The property rental rate will be set according to a pplicable provi sions of this chapter. (3-19-07) 04. Change of Ownership of E xisting ICF/ID Living Unit . Where there is a change of ownership of an existing ICF/ID living unit, the provider operating the ICF/ ID living unit will not receive an adjustment of the provider's prospective rate except that the property rental por tion of the rate will be adjust ed subject to property rental provisions of this chapter. Howev er, new facility reporting req uirements and the cap will apply. (3-19-07) 05. Fraudulent or False Claims . Providers who have made fraudul ent or false claims are subjec t to retrospective settlement as deter mined by the Department. (3-19- 07) 06. Excluded Costs . Excluded costs may be retrospectively settled according to th e provisions of Section 247 of these rules. (3-19-07) 627. ICF/ID: EXEMPT COSTS. Exempt costs are not subject to the ICF/ID cap. (3-19-07) 01. Day Treatment Services . As specified in this Section, the cost of day treatment servi ces may be reimbursed in this category and may not be subject to the ICF/I D cap. (3-19-07) a. This category includes the direct costs of labor, benefits, con tracted services, property, utilities and supplies for such services up to the limitations provided in th is Subsection. (3-19-07) b. When a school or another agency or entity is responsible for or pays for services provided to a participant regularly during nor mal working hours on weekdays, no costs will be assigned to this category for such services. The Department will not reimburse for the cost of ser vices that are paid for or should be paid for by an other agency. (3-19-07) c. When ICF/ID day treatment services are performed for participan ts in a licensed Developmental Disability Center, the allowable cost of such services will be included in this category, but not more than the amount that would be paid according to t he Department's fee schedule f or individual or group therapy for similar services. Amounts incurred or paid by the ICF/ID in excess of what would be paid according to the Department's fee schedule for like services are not allow able costs and will be reported as non-reimbursable. (3-19-07) d. For day treatment services provided in a location other than a certified developmental disability center, the maximum amount reportable in this category will als o be limited. Total costs fo r such services reported by each provider in this category will b e limited to the number of hours, up to thirty (30) hour s per week per participant, of individual or group developmental therapy times the hourly r ate that would be paid according to the most recent Department fee schedule for the s ame services if provided in a developmental disability center. Costs in excess of the limits determined in this Subsection will be classified and rep orted as subject to the ICF/ID cap. Initial rates established under the prospective system effective October 1, 1 996, and not later than October 1, 1997, will not include a limitation of day treatment costs based on the hourly rate, when the hours of individual or group therapyIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 628 Page 2708were not obtained or audited by the Department at the time the rate was published. However, if a provider believes that the day treatment cost used to establish the day treatment portion of its prospective rate was misstated for rates set for periods beginning October 1, 1996, through rates beginn ing October 1, 1997, revisions to the prospective rate may be made to the extent the pr ovider demonstrates, to the sat isfaction of the Departmen t, that the cost used was misstated. Such a revision will be considered only if the provi der requests a revision and provides adequate documentation within sixty (60) days of the date the rate was s et. At the option of the D epartment it may negotiate fixed rates for these day treatment services. Such rates will b e set so the aggregate related payments are lower than would be paid with a limitation based on schedules used for lic ensed Developmental Disability Centers. (3-19-07) e. Financial data including expenses and labor hours incurred by o r o n b e h a l f o f t h e p r o v i d e r i n providing day treatment services, must be identifiable and sepa rate from the costs of other facility operations. Reasonable property costs relat ed to day treatment services and not included in the property rental rate, will be separately identified, will be reported as day treatment servic es costs, and will not include property costs otherwise reimbursed. Property costs relat ed to day treatment services wi ll be separately identified as not related to living unit costs by a final audit determination issued prior to October 1, 1996, or will be separate and distinct from any property used for ICF/ID servi ces that are or were day treatment service s. (3-19-07) f. In the event a provider has a change in the number of participa nts requiring day treatment services, the prospective rate may be adju sted by the Department to refle c t a c h a n g e i n c o s t s r e l a t e d t o s u c h a c h a n g e . Providers receiving such changes may be required to provide add ed documentation to the Department to assure that further changes can be identified and the prospective rate adju sted accordingly. (3-19-07) 02. Major Movable Equipment . Costs related to major movable equipment, as defined in this chapter will be exempt from the ICF/ID cap and will be reimbursed prosp ectively based on Medicare principles of cost reimbursement. (3-19-07) 628. ICF/ID: COSTS EXCLUDED FROM THE CAP. Certain costs may be excluded from the ICF/ID cap, may be subje ct to retrospective settlement at the discretion of the Department, and may result in changes to the prospective rate a s provided in this Section to assure equitable reimbursement: (3-19-07) 01. Increases of More Than One Dollar Per Participant Day in Cos ts. Increases of more than one dollar ($1) per participant day in costs otherwise subject to t he cap incurred by a facility as a result of changes in State or Federal laws or rules will be reported separately on the cos t report for reports filed less than thirty (30) months, or a greater length of time if so di rected by the Department, from the date such increases wer e first required. Such costs will be subdivided into the comp onent parts of wages, benefits, contracted services and oth er costs in the amounts equal to costs removed from the respective cost categories subj ect to the cap. The Department may adjust the forecasted rate to include the pr ojected per diem related to su ch costs. (3-19-07) a. The provider will report these co sts on a separate schedule or by notations on the cost report so that these costs can be identified a nd reconciled to the provider's general ledger. (3-19-07) b. If more than one (1) increase o ccurs as a result of one (1) or more law or rule change, the costs from each event are to be reported separately. (3-19-07) c. The computation of the cost incr ease amount or amounts is to be presented in detail on a supplementary schedule or schedul es unless the Department state s otherwise. (3-19-07) d. For interim rate purposes the provider's prospective rate may b e granted an increase to cover such cost increases. A cost stateme nt covering a recent period may b e required with the justi fication for the increased costs. The actual amount related to such increases will be dete rmined at audit and may be retrospectively settled. (3-19-07) e. After the initial deadline has passed for all providers to file cost reports for reporting periods beginning on or after the date certain cost increases were firs t required, the Department will , at it's option, include all of the previously excluded costs related to those increases wit h costs subject to the cap whe n setting rates or increaseIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 629 Page 2709the cap and individual facility prospective rates following suc h cost increases. If a cap is set with these particular costs included in the cap categor y, providers subject to that c ap will not have these cost s excluded from the cap for prospective rate purposes. The i ntent of this provision is for costs to be exempt f rom the cap until th ese costs are able to be fully and equitably incorp orated in the data base used to project the cap and for thes e costs to be exempt only when they are not included in the data base. In those cases, wh en costs are not incurred immediately after a change in rule or law, delays in incorpora ting the new costs in the cap a re warranted. (3-19-07) f. When cost increases that have been excluded from the cap are in corporated in the inflation indices used to set the cap, the cost indices will be adjusted to exclu de the influence of such changes if the amount is included in the index is identified. When the cap is set to include prev iously excluded amounts, any adjustments previously made to the indexes related to t he previously excluded costs wi ll be removed. (3-19-07) 02. Excess Inflation . Reimbursement of costs subject to the cap will be limited to the cap unless the Department determines the inflat ion indices used to set the pro spective rates for a reporting period understated actual inflation by more than seven (7% ) percentage points. In such ca se, prospective rates and the cap will be increased by the amount that actual inflatio n indices exceeded projected inf lation indices and may be ret rospectively adjusted by the department. (3-19-07) 03. Cost Increases Greater Than Three Percent . When cost increases of greater than three percent (3%) of the projected interim rat e that result from disasters s uch as fire, flood, or eart hquake, epidemic or similar unusual and unpredictable circumstances over which a provider h as no control. Prospective rates will be increased and they will not be subject to the cap. However, they may be r etrospectively adjusted by the Department. For the purposes of this Subsection, disas ter does not include personal or financial problems. (3-19-07) 04. Decreases . In the event of state or feder al law, rule, or policy changes that result in clearly identifiable reductions in required services, the Department ma y reduce the prospective rate to reflect the identified per diem amount related to such reductions. (3-19-07) 05. Prospective Negotiated Rates . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 622 of these rules, the Director will have the authority to negotiate prospective rates for providers who would ot herwise be subject to accept retrospective settlement. Such rates will not exceed the projec ted allowable rate that would otherwise be reimbursed based on provisions of this chapter. (3-19-07) 629. ICF/ID: LEGAL CONSULTANT FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS. Costs of legal consultant fees and litigation costs incurred by the provider will be hand led in accordance with the following: (3-19-07) 01. In General . Legal consultant fees unrelated to the preparation for or the taking of an appeal of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, or lit igation costs incurred by the provider in an action unrelated to litigati on with the Department of Health and Welfa re, will be allowed as a part of the total per diem costs of which the Medicaid Program w ill reimburse a portion accordin g to the percentage of Medicaid patient days. (3-19-07) 02. Administrative Appeals . I n t h e c a s e o f t h e p r o v i d e r c ontesting in administrative appe al the findings of an audit performed by the Department of Health and Welfare, the costs of the pr ovider's legal counsel will be reimbursed by the Medicaid Program only to the extent that t he provider prevails on the issues involved. The determination of the extent that the provider prevails will be based on the ratio of the total dollars at issue for the audit period at issue in the hearing to the total dollars ultimately awarded to the provider for that audit period by the hearing officer or subsequent adjudicator. (3-19-07) 03. Other . All other litigation costs incurred by the provider in action s against the Department of Health and Welfare will not be re imbursable either directly or indirectly by the Medicai d Program except where specifically ordered by a court of law. (3-19-07) 630. ICF/ID: PROPERTY RENTAL RATE REIMBURSEMENT. ICFs/ID will be paid a property rental rate. Property taxes, pr operty insurance, and depr eciation expense or major moveable equipment will be reimbursed as costs exempt from limi tations. The property rental rate does not includeIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 630 Page 2710compensation for minor movable equipment. The property rental r ate is paid in lieu of payment for amortization, depreciation, and interest for financing the cost of land and d epreciable assets. See Sections 56-108 and 56-109, Idaho Code, for further c larification. (3-19-07) 01. Property Rental Rate . The property rental rate is based upon current construction c osts, the age of the facility, the type of facility, and major expenditures made to improve the facility, or a rate based upon property costs as of January 1, 1985. The amount paid for each Medicaid day of care will be phased in according to the following: (3-19-07) a. R = \"Property Base\" x 40 - \"Age\" / 40 x \"change in building cos ts\" where: (3-19-07) b. \"R\" property r ental (3-19-07) c. \"Property Base\" = eleven dollars and twenty-two cents ($11.22) except for ICF/ID living units not able to accommodate residents req uiring wheelchairs beginning O ctober 1, 1996. Property b ase = seven dollars and twenty-two cents ($7.22) for ICF /ID living units not able ac commodate residents requiri ng wheelchairs. (3-19-07) d. \"Change in building costs\" = 1.0 from October 1, 1996, through December 31, 1996. For ICF/ID facilities, the most recent index available when it is first ne cessary to set a prospective rate for a period that includes all or part of the calendar year, will be used. (3-19-07) e. \"Age\" of facility - The effectiv e age of the facility in years will be set by subtracting the year in which the facility, or portion thereof, was constructed from th e year in which the rate is to be applied. No facility or portion thereof will be assigned an age of more than thirty (30 ) years, however: (3-19-07) i. If adequate information is not submitted by the facility to d ocument that the facility, or portion thereof, is newer than thirty (30) years, the age will be set a t thirty (30) years. Adequate documentation will include, but not be limited to, such documents as copies of building per mits, tax assessors' records, receipts, invoices, building contract, and original notes of indebtedness. An age will be de termined for each building. A weighted average using the age and square footage of th e buildings will become the eff ective age of the facility. The age of each building will be based upon the date when construction on that building was c ompleted. This age will be adjusted to reflect major building expansion or remodeling prior to April 1, 1985, if tha t expenditure was large enou gh to reduce the age of the facility by two (2) or more year s according to the following fo rmula: Where: If the result of this calculation, \"r\" is equal to or greater t han two point zero (2.0), the age of the building in years will be reduced by this number, rounded to the nearest wh ole number for rate setting purposes. In no case will the age be less than zero (0). (3-19-07) ii. For rates paid after June 30, 1989, the effective age of a f acility will be further adjusted when the cost of major repairs, replacemen t, remodeling, or renovation o f a building initiated after April 1, 1985, results in the change in age by at least one (1) year when applied to the form ula in Subsection 630.01.d.i. However, such change will not decrease the effective age of a facility beyond the po int where the increase in t he property rental rate is greater than three-fourths (3/4) of the difference between the property rental rate \"r\" for a new facility at the time ofr = A x E / S x C r = Reduction in the age o f the facility in years. A = Age of the building at the time when construction was comple ted. E =Actual expenses for the construc tion provided that the total co sts must have been incurred within twenty-four (24) months of the completion of th e construction. S = The number of square feet in the building at t he end of cons truction. C =The cost of constructi on for the buildings i n the year when con struction was completed according to the sched ule in Subsection 630.01.d.ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.10 Department of Health and Welfare Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits Section 631 Page 2711the proposed rate revision and the property rental rate for whi ch the facility was eligible immediately before the adjustment. The cost used for \"C \" will be adjusted according to costs published by Marshall Swift Valuation Service to reflect current construction co sts for average Class D conva lescent hospitals. It is the provider's responsibility to notify the Department and documen t costs. The Department will a djust the age after do cumentation of costs. (3-19-07) iii. In the event that new require ments are imposed by state or federal agencies, the Department will reimburse the expenditures direct ly related to these requiremen ts as an increase in the property rental rate if the expense is in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) per bed. If the cost related to the requirement is less than one hundred dollars ($100) per bed, the Department will, within twe lve (12) months of verification of expenditure, reimburse the Medicaid share of the entire cost of such new req uirements, as a one (1) time payment to the facility. (3-19-07) iv. At no time will the property rental rate paid to a facility be less than the greater of the rate allowable to that facility on December 31, 1988, the rate allowable immed iately following the first opening of a new facility after December 31, 1988, or the ra te allowable immediately foll owing the last, if any, age revision after December 31, 1988. However, subsequent to the application of this provision, before any property rental rate increase may be made for current or successor operator s, the final settlement amount of any increase in the prope rty rental rate will first be offset by an amount equal to the impact on final settlement of any rate decrease that would have occurred if the provisions of Subsections 630.01.d.iii. and 630.01.d.iv. of the se rules had not been applied. This is intended to allow the postponement of the financial burden to providers of proper ty rental rate decreases and t o allow an equal offset of the financial burden to the state of subsequent property rate i ncreases for a current or successor provider. (3-19-07) v. Effective October 1, 1996, for ICF/ID facilities, \"age of fac ility\" will be a revised age that is the l e s s e r o f t h e a g e e s t a b l i s h e d u n d e r o t h e r p r o v i s i o n s o f t h i s S e ction or the age that most closely yields the rate allowable to existing facilities as of September 30, 1996, unde r Subsection 630.01 of these rules.

Reimbursement for the property costs of such distinct parts may be allowed if t h e s e a r e a s a r e u s e d e x c l u s i v e ly for home office or day treatment services. The portion of property cost attribut ed to these areas may be reimb ursed as part of home office or day treatment costs without a reduction in the property rental rate. Reimbursement for home office and day tr eatment property costs will not include costs reimbursed by, or covered by the property ren tal rate. Such costs will only be reimbursed as property cost if the facility clearly inc luded space in excess of space normally used in such facilities. At a minimum to qualify for such reimbursement, a struct ure would have square feet per licensed bed in excess of the average square feet per licensed bed for other ICF/ID l iving units within four (4) lice nsable beds. (3-19-07) 03. Leases for Property . Beginning October 1, 1996, ICF/ID facilities with leases will be reimbursed as follows: (3-19-07) a.
