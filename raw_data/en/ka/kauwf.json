More information: [What is our evaluation process?](https://www.givewell.org/what-is-our-evaluation-process) Published: October 2022; Last Updated: January 2023 Summary What do they do? Helen Keller International (Helen Keller) supports programs focused on reducing malnutrition and averting blindness and poor vision; this review focuses only on Helen Keller's work on [vitamin A supplementation](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/vitamin-A) (VAS) in sub-Saharan Africa. Helen Keller provides technical assistance, engages in advocacy, and contributes funding to government-run vitamin A supplementation programs. ( [More](#What_do_they_do)) Does it work? There is strong evidence from many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the 1980s and 1990s that VAS can substantially reduce child mortality, but weaker evidence on how effective VAS is in the places Helen Keller would work with additional funding in the next few years. Helen Keller has conducted studies to determine whether its mass distribution programs reach a large proportion of targeted children and generally found positive results. We have also investigated the question of what effect Helen Keller's support has on programs and found a number of cases where it seems likely that Helen Keller support is necessary for supplementation to occur. ( [More](#Does_it_work)) What do you get for your dollar? We estimate that it costs $1.10 to deliver a vitamin A supplement in Helen Keller-supported programs. The numbers of deaths averted and other benefits of VAS are a function of a number of difficult-to-estimate factors, which we discuss below. ( [More](#What_do_you_get_for_your_dollar)) Is there room for more funding? We conduct \"room for more funding\" analysis to understand what portion of Helen Keller's ideal future budget it will be unable to support with the funding it has or should expect to have available. We may then choose to either make or recommend grants to support those unfunded activities. Our recent analyses of Helen Keller's room for more funding can typically be found by visiting the \"Sources\" sections of our published grant pages (see a list of grant pages [here](https://airtable.com/shr1EzngorAlEzziP/tblG72bMUu36lrWsr/viwwCGCP0KVQIUWfz?blocks=hide)). ( [More](#Is_there_room_for_more_funding)) Helen Keller's vitamin A supplementation program is recommended because: - VAS is a program with a strong evidence base and strong cost-effectiveness. - Track record - Helen Keller has experience with supporting VAS programs in a large number of countries. - Standout transparency - it has shared significant, detailed information about its programs with us. - Room for more funding - we believe that Helen Keller could productively use more funding than it expects to receive to scale up its VAS activities. Major open questions include: - We remain highly uncertain about current rates of vitamin A deficiency among preschool-aged children in areas where Helen Keller supports VAS programs. If rates of vitamin A deficiency are low, it is likely that the impact of Helen Keller's VAS programs would be limited.

To date, our investigation of Helen Keller has consisted of: - Conversations with Helen Keller staff. [1](#footnote1_wa7tecz) - Reviewing documents Helen Keller shared with us. - A visit to Conakry, Guinea in October 2017 to meet with representatives of Helen Keller. What do they do? Helen Keller International (Helen Keller) supports programs focused on reducing malnutrition and averting blindness and poor vision in countries in Africa and Asia; it also provides vision screenings and distributes eyeglasses at schools in the United States. [2](#footnote2_upgf1tk) In this review, we focus only on Helen Keller's [vitamin A supplementation](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/vitamin-A) (VAS) programs, which operate in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. [3](#footnote3_zbz8617) The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all preschool-aged children (aged 6 to 59 months) in areas where vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a public health problem receive vitamin A supplements two to three times per year. [4](#footnote4_waa4pxt) Helen Keller supports countries' VAS programs for preschool-aged children by providing technical assistance, engaging in advocacy, and contributing funding to governments for implementing the programs. What is vitamin A supplementation? Vitamin A is an essential nutrient that serves many purposes in the body; in particular, the immune and visual systems require it to function properly. [5](#footnote5_m5qbl7x) Essential nutrients must be obtained through diet since the body cannot produce them on its own. [6](#footnote6_ger9xh6) Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) can cause stunting, anemia, xerophthalmia (dry eyes, which can lead to blindness), increased severity of infections, and death. [7](#footnote7_bj0ec7g) WHO notes that people who have diets containing few animal products and little vitamin A-fortified food may be particularly susceptible to VAD. [8](#footnote8_uz4gxx2) WHO estimates that VAD is most common in its Africa and South-East Asia Regions. [9](#footnote9_26u19ps) Infants, children, and pregnant or lactating women with low vitamin A intake appear to have a particularly high risk of the negative health impacts caused by VAD. [10](#footnote10_2fg12o3) WHO notes that vitamin A from high-dose supplements can be stored in the liver and used as needed in the body for several months. [11](#footnote11_g3biwpf) To prevent childhood morbidity and mortality, WHO recommends vitamin A supplementation (VAS) every four to six months for all children aged 6 to 59 months in areas where VAD is a public health problem. [12](#footnote12_e0tw9m7) More information about VAS is available in our [vitamin A supplementation intervention report](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/vitamin-A). How are vitamin A supplements distributed and administered to preschool-aged children? Distribution Helen Keller-supported VAS programs distribute vitamin A supplements through either mass distribution campaigns or through routine delivery (in which caregivers take their children to facilities to receive VAS every six months). [13](#footnote13_dj2z2q4) We have requested that Helen Keller use future GiveWell-directed funding only for mass distribution campaigns because we have a limited understanding of how to measure Helen Keller's impact on routine delivery programs. Helen Keller supports two types of VAS mass distribution campaigns: - Door-to-door campaigns, in which community health workers travel to recipients' homes to distribute and administer vitamin A supplements and other interventions to preschool-aged children. [14](#footnote14_ycetawo) - Fixed-site campaigns, in which caregivers bring preschool-aged children to health facilities or outreach posts to receive vitamin A supplements and other interventions. [15](#footnote15_ud5hara)Fixed-site campaigns use social mobilization activities (e.g., fliers and radio announcements) to remind caregivers to bring their preschool-aged children to nearby distribution sites during the campaign dates. [16](#footnote16_6j2dup5) [This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11pH3JHXar7S-dTiWFO55CeJitVQBSfVl2Kb66U7BdW4/edit#gid=0) lists the distribution methods of VAS mass distribution campaigns that Helen Keller supported with GiveWell-directed funding in 2018 through 2021. Administration Health workers implementing VAS programs are instructed to cut vitamin A capsules open with scissors and squeeze the contents of the capsules directly into children's mouths. [17](#footnote17_20qnh61) Health workers are also instructed to ask caregivers about the age of the child in order to provide the correct dosage of vitamin A: 100,000 IU for 6-11 month-old infants, and 200,000 12-59 month-old children. [18](#footnote18_et2a789) What is Helen Keller's role in VAS programs? Helen Keller provides the following types of support to government-run VAS programs: [19](#footnote19_36qflgm) - Technical assistance: Helen Keller assists governments with monitoring and evaluation, [20](#footnote20_kwwnlnz)training health workers and managers, [21](#footnote21_kajg9t5)policy design, [22](#footnote22_h8khqor)planning and budgeting, [23](#footnote23_4dgz3pf)and social mobilization [24](#footnote24_yqp12bh)for VAS programs (details in footnotes). Helen Keller mainly focuses on providing technical assistance at the sub-national level, particularly to districts or regions that may have low VAS coverage rates. [25](#footnote25_el3ip2e) - Advocacy: Helen Keller encourages national governments to prioritize budgeting for and implementing VAS mass campaigns, [26](#footnote26_4w58orh)and advocates for routine distribution of vitamin A supplements through health facilities. [27](#footnote27_uztdkhn) - Funding: Helen Keller provides grants to governments to cover a portion of the implementation costs of VAS programs. [28](#footnote28_w9zeho6) UNICEF and [Nutrition International](https://www.givewell.org/international/charities/micronutrient-initiative) (formerly Micronutrient Initiative) also support VAS programs in countries where Helen Keller works. Nutrition International procures the vitamin A supplements used in the programs, and UNICEF provides technical and financial support to geographic regions not supported by Helen Keller. [29](#footnote29_sfur0xr) Helen Keller's spending on VAS campaigns Helen Keller's work on VAS campaigns in 2018 through 2021 was primarily funded by GiveWell-directed funding. [30](#footnote30_mw7auua) Details of its spending on VAS campaigns in 2018-2021 can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xwRF6bBs66yPOX02nRaWaA0EvbtfjVEMRojAxd2E9sk/edit#gid=1106575499). In short, in 2021: - Helen Keller spent a total of $15.1 million on VAS campaigns, up from $7.6 million in 2020 and $5.8 million in 2019. - By location, Helen Keller spent between roughly $1 and $2 million each in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the expansion of some programming in 2020, but did not significantly affect timelines in 2021. [31](#footnote31_e1op6qk)Helen Keller spent an additional $1 million on regional and global support for these country programs. - By category, Helen Keller spent around 42% on grants to governments for program implementation (\"sub-agreements\"), [32](#footnote32_i5txk47)50% on direct program costs (including campaign logistics, training, monitoring, personnel, travel, equipment, and supplies), [33](#footnote33_ifulp66)and 8% on overhead costs. - - Helen Keller also spent $0.5 million on delivery of VAS through approaches other than campaigns: around $100,000 to $200,000 per country in Cameroon, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. [34](#footnote34_ghzz4fy) Does it work? This section was last updated in November 2020. The information that Helen Keller has provided since that date is not yet reflected in this section. We base our expectation of the impact of Helen Keller's VAS campaigns on: - the evidence of effectiveness of VAS at reducing child mortality, - characteristics of the areas targeted by Helen Keller's VAS campaigns (including vitamin A deficiency and child mortality), and - evidence that a high proportion of targeted children receive and ingest vitamin A supplements. This expectation relies on the assumption that Helen Keller's support of VAS campaigns increases the number of children who receive VAS, compared to the number who would have in the absence of its support. To test whether this assumption holds up, we consider evidence about whether Helen Keller's support of past VAS campaigns either caused those campaigns to occur or increased the coverage rates they achieved. Finally, we consider whether there are factors that are not accounted for in the above evidence that would offset the impact of Helen Keller's VAS programs, either through reducing their effectiveness or contributing to negative outcomes. Is there independent evidence that the program is effective? A large number of RCTs of VAS that were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s found that VAS greatly reduces child mortality. A 1999-2004 trial with more participants than all previous studies combined (the Deworming and Enhanced Vitamin A, or DEVTA, trial) did not find a statistically significant effect on mortality. We remain uncertain about what could explain this difference in results. Further details on trials of VAS: - A [Cochrane](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/program-evaluation#CochraneLibrary)systematic review and meta-analysis of sixteen randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized trial conducted in the 1980s and 1990s ( [Imdad et al. 2010](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub2/pdf)) finds that VAS reduces mortality of 6 to 59-month-old children by 24% (95% confidence interval 17% to 31% reduction in mortality rates). [35](#footnote35_p5pl4m6)The Deworming and Enhanced Vitamin A (DEVTA) study, a more recent trial (taking place between 1999-2004 and published in 2013) in India with around one million participants, estimates that VAS reduced child mortality by 4% and cannot rule out the possibility that VAS did not affect child mortality at all (the 95% confidence interval ranged from a 3% increase in child mortality to an 11% decrease). [36](#footnote36_z4jqry0)An updated version of the Cochrane review ( [Imdad et al. 2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub3/full)) combined DEVTA and another smaller recent trial ( [Fisker et al. 2014](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/134/3/e739.full.pdf)) with previous trials. [37](#footnote37_xd832n1)Its fixed-effect meta-analysis finds that VAS causes a 12% reduction in child mortality (95% confidence interval 7% to 17% reduction) and its random-effects meta-analysis finds that VAS causes a 24% reduction in child mortality (95% confidence interval 17% to 31% reduction). [38](#footnote38_kcsm2re)(See the following footnote for a description of the differences between fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses.) [39](#footnote39_k9mhqay)Even though the overall effect found in the updated meta-analysis remains statistically significant, it is unlikely that differences between the results of DEVTA and earlier trials were due to random chance alone. [40](#footnote40_95buh9b) - We are uncertain about what could explain why the earlier trials and DEVTA found such different results. Some potential explanations include: - The population treated by DEVTA had lower baseline child mortality rates and may have had better overall health than many previously studied populations. [41](#footnote41_tajqkun)Deaths averted by VAS in worse-off populations may have already been averted through other means (e.g., increased vaccination rates) in the DEVTA population. [42](#footnote42_gnljyxf)This hypothesis is undermined somewhat by the apparent lack of a correlation between how much mortality risk was reduced and baseline mortality rate in non-DEVTA trials. [43](#footnote43_uspsw6h) - Some researchers not involved in the study have pointed to evidence suggesting that DEVTA may have failed to achieve as high a coverage rate as it reported. [44](#footnote44_q8luki3) - DEVTA may have had methodological weaknesses that caused it to fail to detect a statistically significant mortality effect, even if VAS had a real effect on mortality rates in the population studied (details in footnote). [45](#footnote45_67kuy66) - The population treated by DEVTA had lower baseline child mortality rates and may have had better overall health than many previously studied populations. For more details, see our [vitamin A supplementation intervention report](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/vitamin-A). A shorter summary of our views is available in our [blog post](http://blog.givewell.org/2016/06/28/challenges-in-finding-a-great-vitamin-a-charity/) on vitamin A supplementation programs. Are programs targeted at areas where they are likely to be effective? We have several sources of uncertainty about how to apply evidence from the trials discussed above to the contexts in which VAS programs operate today, including: - More children in today's contexts may be receiving vitamin A through food fortification programs or improved diets than children in the earlier contexts did. There appears to be limited information available on current rates of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in the populations targeted by VAS. - Child mortality rates in developing countries have decreased substantially over the past few decades. It is possible that deaths that may have been averted by VAS in worse-off populations in the past may already be averted through other means (e.g., increased immunization rates) in today's contexts. To estimate what effect we should expect from VAS in locations where Helen Keller supports VAS programs, we have considered the following questions: - How prevalent is vitamin A deficiency in areas where Helen Keller works? - How high are child mortality rates in areas where Helen Keller works? How prevalent is vitamin A deficiency in areas where Helen Keller works? There is limited recent data on the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) among populations targeted by Helen Keller's VAS programs. Our best estimate, using data from a model of VAD prevalence created by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease project, is that the prevalence of VAD among preschool-aged children in countries where Helen Keller works or plans to work is between 25% and 36%. We estimate that the prevalence of VAD in populations represented in the meta-analysis of the effect of VAS on mortality was roughly 59%. Based on these estimates, we expect that VAS has a smaller impact on child mortality rates in populations reached by Helen Keller's programs today than the impact on mortality found in populations studied in VAS trials. We incorporate this adjustment into our cost-effectiveness analysis of Helen Keller (see [below](#Cost-effectiveness)). It appears unlikely that low rates of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) explain the DEVTA results, but it is still plausible that low rates of VAD in an area may indicate that VAS programs will have a limited effect on mortality there. [46](#footnote46_x8tmiur) (See footnote for arguments on ways in which VAD rates may not be indicative of the impact of VAS on child mortality; we have not yet evaluated these arguments carefully.) [47](#footnote47_w77mj1c) The prevalence of VAD in a population can be estimated using representative surveys of serum retinol concentrations or retinol-binding protein (measured in blood samples), clinically assessed eye signs of VAD (e.g., Bitot's spots, xerophthalmia), or other measures. [48](#footnote48_phhh4mx) WHO defines VAD as being indicated by a serum retinol concentration lower than 0.70 mol/L, and severe VAD as a serum retinol concentration lower than 0.35 mol/L. [49](#footnote49_z3yga09) Our estimates for the prevalence of VAD among populations studied in trials included in [Imdad et al. 2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub3/full) are in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KFBTpp-vBZzBTq3dWz9pFku9JsDKPRTVIfYgb3C_4QU/edit?usp=sharing) (\"Imdad 2017 - VAD prevalence estimates\" sheet). We consider our weighted average estimate of 59% prevalence of VAD in populations studied in VAS trials to be a rough best guess, based on limited data. Our process and sources for creating this estimate are outlined in the following footnote. [50](#footnote50_02lxreq) We remain uncertain about the prevalence of VAD among preschool-aged children in areas where Helen Keller works after considering the following sources of information: - Vitamin A deficiency surveys: We have listed the most recent serum retinol and retinol-binding protein surveys of preschool-aged children in countries where Helen Keller supports or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KFBTpp-vBZzBTq3dWz9pFku9JsDKPRTVIfYgb3C_4QU/edit?usp=sharing). Notes on this data: - Of the nine countries where Helen Keller supports or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs, two have completed nationally-representative surveys of VAD (using serum retinol or retinol-binding protein biomarkers) among preschool-aged children in the past ten years. The remaining countries completed VAD surveys more than ten years ago, or have not ever completed any. [51](#footnote51_gbw7li0) - The majority of these surveys find VAD prevalence among preschool-aged children in the \"severe\" range as defined by WHO (above 20% prevalence). [52](#footnote52_kgg31s0)But one of the more recent surveys, from Kenya in 2012, found prevalence rates in the \"mild\" range. [53](#footnote53_gn1a4rw)Malawi and Ghana have not received support from Helen Keller for VAS programs, but have implemented VAD surveys in the past five years\u2014a very low prevalence of VAD among preschool-aged children was reported from a 2015-16 survey in Malawi (4%), and a relatively high rate (21%) was found in Ghana in 2017. [54](#footnote54_eceop98) - VAS appears to have only a temporary impact on measures of serum retinol and retinol-binding protein concentrations. [55](#footnote55_r1ut1n7)Accordingly, measures of serum retinol or retinol-binding protein may not be useful for evaluating the impact of a VAS program\u2014instead, they may reflect whether or not dietary vitamin A intake is adequate. [56](#footnote56_3dcl5u7) - We have not searched for recent surveys of the prevalence of Bitot's spots or other eye signs of VAD; our understanding is that these indicators of VAD may be responsive to VAS, and so would not be useful as an indicator of \"underlying\" VAD in a population reached by a VAS program, but we have not investigated this issue in depth. [57](#footnote57_5w7k5nw) - Of the nine countries where Helen Keller supports or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs, two have completed nationally-representative surveys of VAD (using serum retinol or retinol-binding protein biomarkers) among preschool-aged children in the past ten years. The remaining countries completed VAD surveys more than ten years ago, or have not ever completed any. [Stevens et al. 2015](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/langlo/PIIS2214-109X(15)00039-X.pdf)incorporates the most recent available VAD surveys and other relevant information (e.g., availability of animal-source foods) into a mathematical model to estimate rates of VAD as of 2013. [58](#footnote58_zt2g3ys)We have not carefully reviewed the methodology used in this paper. [Stevens et al. 2015](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/langlo/PIIS2214-109X(15)00039-X.pdf)concludes that VAD was likely to be high (above 40%) in 2013 throughout sub-Saharan Africa. [59](#footnote59_nimud0y)Three more recent vitamin A deficiency surveys from Sierra Leone, Malawi, and Kenya found considerably lower rates of VAD among preschool-aged children than the lower bound estimate for sub-Saharan African countries in [Stevens et al. 2015](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/langlo/PIIS2214-109X(15)00039-X.pdf). [60](#footnote60_dhgrm6x) - Vitamin A food fortification: Excluding the Democratic Republic of the Congo, all countries in which Helen Keller supports or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs mandate that vegetable oil be fortified with vitamin A. A few others mandate or allow fortification of wheat flour or sugar with vitamin A as well. (Some countries also have programs encouraging the consumption of crops biofortified with vitamin A, but we have not investigated these programs in depth.) [61](#footnote61_gwf6dy8)See details in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KFBTpp-vBZzBTq3dWz9pFku9JsDKPRTVIfYgb3C_4QU/edit?usp=sharing). We are uncertain about whether these food fortification programs have had impacts on rates of VAD among preschool-aged children in these countries. Our key findings: - In most countries in which Helen Keller has recently supported or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs, we have not seen any household- or market-level surveys testing whether food samples are adequately fortified. [62](#footnote62_6kq32hl) - A market-level survey of vegetable oil in the city of Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, found that nearly all samples were adequately fortified, but other surveys we have seen found relatively low rates of adequately-fortified oil. [63](#footnote63_jf74ukk) [Engle-Stone et al. 2017](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/5/522/htm#B10-nutrients-09-00522)found that rates of VAD among preschool-aged children in two cities in Cameroon did not significantly decline between 2009 and 2012, despite vitamin A fortification of vegetable oil becoming mandatory in 2011. [64](#footnote64_2eyzwdd) - In most countries in which Helen Keller has recently supported or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs, we have not seen any household- or market-level surveys testing whether food samples are adequately fortified. - Conversations with Helen Keller and experts on vitamin A deficiency: We have discussed our concerns about the lack of recent data on vitamin A deficiency with Helen Keller. Helen Keller told us that it believes it would be very surprising if vitamin A deficiency were no longer a problem throughout sub-Saharan Africa, especially in countries with high child mortality and malnutrition rates. [65](#footnote65_o9f0saw)Dr. Sherry Tanumihardjo, an expert on vitamin A status assessment, has told us that since many vitamin A oil fortification programs in countries in sub-Saharan Africa are relatively new, it would not be surprising if many of the programs were not yet functioning well enough to have an impact on VAD rates among preschool-aged children. [66](#footnote66_xn3z3us) In 2018, we took the information above into account to form a subjective best guess of VAD prevalence among populations targeted by Helen Keller's VAS campaigns. [67](#footnote67_c254395) In 2019, following a conversation with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), we decided to instead use VAD prevalence estimates from its Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project. [68](#footnote68_9aso7yj) IHME's modeling takes past vitamin A deficiency survey results, vitamin A supplementation coverage, a socio-demographic index, and an estimate of the availability of vitamin A in a country's food supply into account (excluding fortified foods). [69](#footnote69_wq4aon2) IHME's estimates indicate that, as of 2017, VAD prevalence ranged from 25% to 36% among children aged 6 to 59 months in countries where Helen Keller is supporting or plans to support VAS campaigns. [70](#footnote70_i3q4osb) We would guess that IHME's estimates of the prevalence of VAD are more likely to be accurate than our subjective best-guesses, but our confidence in this judgment is limited for the following reasons: - IHME told us that its model does not take vitamin A food fortification into account. [71](#footnote71_014aayd)We are uncertain how much we should expect vitamin A food fortification programs to affect VAD prevalence. - IHME's vitamin A deficiency modeling takes vitamin A supplementation coverage into account, so a country with high coverage for vitamin A supplementation over time would be estimated to have lower vitamin A deficiency. [72](#footnote72_4co6d0p)To estimate the impact of VAS, we would ideally like to consider estimates of what VAD prevalence would be in absence of VAS programs. How high are child mortality rates in areas where Helen Keller works? Child mortality rates in countries where Helen Keller works are lower than child mortality rates of some populations studied in trials of VAS in the 1980s and 1990s, but not so much lower that we would expect that Helen Keller's programs would be unlikely to be effective on average. (See [above](#Is_there_independent_evidence_that_the_program_is_effective) for an explanation of why VAS may have a limited impact on preventing additional child mortalities in populations where baseline rates are already relatively low.) For the nine countries where Helen Keller is supporting or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs, we estimate that mortality rates for children aged 6 to 59 months range from 4.6 to 19.0 deaths per 1,000 child-years as of 2017. [73](#footnote73_es2qmgk) Some major VAS trials took place in contexts where baseline mortality rates were considerably higher than these rates (see Table 1 below). Trials listed in Table 1 with baseline child mortality rates of 10.6 per 1,000 child-years or higher found that VAS significantly reduced child mortality, but the trials with lower baseline rates did not find statistically significant effects. [74](#footnote74_lemcwe4) Three out of the nine countries where Helen Keller supports or plans to support VAS programs have mortality rates below 10.6 per 1,000 child-years. [75](#footnote75_j99qizo) For comparison, control group child mortality rates in the six main trials included in [Imdad et al. 2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub3/full) are presented in the following table. 19 trials are included in the all-cause mortality meta-analysis in [Imdad et al. 2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub3/full), but we focus on these six trials because they account for around 90% of [Imdad et al. 2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub3/full)'s weighted mean estimate of the effect of VAS on mortality. [76](#footnote76_famlgzw) Table 1: Characteristics of the six main studies used in the Cochrane review's estimate of the effect of VAS on all-cause mortality |Study||Age group||Control group mortality per 1,000 child-years||Mortality risk in treatment et al. 1986](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673686911578) [83](#footnote83_gd7ypda) There are major limitations to our analysis so far of baseline child mortality rates in areas where Helen Keller works. In particular: - We have only reviewed data on national average child mortality rates. It would be more appropriate to use regional or local mortality data to evaluate the impact of Helen Keller's sub-national technical assistance work. We have not yet looked into whether reasonably high-quality data exist at the sub-national level. - It seems unlikely to us that there is a real baseline mortality rate \"threshold\" for the effectiveness of VAS (i.e., that VAS has an impact on child mortality when baseline rates are above 10.6 per 1,000 child-years, but no effect when baseline rates are below 10.6 per 1,000 child-years). We compare baseline mortality rates in areas where Helen Keller works to 10.6 per 1,000 child-years because it may be useful as a general indication of where VAS programs are more or less effective at reducing mortality. - We are uncertain whether VAS might have an impact on all mortalities caused by infectious diseases, or only a subset of specific infectious diseases. (It does not seem plausible to us that VAS could have an impact on other causes of child mortality, like accidents.) The only statistically significant cause-specific mortality reduction effect found in a meta-analysis of trials of VAS for preschool-aged children was for diarrhea. [84](#footnote84_w62u8ao)The same meta-analysis found a statistically significant reduction in measles incidence, but not mortality. [85](#footnote85_mrx3f5a)See our analysis comparing mortality rates and causes of mortality between populations studied in VAS trials and targeted populations in countries where Helen Keller works in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KBLL5GS4wBgItBLbe3sgDb8OV3tOmXyuU9BZolM8iB8/edit#gid=58273032&range=A1), \"External validity by country\" sheet. Are vitamin A supplements delivered to and ingested by targeted children? Helen Keller conducts coverage surveys to determine what proportion of the target population (children aged 6-59 months) was reached with VAS in the relevant campaign. We use results from past campaigns to understand the impact we should expect future campaigns to have. Specifically, we use coverage survey results about the proportion of targeted children reached, along with data on program spending, to estimate the [cost of treating a child with VAS](https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international#What_do_you_get_for_your_dollar). Our interpretation of these coverage survey results is informed by their comprehensiveness and the methodology used to collect them. Comprehensiveness See [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jo0ZnCNLljWVnmwngaCnXex3aZNyYqWli1P29PTfJ58/edit#gid=775399462&range=A1:B11) for all results we have seen from Helen Keller's VAS campaigns. We have reviewed coverage surveys from 2018 through 2021. As of this writing in December 2022, we have not yet received all the coverage surveys from 2022, so the below section focuses on coverage surveys through 2021. In 2018, Helen Keller began supporting VAS campaigns with GiveWell-directed funds. The surveys we have seen from 2018-2021 were for campaigns that represent around 54% of Helen Keller's total spending on VAS campaigns in those years. [86](#footnote86_b43mdaz) While this constitutes substantial evidence for the impact of Helen Keller's VAS campaigns, we note that it is less thorough than monitoring we have seen from some of our other top charities. We incorporate this assessment into our cost-effectiveness model. [87](#footnote87_ife29pl) Methodology In Helen Keller's coverage surveys, data collectors visit a sample of households and ask household members whether the eligible children in those households received VAS during the relevant campaign. As noted above, we have focused on understanding the methodology used in the coverage surveys conducted for campaigns in 2018 to 2021 that were supported with GiveWell-directed funds. Full details on the methodology used in those surveys are in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jo0ZnCNLljWVnmwngaCnXex3aZNyYqWli1P29PTfJ58/edit#gid=1675228685). In 2019, Helen Keller developed a revised coverage survey guide, [88](#footnote88_pb1atoc) with a new sampling methodology. [89](#footnote89_cwaiwz6) Our understanding is that this methodology was used for most of the coverage surveys conducted in 2019 on, with exceptions noted in this footnote. [90](#footnote90_64k6e8t) The remainder of this section focuses on this methodology because it has been most commonly used in recent surveys and because we expect it to be used for the majority of future surveys we will receive from Helen Keller. Below, we summarize Helen Keller's general coverage survey methodology since 2019 and discuss methodological strengths and weaknesses. Overall, we believe that Helen Keller's coverage surveys are designed to measure key indicators of the success of VAS campaigns and to achieve samples that are generally representative of target populations. However, we note that the caregiver-reported nature of responses may produce bias in results. We are also uncertain about the quality of survey implementation because we have seen limited results from the procedure used to audit data collectors' work, and the results we've seen are difficult to interpret. [91](#footnote91_0iglqw2) We incorporate our assessment of the quality of Helen Keller's coverage survey methodology into our cost-effectiveness model [92](#footnote92_l6f6nu8) and into our [qualitative assessment of Helen Keller's organizational strength](https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international#Helen_Keller_as_an_organization). - Respondent selection: Helen Keller's 2019-2021 coverage surveys employed two-stage cluster sampling of households in the relevant study area. [93](#footnote93_0l1ce7l)In each survey, the study area was subdivided into smaller \"enumeration areas,\" which were stratified as either urban or rural and in some cases by an additional quality (e.g., Helen Keller-supported or non-Helen Keller-supported). [94](#footnote94_34iywxf)Enumeration areas were then selected randomly, generally with probability proportional to size, from each stratum. [95](#footnote95_xsps7qf)Next, data collectors performed a census of all eligible households in selected enumeration areas. [96](#footnote96_i2k8apq)Census data was sent to the central supervision team, which randomly selected five to fifteen eligible households (i.e., households that contained at least one child aged 6-59 months) per enumeration area. [97](#footnote97_ij9eslm)We expect this selection protocol to result in a sample that is generally representative of the target population. Enumerators were instructed to survey all eligible children in selected households. [98](#footnote98_8p9r740)To determine a child's age (and therefore if they are eligible to be surveyed), data enumerators are instructed to ask the child's caregiver for a health card or birth certificate that states the child's birth date. If documentation is not available, data collectors ask caregivers if they remember the child's birth date, and if the caregiver doesn't know the birth date, they ask about local events to estimate when the child was born. [99](#footnote99_spu18ai) If a selected household is unavailable, data collectors are instructed to return up to two additional times to attempt to interview that household. [100](#footnote100_i90ibz1)In nearly all the surveys we have reviewed, approximately 95% or higher of the targeted number of households were interviewed. [101](#footnote101_4r0t8mk) - Survey design: Helen Keller has developed standard questionnaires, [102](#footnote102_q3yw6te)which it adapts for use in each country and translates into local languages. Each of the 2019-2021 coverage surveys we have reviewed included a pilot survey, during which questionnaires were tested and updated prior to survey implementation. [103](#footnote103_xqgloee)The adaptation, translation, and piloting of questionnaires in each setting increases our confidence that they are administered appropriately and consistently across contexts. A potential source of bias in Helen Keller's coverage surveys is their heavy reliance on caregiver-reported responses. The questionnaire used during household interviews instructs data collectors to ask caregivers questions about VAS and other interventions received by children in their household, such as deworming. [104](#footnote104_3qdd10k)We believe that these responses are at risk of recall bias, as respondents must answer questions about multiple interventions and possibly multiple children. In many cases, the recall period for these responses was relatively short, about one month, while some surveys were conducted two months after the campaign. [105](#footnote105_13y8z1g)Caregiver-reported responses are also at risk of social desirability bias that could lead respondents to overreport VAS administration if they believe that this is the preferred response of data collectors. We would have more confidence in a survey that tested the reliability of reported responses against some objective measure. The questionnaire instructs data collectors to show household members vitamin A capsules and deworming tablets (or photos of these items) when asking questions about these treatments, [106](#footnote106_yw58ln3)but while these visual aids may improve accurate recall, they are not used to verify responses (for example, by asking respondents to identify these items before they are asked if eligible children received them). - Survey implementation: Helen Keller contracts with independent consultants that recruit data collectors and supervisors and oversee survey implementation. Generally, data collectors and supervisors were not involved in VAS campaign implementation, though sometimes HKI staff members are involved in survey implementation. [107](#footnote107_r5xnpn1) Helen Keller's coverage surveys from 2019 and on included an auditing procedure in which supervisors were instructed to randomly select and then re-survey 10% of households in order to assess the accuracy of initial results, to which they were blinded. [108](#footnote108_dljyfnl)We see the inclusion of such a procedure as a methodological strength, both because it may encourage accurate data collection and because it provides a check on the accuracy of results. However, we have seen limited data on the level of correspondence found between initial and re-survey results, and the data we've seen is difficult to interpret, which slightly lowers our confidence in the quality of Helen Keller's auditing procedure. [109](#footnote109_fnei3jm)We are thus uncertain about the quality of survey implementation. - Data capture: Data was collected electronically. [110](#footnote110_naklylm)One concern we have about coverage surveys in general is that data may be lost after being collected. However, we believe it is unlikely that substantial data loss occurred after collection in Helen Keller's 2019-2021 coverage surveys. This is because, as mentioned above, in all the surveys we have reviewed, data was collected and uploaded from approximately 95% or higher of the number of households that were targeted to be interviewed. [111](#footnote111_ks90rdi) Results We believe that results from Helen Keller's coverage surveys provide relatively strong evidence that a high proportion of the target population has been reached with VAS in past campaigns. We use results about the proportion of targeted children reached, along with data on program spending, to estimate the [cost of treating a child with VAS](https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international#What_do_you_get_for_your_dollar). Note that while our discussion of survey methodology [above](#Methodology) focused on coverage surveys conducted in 2019 and on, we use survey results from 2018-2021 to estimate the cost per child treated. See [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jo0ZnCNLljWVnmwngaCnXex3aZNyYqWli1P29PTfJ58/edit#gid=1606491595&range=A1) for all results we have seen from Helen Keller's VAS campaigns. In short, in 2018-2021: [112](#footnote112_xru203m) - The median coverage rate for campaigns that were supported by Helen Keller using GiveWell-directed funds was 85%. [113](#footnote113_5adis6w) - The lowest campaign coverage rate was 61%, from a VAS campaign in 2019 in a county in Kenya supported by Helen Keller. [114](#footnote114_8orcnez)The highest campaign coverage rate was 94%, from the first VAS campaign of 2019 in six regions of Niger supported by Helen Keller. [115](#footnote115_7rni6el) - Coverage rates for 66% of 2018-2022 campaigns with surveys were above 80%, [116](#footnote116_mjed11y)which is the coverage rate targeted by Helen Keller for its VAS campaigns. [117](#footnote117_kf4qtww) How does Helen Keller's support affect program outcomes? The evidence we have discussed to this point forms the basis of our expectation of the impact of Helen Keller's VAS campaigns. This expectation relies on the assumption that Helen Keller's support of VAS campaigns increases the number of children who receive VAS, compared to the number who would have in the absence of its support. To test whether this assumption holds up, we have considered evidence about whether Helen Keller's support of past VAS campaigns either caused those campaigns to occur or increased the coverage rates they achieved. We have found strong evidence in some cases that Helen Keller's financial support enables VAS mass campaigns to occur. Helen Keller's support may impact the outcome of VAS mass campaigns in the following ways: - Increasing coverage rates: Helen Keller identifies districts or regions participating in mass campaigns that have low VAS coverage rates and provides sub-national governments in those regions with technical support. [118](#footnote118_qenui5t) - Causing VAS campaigns to occur: In the absence of external technical assistance and funding, Helen Keller told us that VAS campaigns and programs would not occur at all in some countries. [119](#footnote119_ayzn6ba) We have completed case studies on the types of impact Helen Keller's involvement may have on VAS mass campaigns for a selection of Helen Keller's past country programs. Helen Keller selected the countries for these case studies based on the availability of in-country staff for phone interviews; we are uncertain how representative our five country case studies are of the thirteen countries in which Helen Keller has recently supported VAS programs. In our case studies, we found strong evidence in a few cases that Helen Keller's financial support enables mass distributions of VAS to occur. We have not yet seen evidence we find convincing that Helen Keller's technical assistance enables mass distribution programs to achieve higher coverage rates than the programs would achieve in Helen Keller's absence, primarily because we lack information about coverage rates in areas without Helen Keller-supported programs (details in footnote). [120](#footnote120_8b57xcf) The full details of our case studies are available in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQjSespwzWo9PROkzdp2OsdrRHdkeq9INDZfdkafYss/edit?usp=sharing). Are there any negative or offsetting impacts? In this section, we consider factors that are not accounted for in the above evidence that could offset the impact of Helen Keller's VAS campaigns, either through reducing their effectiveness or contributing to negative outcomes. - Potential VAS interaction with vaccines and increased mortality in some groups: [Benn et al. 2009](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/90/3/629.full.pdf+html)reanalyzed data from an earlier VAS trial in Ghana to test the hypothesis that VAS reduced mortality in children whose most recent vaccine was a live vaccine (e.g., measles), but could lead to increased mortality in children (particularly girls) whose most recent vaccine was an inactivated vaccine (e.g., DTP). [121](#footnote121_mam6po7)The data re-analysis found that VAS was associated with nonsignificant increases in mortality among girls who had received vaccinations. [122](#footnote122_zror6pb)The authors of [Fisker et al. 2014](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/134/3/e739.full.pdf), a 2007-2010 trial in Guinea-Bissau of VAS, intended for the trial to test for interactions between VAS, live or inactivated vaccines, and gender. [123](#footnote123_igb02mo)The trial found no significant effect on mortality overall, a nonsignificant increase in mortality for boys, and no evidence of a differential effect based on receiving live or inactivated vaccines. [124](#footnote124_8pyfk9r)Based on the results of [Fisker et al. 2014](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/134/3/e739.full.pdf), it does not appear that increased mortality following VAS and live or inactivated vaccinations for boys or girls is a substantial concern. We have also completed research on the biological plausibility of interactions between VAS, vaccines, and sex, and did not find reasons to believe that harmful impacts are highly plausible (details in footnote). [125](#footnote125_65uht5u) - Adverse side effects of vitamin A supplements: Some preschool-aged children experience side effects after taking vitamin A supplements, including loose stools, headache, irritability, fever, nausea, and vomiting. [126](#footnote126_38g0243)WHO cites an estimate of the prevalence of these types of side effects of 1.5% to 7%; we have not vetted this estimate. [127](#footnote127_ezurw0t) - Potential vitamin A overdose: Chronic excessive vitamin A intake can cause a serious condition called vitamin A toxicity (also known as hypervitaminosis A). [128](#footnote128_7xlytj7)Our understanding is that cases of vitamin A toxicity are very rare globally, and that VAS programs are not thought to be a cause of cases of vitamin A toxicity. [129](#footnote129_oc2wx7p) - Diversion of skilled labor: VAS mass campaigns involve Ministry of Health staff, nurses, and other health workers. [130](#footnote130_ufw1thw)We are uncertain of the degree to which participating in VAS programs reduces their ability to complete other duties, but we note that our understanding is that VAS campaigns usually take between a few days and a few weeks to complete. [131](#footnote131_e4pyxje) What do you get for your dollar? This section was last updated in November 2020. The information that Helen Keller has provided since that date is not yet reflected in this section. Cost per vitamin A supplement delivered We estimate that on average the total cost to deliver a vitamin A supplement through Helen Keller-supported mass distribution programs is $1.10, using information from programs implemented in 2018 and 2019. Our approach For programs that distribute health commodities, our general approach for calculating a \"cost per item delivered\" estimate is to identify comparable data on costs and items delivered and take the ratio. We try to include all costs incurred to carry out a project, not just those that the charity in question pays for itself. We start with this total cost figure and apply adjustments in our cost-effectiveness analysis to account for cases in which we believe the charity's funds have caused other actors to shift funds from a less cost-effective use to a more cost-effective use (\"leverage\") or from a more cost-effective use to a less cost-effective use (\"funging\"). We prefer to calculate average \"cost per item delivered\" estimates using data from a broadly representative sample of mass distribution rounds, since costs may vary considerably in different contexts. We have used the following inputs to construct our cost per supplement estimate for Helen Keller: - Helen Keller's actual expenditures for VAS distribution rounds in 2018 and 2019 in Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. [132](#footnote132_gg1k4fu) - Rough estimates of expected spending by other organizations supporting VAS distribution rounds in Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger in 2018 and 2019, including UNICEF, Nutrition International, the World Health Organization (WHO), World Vision, and Save the Children. [133](#footnote133_jawy70s) - An assumption about the amount that the governments of Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger will contribute to VAS programs in the form of in-kind contributions. [134](#footnote134_4qrz5uz) - An estimate of the number of children who received vitamin A supplements, based on estimates from Helen Keller of the number of children in Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger aged 6-59 months and the results of Helen Keller's coverage surveys we have seen from GiveWell-supported campaigns. [135](#footnote135_1x8xj1b) Our cost per supplement estimate Using the approach described in the section above, we estimate that it costs $1.10 on average to deliver a vitamin A supplement in Helen Keller-supported VAS mass distribution programs. Full details are in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJaWPx1wpseVbqkNYapIdc3V2plHjLy-8RhU78053lg/edit?usp=sharing). Shortcomings of our cost per supplement analysis The following are key limitations of our cost per supplement analysis: - We have limited information on the contributions of organizations other than Helen Keller supporting VAS mass campaigns in Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger in 2018 and 2019 (UNICEF, Save the Children, Nutrition International, WHO, World Vision, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria). [136](#footnote136_hgnmq1h)We have only seen information on how much funding these organizations have budgeted for government grants to support program implementation, but our cost per supplement estimate also relies on rough estimates of how much additional funding these organizations will use for other expenses, including personnel and overhead costs. [137](#footnote137_e7kwgn8) - We rely on an estimate that 30% of overall program costs are indirect government costs (e.g., time-use of salaried government officials), the same estimate we use for the [Schistosomiasis Control Initiative's deworming programs](https://www.givewell.org/charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative#Shortcomings_of_our_analysis). We would guess that VAS programs and deworming programs require similar types of contributions from governments, but we note that the 30% estimate is derived from a single deworming program in Niger. [138](#footnote138_d2pusan) - Our cost per supplement estimate also relies on Helen Keller's estimates of the population of 6-to-59-month-old children in Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. [139](#footnote139_swhk4p6)We are uncertain about the accuracy of these population estimates. - We only have cost per supplement estimates for Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, but Helen Keller also currently supports VAS campaigns in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Kenya. [140](#footnote140_h3kzglr)We do not include cost per supplement estimates for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Kenya in our analysis because we have seen limited information from Helen Keller's programs in those countries to date (details in footnote). [141](#footnote141_u275rlg) Cost-effectiveness See our most recent [cost-effectiveness model](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models) for estimates of the cost per life saved through Helen Keller's VAS programs. There are limitations to this kind of cost-effectiveness analysis, and we believe that [cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally](http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/), due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible. Helen Keller-supported VAS campaigns also deliver additional interventions alongside VAS, including deworming, polio vaccination, \"mop-up\" immunizations (for children who have missed scheduled immunizations), and screening for severe acute malnutrition and moderate acute malnutrition. [142](#footnote142_8t767sf) A major limitation of our cost-effectiveness analysis of Helen Keller is that we do not directly include benefits resulting from interventions delivered alongside VAS in Helen Keller-supported programs. [143](#footnote143_4cshe0f) Is there room for more funding? We conduct \"room for more funding\" analysis to understand what portion of Helen Keller International's ideal future budget it will be unable to support with the funding it has or should expect to have available. We may then choose to either make or recommend grants to support those unfunded activities. Our recent analyses of Helen Keller's room for more funding can typically be found by visiting the \"Sources\" sections of our published grant pages (see a list of grant pages [here](https://airtable.com/shr1EzngorAlEzziP/tblG72bMUu36lrWsr/viwwCGCP0KVQIUWfz?blocks=hide)). Room for more funding analysis In general, we assess top charities' funding needs over a three-year period. [144](#footnote144_5sguldr) We ask top charities to report their ideal budgets over the next three years, along with information about their current available funding and funding pipeline. The difference between a charity's three-year budget and the funding we project that it will have available to support that budget is the charity's \"room for more funding.\" For this analysis, we focus only on Helen Keller's programs supporting VAS mass campaigns. The main components of our room for more funding analyses are: - Available funding. We ask top charities to report how much funding they currently hold in the bank, including in reserves, and how much of this funding is committed or expected to be spent on specific future activities. The difference between these figures is the amount available to allocate to the charity's unfunded spending opportunities. - Expected funding. We project the amount of additional funding that top charities will receive to support their work over the next three years. These projections represent our best guesses based on top charities' past revenue and our understanding of their funding pipelines. They typically include funding currently held by GiveWell to be granted to the top charity, projected funding due to being a GiveWell top charity, [145](#footnote145_uiajpye)and, if the top charity is part of a larger organization, projected unrestricted funding from that parent organization. They exclude any funding we may specifically recommend to the top charity subsequent to the analysis. We add this projected funding to the amount available to allocate to the charity's unfunded spending opportunities. - Spending opportunities. We ask top charities to report their ideal budgets in each of the next three years and to provide details on the specific spending opportunities included in these budgets. These opportunities are typically presented as one program year in a specific implementation geography (for example, VAS in Nigeria in 2024), and they can represent either an extension of the top charity's previous support to a geography or an expansion of support to a new geography. We ask top charities to report the order in which they would prioritize funding these opportunities, which helps us to understand how available and expected funding will be allocated and what the marginal impact of additional funding beyond that amount would be. A charity's room for more funding represents the total budget for the charity's spending opportunities, less its available and expected funding. For example, if a charity proposes spending $50 million over the next three years and holds $10 million in uncommitted funding, and we project that it will receive an additional $15 million in revenue over the next three years, that charity's room for more funding is $25 million. (Note that a charity's total room for more funding figure includes funding gaps at all levels of cost-effectiveness\u2014see below.) Our recent analyses of Helen Keller's room for more funding can typically be found by visiting the \"Sources\" sections of our published grant pages (see a list of grant pages [here](https://airtable.com/shr1EzngorAlEzziP/tblG72bMUu36lrWsr/viwwCGCP0KVQIUWfz?blocks=hide)). Grant investigation process Room for more funding analysis is a key part of our grant investigation process. We periodically request the information described above from top charities and update our room for more funding analyses. Our default is to update each top charity's room for more funding analysis annually, though we may choose to do so more or less frequently. The cadence on which we conduct updates depends largely on how often we grant funding to a top charity [146](#footnote146_o075bya) and how much we expect that charity's funding and budgets to have changed since our most recent funding decision. [147](#footnote147_5hpm3fk) We have typically updated our analysis of Helen Keller International's room for more funding on an annual basis. Our recent analyses of Helen Keller's room for more funding can typically be found by visiting the \"Sources\" sections of our published grant pages (see a list of grant pages [here](https://airtable.com/shr1EzngorAlEzziP/tblG72bMUu36lrWsr/viwwCGCP0KVQIUWfz?blocks=hide)). After completing such an update, we may then choose to investigate potential grants to support the spending opportunities that we do not expect to be funded with the charity's available and expected funding, which we refer to as \"funding gaps.\" The principles we follow in deciding whether or not to fill a funding gap are described on [this page](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities/2019/open-philanthropy-recommendation#Principles_we_followed). The first of those principles is to put significant weight on our cost-effectiveness estimates. We use [GiveDirectly's](https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly) unconditional cash transfers as a benchmark for comparing the cost-effectiveness of different funding gaps, which we describe in multiples of \"cash.\" Thus, if we estimate that a funding gap is \"10x cash,\" this means we estimate it to be ten times as cost-effective as unconditional cash transfers. As of November 2022, we expect to fund opportunities that meet or exceed a relatively high bar: 10x cash, or ten (or more) times as cost-effective as GiveDirectly's unconditional cash transfers. (Note that a charity's total room for more funding figure includes funding gaps at all levels of cost-effectiveness.) If we decide to fill a funding gap, we either make a grant from our [Top Charities Fund](https://www.givewell.org/top-charities-fund) [148](#footnote148_wdfhrqk) or recommend that another funder\u2014typically Open Philanthropy [149](#footnote149_inygg83) \u2014makes a grant. [This page](https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants) lists all grants made or recommended by GiveWell. Typically, when GiveWell donors make a donation to a top charity, [150](#footnote150_rhf6gau) we don't expect that donation to be directed to a specific funding gap, but rather to contribute to supporting the overall portfolio of opportunities included within a charity's room for more funding.

Thereafter, into adulthood, a diet deficient in vitamin A lacks foods containing either preformed vitamin A esters, such as liver, milk, cheese, eggs or food products fortified with vitamin A or lacking its carotenoid precursors (mainly beta-carotene), such as green leaves, carrots, ripe mangos, eggs, and other orange-yellow vegetables and fruits. Where animal source or fortified foods are minimally consumed, dietary adequacy must rely heavily on foods providing beta-carotene. However, while nutritious in many ways, a diet with modest amounts of vegetables and fruits as the sole source of vitamin A may not deliver adequate amounts, based on an intestinal carotenoid-to-retinol conversion ratio of 12:1. This ratio reflects a conversion efficiency that is about half that previously thought, leading to greater appreciation for why VAD may coexist in cultures that heavily depend on vegetables and fruits as their sole or main dietary source of vitamin A. \"Usually, VAD develops in an environment of ecological, social and economical deprivation, in which a chronically deficient dietary intake of vitamin A coexists with severe infections, such as measles, and frequent infections causing diarrhoea and respiratory diseases that can lower intake through depressed appetite and absorption, and deplete body stores of vitamin A through excessive metabolism and excretion. The consequent 'synergism' can result in the body's liver stores becoming depleted and peripheral tissue and serum retinol concentrations decreasing to deficient levels, raising the risks of xerophthalmia, further infection, other VADD and mortality.\" Pg 1.

A random-effects meta-analysis model involves an assumption that the effects being estimated in the different studies are not identical, but follow some distribution. The model represents our lack of knowledge about why real, or apparent, intervention effects differ by considering the differences as if they were random. The centre of this distribution describes the average of the effects, while its width describes the degree of heterogeneity. The conventional choice of distribution is a normal distribution. It is difficult to establish the validity of any distributional assumption, and this is a common criticism of random-effects meta-analyses. The importance of the particular assumed shape for this distribution is not known.\" - \"If variation in effects (statistical heterogeneity) is believed to be due to clinical diversity, the random-effects pooled estimate should be interpreted differently from the fixed-effect estimate since it relates to a different question. The random-effects estimate and its confidence interval address the question 'what is the average intervention effect?' while the fixed-effect estimate and its confidence interval addresses the question 'what is the best estimate of the intervention effect?'

This has led to the long-lived and strong assumption that VAS works by preventing VAD. Though intuitive, this assumption is contradicted by several facts. \"First, high-dose VAS has no sustained effect on VAD, as measured by serum retinol or other biochemical markers. Frequent intakes of vitamin A in physiological doses\u2014e.g., through food-based approaches, including fortification, and through regular low-dose supplementation\u2014are highly effective in increasing serum retinol and reducing VAD. However, when the dose of vitamin A is as high as 200,000 IU (about 100 times the daily allowance), the liver may not be able to store it, and the excess is broken up and excreted. Thus, the rise in serum retinol resulting from 6-monthly VAS is small, transient, and lasts only for 1-3 months. \"Second, if VAS worked by preventing VAD, then one would expect a clear linear association between the degree of underlying VAD and the effect of VAS: the higher the prevalence of VAD in a community, the larger the effect of VAS. However, this is not the case. Already, the first meta-analysis of the initial eight studies of the mortality effect of VAS noted that there was no association between the effect of VAS on mortality and the degree of underlying VAD at the population level. As presented in a recent review, this conclusion is substantiated when more recent studies are included.\" [Benn 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5372943/), Pg 1. - \"A threshold like this might not be observed if vitamin A had a pharmacological effect (i.e., if a large dose of vitamin A directly primed the immune system in some way, regardless of deficiency). However, Dr. Klemm thinks there is not any clear evidence to substantiate this hypothesis.\" [48](#footnoteref48_phhh4mx) - \"The main objective of assessing vitamin A status is to determine the magnitude, severity and distribution of VAD in a population. Most surveys assess its prevalence in young children and, with increasing frequency, in pregnant or lactating women, as reported here. Although VAD is likely to be widespread following the preschool years, few data exist to reveal the extent of VAD in school-age and young adolescent children (16). Estimating the national prevalence is to be encouraged as such data aids in targeting regions for interventions, and provides baseline values for monitoring population trends and intervention programme impact over time. \"Two sets of indicators of VAD are commonly used for population surveys: clinically assessed eye signs and bio-chemically determined concentrations of retinol in plasma or serum. The term xerophthalmia encompasses the clinical spectrum of ocular manifestations of VAD, from milder stages of night blindness and Bitot's spots, to potentially blinding stages of corneal xerosis, ulceration and necrosis (keratomalacia) (17), as listed in Table 1. The stages of xerophthalmia are regarded both as disorders and clinical indicators of VAD, and thus can be used to estimate an important aspect of morbidity and blinding disability as well as the prevalence of deficiency. As corneal disease is rare, the most commonly assessed stages are night blindness, obtainable by history, and Bitot's spots, observable by handlight examination of the conjunctival surface. Standard procedures exist for assessing xerophthalmia (17). Although night blindness and Bitot's spots are considered mild stages of eye disease, both represent moderate-to-severe systemic VAD, as evidenced by low serum retinol concentrations (19), and increased severity of infectious morbidity (i.e. diarrhoea and respiratory infections) and mortality in children (5) and pregnant women (6, 20). \"Measuring serum retinol concentrations in a population constitutes the second major approach to assessing vitamin A status in a population, with values below a cut-off of 0.70 mol/l representing VAD (21), and below 0.35 mol/l representing severe VAD. Although there is not yet international consensus, a serum retinol concentration below a cut-off of 1.05 mol/l has been proposed to reflect low vitamin A status among pregnant and lactating women (22). While the distribution of serum retinol concentrations below appropriate cut-offs are considered to reflect inadequate states of vitamin A nutriture, a low biochemical concentration of retinol in circulation is not considered a VADD. Also, while an inadequate dietary intake of vitamin A or beta-carotene likely reveals an important and preventable cause of VAD in a population, it is not an indicator of vitamin A status.\" [WHO Global prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in populations at risk 2009](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44110/1/9789241598019_eng.pdf), Pg 2. - Measures of the concentration of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) are used as a \"proxy\" for concentrations of serum retinol. Complications of using RBP as a proxy for serum retinol are described in [Tanumihardjo et al. 2016](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/146/9/1816S.full.pdf): - \"Serum RBP is used as a proxy for serum retinol concentrations in the identification of vitamin A deficiency. As discussed above, serum retinol correlates with liver vitamin A stores only when liver stores are very low. When stores are replete, serum retinol concentrations are homeostatically regulated and do not correlate with liver stores. Because the RBP-retinol complex is released by the liver as part of this homeostatic process, serum RBP correlates closely with serum retinol concentrations, at least in subjects with normal kidney function who are not obese.\" Pg 19S. - \"RBP is not always 100% saturated with retinol; therefore, a 1:1 molecular equivalence between retinol and RBP in the blood does not usually occur. Thus, one cannot generally use the retinol cutoffs for RBP unless liver stores are hypervitaminotic, as discovered in Zambian preschool children (85) in whom the ratio was 1.0 (144). In addition, the added variability in differences in kidney function (e.g., low glomerular filtration rate can cause an increase in RBP but not retinol) among subjects as well as the apparent contribution of adipose tissue to serum RBP (which may not reflect tissue stores in the same way as liver-derived RBP) make it unlikely that the same retinol-RBP correlation that might be observed in 1 population would be appropriate for another. It is possible that certain populations, such as young children not at risk of obesity and with normal kidney function, may be relatively homogeneous with regard to this association, but such associations have not been systematically examined.\" Pg 19S. - See Table 6, Pg 15S, for a list of all vitamin A biomarkers. - \"The main objective of assessing vitamin A status is to determine the magnitude, severity and distribution of VAD in a population. Most surveys assess its prevalence in young children and, with increasing frequency, in pregnant or lactating women, as reported here. Although VAD is likely to be widespread following the preschool years, few data exist to reveal the extent of VAD in school-age and young adolescent children (16). Estimating the national prevalence is to be encouraged as such data aids in targeting regions for interventions, and provides baseline values for monitoring population trends and intervention programme impact over time.

HKI focus its efforts sub-nationally because local level (at state and/or district level) health system performance is key to ensuring high VAS coverage. It also allows HKI to support other health system functions that also improve the delivery of other maternal and child health services. \"In concrete terms, HKI, in consultation with national government counterparts, directs its support to low performing areas to help local program managers identify and solve VAS coverage barriers. This involves organizing workshops with state and district health authorities to analyze what worked and what did not. HKI teams then spend time with health managers to help them identify feasible and cost-effective solutions to improve performance of the targeted services and accompany them through the whole programming cycle (i.e. planning, budgeting, implementation, real time supervision and monitoring, and finally evaluation of the progress made). One cycle sometimes proves insufficient so the HKI teams continue working with each targeted health district until minimum thresholds of performance are met. Funds are used to support deployment of HKI teams in remote areas, to support financing workshops and joint field supervisions, to provide training for field actors, or to organize coverage surveys and review meetings at the end of the exercise. In some cases, HKI provides funds directly to the local authorities to fill financial gaps they may experience ensuring rigorous financial accountability.

The stratification criteria are: the intervention area and the nature of the areas (urban, rural) according to the Charity Response Helen Keller International (HKI) wrote the following in response to GiveWell's [interim review of HKI](https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international/october-2017-version). We have since updated our review of HKI so the below may not fully be up-to-date. Published: November 2017 Helen Keller International (HKI) appreciates GiveWell's invitation to be considered for a top charity recommendation for its vitamin A supplementation program. We have appreciated the transparency and thoroughness of GiveWell's investigative process thus far. We also appreciate being named a standout charity based on the interim review while GiveWell undertakes additional investigation to determine if HKI qualifies as a top-rated charity. We would like to offer the following statements in response to points made in GiveWell's interim review: - Does vitamin A supplementation (VAS) work? This is an important question and one that has received recent attention considering the shifting epidemiologic and programmatic landscape. The epidemiologic landscape has changed since the first VAS trials were published in the early 1990s. Overall, child mortality rates have declined by 49% since 1990 (Unicef 2014), but the rate of decline has been slowest in Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Likewise, the proportionate cause-specific mortality has also changed. In 1990, the three main killers were pneumonia (21% of under-5 mortality; U5MR), diarrhea (20%), and measles (7%) (van den Ent et al 2011), while in 2010 the main killers were pneumonia (18%), diarrhea (11%) and malaria (7%) (Liu L et al 2012). There is no question that in contexts exhibiting public health levels of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and UFMR, VAS (and other interventions that improve the underlying vitamin A status of risk groups) is both sight- and life-saving. This conclusion stems from the results of large, rigorously conducted community trials in South Asia and Africa, which collectively provide incontrovertible evidence that vitamin A interventions, including 6-monthly VAS, reduce early childhood mortality and blindness in undernourished populations (Mayo-Wilson et al 2011). The impact is particularly striking on fatality not only from measles but also from more common diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery and other infectious illnesses. In contexts where uncertainly exists about deficiency and mortality levels (due to the lack of recent data or other reasons) stopping or modifying VAS targets potentially puts children's lives at risk. But even in countries with marked mortality declines and changes in causes of death, one cannot rule out a child survival benefit in many contexts. In all, 54 countries globally had a high U5MR (defined as 50 per 1000 live births) in 2012 (Unicef 2014). A large proportion of these deaths are caused by infections. Furthermore, in these high-mortality countries VAD is also likely to be high (Schultink 2002), thus reinforcing the need to maintain VAS and other vitamin A interventions. Where U5MR, VAD and infectious disease rates are low, the mortality effect of VAS will likely be reduced. Nevertheless, we must bear in mind two important facts (1) the original VAS studies observed mortality impacts in settings with a wide range of mortality and morbidity rates (Beaton et al 1993), and (2) one cannot rule out the role of VAS in helping to bring down U5MR (Bishai et al 2005; Masanja et al 2008). - How to think about the Deworming and Enhanced Vitamin A (DEVTA) program evaluation? GiveWell's report mentions several times the disputed and controversial DEVTA program evaluation study which suffered from important methodological limitations related to supplementation adherence and vital event monitoring systems, as acknowledged by other scientists (Mannar et al 2013; Mayo-Wilson et al 2013; Habicht et al 2013; Sommer et al 2013; Sloan et al 2013). In addition to weighing the methodological flaws of DEVTA, we feel the results of the DEVTA study should be viewed within the context of the larger body of evidence on VAS and child survival. Recently, the WHO examined evidence from all 17 trials (11 in Asia, 5 in Africa and 1 in Latin America) conducted to date for all-cause mortality. Findings revealed that VAS reduces the overall risk of death by 24% (risk ratio (RR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.83). When adding the DEVTA findings to the analysis, the all-cause mortality benefit of VAS remained statistically and clinically significant at 12% (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.84-0.94) (Mayo-Wilson et al 2011) - The current best evidence indicates that VAD remains prevalent in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, but there is a need for more current, reliable and valid estimates of VAD prevalence. GiveWell raises the question, \"How prevalent is vitamin A deficiency in areas where HKI works?\". While HKI recognizes the urgent need for updated and valid estimates of vitamin A status in the countries and sub-regions where we work, HKI relies on the best available evidence from scientific sources to ensure that its VAS programs are targeting at risk populations. The most recent global and region-specific estimates of VA deficiency prevalence come from a pooled analysis of population-based surveys from 138 low- and middle-income countries between 1991 and 2013 and published in the Lancet Global Health Journal in 2015. In this publication, the authors estimated the prevalence of deficiency in 2013 to be highest in sub-Saharan Africa (48%) and south Asia (44%) (Stevens et al 2015). Region and country-specific VAD prevalence estimates should be updated as new data become available. Currently, many countries implementing VAS programs have no VAD data or the data do exist are >10 years old (Wirth et al 2017). Clearly, there is an urgent need to fill this data gap and for funders and host-country governments to invest in high-quality surveys to assess VA (and other micronutrient) status and program coverage in children. - Achieving and sustaining high VAS coverage through HKI's technical assistance. We provided GiveWell with evidence from two countries (Cameroon and Kenya) which demonstrated that HKI's technical assistance contributed to significantly higher coverage rates. We appreciate GiveWell's desire to understand HKI's added value by assessing VAS program performance using a counterfactual paradigm. Unfortunately, due to the lack of funding in Mali and Cote d'Ivoire in 2017, HKI has been unable to provide VAS technical support to either country providing counterfactual examples. Sadly, both countries missed a VAS distribution round in the first semester of 2017 suggesting that in the absence of HKI's support the VAS programs in both countries were negatively affected. During their planned country visit, we encourage GiveWell to look further into the added value HKI provides to VAS coverage. - Cost per supplement delivered and cost-effectiveness of VAS. We feel it is important to note that VAS often serves as the driver behind Child Health Days (CHDs) and Child Health Weeks onto which other vital health and nutrition services (such as deworming, measles immunization, distribution of insecticide-treated bednets, screening for acute malnutrition, and others) are piggy-backed. For example, CHDs delivered nearly half of all global deworming treatments to preschool children in 2013, thus illustrating the strategic importance of this delivery mechanism for attaining high coverage of vital services targeting preschool-age children (Kumapley et al 2015). The design of CHDs and the package of interventions offered can be tailored to the local contexts; and in fragile health systems, CHDs serve as a major delivery platform for high-impact interventions targeted to preschool age children. Because the semi-annual delivery of VAS to preschool children is often the main driver behind CHDs, we feel it is important for cost per supplement delivered and cost-effectiveness models to consider these added benefits. The CHD delivery platform was largely propelled by the need to reach preschool-age children twice each year with a large dose of vitamin A. - Questions that need more information. HKI appreciates the rigor that GiveWell applies to organizations that are being considered for \"top charity\" selection. GiveWell's interim report identifies many remaining questions related to VAS and HKI that it hopes to answer or about which it wants to develop a deeper understanding. Some of these questions will require investments in new data collection. For example, the only way to assess levels of VA deficiency or U5MR in countries or sub-regions where HKI works is to measure these using reliable and valid methods. In low-resource and low-capacity settings, this will require significant investment by the global community and should be done. It is even more difficult to answer the question about the expected child survival impact of VAS given the changing epidemiologic landscape, especially since conducting placebo-controlled trials to address this question would be unethical given the weight of evidence of the benefit of VAS. HKI's view is to trust the scientific community's best estimates of benefit based on thoughtful and systematic meta-analyses. HKI keeps abreast of new scientific evidence as it emerges. If and when estimates of benefit are revised, HKI will revise impact expectations and program approaches. The question of HKI's added value with respect to VAS programs is, in our view clear. HKI remains a global leader, innovator, advocate and technical support to VAS programs in countries and contexts where VAS should remain a priority intervention. We look forward to GiveWell's site visits so they can learn more about the important role HKI has provided to VAS programs especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and the support it wishes to continue to provide until the scourge caused by VAD no longer plagues vulnerable populations. VAD will not disappear until vulnerable populations have achieved normal vitamin A status by sustained changes in dietary vitamin A intake. HKI strives to improve the diets through its fortification, nutrition education and food production programs. Until the time when the diets of vulnerable populations are replete with adequate intake of vitamin A, HKI believes periodic high-dose vitamin A has a vital public health role in protecting child health and survival, and thus remains committed to this sight- and life-saving intervention.
