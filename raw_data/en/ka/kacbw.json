The basis of the blend is the Ternatus clitoria - a plant that is called a blue matcha for a reason. Its colour is as intense as its effect. Clitoria boosts energy, helps maintain focus and prevents mood swings. There is also Siberian ginseng, which is invaluable when it comes to removing all signs of fatigue. Liquorice and pomegranate blossom provide a unique aroma and have a strong energising effect, as does the ayurveda-prized bertram, which helps you to stay cheerful in any situation!
