The American Academy ofPediatrics recommends routine immunization of infants with 3 doses of pentava-lent rotavirus vaccine administered orally at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The rstdose should be administered between 6 and 12 weeks of age; immunization shouldnot be initiated for infants older than 12 weeks of age. Subsequent doses should beadministered at 4- to 10-week intervals, and all 3 doses of vaccine should beadministered by 32 weeks of age. Pentavalent rotavirus vaccine can be coadmin-istered with other childhood vaccines. Pentavalent rotavirus vaccine is contrain-dicated for infants with a serious allergic reaction to any vaccine component or toa previous dose of vaccine. PURPOSE OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND RATIONALE The purpose of this statement is to provide the rationale and recommendations foruse of a bovine-based pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq) in US infants. Therationale for using rotavirus immunization for prevention or modication ofrotavirus disease is based on several considerations. First, rates of rotavirus illnessamong children in industrialized and less developed countries are similar, indicat-ing that clean water supplies and good hygiene have little effect on virus trans-mission, so further improvements in water or hygiene are unlikely to prevent thedisease. 1-5Second, in the United States, a high level of rotavirus morbidity con- tinues to occur despite currently available therapies. For example, the rate ofhospitalizations for gastroenteritis in young children declined only 16% from 1979to 1995 6,7despite the widespread recommendation by experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), 8,9for the use of oral rehydration solutions in the treatment of dehydrating gastroenteritis. Third, studies of natural rotavirus infection indicatethat initial infection protects against subsequent severe gastroenteritis, althoughsubsequent asymptomatic infections and mild disease might still occur. 1,10,11 Fi- nally, trials of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in the United States and 10 othercountries show efcacy rates of 98% for prevention of severe illness and 74% forprevention of rotavirus-induced diarrheal episodes of any severity. 12These results are similar to the protection observed after natural rotavirus infection. Thus,immunization early in life, which mimics a child's rst natural infection, will notprevent all subsequent disease but should prevent most cases of severe rotaviruswww.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/ peds.2006-3134 doi:10.1542/peds.2006-3134All policy statements from the American Academy of Pediatrics automaticallyexpire 5 years after publication unlessreafrmed, revised, or retired at orbefore that time.

This statement provides recommendations regarding the use of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in infants in theUnited States. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DISEASE Rotavirus is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in theUnited States and infects almost all children in the rst 3to 5 years of life, with severe, dehydrating gastroenteritisoccurring primarily among children 3 to 35 months ofage. In the rst 5 years of life, 4 of 5 children in theUnited States will develop rotavirus gastroenteritis, 1,4,131 in 7 will require a clinic or emergency department visit,1 in 70 will be hospitalized, and 1 in 200 000 will die asa result of this disease. 14,15 In the United States, rotaviruses are proven to be responsible for only 5% to 10% of all gastroenteritisepisodes among children younger than 5 years. How-ever, infection with rotavirus results in more severedisease than with other pathogens that cause gastroen-teritis and, thus, accounts for a higher proportion ofsevere gastroenteritis episodes that require outpatient orhospital visits. 16,17For example, rotavirus is responsible for 30% to 50% of pediatric admissions to hospitalsbecause of gastroenteritis and 20% to 25% of cases ofpediatric gastroenteritis in outpatient clinics. 18-21During peak rotavirus season, the virus may be the cause ofmore than 70% of inpatient pediatric admissions forgastrointestinal illness. 7Rotavirus is also an important cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea in children22,23and is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in children whoattend child care. 24-26 In the United States, rotavirus causes yearly epidem- ics of disease from late fall to early spring. The peak ofdisease varies by region. In the Southwest, the peakrotavirus season is November through December. Thepeak of the epidemic then travels sequentially across theUnited States from west to east, concluding in Aprilthrough May in the Northeast. 6,27,28 Multiple serotypes of rotavirus are in circulation. Se- rotype is dened by 2 surface proteins: VP7, the glyco-protein (G protein), and VP4, the protease-cleaved pro-tein (P protein), which induce neutralizing antibodies. Atyping system has been developed for each protein. 29Ten G serotypes and 11 P serotypes identied 30Recently, previ- serotypes, such as G9, have emerged. Pre-dominant serotypes vary from year to year and region toregion. Rotavirus is transmitted from person to person pri- marily by the fecal-oral route. Children shed more than100 billion virus particles per gram of stool during theacute illness. 31,32Shedding may occur before the devel-opment of symptoms and can persist for as long as 10 days after the onset of symptoms in immunocompetenthosts. 33Spread of rotavirus infections within families is common. Of the adult contacts of infected infants, 30%to 50% become infected, although most are asymptom-atic. 34,35 Clinical Manifestations of DiseaseAfter an incubation period of 1 to 3 days, rotavirusgastroenteritis begins with acute onset of fever and vom-iting followed 24 to 48 hours later by watery diarrhea. 36 Typically, there are 10 to 20 bowel movements per day.Symptoms generally persist for 3 to 8 days. Fever occursin up to half of all infected children and is usually lowgrade, although up to one third of patients may have atemperature higher than 39\u00b0C. Vomiting is nonbiliousand occurs in 80% to 90% of infected children. Vomitingis usually brief and lasts 24 hours or less in most chil-dren. Dehydration and electrolyte disturbances are themajor sequelae of rotavirus infection and occur mostoften in the youngest children. 37,38Rotavirus infection is usually localized to the intestine, but rarely, involve-ment of extraintestinal sites (including the respiratorytract, liver, kidney, lymph nodes, and central nervoussystem) has been reported. 39-42 In immunocompetent children, disease tends to be most severe in those who are between 3 and 24 monthsof age, although 25% of cases of severe disease occurafter 2 years of age. 7Patients with immunodeciency, including those with HIV infection, solid organ or bonemarrow transplantation, and natural killer cell de-ciency, may suffer more severe or prolonged diar-rhea. 43-46 Most children are infected with rotavirus more than once. First infections are more likely to result in severegastroenteritis than are subsequent infections. Protectiveimmunity develops after rotavirus infection and is stron-gest against moderate-to-severe disease. 1Subsequent in- fections are usually milder or may even be asymptom-atic. Adults usually have asymptomatic or mild diseasebecause of immunity from previous exposure. 34,35 Most mothers have rotavirus antibody from previous infection that is passed transplacentally, protecting theneonate. As a result, most infected neonates will haveasymptomatic or mild disease. 11An exception is the pre- term infant, who is at greater risk of severe illness thanthe term infant because of the lack of transplacentalmaternal antibodies. 47 Because the clinical features and stool characteristics of diarrhea caused by rotavirus are nonspecic, conr-mation of the diagnosis of rotavirus infection in childrenwith diarrhea by laboratory testing is necessary in someclinical settings and for surveillance. The most fre-quently used method is antigen detection in stool byenzyme immunoassay (EIA) directed at a group antigencommon to all group A rotaviruses, including those in 172 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICSthe rotavirus vaccine. Stool specimens from less than 10% of children immunized with rotavirus vaccine maytest positive by EIA for up to 2 weeks after the rstimmunization. Positive stool EIA test results are unlikelyafter subsequent doses. Vaccine Description The licensed pentavalent rotavirus vaccine is an oralvaccine that contains 5 live reassortant rotaviruses. Therotavirus parent strains of the reassortants were isolatedfrom human and bovine hosts. Four reassortant rotavi-ruses express 1 of the outer capsid proteins (G1, G2, G3,or G4) from the human rotavirus strain and theattachment protein (P7[5]) from the bovine rotavirusparent strain. The fth reassortant virus expresses theattachment protein (P1A[8]) from the human rotavirusparent strain and the outer capsid protein G6 from thebovine rotavirus parent strain. The reassortants in Vero cells by using standard tissue-culturetechniques. The reassortants are suspended in a buffered stabilizer solution. Each vaccine dose contains sucrose, serum. There are no pre-servatives or thimerosal. Immunogenicity The immune correlates of protection from rotavirus in-fection and disease are not fully understood. In a largephase III clinical trial (see Appendix 1 for denitions ofstudy phases) of rotavirus group-specic serum immu-noglobulin A antibodies was used the measuresof the immunogenicity of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine.Serum samples were obtained from a subset of studyparticipants before immunization and approximately 2weeks after the third dose, and seroconversion was de-ned as a threefold or greater increase in antibody titerfrom baseline. Seroconversion rates for immunoglobulinA antibody to rotavirus were 95% among 189 vaccinerecipients versus 14% in 161 recipients of the placebo. 12 When administered simultaneously, a 3-dose series of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine does not diminish the im-mune response to type b in (DTaP) vaccine. 48Because validation of the pertussis assays is still under review,insufcient immunogenicity data are available to con-rm lack of interference when pentavalent rotavirusvaccine is administered concomitantly with childhoodvaccines to prevent pertussis.Efcacy The efcacy of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine has beenevaluated in 2 phase III trials. 12,49 In these trials, the efcacy of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine after comple-tion of a 3-dose regimen against rotavirus gastroenteritisof any severity was 74% and against severe rotavirusgastroenteritis was 98% (Table 1). 2),but relatively few non-G1 rotavirus cases were In a large study, 12the efcacy of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in reducing the number visits for rota-virus gastroenteritis was evaluated among 5673 subjectsand in reducing the number of emergency departmentvisits and hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritisamong 68 038 subjects over the rst 2 years of life.Pentavalent rotavirus vaccine reduced the incidence ofofce visits by 86%, emergency department visits by94%, and hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis by96% (Table 3). was 59%. efcacy of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in second rotavirus season after immunization was 63%against rotavirus gastroenteritis of any severity and 88%against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. 12 Data on the efcacy of fewer than 3 doses of pentava- lent rotavirus vaccine are limited. In a large study, theefcacy of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in reducing thenumber of emergency department visits and hospitaliza-tions for rotavirus gastroenteritis was evaluated in chil-dren receiving fewer than 3 doses of vaccine. 50Although the study included more than 68 000 children, the num-ber receiving fewer than 3 doses of vaccine or placebowas less than 8600. In an analysis that assessed vaccineefcacy starting 14 days after each dose and includingbreakthrough cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis betweendoses, the estimated rate reduction in hospitalizationsand emergency department visits of 1, 2, and 3 doses ofvaccine in this study was 83%, 81%, and 95%, respec-tively. Neither breastfeeding nor concurrent administration of other childhood vaccines seems to diminish the ef-cacy of a 3-dose series of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine(Merck & Co Inc, unpublished born preterm b 1 57 98.2 89.6-100.0 aPer protocol population (includes only cases that occurred at least 14 days after dose 3). bSeverity score /H1102216, as determined by the scoring system of Clark et al.58 PEDIATRICS Volume 119, Number 1, January 2007 173tion), the point estimate of vaccine efcacy against G1 through G4 rotavirus gastroenteritis of any with that among nonpreterm infants (70%),but the condence bounds included 0 because of thesmall sample size (Merck & Co Inc, unpublished data,2005). Safety Intussusception Safety with respect to intussusception was evaluated in 71 725 subjects enrolled in phase III efcacy trials. Ina large-scale safety and efcacy trial designed specicallyto evaluate the risk of intussusception, 12parents or legal guardians of all subjects were contacted by telephone orhome visit on approximately days 7, 14, and 42 aftereach immunization and every 6 weeks thereafter for upto 1 year after the rst dose. Parents were asked about allserious adverse experiences, including intussusception,among enrolled children. Potential intussusception caseswere adjudicated according to a prespecied case deni-tion surgical, and autopsycriteria. For the prespecied 42-day postimmunizationend point, 6 cases of intussusception were observed in the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine group versus 5 cases ofintussusception in the placebo group (multiplicity-ad-justed relative risk: 1.6). The data did not suggest anincreased risk of intussusception relative to placebo.Among vaccine recipients, there were no conrmedcases of intussusception within the 42-day period afterthe rst dose, which was the period of highest risk forthe previously licensed rhesus-human rotavirus reassor-tant-tetravalent (RRV-TV) vaccine (Table 4). addition,no evidence of clustering of cases of intussusception wasobserved within a 7- or 14-day window after immuni-zation for any dose. For the 1-year follow-up period afteradministration of the rst dose, 13 cases of intussuscep-tion were observed in the pentavalent rotavirus vaccinegroup versus 15 cases of intussusception in the placebogroup (multiplicity-adjusted relative risk: 0.9). Other Adverse Events Serious adverse events and deaths were evaluated in 71 725 infants enrolled in phase III trials (Table 5).Among pentavalent rotavirus vaccine and placebo recip-ients, the incidence of serious adverse events, includingdeaths, was similar. No deaths were attributed to immu-nization by blinded investigators. The most commoncause of death (accounting for 17 of the 52 deaths) wassudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and deaths fromSIDS were equally distributed among pentavalent rota-virus vaccine and placebo recipients ( N/H110058 and 9, re- spectively). A subset of 11 722 subjects was studied in detail to assess other potential adverse experiences such asfever, diarrhea, and vomiting. In the 42-day period afterimmunization, vaccine recipients had a small but sig-nicantly ( P/H11021.05) greater rate of several symptoms compared with placebo recipients, including 1% excessof vomiting (15% vs rotavirus vaccine placebo recipients, theincidence of reported episodes of fever (43% vs 43%, re-spectively) hematochezia (0.5% vs 0.3%, respectively)was In the 7-day period after immunization, vaccine re- cipients had a small but signicantly Gastroenteritis 3 Efcacy of Pentavalent Rotavirus Vaccine in Reducing Health Care Utilization for G1 through G4 RotavirusGastroenteritis Type of Contact No. of Casesa IntervalVaccine Placebo 86.0 73.9-92.5 aPer-protocol population (includes only cases that occurred at least 14 days after dose 3). bN/H1100534 035 vaccine recipients and 34 003 placebo recipients. cN/H110052834 vaccine recipients and 2839 placebo recipients.

The incidence of feverand irritability during the 7-day period after any vaccinedose was similar among pentavalent rotavirus vaccineand placebo recipients. Safety in Preterm Infants weeks]) in the phase III trials. Allpreterm infants were monitored for severe adverseevents, and a subset of 308 was monitored in detail forall adverse events. No cases of intussusception werereported among preterm Among preterm infantsgiven pentavalent of serious adverse events (5.5% vs 5.8%, re-spectively) was similar. Two deaths each were reportedamong preterm infants who were given pentavalent ro-tavirus vaccine (1 SIDS and 1 motor vehicle crash) andplacebo (1 SIDS and 1 unknown cause). Shedding and Transmission of Vaccine Strains Fecal shedding of vaccine virus was evaluated by EIA in a subset of subjects enrolled in the phase III trials byobtaining a single stool sample during days 4 to 6 aftereach immunization visit and among all children whosubmitted a rotavirus antigen-positive stool specimen atany time. Vaccine virus was shed in 32 (8.9%) of 360subjects after dose 1, 0 (0%) of 249 subjects after dose 2,and 1 (0.3%) of 385 subjects after dose 3. In phase IIIstudies, shedding was observed as early as 1 day and aslate as 15 days after a dose. The potential for transmis-sion of vaccine virus was not assessed through epidemi-ologic studies. Cost-effectiveness In a recent analysis that used current estimates of rota-virus disease burden, vaccine efcacy, vaccine coveragerates, and health costs, investigators estimated that anational rotavirus immunization program in which 3 doses of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine are administeredat ages 2, 4, and 6 months would result in 255 000 fewerphysician visits, 137 000 fewer emergency departmentvisits, 44 000 fewer hospitalizations, and 13 fewer deathsper year in children younger than 5 years. From thehealth care perspective alone, immunization is likely tobe cost-saving at total cost per child (including adminis-tration costs) of up to $66 per child (approximately $22per vaccine dose). A higher-priced vaccine would beincreasingly unlikely to be cost-saving, and at a cost ofmore than $268 per child (approximately $89 per dose),a rotavirus immunization program would most likelyhave a net cost to society (CDC, unpublished data,2006). Vaccine Administration and Storage Pentavalent rotavirus vaccine is provided in a squeez-able-plastic dosing tube with a twist-off cap designed toallow for the vaccine to be administered directly to in-fants by mouth. Each tube contains a single 2-mL dose ofthe vaccine as a liquid buffered-stabilized solution that ispale yellow in color but may have a pink tint. Thisformulation protects the vaccine virus from gastric acidand stabilizes the vaccine, which allows for storage atrefrigerator temperatures (2-8\u00b0C) for 24 months. Pen-tavalent rotavirus vaccine should be administered assoon as possible after being removed from refrigeration.For information on stability under conditions other thanthose recommended, call 800-637-2590. Contraindications and Precautions Contraindications Serious Allergic Reaction to a Vaccine Component or a Previous Vaccine Dose Pentavalent rotavirus vaccine should not be adminis- tered to infants who have severe hypersensitivity to anycomponent of the vaccine or who have experienced aserious allergic reaction to a previous dose of pentava-lent rotavirus vaccine (recommendation; evidence gradeD; expert opinion [see Appendices 2 and 3]). Precautions Altered Immunocompetence Practitioners should consider the potential risks and benets of administering rotavirus vaccine to infantswith known or suspected altered immunocompetence(recommendation; evidence grade D; expert opinion).Children and adults who are immunocompromised be-cause of congenital immunodeciency, bone marrowtransplantation, or solid organ transplantation some-times experience severe, prolonged, and even fatal rota-virus gastroenteritis. However, no safety or efcacy dataare available for the administration of rotavirus vaccine TABLE 5 Summary of Serious Adverse Events Within 42 Days of Any Dose No. (%) of Subjects Vaccine Placebo No SAEs 35 289 (97.6) 34 614 (97.4) ( /H110210.1) 13 ( /H110210.1) Discontinued because of an SAE 83 (0.2) 72 (0.2) SAE indicates serious adverse event.

Moderate-to-Severe Acute Gastroenteritis In usual circumstances, pentavalent rotavirus vaccine should not be administered to infants with acute, mod-erate-to-severe gastroenteritis until the condition im-proves (recommendation; evidence grade D; expertopinion). However, infants with mild acute gastroenter-itis can be immunized, particularly if the delay in immu-nization may be substantial and might make the childineligible to receive vaccine (eg, older than 12 weeks ofage before immunization is initiated). Pentavalent rotavirus vaccine has not been studied among infants with concurrent acute gastroenteritis,among whom its immunogenicity and efcacy theoret-ically can be compromised. For example, infants whoreceived oral poliovirus vaccine during an episode ofacute gastroenteritis, in some instances, had diminishedpoliovirus antibody responses to oral poliovirus. Moderate-to-Severe Febrile Illness Infants with moderate-to-severe illness should be im- munized as soon as they have recovered from the acutephase of the illness (recommendation; evidence grade D;expert opinion). This precaution avoids superimposingadverse effects of the vaccine on the underlying illness ormistakenly attributing a manifestation of the underlyingillness to the vaccine. Preexisting Chronic Gastrointestinal Disease Practitioners should consider the potential risks and benets of administering pentavalent rotavirus vaccineto expert opin- ion). Infants with preexisting chronic gastrointestinalconditions and who are not undergoing immunosup-pressive therapy should benet from pentavalent rota-virus vaccine immunization, and the benets outweighthe theoretical risks. However, the safety and efcacy ofpentavalent rotavirus vaccine have not been (eg, con-genital disease,short-gut vomiting of unknowncause). Previous History of Intussusception After administration of a previously licensed rotavirus vaccine (RRV-TV), an increased risk of intussusceptionwas observed. Available prelicensure data from a largetrial of 70 000 infants show no evidence of an associa-tion between intussusception and pentavalent rotavirusvaccine. However, additional postlicensure surveillancedata are required to conrm that the vaccine is notassociated with intussusception at a lower rate than therate that would have been detected in prelicensure trials.In addition, some data suggest that infants with a historyof intussusception may be at higher risk of a repeatepisode than other infants. Therefore, until postlicensuredata on safety of rotavirus vaccine are available, the risksand benets of immunization should be consideredwhen immunizing infants with a previous episode ofintussusception (recommendation; evidence grade D;expert opinion). RECOMMENDATIONS Routine Immunization With Pentavalent Rotavirus Vaccine Infants should receive 3 doses of pentavalent rotavirusvaccine administered orally at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.The rst dose should be administered between 6 and 12weeks of age (ie, on or before 12 weeks 0 days of age).Subsequent doses should be administered at 4- to 10-week intervals, and all 3 doses of vaccine should beadministered by 32 weeks of age (ie, on or before 32weeks 0 days) (strong recommendation; evidence gradeA; well-designed randomized, controlled trials). Immunization should not be initiated for infants older than 12 weeks because of insufcient data on safety ofthe rst dose of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in olderinfants (recommendation; evidence grade D; expertopinion). Vaccine should not be administered after 32 weeks of age because of insufcient data on the safety and efcacyof pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in infants after this age(recommendation; evidence grade D; expert opinion).Adverse events, such as fever, were substantially higherin children who initiated or completed the RRV-TV vac-cine series after 6 months of age. 51-53 For infants in whom the rst dose of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine is inadvertently administered off label 176 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICSat 13 weeks of age or older, the rest of the rotavirus immunization series should be completed per the sched-ule dened above, because timing of the rst doseshould not affect the safety and efcacy of the secondand third dose (recommendation; evidence grade D; ex-pert opinion). Infants documented to have had rotavirus gastroen- teritis before receiving the full course of rotavirus im-munizations should still initiate or complete the 3-doseschedule because the initial infection frequently pro-vides only partial immunity (recommendation; evidencegrade D; expert opinion). Infants who are being breastfed can receive pentava- lent rotavirus vaccine. The efcacy of pentavalent rota-virus vaccine is similar among breastfed and nonbreast-fed infants (strong recommendation; evidence grade A;well-designed randomized, controlled trials). Like other childhood vaccines, pentavalent rotavirus vaccine can be administered to infants with transient,mild illnesses, with or without low-grade fever 54(recom- mendation; evidence grade D; expert opinion). Simultaneous Administration With Other Childhood Vaccines Pentavalent rotavirus vaccine can be administered to-gether with DTaP, Hib, IPV, hepatitis B, and pneumo-coccal conjugate vaccines. Available evidence suggeststhat the vaccine does not interfere with the immuneresponse to the Hib, IPV, hepatitis B, and pneumococcalconjugate vaccines and the diphtheria and tetanus anti-gens in insufcient immunogenicity data are of immune responseswhen pentavalent rotavirus vaccine is administered con-comitantly with childhood vaccines to prevent pertussis(recommendation; evidence grade D; expert opinion). Special Situations Preterm Infants (Those Born at Less Than 37 Weeks' Gestation) Practitioners should consider the potential benets andrisks of immunizing preterm infants against rotavirus.Limited data suggest that preterm infants are at in-creased risk of hospitalization from viral gastroenteritisduring their rst year of life. 47In clinical trials, the safety and efcacy of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine seem to besimilar for preterm and term infants, although a rela-tively small number of preterm infants have been eval-uated. The lower concentration of maternal antibody torotaviruses in very low birth weight, preterm infantstheoretically could increase the risk of adverse reactionsfrom pentavalent rotavirus vaccine. The AAP supportsimmunization of preterm infants under the followingconditions: the infant is at least 6 weeks of age, the infantis clinically stable, and the rst dose of vaccine is given atthe time of discharge or after the infant has been dis-charged from the hospital nursery. Until further data are available, the AAP considers the benets of pentavalentrotavirus vaccine immunization of preterm infants tooutweigh the theoretical risks (recommendation; evi-dence grade B; randomized, controlled with minorlimitations). Exposure of Immunocompromised Persons to Immunized InfantsInfants living in households with persons who have orare suspected of having an immunodeciency disorderor impaired immune status can be immunized (recom-mendation; evidence grade D; expert opinion). Mostexperts believe that the protection of the immunocom-promised household member afforded by immunizationof young children in the household outweighs the smallrisk of transmitting vaccine virus to the immunocom-promised household member and any subsequent theo-retical risk of vaccine virus-associated disease. To mini-mize potential virus transmission, persons havingcontact with the feces of the immunized infant (eg, afterchanging a diaper) should use measures such as goodhand-washing for at least 1 week after the rst dose ofpentavalent rotavirus vaccine. Exposure of Pregnant Women to Immunized Infants Infants living in households with pregnant women canbe immunized (recommendation; evidence grade D; ex-pert opinion). Most women of childbearing age wouldhave preexisting immunity to rotavirus, so the risk ofinfection and disease from potential exposure to theattenuated vaccine virus strain is very low. In addition,immunization of young children would decrease poten-tial exposure of the pregnant women to wild virus if theunimmunized infant suffers from rotavirus gastroenter-itis. Regurgitation of Vaccine The practitioner should not readminister a dose of pen-tavalent rotavirus vaccine to an infant who regurgitates,spits out, or vomits during or after administration ofvaccine (recommendation; evidence grade D; expertopinion). The infant can receive the remaining recom-mended doses of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine at theappropriate intervals. Data are limited regarding thesafety of administering a dose of pentavalent rotavirusvaccine higher than the recommended dose and on theefcacy of administering a partial dose. Additional dataon safety and efcacy are needed to evaluate the benetsand risks of readministration. Hospitalization After Immunization If a recently immunized child is hospitalized for anyreason, no precautions other than standard precautionsneed be taken to prevent the spread of vaccine virus inthe hospital setting (recommendation; evidence grade D;expert opinion). PEDIATRICS Volume 119, Number 1, January 2007 177Reporting Adverse Events Any clinically signicant or unexpected adverse eventsthat occur after administration of rotavirus vaccineshould be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Report-ing System (VAERS). The National Childhood VaccineInjury Act requires health care professionals to report toVAERS any event listed (1) by the vaccine manufactureras a contraindication to subsequent doses of the vaccineor (2) in the table of reportable events following vacci-nation (see http://vaers.hhs.gov/reportable.htm) thatoccurs within the specied time period after immuniza-tion. Pentavalent rotavirus vaccine is covered under thegeneral category of rotavirus vaccines in the table ofreportable events, and no specic conditions are listedfor reporting. VAERS reporting forms and information canbe requested 24 hours a day by calling 800-822-7967 or byaccessing the VAERS Web site at http://vaers.hhs.gov. Enhanced Postlicensure Surveillance for Adverse Events In prelicensure clinical trials, pentavalent rotavirus vac-cine has not been associated with any serious adverseevents, including intussusception. Nevertheless, contin-ued monitoring for adverse events after introduction ofpentavalent rotavirus vaccine into routine immuniza-tion programs is important, particularly in light of theprevious experience with RRV-TV vaccine. In addition tomanufacturer-sponsored phase IV studies, postlicensuremonitoring will include enhanced review of adverseevents reported to VAERS. The Vaccine Safety Datalink(VSD) will also be used to monitor intussusception riskassociated with pentavalent rotavirus vaccine and toevaluate any other possible associations that may beidentied through VAERS or in phase IV studies. TheVSD project includes information on persons enrolled in8 large health maintenance organizations, with an an-nual birth cohort of more than 90 000 infants. Data onall vaccines administered within the study populationare recorded and linked with diagnoses from medicalencounters to determine rates of potential adverseevents that result from immunization. Recently devel-oped rapid-analysis methods allow the VSD to conductnear \"real-time\" monitoring for vaccine adverse events. Given the background rate of natural intussusception among US infants (25-38 cases per 100 000 infants) andthe large number of children who potentially are eligiblefor immunization, some intussusceptions are expectedto occur in the 2-week period after immunization bychance alone that will be unrelated to the vaccine. Con-sequently, intensive postlicensure surveillance will benecessary to assess the safety of pentavalent rotavirusvaccine against this rare event. Future Needs Surveillance of Rotavirus Gastroenteritis Rotavirus gastroenteritis is not a reportable disease in theUnited States, and testing for rotavirus infection is notalways performed when a child seeks medical care for acute gastroenteritis. Establishing rotavirus disease sur-veillance systems that are adequately sensitive and spe-cic to document the effectiveness of immunization pro-grams will be necessary. Current national surveillancesystems for rotavirus infections include (1) review ofnational hospital discharge databases for rotavirus-spe-cic or rotavirus-compatible diagnoses, (2) reports ofrotavirus isolation from a sentinel system of laboratories,and (3) surveillance in 3 sites that participate in the NewVaccine Surveillance Network. At state and local levels,additional surveillance efforts\u2014by enhanced surveil-lance at sentinel hospitals or review of hospital dischargedatabases\u2014will be necessary to monitor the effectivenessof the vaccine program. Special studies (eg, case-controlstudies) will be needed to conrm the effectiveness ofpentavalent rotavirus vaccine in routine programmaticuse. Detection of Unusual Strains of Rotavirus A national strain-surveillance system of sentinel labora-tories has been established at the CDC to monitor theprevalence of rotavirus strains before and after the in-troduction of rotavirus vaccines. This system is designedto detect new or unusual strains that might not be ef-fectively prevented by immunization and affect the suc-cess of the immunization program. Research Future research should include studies to determine thesafety and efcacy of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine ad-ministered to preterm infants, infants with immunedeciencies, infants who live in households with immu-nocompromised persons, and infants with chronic gas-trointestinal disease. Postlicensure studies also should beconducted to determine the relative efcacy of fewerthan 3 doses of vaccine and to address the cost-effective-ness of immunization programs in various settings. Introduction of Additional Rotavirus Vaccines A efcacy and, in a trial of more than60 000 infants, no increase in intussusception amongvaccine recipients compared with placebo recipients. 55 As of August 2006, RotaRix was licensed in the Euro-pean Union and 33 countries in Latin America, Africa,and Asia, but a licensure application has not yet beensubmitted in the United States. Factors That May Influence Vaccine Acceptance The success of a rotavirus immunization program de-pends on the acceptance and enthusiasm of physiciansand other health care professionals who care for childrenand caregivers of infants. In light of the experience withthe withdrawal of RRV-TV vaccine because of its associ- 178 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICSation with intussusception, some health care profession- als and parents might have concerns about immuniza-tion with pentavalent rotavirus vaccine. However, in astudy by Iwamoto et al, 5694% of surveyed pediatricians reported that they would use a new rotavirus vaccine ifit proved to be safer than RRV-TV vaccine and wasrecommended by the AAP and CDC for routine useamong infants. Barriers to reintroducing a rotavirus vac-cine were fear of adverse reactions among 95% of pedi-atricians, followed by potential high vaccine cost (63%)and amount of time required to educate parents (57%). Immunization program personnel will benet from education about rotavirus disease and rotavirus vaccine.Parental education on rotavirus gastroenteritis and onthe vaccine also will be essential for establishing andmaintaining public condence in this vaccine and avoid-ing confusion by cases of gastroenteritis in early child-hood that result from nonrotaviral causes that are notpreventable by pentavalent rotavirus vaccine.

Safety, efcacy, and immunogenicity of a live, quadrivalent human-bovine reassor-tant APPENDIX 1: DEFINITIONS OF STUDY PHASE Most clinical trials are designated as phase I, II, or III onthe basis of the type of questions that study is seeking toanswer: In phase I clinical trials, researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people (20-80) for therst time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dos- age range, and identify adverse effects. In phase II clinical trials, the study drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people (100-300) todetermine if it is effective and to further evaluate itssafety. In phase III studies, the study drug or treatment is given to large groups of people (1000-3000) to con-rm its effectiveness, monitor adverse effects, com-pare it with commonly used treatments, and collectinformation that will allow the drug or treatment to beused safely. These phases are dened by the Food and Drug Ad- ministration in the Code of Federal Regulations. APPENDIX 2 Guideline Denitions for Evidence-Based Statements Statement Type Denition Implication Strong recommendation The subcommittee believes that the benets of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or that the harms clearly exceed the benets inthe case of a strong negative recommendation) and that the quality of thesupporting evidence is excellent (grade A or B). aIn some clearly identied circumstances, strong recommendations may be made on the basis oflesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain andthe anticipated benets strongly outweigh the harms.Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for analternative approach is present. Recommendation The subcommittee believes that the benets exceed the harms (or that the harms exceed the benets in the case of a negative recommendation), butthe quality of evidence is not as strong (grade B or C). aIn some clearly identied circumstances, recommendations may be made on the basis oflesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain andthe anticipated benets outweigh the harms.Clinicians also should generally follow a recommendation but remain alert to newinformation and sensitive to patient preferences. Option Either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (grade D) aor well- performed studies (grade A, B, or C)ashow little clear advantage to one approach versus another.Clinicians should be flexible in their decision-making regarding appropriate practice, although theymay set boundaries on alternatives; patientpreference should have a substantial influencingrole. No recommendation There is both a lack of pertinent evidence (grade D) aand an unclear balance between benets and harms.Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision-making and be alert to new publishedevidence that claries the balance of benetversus harm; patient preference should have asubstantial influencing role.
