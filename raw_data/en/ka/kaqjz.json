While current primary care model is based on \"medicating\" most of chronic medical conditions without addressing the cause, we offer an alternative. All our methods are centered around identifying and treating the cause of a patient's problems. In addition, during the past 15 years we have developed clinically effective way of implementing truly preventive programs to maintain patients' health. The detailed list of conditions we treat is by no means complete, but rather is a comprehensive example of the conditions for which we found integrative approaches to be effective. We do address a variety of acute medical problems in a holistic way and with minimal use of medications. However, we value the effectiveness of conventional medicine in addressing many acute medical problems and work closely with the George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates and the GW Hospital to assure that our patients have quick and easy access to lifesaving services.
