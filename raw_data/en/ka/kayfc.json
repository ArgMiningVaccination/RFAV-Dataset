MISSION The school shall have a clearly formulated and publicly stated mission with supporting goals, objectives and values. 1.1.A. A clear and concise mission statement for the school as a whole. The 2011- 12 strategic planning process (See C riterion 1.1.E ) established the following mission statement for the University of Washington (UW) School of Public Health (SPH): \"The UW School of Public Health is dedicated to education to prepare outstanding, innovative, and diverse public health leaders and scientists; research to advance public health science and policies; and service to promote the health and well -being of communities locally, nationally, and globally.\" The three arms of the SPH mission are interdependent and benefit from their intersections and overlap. For example, the SPH believes that offering field -based service learning enhances the student's educational experience while also promoting public healt h within a community. S tudents who engage in research advance the research and also gain ana lytic skills . Through university- community research collaborations, the S PH's research efforts yield public health impact in the communities with which it works. 1.1.B. A statement of values that guides the school. The S trategic P lan articulate s the follo wing values as foundational for the mission and activities of the SPH. Integrity - Adhere to the highest standards of objectivity, professional integrity, and scientific rigor. Collaboration - Nurture creative, team -based, and interdisciplinary approaches to advancing scientific research and knowledge and improving population health. Impact - Evaluate the effectiveness of our efforts, assessing if we have made a difference and learning from our experiences. Innovation - Create innovative approaches to educ ating and inspiring students and to answering important public health questions. Diversity - Embrace and build on diverse perspectives, beliefs, and cultures to promote public health. Equity - Promote equity and social justice in defining and addressing he alth and health care. Excellence - Recognize our SPH -wide strengths and the contributions of our faculty, staff, and students. Stewardship - Practice careful stewardship of the trust and resources invested in us. Courage - Bring courage, passion, and perse verance to advance public health principles in policy discourse. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 1 1.1.C. One or more goal statements for each major function through which the school intends to attain its mission, including at a minimum, instruction, research and service. During the strat egic planning process, seven goals were articulated for the SPH . These embody the collective aspirations of internal and external stakeholders for the future development of the SPH. The SPH Strategic Plan also summarized a number of specific strategies (not to be confused wi th objectives ) towards achieving each goal. These goals and strategies are listed below: Goal 1: Strengthen our teaching 1.1 Review the current Master of Public Health ( MPH ) curriculum to ensure that graduates have the skills and practi cal competencies necessary to be productive, effective, and transformational public health leaders, scientists, and practitioners. 1.2 Evaluate establishing an abbreviated degree program for clinical professionals, including medical students. 1.3 Regula rly review and modify programs so they do not become outdated. 1.4 Identify best practices and improve efficiencies in teaching and course offerings. 1.5 Strengthen the delivery of high -quality education in our undergraduate, MPH, MS, and PhD programs . Establish mechanisms, such as hiring criteria and faculty incentives, to improve the quality of our teaching, advising, and mentoring. Improve our pedagogical models and increase the use of adult learning methods, such as greater use of problem -based l earning, as appropriate, through professional development and by bringing in practitioners as instructors and mentors. 1.6 Improve the quality and consistency of written and on line curriculum materials. Develop standardized teaching tools for use across departments. Provide information and support f or faculty to create and maintain comprehensive course websites. 1.7 Extend our teaching beyond the classroom. Convene forums for community, workforce, and business partners to explore how to optimize limited resources to improve community and workplace health. Provide opportunities for our students to teach public health to K -12 students, undergraduates, workers, and the general public. 1.8 Enhance our ability to advise and mentor students effectively. Improve support for advising and mentoring of students by staff and faculty . Strengthen School -wide student services. 1.9 Seek financial support for students through scholarships, training grants, and other mechanisms. 1.10 Expand the public health u ndergraduate program. Create a pedagogically sound, high -quality undergraduate public health curriculum with elective areas of focus. 1.11 Broaden opportunities for public health training. Offer additional and varied educational opportunities to public health practitioners, such as short - courses and certification programs. Explore opportunities to use distance learning technologies effectively. Consider developing public health content modules for use in other UW schools and colleges. Goal 2: Stren gthen our r esearch 2.1 Develop and strengthen robust research support, both methodological (such as biostatistical collaborations) and procedural (such as assistance with grant proposal processing) to optimize the research experience for faculty. 2.2 Develop mechanisms (such as pilot grants) to assist junior faculty in initiating research programs. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 2 2.3 Develop mechanisms to facilitate cross- disciplinary research, including mutually beneficial arrangements between departments and with other schools and colleges at UW. 2.4 Develop equitable, transparent, and predictable ways of recovering and allocating indirect costs. Goal 3: Strengthen our collaborations with c ommunity partners 3.1 Become the go -to academic public health resource for the Pacific No rthwest. Increase the School's collaboration with public health practitioners on issues that affect the Pacific Northwest region. Actively participate in promoting health through student practicums, internships, publications, and appearances in popular m edia; presentations to and participation on advisory and decision - making bodies; and providing evidence -based information. 3.2 Strengthen connections between research programs and the needs of communities and practitioners. Promote community research links through outreach, consultative activities, support of translational and community- based participatory research, and rewarding faculty, staff, and students who collaborate effectively with community partners. Goal 4: Globalize the school 4.1 Increase our engagement and formalize ties with key global health organizations, the private sector, advocacy organizations, and immigrant populations. 4.2 Globalize the curriculum, ensuring that the majority of courses at the School contain material relevant to global health concerns and provide a global context for national and local issues. 4.3 Recruit innovative faculty and students from around the globe. 4.4 Secure funding for junior faculty, fellows, and students to support career development and innova tive global research and projects. Goal 5: Improve our diversity 5.1 Establish a standing diversity committee in consultation with the School community.

Review the current curriculum to assure that core requirements for students in all programs include material and methodologies for understanding and addressing socioeconomic status, class, race, and other social determinants of heal th. 5.3 Diversify the School's faculty and staff. Develop School -wide recruitment policies with guidelines and measurable goals that build on existing guidelines and draw on successful models. These policies should hold search committees, chairs, and th e dean accountable for taking actions that ensure searches produce a diverse pool of applicants. Design and disseminate SPH guidelines for mentoring and retention programs for underrepresented minority faculty and staff. Establish a program to invite tal ented underrepresented minority faculty in public health disciplines to spend a half -year or a year at the School. 5.4 Strengthen recruitment and mentoring of students from underrepresented populations. Develop and implement a robust student recruitment policy, including establishing the criteria for admission to SPH degree programs that promote diverse applicants. Establish \"pipelines\" through connections to middle schools, high schools, and traditionally minority serving colleges. Invest in community- building events and professional development activities for students from underrepresented populations. 14 University of Washington School of Public Health Page 3 Goal 6: Enhance our s chool c ommunity 6.1 Provide space and technological infrastructure to support educational and research goals. 6.2 Invest in School -wide events that bring our broad community together for rich interactions.

For example, the SPH is the place to be if you want to: Establish a strong foundation in the basic sciences of public health. Address health concerns from a global perspective and play an active role in solving the health challenges of the Pacific Northwest region. 7.4 Revisit the Scho ol's external image to align it with the directions set by this plan. 7.5 Develop a program to identify potential funders a process that will include experienced School - level professional staff and close coordination with faculty. 7.6 Emphasize support for faculty, staff, students, and facilities. 7.7 Build fundraising approaches around the priorities stated in this Strategic Plan. In addition to these goals for \"Strengthening the C ore,\" the Strategic Plan lays out a research agenda to advance the School's contribution in six emerging public health challenges identified during the strategic planning process as priority areas for the SPH . A. Dissemination and Implementation Science B. Genomics and Public Health C. Global Environmental Change and Human Health D. Health Policy and Health Systems E. Obesity, Food, Physical Activity, and Health F. Social Determinants of Health These initiatives are described in Criterion 3.1. 1.1.D. A set of measurable objectives with quantifiable indicators related to each goal statement as provided in Criterion 1.1.C. In some cases, qualitative indicators may be used as appropriate . The table below lists the specific objectives and indicators that have been selected to track each of the Goals listed in Criterion 1.1.C .

Description of the manner through wh ich the mission, values, goals , and objectives were developed, including a description of how various specific stakeholder groups were involved in their development. From March through December 2011, several hundred students, faculty, staff, partners , and supporters contributed their time and ideas toward developing strategic goals and priorities for the UW School of Public Health. The SPH Strategic Plan can be found in Appendix 1.1.E .i. The process was designed to be comprehensive and inclusive, seeking br oad engagement from faculty, staff, students, alumni, partners , and friends. We used traditional forms of engagement such as focus groups , surveys, and stakeholder interviews. Numerous discussions were held in the community, and input was given through onl ine opportunities to participate in the process. Comments were collected from 30 informal focus -group discussions facilitated by Steering Committee members between April and June 2011. These were promoted as community- wide discussions about the future of the SPH . They were held in a variety of settings on campus and in University of Washington School of Public Health Page 6 the community and attended by nearly four hundred faculty, staff, students , and community partners. A web -based survey was developed to reach as wide an audience as possible. It was heavil y promoted among faculty, staff, students, alumni, and current and potential partners by email, website mention, and verbal mention. In addition, survey respondents were encouraged to promote the opportunity among their own contacts. For external stakehold ers, we were particularly interested in understanding how the SPH could improve partnerships and prepare students with skills they need for the twenty -first century workforce, and what stakeholders view ed as the biggest challenges facing public health. A t otal of 822 individuals responded to the survey (232 alumni , 202 students , 152 faculty , 116 staff , and 120 external stakeholders) . The full survey results are summarized in a separate document (Appendix 1.1.E .ii) and available online at http://sph.washington.edu/strategicplan/sph_survey_draft_analysis_062911.pdf . Stakeholder interviews were conducted with 19 individuals, including deans of associated schools at the University of Washington and representatives of partner agencies ( Appendix 1.1 .E.iii). The strategic planning process also involved a weekend -long retreat where leaders, student s, staff, faculty , and external stakeholders met to develop and refine SPH's mission, values, goals, and objectives for the coming decade . Furthermore, the strategic planning process generated a list of priority strategies to achieve these goals and ob jectives as described above. 1.1.F. Description of how the mission, values, goals and objectives are made available to the school's constituent groups, including the general public, and how they are routinely reviewed and revised to ensure relevance. The SPH 's mission, values, goals, and strategies are prominently displayed on the SPH's website (http://sph.washington.edu/strategicplan/SPH_StratPlan_2012.pdf ) and are promoted in print materials circulated with information about the Strategic Plan. The dean ho lds annual all-school meetings where these are also reiterated. A one -page handout was developed (see picture shown and Appendix 1.1.F ) for use and display in offices and corridors to emphasize the importance of the SPH 's mission and values in all aspects of teaching, research, and service. Formal review occurs at multiple levels. These activities are described in more detail in Criterion 1.2. 1.1.G. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknes ses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH has a concise mission statement, value statement, and set of goals that were developed through a n inclusive strategic process involv ing, and with strong support from , faculty, students, staff, alu mni, and external stakeholders . SPH departments also articulate mission, vision, and goal statements. The Strategic Plan includes specific strategies to achieve the SPH's goals . The SPH has specified a set of measur able objectives to help track progress to ward the SPH's articulated goals. The Strategic Plan , including mission, v alues, g oals, and s trategies, has been widely disseminated to internal and external audiences. Weaknesses/Challenges The Strategic Plan generated more goals and strategies than can c ompleted in the short term; a multi- year phased -in timeline will be necessary to address all goals and strategies. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 7 The tracking of progress toward the SPH goals, including progress on each of the 35 articulated strategies, requires dedicated staff effort. Plans The special assistant to the dean formally will track progress toward the goals, objectives, and strategies articulated in the Strategic Plan . Continue to use the goals and strategies of the Strategic Plan to direct and promote the activities of school leadership, faculty, staff, and students. Improve the efficiency and dissemination of measurable objectives. Assess and refine targets for the indicators related to these objectives. Continue to disseminate meaningful evidence of the SPH progress towards its goals. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 8 1.2. EVALUATION The school shall have an explicit process for monitoring and evaluating its overall efforts against its mission, goals and objectives; for assessing the school's effectiveness in serving its various con stituencies; and for using evaluation results in ongoing planning and decision making to achieve its mission. As part of the evaluation process, the school must conduct an analytical self -study that analyzes performance against the accreditation criteria defined in this document. 1.2.A. Description of the evaluation processes used to monitor progress against objectives defined in Criterion 1.1.D, including identification of the data systems and responsible parties associated with each objective and with the evaluation process as a whole. Evaluation is integral to the way the SPH and its constituent departments, programs, and centers operate. The objectives and measures described in Criterion 1.1.D constitute an important , but only partial, basis for evaluat ion, monitoring, and planning in the SPH. The SPH conducts , or is the subject of, a number of external and internal processes to monitor and evaluate its performance in teaching, research, and service. These evaluative quality -improvement processes usually combine quantitative indicators and qualitative information , but ultimately rely on considered judgment with regard to need for improvement , innovation, and/or re -allocation of re sources. Evaluation is conducted at multiple levels: school level and depart ment /program level . School Level Strategic Plan Implementation Monitoring The special assistant to the dean formally tracks progress toward the goals, objectives, and strategies articulated in the SPH Strategic Plan and identifies and helps resolve problem s in implementation. (See http://sph.washington.edu/strategicplan/implementation.asp for detailed tracking information.) Standing and ad hoc committees play significant roles in ide ntifying priorities and carrying out the goals and strategies outlined in the Strategic Plan . The SPH Faculty Council, Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee, Diversity Committee and Distance Learning and Learning Technology Committee play key roles i n monitoring (as well as implementing) the Strategic Plan . Periodic review of the SPH's Strategic Plan is formally addressed as part of the SPH Executive Committee's tasks. School of Public Health Executive Committee Annual Retreat Each summer, the School of Public Health Executive Committee (SPHEC) meets for an all -day retreat to review the status and plans for the various departments and the SPH as a whole. In previous years a notebook containing a comprehensive set of data tables formed a significant pa rt of the background information for these review s. In 2011, the first summer that Dean Howard Frumkin was dean, a two -day strategic planning retreat was held in place of the annual review. In 2012, the SPHEC retreat focused on the implementation of the St rategic Plan and other priority issues for each d epartment and for the SPH as a whole. Annual R eport to the Provost During the autumn and winter quarters, the dean's o ffice prepares a budget request for the p rovost. This process in data -intensive, as the provost specifies an array of metrics from each school. These data include trends in student enrollments, teaching (student credit hours), and research. These reports are available in the Appendix 1.2.A .i. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 9 SPH Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee The committee addresses all curriculum and educational policy issues that affect the SPH as a whole. It reviews course enrollment, program learning objectives, and results of the annual student competency survey . Members of the committee usually chair or serve on their department curriculum committees, and so they are able to integrate departmental perspectives into the SPH-wide discussion, and vice versa. Dean's Review Every five years, the University president appoints a special committee to conduct a re view of the dean. The process is similar to that used to review department chairs. Recommendations are made as to the dean's success at meeting SPH and University goals and expectations. A s with the chair reviews, the process is an evaluation of the succes s of the SPH as a whole , as well as of the dean individually. Dean Wahl was reviewed in 2005. The current d ean has been in place for fewer than three years and has not had a formal review. Department/Program Level External Accrediting Bodies As indicated in Criterion 1.3.A , several programs in the SPH are accredited by accrediting bodies other than Council on Education for Public Health ( CEPH ). Each of these organizations requires extensive analytic self -study processes, and each provides the programs with thoughtful evaluative feedback. In the most recent re- accreditation reviews, each of these programs received the maximum terms of re- accreditation. Copies of these accreditation reports may be found in Appendix 1.3.A . Graduate School Program Reviews Since the last accreditation, four graduate programs in the SPH have been reviewed by the Graduate School . This in -depth process is similar to a CEPH review . The academic program /department conducts a detailed self -study and a review team assembled by the Grad uate School includes senior faculty from outside the UW, faculty from outside the SPH , and faculty from within the SPH who are not in the department under review. Using the self -study document and interviews conducted during a two- day site visit, the revie w team examines the department's goals and plans in light of its record of achievements, overall quality, adaptability to change, and prospects for innovation, in the context of the SPH and the University as a whole. The program reviews were conducted on t he following schedule: 2007 Master of Public Health Degree 2007 Graduate Certificate in Statistical Genetics 2009 Public Health Genetics Graduate Program 2009 Genetic Epidemiology Master of Science Program 2010 Public Health Graduate Certificate Program 2010 Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences 2013 Department of Biostatistics These reviews recommended the maximum interval until the next review, an indication that no significant concerns were identified. Nevertheless, each review included helpful recommendations for improving these academic programs . Copies of the self -studies and Graduate School reviews may be seen in Appendix 1.2.A.ii . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 10 Dean's A nnual R eview of Chairs/ Departments In 2011, Dean Frumkin initiated an annual process in which the chairs summarize the activities, successes, and problems in their respective departments. These reviews are structured to provide detailed information as per the form below (Table 1.2.A ). Because almost all teaching, research, and service activit ies are initiated and performed at the department level, these annual departmental reviews serve as a comprehensive and detailed annual evaluation of the major functions of the SPH.

The committee consults with the incumbent regarding his or her views of past policies and practices and proje ctions of departmental and personal goals. It also solicits comments from all involved constituencies: faculty, staff, students, other administrators, and colleagues from outside the University. Upon completion of the review, the committee prepares a repor t for the dean and the provost, and an overview and summary are shared with the department. This review serves, in part , as a review of the department, as well as the chair. Recommendations are made depending on the chair's success at meeting department an d SPH goals and expectations. Since the last accreditation, the chairs of Epidemiology and Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Science ( DEOHS ) have been reviewed. Reviews of the chair of Biostatistics will be in 2013.

In addition, in departments with multiple tracks , such as DEOHS and Health Services, program faculty meet at least annually to review and evaluate educational policy, address curriculum and practicum issues, and develop enhancements to their programs. Evaluation Data Resources The SPH , departments, and programs are aided by data from the following sources. UW Enterprise Data W arehouse Over the past seven years t he University has created a data warehouse fo r internal data users. The warehouse hosts a large array of data on applicants, students, classes, grants and contracts, faculty, and finances. The SPH has made excellent use of this resource in the computation of SPH indicators and f or a large catalog of parameter -driven data reports on all aspects of the SPH . Demonstrations of the SPH 's \"Report Services\" tools will be available for site visitors. Graduate School The Graduate School provides extensive analytic data to the SPH and departments on applicants, accepted students, and enrolled students. In addition, the Graduate School conducts an exit survey of all University master's and PhD graduates. The summary results are distr ibuted to all schools and colleges. The survey asks students to rate such characteristics as departmental academic standards, adequacy of training, satisfaction with supervision and/or guidance, quality of the faculty, and overall quality of the program. I t also asks whether students published a paper in a journal while in the program, whether they received financial support, and what their post -graduation plans are. Office of Educational Assessment: Student Evaluation of Courses It is SPH policy that all c ourses be evaluated by students. Most courses use one of the standard forms provided by the University's Office of Educational Assessment (OEA); instructors may substitute other instruments tailored to their particular course s. Results are reviewed by each department's curriculum committee or chair , and annually by faculty senior in rank at the time of faculty reviews. Recommendations to the faculty member based on these reviews are transmitted through the chair. In addition, the OEA produces aggregate reports summarizing student course evaluations by department. Copies of these reports can be found in Appendix 1.2.A.iii . SPH Student Exit Survey The SPH has developed its own student s urvey. The most recent SPH -wide survey was conducted in spring 2012. This s urvey is used to supplement the Graduate School E xit Surve y and has provided data for some of our indicators. The survey can be seen in Appendix 1.2.A .iv. SPH Alumni Survey The SPH conducted a survey of alumni in 2012 to gather information about: 1. Current e mployment of our graduates 2. Graduates' assessment of the skills and knowledge they need in their current jobs 3. Graduates' assessment of their SPH education 4. Graduates' recommendations for improving the SPH The survey instrument is in Appendix 1.2.A .v. Data fr om this survey and the exit surveys can be used to inform curriculum planning at the school, department, and program level. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 13 1.2.B.

In general, the indicators above suggest that the SPH continues at a high level and/or is improving in the quality and quantity of teaching, research productivity, service and inter disciplinary collaboration, globalization, communications, and building a vibrant school community. On the other hand, we are still struggling with improving the diversity of our students, staff and faculty. Student rating of the adequacy of mentoring and their student space is also not satisfactor y. The measurement and tracking of these indicators represent only one aspect in which the progress towards the s trategic g oals is being monitored and promoted. Some of the objectives and indicators that will be used to measure progress towards these goals have been computed and tracked in the past; however, for some objectives, we do not have historical baseline measur es. In addition, i t is evident that quantitative indicators are not sufficient to track progress in implementing these strategies listed abo ve; therefore, the dean has assigned a member of his staff the direct responsibility for tracking activities and progress related to the seven goals outlined in the Strategic Plan . 1.2.D. Description of the manner in which the self -study document was developed, including effective opportunities for input by important school constituents, including institutional officers, administrative staff, faculty, students, alumni , and representatives of the public health community. The overall responsibility for this self-study was given to the a ssociate d ean for Academic Affairs and a writing /review committee which consisted of the individuals in the SPH who had the most detailed knowledge of the various aspects of the SPH that are described in this document: Associat e Dean, Academic Affairs (lead) Associate Dean, Research and Programs Assistant Dean, Administration Director, Student Affairs Assistant Director, Student Affairs Chief Financial Officer Special Assistant to the Dean for Strategic Planning University of Washington School of Public Health Page 17 Chair, SPH Curri culum and Educational Policy Committee Chair, SPH Diversity Committee Chair, SPH Faculty Council Director, Undergraduate Public Health Major Manager, Academic Affairs SPH Database Manager The process can be summarized as follows: The constituency groups w ith the most direct knowledge and interest in the re -accreditation were briefed about the purpose of the reaccreditation, the issues to be addressed, and the timeline. These groups were asked to provide input through the members of the writing committee and included: School of Public Health Executive Committee School of Public Health Faculty Council Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee MPH Review Work Group All faculty attending the All School Meeting ( January 12, 2012) The various deliverables outl ined in the CEPH document \"Accreditation Criteria, Schools of Public Health, Amended June 2011 \" were assigned to members of the w riting c ommittee . Several constituencies were especiall y active in providing input and review for parts of the draft sections , especially a) departmental and SPH curriculum c ommittees; b) Diversity Committee; and c) Student Services staff. Wider participation in self-study was enlisted, as needed, by the departmental and student representatives on these committees. Initial review/ editing of each deliverable was done by the a ssociate dean for Academic Affairs , and sections were returned to those designated for revision , where appropriate . Preliminary analysis of strengths, weaknesses/challenges, and plans for each c riterion was draf ted by members of the writing committee. Comments and input on the draft s elf-study was solicited from faculty, staff, and students , and from external constituencies via posting on the SPH w ebsite, and revisions were made as needed . 1.2.E. Assessment of th e extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH collects a wide range of both quantitative measures and qualitative information on progress toward its str ategic goals and objectives. The SPH has dedicated resources and staff to promote and track the implementation of the Strategic P lan. The SPH Executive Committee reviews these measures at its annual retreats to plan actions to enhance the SPH's programs. Departments and programs conduct similar review and planning activities annually. Each department in the SPH, under the auspices of the Graduate School, regularly conducts a detailed self -assessment and undergoes an extensive program review by a panel of ex ternal reviewers. By University code, the chairs of each department and the dean are extensively evaluated every five years. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 18 The provost requires detailed metric s from the dean annually as part of budget negotiations. The dean requires detailed accoun ting from the chairs annually. Weaknesses/Challenges It has been difficult to establish defensible targets for many quantitative indicators . Greater use could be of available data resources and SPH metrics could be shared in more detail with faculty studen ts and staff Many important aspects of the SPH cannot be adequately monitored with quantitative indicators . Plans Continue to refine performance data and evaluation metrics Work to establish appropriate quant itative targets where possible. Continue to impr ove the scope, efficiency, and dissemination of performance data and evaluation metrics in the SPH. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 19 1.3. INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT The school shall be an integral part of an accredited institution of higher education and shall have the same level of independence and status accorded to professional schools in that institution. 1.3.A. A brief description of the institution in which the school is located, and the names of accrediting bodies (other than CEPH) to which the institution re sponds. The SPH is one of 16 schools and colleges on the University of Washington (UW) campus in Seattle. The SPH is one of six professional schools that comprise the Health Sciences Center; the others are Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Social Work. As in the other schools, the d ean reports to the president through the p rovost on all budgetary and academic issues. The president reports to the Board of Regents, which has ultimate authority for governing the University. The University of Washingt on is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities and is a member of the Association of American Universities. Several of the SPH's academic programs are accredited by other accrediting bodies, as described in Table 1.3.A . Copies of the reports of these accrediting bodies are included in Appendix 1.3.A .

Health Sciences and Medical Affairs organizational c hart University of Washington School of Public Health Page 22 1.3.C. Description of the school's level of autonomy and authority regarding the following: budgetary authority and decisions relating to resource allocation ; lines of accountability, including access to higher -level university officials ; personnel re cruitment, selection and advancement, including faculty and staff ; academic standards and policies, including establishment and oversight of curricula The Board of Regents has ultimate authority for the governance of the University. Its 10 members are appointed by the g overnor of the State of Washington. In addition to their other responsibilities, the regents are responsible for appointing the president. The president is the chief executive officer of the University and is responsible for the general welfare of the institution, including its programs in instruction, research, and public service. The president is directly responsible to the Board of Regents for the management of the University and is the University community's official representative to the r egents. The provost is the chief operating and academic officer of the University and reports directly to the president. The provost's office is responsible for the develo pment, implementation, and over sight of the University's academic programs, budget, research, and faculty personnel matters. The provost provides leadership in educational and curriculum development, formulation, and allocation of capital and operating budgets, management of academic and administrative personnel, allocation of space, and long- range University planning. In those areas for which the provost has responsibility, the deans report to the president through the provost. Throughout the University, each dean oversees his/her respective school's or college's education and curriculum development, formulation and allocation of budgets, management of academic and administrative personnel, allocation of space, and long- range planning. The dean formulates the SPH's budget request in consultation with department chairs and the SPH's Faculty Council (elected by the faculty) and submits it every two years to the provost. It is the p rovost's task to divide the academic portion of the state allocation among the University's colleges and schools. The SPH also receives a percentage of the indirect costs recovered from grants and contracts originating from the SPH . The dean participates in the Board of Health Sciences Deans, a forum for addressing the unique issues that face the six health sciences schools and for promoting inter -school coordination. The University of Washington has a long and strong tradition of collegial , shared governance by faculty and administration. SPH faculty members participate in University governance through the Faculty Senate, an elected body with representation from all units. The Faculty Senate may propose policy in academic, personnel, or budgetary matters. To be put into effect, such proposals must receive the concurrence of the p resident and/or a majority of the voting faculty. Official University policies and procedures are contained in the University Policy Directory available online at : http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/index.shtml . Personnel recruitment, selection, and advancement are conducted according to established University policies. For faculty positions, a search is required, usually on a national level, before an appointment is made. Advertisements for faculty positions are reviewed by the d irector for Equal Opportunit y, International Scholars Operations , and Academic Human Resources, to assure compliance with state and federal affirmative action and equal opportunity guidelines and U.S. Department of Labor guidelines. Candidates are reviewed by a search committee, and proposed appointments are reviewed by the departmental faculty and chair, the dean, Academic Human Resources , the provost, and the Board of Regents. New appointments at the levels of associate and full professor are reviewed by the SPH's Faculty Council. P romotions undergo a review process comparable to that of new appointments. The University of Washington policies on faculty a nd governance can be found online at: http://www.wash ington.edu/admin/rules/policies/FCG/FCGTOC.html . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 23 Academic policies and standards are set within the SPH and are subject to the policies and standards of the University. All graduate degrees offered by the SPH are authorized by the Graduate School. All new degre e programs must be approved by t he Graduate School . Thus, the Graduate School establishes the minimum criteria for admission of graduate students and required credits for degrees, and the schools and departments establish additional criteria. Since authority to grant graduate degrees resides in the Graduate School, the programs of the SPH are subject to the same 10 -year reviews that are required of all University units offering graduate degrees. The academic policies of the Graduate School can be found at: http://www.grad.washington.edu/fac -staff/gpa- gpc/. 1.3.D. Identification of any of the above processes that are different for the SPH than for other professional schools, with an explanation. Not applicable. 1.3.E. If a collaborative school, descriptions of all participating institutions and delineation of their relationships to the school. Not applicable. 1.3.F. If a collaborative school, a copy of the formal written agreement that est ablishes the rights and obligations of the participating universities in regard to the school's operation. Not applicable. 1.3.G. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans rela ting to this criterion. Strengths The SPH is one of 16 schools at the University of Washington and enjoys the same status and autonomy as all other schools. The SPH has well -established, formal relationships within the University's governance structure and is subject to the policies and standards of the University. The dean participates as a full member of the Board of Deans of the University of Washington. The dean is a full member of the Board of Health Sciences Deans. The SPH is well positioned to create a strong collaborative i nterprofessional education experience for future students due to the strong commitment of the Board of Health Sciences Deans to the Interprofessional Education (IPE) effort (see Criterion 1.4.C ). The dean, chairs and faculty partic ipate in many University committees that are outside the SPH ; e.g., dean - d ean s earch c ommittees, d ean review c ommittees; c hairs - search committees, department and program r eview c ommittees; f aculty - faculty s earch c ommittees, Faculty Senate, UW Emergen cy Preparedness Committee. Weaknesses/Challenges None Plans None This criterion is met.

These two programs operate as quasi -departments. They have their own d irectors and are overseen by the associate dean for Research and Programs. In addition, the undergraduate Public Health m ajor program also has its own director and is over seen by the a ssociate dean for Research and Programs. 1.4.C. Description of the manner in which interdisciplinary coordination, cooperation and collaboration occur and support public health learning, research and service. The SPH participates in, initiates, and promotes a large number of policies and activities to support interdisciplinary cooperation and collaboration. University l evel In the past 10 years, the SPH has developed concurrent degree programs with the schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, S ocial Work, Public Affairs, Business, International Affairs, and Arts and Sciences (Anthropology, Statistics). (See Criterion 2.13) . Approximately 35 percent of attendees in SPH courses are from outside the SPH . Many of the core/primary faculties in the SP H have joint or adjunct appointments in other departments in the university (See Criterion 1.7) . Conversely, the SPH departments have appointed a large n umber of faculty to joint or a djunct appointments in the SPH (See Criterion 1.7) . Our Department of Glo bal Health is the focal point for global health activities involving faculty and students from throughout the University. The a ssociate dean for Research and Programs is a member of the UW Research Advisory Board and other U niversity -wide research coordinating committees. Within Health Sciences The SPH participates in (and co- chairs) the initiative on Inter professional Education (IPE) , a large collaborative effort to integrate teaching and experiential /service lea rning among students in the six health scien ces schools (see Appendix 1.4.C ). The SPH provides training, especially through the Department of Epidemiology, for post -doctoral fellows from throughout the Health Sciences . The new Department of Global Health was created to be joint ly housed within the S PH and the School of Medicine. The SPH participates in several interschool research training programs (see Criterion 3.1) . The associate dean for Academic Affairs meets monthly with his counterparts from the six health sciences schools to discuss common concerns regarding students, curriculum, and programs. SPH faculty teach the public health course in the School of Medicine . Incoming SPH students read and participate in inter -school activities related to the \"Common Book\" they read prior to starting school . (The common Book for 2012 was The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, by Anne Fadiman.) Within the SPH The SPH has developed a number of Graduate Certificate Programs that enable students to obtain a \"minor \" in an area of P ublic H ealth outside of th eir primary department. Students from outside the SPH also enroll to obtain these Graduate Certificates (see Criterion 3.3 ). In addition, within the SPH, students have the opportunity to pursue a n MPH/MHA degree. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 28 The SPH is home to several degree programs that are interdisciplinary: Nutritional Sciences, Public Health Genetics, and Pathobiology. In addition, the Maternal and Child Health Program includes MPH students from both Health Services and Epidemiology. Many faculty in the SPH have joint or a djunct a ppointments in other SPH departments. Within the SPH , coordination of the curriculum is maintained by the SPH Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee (CEPC) which has overall responsibility for the MPH degree and for coordination of courses offered by the SPH . Many courses are cross- listed, and students face no barriers in taking courses outside of their department and, indeed, outside of the SPH. The SPH Strategic Plan identified six emerging, interdisciplinary areas for scholarly pursuit (See Criteri on 1.1 ). The d ean is supporting a large effort to pursue these efforts by providing considerable funds for pilot grants and faculty hires in these areas. Interdisciplinarity is a criterion for the pilot grants and the faculty recruitments. Within the r egion and l ocal c ommunity The SPH has long and strong interdisciplinary collaborations with many research institutes within the Seattle area, including the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Children's Hospital Research Institute, Group Health Co operative's Research Institute, Seattle VA Research and Development Program , Seattle Biomedical Research Institute (SBRI) , and others. 1.4.D. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH departmental structure promotes strong, discipline -based researc h and teaching programs. The SPH participates in, initiates, encourages, and promotes a wide range of interdisciplinary curricular, research , and service activities with partners from the wider University community, within the SPH, and the local and regional community. The SPH houses or participates in over 35 research centers. These research centers provide environments that promote cutting -edge, interdisciplinary , and inter-institutional efforts to create and disseminate new knowledge. Weaknesses/Challenges The administrative and financial burden of creating new departments has resulted in the SPH locating interdisciplinary and other units (e .g., Social and Behavioral Sciences, Nutritional Sciences, Public Health Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, Pathobiology , and others) within department s or in the office of the dean. This produces a complexity that is a challenge administratively and in terms of communication to outside audiences (especially prospective students) . The Department of Global Health was established to exist jointly in the SPH and the School of Medicine. This has necessitated a considerable effort to develop workable faculty , administrative, and financial policies and procedures. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that codifies these policies an d procedures is included in Appendix 1.4.D . Plans Continue to promote interdisciplinarity in teaching, research , and service. Develop better and better -understood administrative systems to support interdisciplinary programs and activities . Provide better , clearer information about the wide range of interdisciplinary academic programs, research, courses, and service opportunities through SPH and departm ental websites and other communication vehicles. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 29 1.5 GOVERNANCE The school administration and faculty shall have clearly defined rights and responsibilities concerning school governance and academic policies. St udents shall, where appropriate, have participatory roles in the conduct of school and program evaluation procedures, policy setting and decision making. 1.5.A.

Description of the school's governance and committee structure's roles and responsibilities relating to the following: -general school policy development -planning and evaluation -budget and resource allocation -student recruitment, admission and award of degrees -faculty recruitment, retention, promotion and tenure -academic standards and policies, including curriculum development -resea rch and service expectations and policies General SPH policy development SPH operates within the governance guidelines and systems of the University of Washington, as determined in large part by the UW Faculty Senate, UW Faculty Code, the Graduate School, and the office of the provost. Within this framework, SPH-wide policy, internal allocation, and strategic planning decisions are made primarily by the SPH Executive Committee (SPHEC) with input from the SPH's Faculty Council , faculty, students, and other constituencies. SPHEC is concerned with all issues affecting the SPH , particularly resource allocation, strategic planning, development, external visibility, faculty affairs, and educational policy. The committee meets monthly and is advisory to the dean. It makes collegial decisions on these matters based on input from faculty, staff, and students, including input from the standing committees. The interests of the faculties of each department are represented in SPHEC by their chairs. At these meetings, issues of SPH-wide importance that have been raised at departmental faculty meetings and by the students are presented and discussed. In addition, the dean informs the department chairs and associate deans of important University -wide initiatives and policy issues. The standing committees that contribute to governance in the SPH are: the Faculty Council, the Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee, the Practicum Committee, the Distance Learning and Technology Committee, the Diversity Committee and the Pra cticum Committee . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 34 Each unit on campus, as per the UW Faculty Senate, has a Faculty Council , which contributes to SPH-wide policies on faculty expectations, appointments, and promotions. The Faculty Council reviews and votes on faculty appointment s, promoti ons, and awards of tenure and advises the dean on matters involving SPH policy, including priorities, resource and salary allocation, and budgets. Each department must elect a representative and an alternate to the Faculty Council. Terms are for three year s and may be renewed once by a vote of the department faculty. All voting members of the faculty are eligible to serve, including joint faculty who hold voting rights in SPH. Each year, the Faculty Council elects a chair, whose term may be renewed . The Byl aws of the SPH Faculty Council can be found in Appendix 1.5.A.i i. The Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee formulates SPH -wide academic policies, oversees the curriculum, and approves new cou rses and programs, as well as course and program changes a t the SPH level . It reports to the Faculty Council. The Practicum Committee sets and monitors policies and procedures for the MPH practicum. The Diversity Committee develops, promotes, and implements policies and activities to create and sustain a n open a nd inclusive environment for all faculty, staff, and students. The Distance Learning and Technology Committee coordinates and monitors distance learning online capabilities of the SPH. These standing committees may present issues and recommendations to SP HEC for discussion and action. All of these committees are advisory to the dean. Students participate in the governance of the SPH through representation on standing SPH -wide and departmental committees. Students are encouraged to bring proposals and conce rns to departmental and program meetings and to SPHEC. Students also contribute to the governance of the SPH through the Student Public Health Association and the Undergraduate Student Public Health Association. These organizations receive funding from the dean to support meetings and other student -run events. The departments in the SPH play a major governance role and are given considerable autonomy and responsibility for resource use, faculty recruitment and mentoring, curriculum development, and student admissions, advising, and monitoring. All departments hold faculty meetings at least once a month to review emerging issues, discuss potential initiatives, and provide a forum for all faculty and student representatives to participate in the governance and decision- making of the department. The f aculty is essential in the formulation of academic and student -related policies and standards. Executive Order IV: Legislative Authority of the Faculty ( http://www.washington.edu/admin/ rules/policies/PO/EOIV.html ) states: ... the President authorizes the University faculty to formulate regulations for the immediate government of the University and to share responsibility with him or her...and the academic deans in such matters as: A. Educational policy and general welfare; B. Policy for the regulation of student conduct and activities; C. Scholastic policy, including requirements for admission, graduation, and honors; D. Approval of candidates fo r degrees; E. Criteria for faculty tenure, appointment, and promotion; F. Recommendations concerning campus and University budgets; G. Formulation of procedures to carry out the policies and regulation thus established. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 35 Planning and e valuation SPH-wide P lanning The SPH completed a comprehensive strategic planning process in 2011. Several hundred students, faculty, staff, partners, and supporters contributed their time and ideas toward developing strategic goals and priorities for the SPH . Implementation b egan in 2012, will continue in phases for the coming years, and will be tracked formally by the s pecial assistant to the dean. Review of the progress towards the SPH's strategic goals occurs annually at the SPHEC summer retreat, where modifications are mad e based on input from the department faculty, students, and partnering organizations. The dean meets monthly with the Faculty Council to discuss developments, solicit suggestions, and respond to concerns on aspects of the SPH , especially as they relate to faculty affairs . The dean also reviews the plans for the SPH with the Dean's Council, which meets quarterly, to solicit its input on strategic directions for the SPH . The SPH Student Advisory Council also meets with the dean to provide input and feedback on SPH policy, including budget decisions that affect students. Departmental and Program Planning Annually, all departments meet in a retreat format to formally discuss academic and research activities and make plans related to program development, researc h, faculty, and departmental initiatives and needs. In departments with multiple teaching program tracks, the faculty associated with these tracks also conduct periodic retreats and reviews to evaluate their programs and plan efforts for program enhancemen ts. The dean meets annually with the c hairs to review all aspects of their respective departments to discuss departmental concer ns and plans (see Criterion 1.2.A ). In addition, every 10 years, the Graduate School conducts formal reviews of each graduate pr ogram in the SPH. As a part of this process, the departments or programs develop formal plans to respond to issues (including both concerns and opportunities) identified by these reviews. Budget and r esource allocation Based on the SPH's Strategic Plan and goals, as well as departmental needs, the dean develops a biennial budget that is presented by the d ean to the provost. Allocations for state funds are distributed to the office of the dean, on the basis of teaching performed (student credit hours), student enrollment, indirect cost recovery, and \"provost s upplement,\" which is determine d by a number of factors. These funds are in turn allocated to the office of the dean for its operations and programs and to the departments per established and transparent formulae. The formula e for this allocation process are developed by the c hief financial officer in consultation with the c hairs and the associate dean for Research and Programs. In general, revenues generated by teaching, enrollment, and indirect co st return are allocated to the d epartments in proportion to their respective activities. The budget and resource allocation process is described in more detail in Criterion 1.6 . Student r ecruitment, admission , and award of d egrees The departments bear the major responsibility for student recruitment, admissions standards, student selection, academic standards, and tracking fulfillment of degree requirements. The faculty has clearly defined rights and responsibilities in these activities . The Office of Student Af fairs plays a central coordinating and funding role in efforts to recruit a diverse student body and works together with the departments in these efforts . A detailed description of the SPH's student recruitment and admissions process is provided in Criteri on 4.3 . The G raduate S chool sets broad requirements for admission; however, department/program/track faculty determines the specific degree/track criteria and standards for admissions. Applicant selection is determined by department/track faculty. At the UW, students apply simultaneously to both the Graduate School and to specific academic programs in the SPH. The Graduate School provides administrative University of Washington School of Public Health Page 36 support for admissions such as data processing, verifying admissions materials (e.g., transcripts) , and collecting the application fee. Department/track faculty determine graduation requirements and standards within the general (usually minimum) requirements dictated by the Graduate School and accrediting bodies. Degrees are formally granted by the Graduate School based on departmental recommendations . The dean's office 1) oversees the development of the SPH Academic Programs Catalog , 2) maintains the SPH's website, which serves for many prospective students as the point of first contact with the SPH , and 3) houses the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) that helps applicants and current students with problems related to choice of program, financial aid , and the MPH practicum requirement. OSA plays a major role in minority recruitment, which involves staff train ing, frequent attendance at outreach events, and identification of financia l support for students from diverse backgrounds . Faculty r ecruitment , retention , promotion , and t enure Faculty recruitment, retention, promotion, and tenure are shared responsibili ties of the departments and the SPH's Faculty Council, with the d ean having final decision -making authority for the SPH . Faculty Recruitment Departments are generally responsible for identifying needs for new or replacement faculty and , with permission of the dean, for conducting appropriate national searches. In recent years, because of the general economic downturn, the p rovost has requested a formal hiring plan annually from the deans of all UW schools and colleges. These are compiled in consultation wit h the chairs. The provost has the authority to approve or ask for revisions in these hiring plans. An explanation of the procedures for recruiting, appointing, and promoting faculty can be found in the University Policy Directory (Chapter 24), online at http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/FCG/FCCH24.html , in the SPH Academic Affairs Handbook in , and on the web at http://sph.washington.edu/gateway/handbook/ . In general, the decision to offer an appointment to a new faculty member requires a vote of the faculty of the department in which the candidate would be hired. The Faculty Council reviews t he qualifications of the candidate and makes it s recommendation to the dean. The dean reviews the proposed appointment, and then forwards it to the president and provost with his recommendation. The proposal is reviewed by the p rovost. Final approval is aw arded by the Board of Regents. Faculty Retention Through the hiring process, new faculty orientation, mentoring, and annual review, the SPH seeks to hire, retain, and promote faculty of the highest caliber. SPH faculty often receive competitive offers from other institutions. Faculty who receive offers from other employers are requested to complete a UW Report of Competitive Offer form . The department may make a counter -offer to retain outstanding faculty , occasionally preemptively. The faculty in the five SPH departments have authorized the chairs to negotiate retention offers. Promotion It is the responsibility of the Faculty Council to develop (with concurrence from SPHEC and the dean) criteria for promotion, to inform departments of these requirements, t o specify appropriate review materials, to establish time schedules for review, and to gather all necessary information for promotion decisions. After the review of a proposed appointment, promotion, or tenure proposal, the Faculty Council makes a recomme ndation to the dean. If the department chair and faculty do not agree on a particular proposed appointment or promotion, the Faculty Council also plays a fact -finding role. To qualify for promotion, University of Washington School of Public Health Page 37 faculty must perform at a high standard in teaching and i n research or academic public health practice, and they are encouraged to provide service to the professional, SPH , University, and general communities. Outstanding performance in one area may compensate partially for modest activity \u2014but not for inadequate performance\u2014 in another. Each fall, senior departmental faculty review all faculty beneath the rank of professor for possible promot ion. Reviews are conducted using the general University guidelines ( University Policy Directory, Chapter 24) http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/FCG/FCCH24.html and the guidelines established by the Faculty Council in the SPH Academic Affairs Handbook (Appendix 1.5.B ). If the departmenta l faculty recommend promotion, the recommendation and the packet of supporting materials is sent to the dean, who refers the proposal to the Faculty Council. The C ouncil reviews the proposal and makes a recommendation to the dean, who forwards the proposal to the p rovost with his or her recommendation. Tenure Historically the SPH had a limited , finite number of tenure positions assigned to each department in the SPH. Most faculty join the SPH without a commitment of tenure (the UW calls these appointments \"WOT, \" without tenure by reason of funding ). WOT faculty have the same voting privileges and rights as tenured faculty, except for a guarantee of salary support. WOT faculty are supported from departmental funds for teaching and by external grants and cont racts for research. They can be released from UW employment only for reasons of misconduct and loss of funding (less than 50% over one year). The awarding of tenure can come a) upon promotion to a ssociate p rofessor, if the faculty member was hired as a tenure track assistant professor; b) upon joining the faculty, if the faculty member was hired as a tenured associate or full professor; or c) most commonly, by a vote of the senior faculty to awar d tenure to a seated member of the faculty . This last option has been applied to senior faculty with a track record of excellence in teaching, research , and service and who have demonstrated a commitment to the University through ex emplary departmental citizenship. Award of tenure requires letters from external referees, a vote of the Faculty Council, and approval of the d ean. More recently, with the adoption of the Activities -Based Budgeting (ABB) method of allocating revenues to the UW Schools and Colleges, the notion of \"tenured positions\" has become uncertain, because allocation to the units is no longer based on the \"tenured positions\" in each unit. Currently, any commitment of tenure requires that the department and school demonstrate that there are projected, sustainable resources to support the tenured posit ion. Academic s tandards and policies , including c urriculum development : The Graduate School sets minimum requirements for graduate degrees, such as credits and grades. Specific academic requirements, standards, and policies for each program in the SPH are determined by departmental faculty. The requirements for all degree programs in the SPH exceed the requirements of the Graduate School. An analogous relationship exists with the Office of Undergraduate Education for undergraduate programs. Departmental f aculty establish standards and policies for their academic programs, and the SPH Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee provides oversight to ensure compliance with SPH standards and policies. Generally, the responsibility for curriculum development l ies with the departments, each of which has its own curriculum committee. The Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee reviews any proposed new course, degree and certificate programs, or modifications to existing courses and programs. It ensures course integration across the SPH by noting any gaps or overlaps in the curriculum , and occasionally initiates SPH -wide efforts in curriculum development, e.g., recent initiatives in the areas of public health ethics and human biology. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 38 The Curriculum and Educa tional Policy Committee monitors all curricular matters related to the educational mission of the SPH, reviews and approves changes to the curriculum, and makes recommen dations, as appropriate, to the SPHEC and the dean. Because the MPH degree involves cou rses throughout the various departments, the Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee has a special role in reviewing and approving any changes in the requirements and expectations for the MPH . The committee also reviews the departmental peer teaching evaluation procedures . The a ssociate dean for Academic Affairs, with guidance from the Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee, oversees all degree programs and assures they are implemented consistently across departments, including developing and upda ting program learning objectives and the inclusion of course learning objectives in all syllabi. The University's Graduate Faculty Council reviews each graduate program in the University on a 10 -year rotation cycle and approves new degree program applicati ons before they are sent to the state Higher Education Coordinating Board for approval. The review process for the Graduate Faculty Council is similar to the CEPH accreditation review. The department/program prepares a self -study document according to U niversity -wide specifications. A review committee is formed, consisting of three to four University faculty outside the SPH and two to three non -UW faculty members involved with similar programs at their home institutions. After the self -study is reviewed, a two -day site visit is conducted to meet with the program director, coordinator, faculty, students, department chair, and the dean. The review committee drafts a report and distributes it to the program for comments on its accuracy. A final report is distributed to the Graduate Faculty Council, which then meets with the internal review committee members, the department chair, and the dean to discuss the report and make any final recommendations. Programs reviewed by the Graduate Faculty Council since the last CEPH accreditation include: Graduate Certificate in Statistical Genetics (2007); Master of Public Health (2007); Pu blic Health Genetics PhD (2009); Master of Science in Genetic Epidemiology (2009); Public Heal th Graduate Certificates (2010); Environmenta l and Occupational Health Sciences MS and PhD (2010) . Research and s ervice expectations and policies All faculty in the SPH are expected to engage in research, and all must comply with the standards for research established by the University though the Human Subjects Division and Office of Research. Specific policies for the SPH have been developed by SPHEC concerning which faculty titles can be principal investigators on externally funded grants and contracts. Research and service expectations for promoti on at each rank are established by the elected Faculty Council, approved by SPHEC, and published in the SPH Academic Affairs Handbook ( Appendix 1.5.B ). These expectations are described in Criterion 3.2.A. 1.5.C. A copy of the school's bylaws or other poli cy documents that determine the rights and obligations of administrators, faculty, and students in governance of the school. The SPH is guided and governed by a number policy documents. 1. The University of Washington Faculty Code: http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/FCG/FCGTOC.html 2. The policies of the Graduate School: http://www.grad.washington.edu/policies/ 3. The G raduate School Memoranda: http://www.grad.washington.edu/policies/memoranda/index.shtml 4.

University of Washington School of Public Health Page 39 1.5.D. Identification of school faculty who h old membership on university committees, through which faculty contribute to the activities of the university. SPH faculty serve on close to 100 University -level councils, committees, and advisory boards. These service activities are listed in Appendix 1.5.D along with the SPH faculty who serve on these. In addition, staff and student s participate on a number of University com mittees, especially committees involving diversity and University events. 1.5.E. Description of student roles in governance, includin g any formal student organizations. Each department has two s tudents elected to serve as University -wide Graduate and Professional Student Senators. Each senator represents student issues and concerns at the Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) meetings which occur on a semi -monthly basis. The senator is also responsible for appropriation of the annual GPSS allocation of budget money to the programs. Within the SPH, the Student Public Health Association (SPHA) and Undergraduate Student Public Health Association (USPHA) are official student groups whose purpose is to integrate and unify students across the multiple graduate and undergraduate departments and programs at the SPH , and to create a consolidated voice to address student concerns as th ey arise. They seek to promote a positive educational experience for all students by creating interdisciplinary learning experiences; encouraging open communication between departments and among students, the Dean's Office, and other SPH decision- making bo dies; and promoting cross -departmental social interaction for the purposes of enjoyment and networking. SPHA also delegates representatives to all SPH -wide comm ittees of student interest. C urrent committees with student representation include: School of P ublic Health Executive Committee Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee Diversity Committee Distance Learning and Learning Technologies Committee Accreditation Committee MPH Curriculum Review Work Group Tuition Committee Practicum Committee (positio n to be filled) Within all departments, students participate in governance a s appointed representatives at faculty meetings, and on admissions, curriculum, and academic affairs committees. In addition, t he Pathobiology program has a Student Affairs Committ ee that is charged with maintaining and increasing , as necessary, effective communication between the faculty and students of the Pathobiology Program . This past year, students also established the School of Public Health Student Advisory Council. The Council includes students from the departments (Graduate and Professional Student Senators), representatives from the Student Public Health Association and the Undergraduate Student Public Health Association, as well as representation from the various SPH-wide permanent and ad- hoc committees (see Figure 1.5.E on the next page ). While primarily an information -sharing body, the Student Advisory Council also serve s to advise the dean in budgeting matters and is involved in long and short range planning for the SPH. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 40 Figure 1.5.E . Composition of Public Health Student Advisory Council University of Washington School of Public Health Page 41 1.5.F. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH has an effective system of governance that gives faculty a major role in academic policy, promotion and tenure decisions, budget deliberations, and space allocation. The faculty play a dominant role in curricular and educational policy, appointments, promotion and tenure, and through the SPH Faculty Council . The committee structure in the SPH and departments includes student representation and functions effectively for communication, policy, planning, and evaluation. The SPH Academic Affairs Handbook , written by SPH faculty, gives a clear, comprehensive overview of appointment, promotion, and tenure criteria and procedures , as well as other SPH policies that affect faculty . Weaknesses/Challenges Because of competing demands, including, but not limited to, the nee d to compete for grant funding (faculty) and work obligations (students), faculty and students vary in the degree to which they are able to contribute to SPH governance and other University service. Plans Continue to upgrade the SPH website to provide cle ar access to University and SPH policies, procedures, and developments affecting the SPH community. Continue to encourage all departments to contribute broad faculty and student participation in planning, governance, and University service. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 42 1.6 FISCAL RESOURCES The school shall have financial resources adequate to fulfill its stated mission and goals, and its instructional, research and service objectives. 1.6.A. Description of the budgetary and allocation processes, including all sources of funding supportive of the instruction, research and service activities. This description should include, as appropriate, discussion about legislative appropriations, formula for funds distribution, tuition generation and retention, gifts, grant s and contracts, indirect cost recovery, taxes or levies imposed by the university or other entity within the university, and other policies that impact the fiscal resources available to the school. This section summarizes the financial picture of the SPH . First, the different types of revenues that the SPH uses for its operations are described . Second, the allocation processes for each of these revenue streams are described in two parts: a) the historical allocation process, and b) the future allocation process. This distinction is important because the University is currently implementing an Activity -Based Budgeting (ABB) system for F iscal Y ear (FY) 13. This will significantly alter the future allocation processes. Finally, this section will summarize the major financial trends for the SPH over the past seven years. Types of r evenues s treams The SPH has four revenue streams. 1. Designated Operating Funds (DOF) : These consist primarily of indirect cost recovery funds from grants and contracts. 2. General Operatin g Funds (GOF) : There are two sources of GOF: a) University -controlled funds which are a combination Washington S tate funds allocated by the s tate legislature to the University and tuition revenues; and b ) a state appropriation from the State Industrial Ins urance Fund specifically targeted to the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Science . 3. Other Operating Funds (OOF) : These are primarily revenues from endowments. 4. Restricted Operating Fun ds (ROF) : These funds fall into four categories: a) g rants and contracts; b) extension tuition and fees ( tuition and fees from self -sustaining academic programs and classes taught through the University Educational Outreach division) ; c) revenues from recharge centers (e.g., transfers for biostatistical consu ltation ); and d) gifts. Summary of allocation p rocesses Historical Allocation Process ( pre-2012 ) DOF : These funds are primarily indirect cost recovery (ICR) . Historically the University returned the full school allotment of indirect costs. In FY11, for ex ample, this amount was equal to 43 percent of the total indirect costs generated from SPH's sponsored awards. Each year, SPHEC decided how much of these funds would be kept in the dean's office for common services (e.g., student support, database managemen t) and the remainder (generall y over 9 5 percent of total ICR) was allocated to the departments in proportion to how much ICR they generated. GOF : In the historical allocation, there was no way to distinguish between tuition revenue and University allocati ons from the state treasury. The distribution of GOF funds to the academic units was based on the historical amount received in the prior year , with a percentage increase (or decrease) dictated by the availability of funds and directives from the s tate l egislature. Prior to 2012, GOF funds were passed directly to the departments (and the o ffice of the dean, for its allocation), in proportion to the previous biennial allocation . Occasionally, additional U niversity funds \u2014either one -time or ongoing \u2014were added to the allocation to the SPH for specific purposes (e.g., program expansions, minority faculty recruitment, dean's recruitment package, etc.) . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 43 The component of GOF from the state Industrial Insurance Fund was allocated solely to the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Services. No University or dean's office overhead was taken from these funds. OOF : The allocation process was a two -step process : a) the first two quarterly interest disbursements were kept by central administration as a form of overhead; b) a ll subsequent distributions were allocated to the departments that \" owned\" the endowments . No d ean's overhead was charged. ROF : These f unds were also allocated directly to the departments responsible for their generation. No dean's overhe ad was collected on these revenues . Current Allocation Process (2012 - present) Beginning (approximately) in FY12, both the University and SPH allocation methodology change d. At the University level the historical allocation of GOF has been discontinued, r eplaced by an Activities - Based Budgeting (AB B) methodology. Under this system, tuition- based revenue is allocated to schools by a complex formula involving a weighted average of student majors in, and student credit hours (SCH) taught by, each school. Thir ty percent of generated and collected tuition revenues are held back by the provost . In addition, a percentage of the SPH's share of indirect cost return is also re tained centrally. Finally, the provost uses these held funds and the (diminishing) legislative allocation to the University to provide \"Provost's Discretionary Funds\" to schools and colleges to ensure no school or college experiences a dramatic shortfall due to these changes, as well as to promote or compensate for other needs. At the SPH level, the allocation process also changed. First, because of ABB, there is no longer a separate, historically based allocation to the office of the dean . GOF, DOF, and revenues derived from teaching in the UW Educational Outreach division are now \" taxed \" (i.e., a dean's office tax) to provide for the operating expenses of the dean's office. Second, the internal SPH allocation of these funds is now made using a transparent methodology/algorithm to link allocations to departments with activity (ICR generation , student enrollments, and teaching). Third, because of program re organizations, the dean's office expenses now include the operations for two programs that had previously been housed in the Department of Epidemiology (Nutritional Sciences and Public Health Gene tics) and the new undergraduate Public Health m ajor. DOF : Because of the new U niversity methodology, the current model returns 35 percent of all Facilities and Administration ( F&A ) generated by SPH sponsored awards. This represents a net decrease in retur n of ICR to the SPH , as previously the SPH averaged 43 percent return of F&A which was off -set by a one - time provost award. GOF : The net tuition -based revenues are calculated by reducing the gross tuition by the amount of uncollected tuition, and then a 30 percent University overhead ta x is levied against the revenue; the remainder is allocated to the SPH for internal distribution. Fu nds from the State's Industrial Insurance Fund continue to be awarded directly to the Department of Environmental & Occupational Health . OOF : This allocation process is unchanged from the historical process . ROF : The process is unchanged for all types of ROF except University Educational Outreach tuition and fees. These fees are now subject to the dean's office tax . Changes in f inancial environment There have been three major changes in the external financial environment: 1. Large reduction in state support of the University : The state of Washington has reduced funding for the University of Washington by 50 percent since 2009. The following chart (Figure 1.6.A.i ) provides additional detail: University of Washington School of Public Health Page 44 Figure 1.6.A.i. Tuition and s tate funding 2. Minimal Growth in National Institutes of Health ( NIH) research budgets : As with other academic institutions, the University and the SPH have felt th e impacts of the minimal growth in NIH research budgets. The SPH generates over 80 percent of its operating budget from grants and contracts , with NIH being the single largest funder. The SPH has been successful in securing grant funding from NIH, but it has come at a greater cost as the funding level continues to decrease. 3. As seen in the chart, to maintain the same total funding , tuition revenues have increased significantly. This has had several repercussions. Tuition revenues were increased by raising th e tuition rates, and this directly impacts student recruitment. Additionally, school operations have changed as tuition revenues became an increasing component of the total revenues. In addition to the changes in the external environment, there have been t hree significant changes within the internal environment. 1. Creation of Global Health Department : The department of Global Health was created in 2007. The department is joint between the SPH and the School of Medicine. The department has experienced enormous growth and currently has the second largest research portfolio of all departments at the University. The department has proven to be a significant financial strength given the overall decrease in NIH funding. 2. Adoption of Activity -Based Budgeting (ABB) by the University : The University adopted an ABB model over the past seven years. F Y13 is the first year of full implementation after three years of implementation. As mentioned above, ABB directly ties the distribution of GOF to a school's teaching activities. This increases the SPH's ability to forecast, but it also creates very explicit financial incentives related to teaching. The full impact of ABB will be assessed over the next several years. 3. Implementation of modified ABB within the SPH : In response to ABB, the SPH has adopted a similar funding model for distribution of GOF to the departments. Full implementation of the SPH model will occur in FY 15 following three years of transition. T he model accounts for a broader range of school revenue sources since, due to the university ABB allocation system, the traditional pass- through of University funds to the departments is no longer possible . Throughout its implementation, the new SPH model will be evaluated by three criteria: impact on school programs , logistics of implementation , and acceptability. $00M$200M$400M$600M$800M Tuition Revenues State General Fund State Funds & Tuition University of Washington School of Public Health Page 45 University of Washington School of Public Health Page 46 Trends in the SPH Budget Overall Trend The chart below ( Figure 1.6.A.ii ) summarizes the strong financial growth of the SPH over the past seven years. This strength is particularly noteworthy given the strong negative pressures from the external environment that are highlighted above. There are no immediate financial concerns for the SPH.

Not applicable. 1.6.D. Identification of measurable objectives by which the SPH assesses the adequacy of its fiscal resources, along with data regarding the SPH's performance against those measures for each of the last three years. The UW school of Public Health uses the six measurable objectives below to track the adequacy of its resources.

Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The transition to activity -based budgeting (ABB) , recently implemented by the University of Washington , rewards the large amount of teaching, including service teaching , provided by SPH . The anticipated increase in the amount of undergraduate teaching and majors will result in increased revenue back to the SPH under the ABB model . The SPH houses a number of very large grants which, because of their size, will be unlikely to move from SPH . Changes in state policy have resulted in the University retaining all tuition revenues which , combined with ABB , give s the SPH more control over its revenues. SPH has more leeway in setting tuition for its graduate degrees. Weaknesses/Challenges There has been a 50 percent decline in state support for UW in the past three years, only partially made up by increases in tui tion funding coming to the UW . The transition to fee -based system s for some SP H programs (e.g., the Community- Oriented Public Health Practice MPH) places the entire cost of the program on students, who may also incur additional expenses for electives. The SPH has limited resources for student aid, outside of grant -based support (e.g., RA -ships and traineeships) The SPH is predominantly funded by grants and contracts (>80 percent of operating budget ), which is a source of significant vulnerability , particula rly in light of anticipated reductions in the level of federal funding of research . Faculty salaries compare poorly to those at our peer institutions. Gift and endowment revenues constitute an inadequate proportion of operating expenses . The Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences is heavily dependent on the funds it receives from the Industrial Insurance Fund , which is subject to political and legislative support for its continuing existence. Plans SPH is increasing its levels of teaching and enrollment, especially in the undergraduate programs . SPH has i ncreased investment in fund- raising staff; the dean is taking a hands- on role in seeking private and philanthropic support for SPH , including scholarships . The o ffice of the dean has h ired a grants manager to facilitate preparation of grant proposals. SPH CFO is developing improved tools for financial account and forecasting to improve financial management and planning throughout the SPH . SPH will c ontinue to use the UW Office of Contin uing and Professional Education for self - sustaining programs to expand its audiences, to increase revenues, and to diversify revenue sources . The criterion is met.

A concise statement or chart defining the headcount and FTE of non -faculty, non- student personnel (administration and staff). Table 1.7.C summarize s the number of nonfaculty, nonstudent employees at the SPH. Many of these individuals are attached to research projects. These numbers are a \" snap-shot\" on October 1 of each year. As can be seen from the table, the number of staff has remained fairly constant in recent years, as has the gender distribution and the percent of staff from underrepresented minorit y racial and ethnic groups. Because almost all employees are full -time, the calculation of F TE was not attempted. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 51 Table 1.7.C.

Description of the space available to the school for various purposes (offices, classrooms, common space for student use, etc.) by location. The SPH occupies 200,705 (72 percent ) net assignable square feet ( ASF) designated as \"on campus \" and an additional 79, 795 ( 28 percent ) ASF designated as \"off-campus \" for a total of 280,500 A SF (Appendix 1.7.D gives more detailed information on space by department and use ). Note t hat most classrooms supporting SPH instruction are not under the control of the SPH , but are assigned through the Classroom Services division of Health Sciences Administration . SPH Space by use (Table 1.7.D.i ): Faculty occupy 29 ,386 A SF; administration and staff (including service space and storage), 115,670 A SF; student use spaces , 2,126 A SF; wet laboratories (including animal quarters and lab service space), 46,960 A SF; computer space s, 1,046 A SF; specialized instruction spaces beyond general assignment classroom spaces (see below), 3,237 A SF; other non- laboratory research related spaces assigned to the SPH, 64,870 ASF; and conference space, 1 7,205 A SF. The following table summarizes SPH assigned spaces. Table 1.7.D .i. SPH space by usage category Usage Category On Campus Off Campus Total Assignable Sq. Ft. (ASF) % of the last CEPH review, SPH has doubled its total space up from 130,300 to 280,500 A SF. This growth has largely resulted from three factors: the creation of the Joint Department of Global Health (107,837 ASF); the University's acquisition of the UW Tower Building which hosts two floors (21,370 ASF) of expanded and consolidat ed SPH research projects serving the Biostatistics and Health Services Departments; and a rapid increase in the SPH's research portfolio in terms of annual award levels from $83 million in FY 05 to $153 million in FY 12. As noted, nearly all of the l ecture h alls, classrooms, and seminar rooms used by the SPH are administered by Health Sciences Administration under the oversight of the Board of Health Sciences Deans . They are shared among all health s ciences schools, and classroom scheduling can be problematic if room requests are not planned well in advance. While these rooms are not included in the accounting of SPH space, S PH University of Washington School of Public Health Page 52 does control 4,167 A SF in specialized instructional space devoted to unique SPH activities (e.g., Global Health C lassroom). Student Spaces (Table 1.7.D.ii ) Nowhere is the space landscape changing more than in spaces that best serve emerging student requirements. Laptops, smart phone s, Internet -based learning management systems, Skype, social network connections, and an expanded Wi-Fi reach mean accessing academic resources, finding conducive study areas, being connected to instruction and instructors, or even working collaboratively with fellow students is increasingly important . In the midst of these learning and electronic revolutions, traditional notions of space are evolving and require re -evaluation. An additional influence is the growing emphasis at UW on interprofessional learning and practice. This necessary shift will require new approaches to the design of learning and collabor ative learning spaces. Furthermore, with the addition of the Public Health u ndergraduate m ajor program, it has become increasingly important for SPH to provide both graduate and undergraduate space dedicated to student use. In May, 2013, the School will add the offices for the Public Health Major (300 ASF and a general student lounge (505 ASF) and). As a flexible open space, the lounge will provide a student controlled and managed gathering space for both undergraduate and graduate students. It will become a locus for student -sponsored talks, student association meetings, and a relaxed environment for catching up emails and informal chats with colleague students. Plans are underway for further remodeling of the key upper campus Raitt Hall location for interd isciplinary student activities and resource center (1,094 ASF). This Center is envisioned to provide space for upper campus advising, informational meetings, the Global Resource Center, and to stimulate cross- disciplinary collaboration with upper campus ac ademic units (Arts and Sciences, Public Affairs, International Affairs, Law School, School of Business, Education, Engineering, and the Information School). Throughout 2012- 13 academic year , SPH is conducting a future -oriented space design and programming initiative. One outcome will be to redefine student, support, and practice spaces that better match future trends and requirements. The University is committed to a multi -year capital initiative to transform the Health Sciences learning spaces (T -Wing) to address instructional requirement s in the coming 20 years and beyond. These spaces will be designed to be flexible spaces that can optimally utilize UW learning technologies as they are introduced. They will promote collaborative educational experiences f or our students and their health professional colleagues. Below is the distribution of student spaces including offices and carrels managed by each department. Table 1.7.D. ii.

The most significant of these independent research institution relationships include: the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Seattle Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital, Seattle Biomed, Group Health, and Chil dren's Hospital and Medical Center. SPH s pace plans: Looking forward, SPH plans to leverage the transdisciplinary resources of other campus units and the move toward interprofessional approaches to health professional education. A s part of the draf t South Campus Precinct Master Plan (see space placements concept diagram below Figure 1.7.D.) , the SPH is in the process of programming space for a new building through an aggressive capital campaign led by Dean Frumkin (up to 150,000 A SF). This space will retur n many of the off -campus faculty and their projects to the main campus. It will facilitate undergraduate and graduate student access to faculty and promote collaborations among the health s ciences s chools. Figure 1.7.D. South Campus Precinct Plan - Space Placement Concepts Diagram To lead efforts to transform the education of health professionals for improved health outcomes (local to global), S PH is actively participating in the Boar d of Health Sciences Deans' six -school Interprofessional \"D effort will a more efficient, highly collaborative , and cost -effective means for delivering health professionals ' education. It will utilize current, remodeled, and new -building spaces to promote innovative , transdisciplinary educational experiences and transform professional perspectives for both students and faculty . Included in this Health Sciences- wide initiative will be the creation of new , state-of-the-art general assignment instruction classrooms and supporting spaces/technologies , as well as an extensive modernization of current instruction spaces. Together, these capital projects will be the centerpiece of the University's next capital campaign. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 54 1.7.E.

A concise statement concerning the amount, location , and types of computer facilities and resources for students, faculty, administration , and staff. University of Washington computing resources The University provides faculty, staff, and s tudents several options for centrally managed resources for e- mail and websites (department, course, and individual ) that all the departments University of Washington School of Public Health Page 55 use through the University of Washington Information Technology (UW IT) organization . The University provides many services for faculty, staff, and students, such as cloud -based email, calendaring, and document management from Google and Microsoft Live, online access to articles from scientific journals, large poster and slide printing, nationwide Internet dialup servi ce, and wireless network access covering nearly 100 percent of all UW campus locations. Each year, the SPH applies for and receives between $10,000 and $50,000 of the University's technology innovation funds, which are supported by the UW student technology fee. These funds are used to extend student access to available technologies and services. The University provides free or discounted licensed software from Microsoft, Adobe , and other academic software companies to students, faculty, and staff for camp us and home use (thus extending the potential for remote access to UW resources). The UW has invested heavily in new computer and network- based technologies to enhance both research and instruction. \"UWired\" is the University of Washington forum for promoting broad- based discussions, experimentation, and analysis of the following areas: o Innovation in teaching and learning with technology tools (Tegrity and Canvas) o Fluency in information technology o New ways for students and faculty to access technology -enabled tools and resources UWired is the University's intellectual \"commons\" to address uses of information technology in all facets of the University 's instructional mission. UWired is not an operating unit but rather a source for new ideas about technology- enabled teaching , learning , and new practices and services, as well as the ongoing evaluation of such practices and services. SPH computing resources The SPH centrally maintains 13 servers to support web -based applications and their development for the SPH and its departments. The SPH provides a secure central database of faculty, grant, and student information and provides access to these data thro ugh secure data services, ShareP oint I ntranet , and reporting services websites. The SPH has developed and deployed web- based applications for use by the departments and programs, including: an events calendar, a content management system, faculty appointments and biographies, searchable faculty research interests, an alumni contact/mentoring information submissio n service, and a jobs listing service. A central report server provides links to real -time reports as well as to structured queries to access the UW's Enterprise Data Warehouse and Financial Cube for decision support and information retrieval . The departments and research centers also provide computer and information support. This is described in Appendix 1.7.F. 1.7.G. A concise description of library/information resources available for school use, including a description of library capacity to provide digi tal (electronic) content, access mechanisms, training opportunities and document- delivery services. UW Libraries is a network of 25 facilities serving three campuses : Seattle main campus, and the Bothell and Tacoma branch campuses. Available electronically and via reference services on a 24/7 global basis (\"Any Time Any Place Library\"), the UW Libraries system maintains a collection of more than 7 million cataloged volumes (1.8 million in annual checkouts) and journal articles available via download; an equ al number of older journals in microform format; more than 100,000 L ibraries -licensed online journal titles with access to 120,000 journals; 500,000 electronic books; 600,000 locally digitized items within 300 collections , and several million items in othe r formats. Annually, the UW Libraries system supports 3 million separate log -in sessions to over 300 Libraries -databases. See the fact sheet in Appendix 1.7.G . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 56 To maintain pace with global service requirements and rapidly expanding electronic tools, the sy stem is constantly evolving to provide worldwide access to growing electronic collections. In 2011, over 15,000 reference questions were responded to; 750,000 student uses were drawn up of digitized items via course reserve, and 9 million separate sessions were conducted on Libraries' websites. The UW Libraries Catalog is a fully integrated, computerized system that provides bibliographic information and circulation status for the cataloged holdings of the University Libraries. Important for the Public He alth community, the six health sciences s chools created access to a library program tailored to the special requirements of health professions. The mission of the Health Sciences Library (HSL) is to advance scholarship, research, education , and health care by anticipating information needs, providing essential resources, and facilitating learning for the greater health sciences community. The HSL staff strives to integrate this knowledge at the point of use for clinicians, researchers, administrators, instr uctors , and students within a distributed multi -state educational environment. HSL supports six schools: Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Social Work. A primary user population of over 25,000 students and faculty are located both on campus and at clinical sites through the five -state WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho) region. Serving this large geographic area requires us to focus our efforts on providing web- based knowledge resources regardless of physical location of the user. The HSL contracts with the National Library of Medicine to be the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, Pacific Northwest Region, connecting health professions across the region to information services. HSL staff includes 27 FTE professionals and 15 FTE classified staff and student assistants, including 12 FTEs funded by grants and contracts for special projects. Knowledge resources include 5,940 current print journal subscriptions; 408,675 book titles, which include all textbooks and media; 940 electronic journals, and 283 databases available via the web. All online content is made available through the HSL website which includes links to all the UW Libraries' electronic resources.

Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths SPH has a large faculty representing all core public health areas. Student -facul ty ratios in all departments allow students to benefit from frequent and consistent contact with faculty . Resources of the University of Washington, including libraries, computing infrastructure, and laboratories, are a major asset and resource for SPH stu dents, faculty, and staff. The SPH is co -located with other health s ciences schools and physically close to the rest of the University, which promotes shared educational, research, service, and administrative collaboration. Faculty enjoy extraordinarily cl ose working arrangements with neighboring research, clinical, and public health resources, many of whom have formal affiliation agreements with the University and the SPH . Weaknesses/Challenges The size and complexity of the SPH's student body, programs, r esearch, and service activities continues to place difficult demands on financial and space resources. Approximately half of SPH space is located outside of the Health Sciences Campus . This s pace dispersion inhibits student -faculty, student -student, and f aculty -faculty interaction s. The need for classroom space, particularly for small seminar rooms, is increasing, which limits the flexibility of scheduling new courses or additional sections of courses. We hav e inadequate student space. Plans The dean has p laced a high priority on a \"School of Public Health Building ,\" and the dean and the advancement team are actively seeking donors for this building . The criterion is partially met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 59 1.8 DIVERSITY The school shall demonstrate a commitment to diversity and shall evidence an ongoing practice of cultural competence in learning, research and service practices. 1.8.A. A written plan and/or policies demonstrating systematic incorporation of diversity within the school. Required elements include the following: i. Description of the school's under -represented populations, including a rationale for the designation. ii. A list of goals for achieving diversity and cultural competence within the school, and a description of how diversity -related goals are consisten t with the university's mission, strategic plan and other initiatives on diversity, as applicable. iii. Policies that support a climate free of harassment and discrimination and that value the contributions of all forms of diversity; the school should als o document its commitment to maintaining/using these policies. iv. Policies that support a climate for working and learning in a diverse setting. v. Policies and plans to develop, review and maintain curricula and other opportunities including service learning that address and build competency in diversity and cultural considerations. vi. Policies and plans to recruit, develop, promote and retain a diverse faculty. vii. Policies and plans to recruit, develop, promote and retain a diverse staff. viii. Policies and plans to recruit, admit, retain and graduate a diverse student body. ix. Regular evaluation of the effectiveness of the above- listed measures. 1.8.A.i. Description of the SPH's underrepresented populations, including a rationale for the design ation. The SPH defines underrepresented populations as Hispanic/Latinos, African -Americans, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders because individuals in these groups a) have historically been underrepresented in the SPH in comparison with their numbers i n the general populations , and b) their voices in the SPH and their membership in the public health profession are essential to eradicating inequities in health status in our community, the nation, and the world . Ethnicity and race, however, are not the on ly characteristics that may affect the inclusiveness and climate in the SPH. Differences in privilege, s ocioeconomic status , family history of participation in higher education, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, nationality, religion, and mi litary status also demand that leadership, faculty, students , and staff conduct themselves with cultural awareness, respect, and appreciation for the value of diversity in our school and our profession. 1.8.A.ii. A list of goals for achieving diversity and cultural competence within the SPH , and a description of how diversity -related goals are consistent with the U niversity's mission, strategic plan , and other initiatives on diversity, as applicable. One of the seven Strategic Plan goals for the SPH is to \"Improve our diversity .\" Below we list the objectives and strategies that were specified in the Strategic Plan . Establish a standing diversity committee in consultation with the SPH community. (DONE) Promulgate policies and communications designed to improv e diversity. Strengthen diversity within the curriculum. Review the current curriculum to ensure core requirements for students in all programs include material and methodologies for understanding and addressing socioeconomic status, class, race, and othe r social determinants of health. Diversify the SPH's faculty and staff. Develop SPH -wide recruitment policies with guidelines and measurable goals that build on existing guidelines and draw on successful models. These policies should hold search committe es, chairs, and the dean accountable for taking actions that ensure searches produce a University of Washington School of Public Health Page 60 diverse pool of applicants. Design and disseminate SPH guidelines for mentoring and retention programs for underrepresented minority faculty and staff. Strengthen recruitment and mentoring of students from underrepresented populations. Develop and implement a robust student recruitment policy that promote s a diverse student body . Establish \"pipelines\" through connections to middle schools, high schools, and community colleges. Invest in community- building events and professional development activities for students from underrepresented populations. These goals are entirely in concert with those of the University as a whole. Over the past several years, the University of Washington has engaged in a series of planning initiatives to shape its future as a premier research and education institution in the context of changing demographics, challenges of global scale, and tough economic times. As part of planning for change, the president asked the chief diversity officer to lead the University Diversity Council in developing goals and strategic priorities to embed diversity across the University. The UW Diversity Council drafted a Diversity Blueprint (Appendix 1.8.A .i), which defines six goals encompassing major areas of emphasis for diversity: leadership and governance; student, faculty , and staff diversity; curriculum and research; and institutional and classroom climate. For each goal, there are strategic priorities and recom mended action steps for both administrative and academic units and persons who will be accountable for oversight and progress. Institutional level metrics have been developed by a team of University assessment professionals and researchers. The Blueprint i s a guide for planning. Each a cademic and administrative unit, including the SPH, is developing a plan based on assessment of needs and priorities in relation to those identified in the Blueprint. The sum total of these planning efforts will constitute a U niversity of Washington Diversity Plan. 1.8.A.iii. Policies that support a climate free of harassment and discrimination and that value the contributions of all forms of diversity; the school should also document its commitment to maintaining/using these p olicies. The University of Washington, as an institution established and maintained by the people of the state, is committed to providing equality of opportunity and an environment that fosters respect for all members of the University community. The U niversity and the S PH support a climate free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in Executive Order N o. 31: Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action (http://www.washington.e du/admin/rules/policies/PO/EO31.html ). This policy has the goal of promoting an environment that is free of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. To facilitate that goal, the University retains the authority to discipline or take appropriate correc tive action for any conduct that is deemed unacceptable or inappropriate, regardless of whether the conduct rises to the level of unlawful discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Specifically, this policy: Prohibits discrimination or harassment against a member of the University community because of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, citizenship, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, or military status. Prohibits any member of the University community, including, but not limited to, the faculty, staff, or students, from discriminating against or unlawfully harassing a member of the public on any of the above grounds while engaged in activities directly related to the nature of their Universit y affiliation. Prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports concerns regarding discrimination or harassment, or who cooperates with or participates in any investigation of allegations of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 61 1.8.A.iv. Pol icies that support a climate for working and learning in a diverse setting. The University of Washington School of Public Health is committed to developing a more diverse and culturally competent faculty, staff, and student body in order to better serve communities in our region and beyond. Our commitment to diversity is supported by the UW Board of Regents. Underlying all public health research and training activities is an appreciation of the effect that cultural and socioeconomic diversity have on the he alth of communities. There must be an understanding of the behaviors, attitudes, and policies that enable public health to work effectively in cross- cultural situations. We recognize that cultural and sociodemographic diversity enriches the process of disc overy by engendering multiple modes of thinking about problems and communicating ideas. Opportunities for enrichment accrue to those institutions that successfully cultivate diversity within their educational, research, and outreach activities. Schools tha t fail to achieve and maintain a diverse constituency of students, faculty, and staff risk becoming increasingly removed from leading- edge educational and research opportunities in public health and losing relevance in their communities. All regions of the country, including the Pacific Northwest, are becoming more diverse in racial and ethnic makeup. As the problem of racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes continues to grow, policymakers and the general public increasingly look to health professi onal schools to address these urgent and unacceptable circumstances. Because we are one of the few schools of public health in the Northwest, it is particularly important f or us to be up to the challenge (http://sph.washington.edu/prospective/diversity.asp ). The SPH aims to create a climate that supports working and learning in a diverse setting through the following policies: 1. Encouraging engagement in learning and high academic achievemen t for all students . Ensuring that all underrepresented students participate equitably in high- impact educational experiences. Providing adequate assistance and support infrastructure to ensure access to and success in high - impact educational experiences fo r underrepresented students . Creating more high- impact programs focused on diversity . Increasing underrepresented student interaction with faculty particularly in areas such as career advising, mentorship for graduate and professional study, internships, a nd professional development opportunities . Providing leadership development around diversity issues for all UW students interested in becoming peer mentors, facilitators, or participants in other leadership activities . 2. Ensuring that the built environment i s welcoming and accessible for all people and cultures. Encourag ing a new perspective on accessibility that prioritizes Universal Design over compliance and Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA) minimums, and build this into practice . Monitoring and addres sing access/infrastructure for students with diverse needs, such as observation of religious customs and gender neutral bathrooms . Monitoring and addressing restroom accessibility issues for students with mobility concerns , particularly in reference to classroom space/restroom proximity . Encourag ing diverse visual and physical representations across campus from art installations to building design to website and media campaigns . 3. V iewing disability as a type of diversity and hav ing resources in place to help students with disabilities thrive within SPH . The University of Washington Disability Resources for Students Office (DRS) was established in 1978 following the enactment of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by the U.S. Congress. Section University of Washington School of Public Health Page 62 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), mandate that appropriate and reasonable academic accommodations be provided to students with disabilities. In addition our Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking , and Technology (DO -IT) Center provides resources for faculty to make their curricula more accessible for students with disabilities http://www.washington.edu/doit/Faculty/Resources/Doit/ . Since 1978, we have been committed to providing academic accommodations to qualified students with disabilities at the UW. DRS strives to support the Univer sity in the inclusion of students with disabilities as independent, responsible, and productive members of the campus community. 1.8.A.v. Policies and plans to develop, review and maintain curricula and other opportunities including service learning that address and build competency in diversity and cultural considerations. Topics related to diversity and cultural competence a re covered in several courses offered by the SPH. Cultural competency is currently covered as a three week module in HSERV 510: Soci ety and Health , which is required of all MPH students. Several other courses on racial/ethnic disparities are offered within the SPH and other health sciences schools (including EPID and Health Care Disparities; FAMED 525: African American Health and Health Disparity). In addition to the coursework offered by the SPH, the SPH and departments include aspects of cultural competency as part of their student orientation s. SPH has joined other health s ciences s chools to choose a \"Common Book\" that all incoming students are expected to read. This year, the book focused on cultural competence in public health and has created opportunities for dialogue throughout the entire school year. The SPH Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee and the departmental curriculum committees are responsible for the review , development, and maintenance of coursework and educational opportunities that address diversity, health disparities, and cultural competency. Each degree program has competencies related to these themes. As part of the implementation of the SPH Strategic Plan , the Diversity Committee, together with the MPH Curriculum Review Work Group, is currently reviewing the MPH curriculum to identify areas where cultural competency and diversi ty-related content are covered and/or could be improved. In addition, the SPH Office of Student Affairs strives to provide students with service- learning opportunities that will enab le them to interact with diverse populations in a public health setting. This takes place through SPH -wide service days, regularly publicized volunteer opportunities and the MPH practicum experience. 1.8.A.vi. Policies and plans to recruit, develop, promote and retain a diverse faculty. The SPH Diversity Committee, as one of its first priorities , has developed a set of guidelines for faculty searches. These guidelines have been approved by the dean , department chairs, and the Faculty Council, and are now b eing used for all SPH faculty searches/recruitments. They are summarized below and included as Appendix 1.8.A.ii . 1. Department chair s should determine whether women and racial/ethnic minorities are unde rrepresented on faculty at the d epartmental level, and s et departmental priorities for hiring based on this information. Search committees should be made aware of d epartmental priorities prior to beginning the search. 2. New faculty should be hired using a deliberate search process, which should involve convening a search committee to review and recommend candidates. 3. Chair s should ensure diverse representation on search committees. Committees should include a minimum of one student . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 63 4. Search committees should include recommended language regarding diversity in job advertisements (see figure below) . 5. Search committees should market positions widely, including outreach to minority- serving institutions, professi onal organizations , and LISTSERVs . Committee members should make personal contact with diverse candidates. 6. Search committees should recruit candidates until applicant pool includes adequate representation from women and underrepresented minorities and reflects the hiring priorities of the department. The department chair will review the diversity of the pool of el igible candidates before candidates are asked to come for campus visits. 7. Search committees should consider diversity in their review of candidates and use s election criteria that include diversity- related teaching, research , and service experience. The Div ersity Committee will provide examples of criteria, if needed. 8. Search committees should structure the interview process such that it ensures that candidates meet with a diverse group of interviewers and are made aware of diversity efforts within the SPH and on campus. Diversity committee members are available to meet with candidates during campus visits, if needed. 9. All searches that result in a potential offer must submit a diversity report to the office of the dean along with the draft offer letter for the dean's review and approval. The faculty diversity search checklist reporting f orm can be found in Appendix 1.8.A.iii. LANGUAGE FOR JOB ADS The UW School of Public Health is committed to a diverse academic community . We view diversity as essential to our mission, for more information please see the following website: http://www.washington.edu/diversity/ . The University of Washington is an Equal Opportunity Affirmative Action employer. The Un iversity is building a culturally diverse faculty and staff and strongly encourages applications from women, underrepresented minorities, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans. The University's Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (EOAA) also reviews advertisements for new faculty openings prior to their submission for publication to ensure compliance with University, state, and federal regulations. There is a multi -tiered process for review of any advertisement for faculty openings to ensure that diversity goals are considered and regulations are met. The University may make special recruitment and outreach efforts to increase the pool of qualified minority and women applicants, and schools and departments are expected to do so. Departments will continue to receive information regarding potential minority candidates. Recognizing that good recruitment efforts may incur additional costs, the p rovost's o ffice may augment departmental funds for these purposes. Nondepartmental funds may be available to meet requirements of new hires. In terms of retention, there are several affinity groups for diverse faculty and staff. All faculty are assigned mentors within their departments to help through the tenure and promotion process, inc luding third -year reviews and annual reports. Department chairs also review workloads of their faculty to ensure that mentorship to underrepresented students and service to underrepresented communities are recognized in the tenure and promotion process. Th e Diversity Committee plans to review policies related to promotion and retention of diverse faculty and make recommendations as needed. 1.8.A.vii. Policies and plans to recruit, develop, promote and retain a diverse staff. SPH is committed to recruitment and retention of a diverse staff. We view the recruitment, hiring, and retention of excellent and diverse staff as critical to academic excellence, and to the future of public health's efforts to promote health and eliminate health disparities. The priorit y of the D iversity University of Washington School of Public Health Page 64 Committee has been to focus on the recruitment and retention of diverse faculty; however, the C ommittee plans to create a similar set of recommendations for hiring staff. 1.8.A.viii. Policies and plans to recruit, admit, retain and gradu ate a diverse student body. The SPH Office of Student Affairs recently hired a 50 percent FTE to focus specifically on recruitment and prospective student outreach, with an emphasis on diversity. This position, in partnership with staff and faculty within the SPH , as well as offices across campus, is in the process of developing a comprehensive plan to recruit and retain a diverse student population. Current efforts focus on the following: Assessing recruitment efforts that are currently underway within the SPH Networking with established University of Washington offices to include the SPH in diversity related recruitment efforts locally, regionally , and nationally Developing a SPH -specific outreach plan focused specifically on underserved minorities Updating existing and creating new marketing materials Establish pipelines wi th community colleges and high s chools in the area The SPH D iversity C ommittee is also committed to the retention and graduation of our diverse students; to this end, the Committee is seeking to establish more formal opportunities for student mentorship. Additionally, the Office of Student Affairs connects students to existing resources on campus that serve diverse students, including the Q Center, the Graduate Opportunities and Minority Achievement Program, and the Center for Experiential Learning and Diversity. In partnership, the Diversity Committee and the OSA is implementing a quarterly event series focused on various aspects of diversity and incorporating diverse voices. 1.8.A.ix. R egular evaluation of the effectiveness of the above- listed measures. Evaluation of the policies and activities identified above is the responsibility of the Diversity Committee (described below) , which will compile an annual Diversity Report , including qua ntitative metrics and an accounting of concrete efforts to \"Improve our diversity\" as outlined in the SPH Strategic Plan . This report will be presented to the dean , SPHEC, and Faculty Council and will include recommendations for needed action. In addition, as described in Criterion 1.2 , the annual departmental reports to the dean include substantial reporting requirements for describing diversity -related activities at the department level . A copy of the most recent report can be found in Appendix 1.8.A.iv. 1.8.B. Evidence that shows the plan or policies are being implemented. Examples may include mission/goals/objectives that reference diversity or cultural competence, syllabi and other course materials, lists of student experiences demonstrating diverse settings, records and statistics on faculty, staff and student recruitment, admission and retention. As mandated by the SPH Strategic Plan , a standing SPH Diversity Committee was created in March 2012. This committee replaced the SPH's Diversity Task Force and was given a broader and clearer mandate, as described ab ove. This 18-member group of students, staff , and faculty includes representation from each department, as well as the d ean's o ffice. This group has been charged with developing and advocating for policies and initiatives that will improve the diversity of the SPH community. The Committee reports to the dean of the School of Public Health and is responsible for mobilizing students, staff, and faculty to support and implement such policies and initia tives. The by -laws and committee charge are included as Appendix 1.5.A. vi. The first priority of the committee has been the development of strong er policies to ensure that faculty searches are conducted in a manor to maximize the diversity of the applicant pool, as described in Criterion 1.8.A.vi above. In the past several years, searches for faculty in the SPH have utilized a predecessor of the current guidelines, the \"Faculty Advancement Recruitment Toolkit\" that was developed by the previous Diversity Ta sk Force. In the past two years, 14 of the 26 new faculty hires University of Washington School of Public Health Page 65 were from diverse backgrounds. In response to strong student interest, a student subcommittee has been formed to discuss and address student needs and concerns related to diversity. The subcom mittee leaders report to the Diversity Committee at its monthly meetings. 1.8.C. Description of how the diversity plan or policies were developed, including an explanation of the constituent groups involved. The overall plan for \" Improving our diversity \" was established through broad input from all SPH stakeholders during the 2011 -12 strategic plan ning process (described in Criterion 1.1) . The SPH Diversity Committee is charged with determining priorities and establishing a work plan to implement the Strate gic Plan . 1.8.D. Description of how the plan or policies are monitored, how the plan is used by the school and how often the plan is reviewed. The Diversity Co mmittee is the focal point for d iversity planning, implementation, and moni toring of diversity i mprovement efforts in the SPH. In this work, the Diversity Committee is guided by the UW Diversity Blueprint and the SPH Strategic Plan . Criterion 1.8.A.ix, above , describes the evaluation procedure s that have been established to monitor planning, activity , and progress. The s pecial a ssistant to the d ean al so regularly monitors progress o n the implementation of this goal \u2014as well as all other goals\u2014 of the SPH Strategic Plan (http://sph .washington.edu/strategicplan/implementation.asp ). 1.8.E. Identification of measurable objectives by which the school may evaluate its success in achieving a diverse complement of faculty, staff, and students, along with data regarding the performance of the program against those measures for each of the last three years. CEPH Data Template 1.8.1. At a minimum, the school must include four objectives, at least two of which relate to race/ethnicity. Measurable objectives must align with the school's definition of under -represented populations in Criterion 1.8.a. Table 1.8.E (CEPH Data Template 1.8.1) summarizes the trends in achieving a diverse complement of faculty, staff, and students. Table 1.8.E.

Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths At all le vels, the University and the SPH support improving diversity composition and climate. Improving diversity is one of seven goals articulated in the 2012- 2020 SPH Strategic Plan . SPH has an energetic Diversity Committee with representation by faculty, studen ts, and staff from throughout the SPH . The hiring of diverse faculty has improved in the past two years. New policies and procedures are in place to promote more vigorous searches for diverse faculty hire, including a diversity report that has to be filed with the dean's office for all faculty searches that results in an offer. The dean requires an annual accounting from the chairs on the efforts made in their departments to increase the diversity of students, staff, and faculty, improve the diversity clima te, and enhance the curricular content related to culture, inequities, and health disparities. The UW Office of Disability is one of the leaders in the field . Weaknesses/Challenges As illustrated by the data in Table 1.8.E., the SPH is far from meeting it s targets for a diverse faculty . There has not been a careful review of how diversity and health inequities are examined and treated in courses taught by all departments in the SPH . SPH lacks resources to make attractive recruitments for diverse faculty and students . Plans The SPH Diversity Committee now reports annually to SPHEC on issues, accomplishments, policies, recommendations, and initiatives to enhance diversity in the SPH. In collaboration with the SPH Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee, the Diversity Committee will strengthen diversity within the SPH's curricula, including material and methodologies for understanding and addressing socioeconomic status, class, race, and other social determinants of health. The SPH will use teaching system s such as Tegrity (video lecture capture software) to help students with hearing handicaps. The Diversity Committee will develop and implement recruitment policies and measurable goals that ensure searches produce diverse applicant pools. The Diversity Com mittee will also d evelop and implement initiatives for mentoring and retention of underrepresented minority faculty, staff , and students. The Diversity Committee will work to create and sustain a welcoming climate for divers e faculty, staff, and students . The Diversity Committee will also d evelop and implement activities including ongoing professional development for faculty and staff so that they can provide such a climate for students and for each other, and build an environment that is welcoming and acce ssible for all people and cultures. The leadership of the SPH will continue to raise financial resources to recruit and retain faculty and students from diverse and/or disadvantaged backgrounds. This criterion is partially met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 67 CRITERION 2.0: INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS 2.1 DEGREE OFFERINGS The school shall offer instructional programs reflecting its stated mission and goals, leading to the Master of Public Health (MPH) or equivalent professional masters degree in at least the five areas of knowledge basic to public health. The school may offer other degrees, professional and academic, and other areas of specialization, if consistent with its mission and resources. 2.1.A. An instructional matrix presenting all of the SPH's degree programs and areas of speciali zation. If multiple areas of specialization are available within departments or academic units shown on the matrix, these should be included. The matrix should distinguish between public health professional degrees, other professional degrees , and academic degrees at the graduate level, and should distinguish baccalaureate public health degrees from other baccalaureate degrees. The matrix must identify any programs that are offered in distance learning or other formats. Non -degree programs, such as certific ates or continuing education, should not be included in the matrix. The SPH offers a wide range of professional and academic degrees. These are listed in Table 2.1.A . (CEPH Template 2.1) and summarized below. Undergraduate degrees The SPH offers three undergraduate degree programs: BS in Environmental Health, BA or BS in Public Health, and BS in Health Informatics and Health Information Management. The Department of Global Health sponsors an undergraduate minor. Professional degrees: MPH : The Master of Public Health is offered in the five core areas: Biostatistics, Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, Epidemiology, Health Services, and Social and Behavioral Sciences (which is administered through the Department of Health Services). In addition, t he SPH provide s opportunities for pursuing an MP H in several subspecialty areas: maternal and child health, global health, nutritional sciences, public health genetics, and other sub- specializations as indicated in Table 2.1.A . The SPH offers one option fo r an executive ( part-time/part distance) MPH program: the Executive MPH ( eMPH) administered through the Department of Health Services. MHA : The SPH also administers a Master of Health Administration (MHA) degree. This degree, offered in both in- resident an d executive formats , is formally in the Graduate School's interdisciplinary group structure. Nevertheless, the administrative responsibility, the academic leadership, and the majority of faculty for these programs are housed in the SPH's Department of Heal th Services. Master of Health Informatics and Health Information Management (MHIHIM) : In Autumn quarter 2013, the SPH will offer a new master 's degree in Health Informatics and Health Information Management. This program will prepare graduates to lead the development of enterprise -scale health care and public health information management systems, and integrate health data and electronic health records. Academic degrees: The SPH offers Master of Science (MS) and doctorate degrees (PhD) through the Departm ents of Biostatistics, Environmental and Occupational Health Science s, Epidemiology, Global Health, and Health Services, as well as through the interdisciplinary programs in Nutritional Sciences and Public Health Genetics. SPH also offers (within the Depar tment of Global Health) a PhD program in Pathobiology . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 68 Concurrent ( joint) degree programs In response to interest from colleagues and students in other UW schools, SPH has created a large number of concurrent (joint) degree programs with other s chools/ colleges of the University: Arts and Sciences (Anthropology), Business, Dentistry, International Affairs, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Public Affairs, and Social Work. The concurrent programs are administered by specific departments in the SPH , as indicated in the Table 2.1.A.

Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate- level pr ofessional and academic degree programs. The SPH offers MPH programs in each of the five core areas of knowledge basic to public health, as well as in a number of other public health specialties. The SPH also offers a graduate professional degree in Health Administration and will be adding a Master of Health Information & Health Information Management in autumn 2013. The SPH offers part -time MPH and MHA degrees for mid -career working professionals. The SPH offers PhD degree programs in each of the five cor e areas of knowledge basic to public health (a PhD in the areas of social and behavioral sciences can be pursued as a concentration in the Health Services PhD ). The SPH collaborates with other UW school s and departments to provide a large number of concurr ent degree programs. Weaknesses/Challenges The large number of degree, concurrent degree, and certificate programs offered by the SPH can be confusing to potential applicants. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 72 Plans Continue to enhance the SPH's website to help potential applicants under stand the SPH's offerings and choose the program(s) best suited to their needs and interests. Continue to expand and improve the SPH's professional and academic programs to meet the changing needs and opportunities in the field. Continue to develop innovat ive programs to meet the evolving educational needs of the field. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 73 2.2 PROGRAM LENGTH An MPH degree program or equivalent professional public health masters degree must be at least 42 semester -credit units in length. 2.2.A. Definitio n of a credit with regard to classroom/contact hours. The University of Washington School of Public Health , consistent with the rest of the campus , schedules classes on the \" Quarter System .\" Quarters have an instructional period of 10 weeks. A \"credit\" is equivalent to 1 contact hour per week, or 10 contact hours per quarter. The general expectation is that for each contact hour, students will spend two to three hours out of class reading, studying, preparing assignments, etc. Therefore, a student enrolled in a 3- credit course would usually spen d 30 hours in class and 60- 90 hours working outside of class on the course. For courses that do not have formal in- class sessions ( e.g., thesis work, fieldwork, etc.), the expectation is that the student will devote b etween 30 and 40 hours per credit per quarter on the course . 2.2.B. Information about the minimum degree requirements for all professional public health masters degree curricula shown in the instructional matrix. If the school or university uses a unit of academic credit or an academic term different from the standard semester or quarter, this difference should be explained and an equivalency presented in a table or narrative. All Master of Public Health (MPH) degrees require a minimum of 63 (quarter) credi ts. The Master of Administration (MHA) degree, in -residence and e xecutive versions (EMHA) , require a minimum of 72 and 68 (quarter) credits , respectively . 2.2.C. Information about the number of professional public health masters degrees awarded for fewer than 42 semester credit units, or equivalent, over each of the last three years. A summary of the reasons should be included. All SPH MPH programs require a minimum of 63 quarter credits (equivalent to 42 semester credits).The SPH has not awarded any MPH d egrees to any student who took fewer than 63 qua rter credits in the past 3 years. 2.2.D. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths SPH mee ts the requirements of the Council on Education for Public Health for program length. Weaknesses/Challenges None. Plans None. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 74 2.3 PUBLIC HEALTH CORE KNOWLEDGE All graduate professional degree public health students must complete suff icient coursework to attain depth and breadth in the five core areas of public health knowledge. 2.3.A. Identification of the means by which the school assures that all graduate professional degree students have fundamental competence in the areas of knowl edge basic to public health. If this means is common across the school, it need be described only once. If it varies by degree or program area, sufficient information must be provided to assess compliance by each program. All students enrolled in MPH degr ee programs are required to take a course in each of the five core public health areas as defined by CEPH. All department s have an introductory course that meets the requirement for the MPH core knowledge areas. Biostatistics 511 Environmental and Occupati onal Health 511 Epidemiology 511 Health Services 510 (Social and Behavioral Sciences) Health Services 511 For in -residence students, there are several options for meeting these requirement s (Table 2.3.A.i .). These options are either more advanced courses (e.g., Epidemiology 512 and 513 substituting for Epidemiology 511) or courses that are designed to be more relevant for certain MPH majors ( e.g., Global Health 511 for Health Services 511) . Students in the Executive MPH (eMPH) have alternative choices in some areas. The Community- Oriented Public Health Practice (COPHP) has an integrated two -year series of problem - based learning modules that address all five core areas. These modules are organized as indicated in Appendix 2.3.A . All MPH students are requ ired to undertake a practicum, as described in Criterion 2.4 . In addition, all MPH students conduct a culminating project , as described in Criterion 2.5. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 75 Table 2.3.A .

Although this is an in tegrated curriculum, each quarter concentrates on different core are as of knowledge using a problem -based learning (PBL) pedagogy (See Appendix 2.3.A ). 2.3.B. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths , weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths All MPH student s have well -defined requirements to assure fundamental competence in the areas of knowledge basic to public health. In-resident MPH students have options for fulfilling these requi rements. For some programs, course requirements to ensure fundamental competence in the areas of knowledge basic to public health have been crafted to be relevant to their major field of interest (e.g., public health practice, global health) . SPH Curriculu m and Educational Policy Committee (CEPC) is responsible for overseeing the MPH programs and ensuring that all programs adequately address the areas of knowledge basic to public health. The CEPC must approve any substitutions for the required courses. CEPC defines and approves the expected core competencies for the MPH programs. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 76 Weaknesses/Challenges Students who enter the MPH programs vary in their prior education and work experience, which makes it harder to create standard core courses that fit everyo ne's learning goals. Plans Continue to coordinate and monitor the equivalency of alternative courses that address the core public health areas of knowledge to ensure they adequately address the expected MPH core competencies. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 77 2.4 PRACTICAL SKILLS All graduate professional public health degree students must develop skills in basic public health concepts and demonstrate the application of these concepts through a practice experience that is relevant to students' areas of specialization . 2.4.A. Description of the school's policies and procedures regarding practice experiences, including the following: selection of sites, methods for approving preceptors, opportunities for orientation and support for preceptors, approaches for faculty su pervision of students, means of evaluating student performance, means of evaluating practice placement sites and preceptor qualifications, criteria for waiving, altering or reducing the experience, if applicable All MPH students must complete a 120 - to 240- hour practicum. Students may elect to complete as many as 6 credits (240 hours) for their practicum , and students in the Community Oriented Pubic Health Practice (COPHP) and Nutritional Sciences Programs are required to do so. The P racticum for most stude nts is overseen by the assistant director of Student Affairs. In addition, several programs in the SPH (e.g., COPHP, Nutritional Sciences, Public Health Genetics) have designated faculty who take responsibility for organizing practicums for their students , and the student services staff of the various programs/tracks may also assist MPH students in finding practicums and faculty advisors. The Practicum Steering Committee establishes policy for all practicums in the SPH and supports the a ssistant director of Student Affairs in her role as the SPH Practicum Coordinator. A summary of the MPH P racticum policies and procedures is given below and is also available in the Practicum Syllabus (Appendix 2.4.A.i). Full policies and procedures for the practicum are described in the MPH Practicum Program Handbook, updated in February 2013 ( Appendix 2.4.A.ii ). Goal and l earning objectives The goal of the practicum is to provide students an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills being acquired through their courses o f study in a planned, supervised, and evaluated practical experience. These opportunities can take place in a variety of agencies and organizations, including local and state public health agencies, as well as local, state, national , and international nong overnmental agencies and organizations. The l earning objectives for the Practicum are designed to move students toward mastery of the generic MPH c ompetencies and, also, to focus their practicum on achieving specific learning objectives of importance to ea ch individual student. The student's learning c ontract articulates the ways in which the following learning objectives are incorporated into their practicum project. The generic learning objectives of the MPH Practicum are to: Describe and discuss the role, structure, functions, budget, funding , and culture of the hosting organization. Describe and discuss the demographics of the population(s) served by the agency and the potential impact of the practicum on that population . Describe and discuss the public health issue addressed by the practicum project . Demonstrate evidence- based rigor in the application of public health problem solving skills . Demonstrate an ability to work as a member of a team . Communicate effectively with professional colleagues, client s, and/or community groups . Demonstrate cultural competence to the degree possible and appropriate in the context of the student's specific practicum experience. In addition, when preparing the learning contract ( Appendix 2.4.A.iii ) for the practicum, each student, together with her/his advisor, defines individualized learning objectives describing the specific knowledge and skills that the student hopes to gain from the practicum experience. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 78 Selection of sites The SPH has recently hired a new a ssistant d irector of Student Affairs who is charged with providing more structure and strengthening the learning experience afforded by the practicum. As one of her priorities she is enhancing the outreach processes to potential sites in order to better connect studen ts to practicum opportunities. The practicum office maintains web postings of all past and potential sites for students to review as they think about starting their practicum. Potential sites and site supervisors are currently identified in several ways: The assistant d irector of Student Affairs has begun seeking out and building new relationships with potential sites. We have initiated a \"practicum brown bag\" series which affords sites the opportunity to spend an hour on campus speaking with interested MP H students. Contacts within the practice community also notify the SPH Practicum Office about practicum opportunities and work with the A ssistant D irector to craft appropriate position descriptions. Students frequently find community sites through their faculty advisors, in addition to on their own, that are well matched to their professional and academic interests. The Northwest Center for Public Health Practices is also a valuable asset for identifying agencies and projects for student practicum. Criteria for site selection are: The practicum site must provide an opportunity for the student to develop further and apply specific skills or competencies learned in the academic program (e.g., assessment, program planning, evaluation, management, data analy sis, policy development, etc.) . The site must provide a supervisor who is willing and able to spend regularly scheduled time with the student and provide guidance. In addition, the site supervisor should have a population health perspective and be qualifie d to evaluate the professional competency of the student . The site should afford the student regular contact with public health practitioners. The site supervisor should exhibit a willingness to increase student responsibility and independence gradually ov er the duration of the practicum experience. The site must provide appropriate logistical support, such as a workspace, access to a computer, phone, and/or photocopying. Whenever possible, the a ssistant d irector of Student Affairs or a representative from her/his program visits potential practicum sites to establish rapport and discuss expectations related to hosting an MPH student. After a site has been identified, the SPH's standard affiliation agreement is completed by representatives of the practicum si te (Appendix 2.4.A.iv ). The a ssistant d irector of Student Affairs, sometimes in collaboration with the faculty from specific programs (e.g., COPHP, Nutritional Sciences, etc.) maintains descriptions of all approved practicum opportunities. Students may rev iew these descriptions to select potential practicum sites or may propose alternate sites, which must be approved by the faculty adviser. Methods for approving preceptors For many of our practicum sites we have longstanding relationships with the site supe rvisors and have witnessed their prior success as practicum mentors. In addition, many practicum preceptors are alumni of our MPH programs. For new relationships we generally expect the practicum site supervisor to have a minimum of a master's degree in a relevant discipline. This requirement is to assure that the site supervisor can adequately mentor and evaluate our students at a professional level. The supervisor's professional and academic credentials are noted on the student's learning contract and rev iewed by the Assistant Director of Student Affairs. (The COPHP, Nutritional Sciences, and Public Health Genetics MPH programs designate faculty who assist in the approval of practicum sites and preceptors.) University of Washington School of Public Health Page 79 Orientation and support for preceptors The genera l expectations and responsibilities of the site and site supervisor are delineated in the 2.4.A.v ). The learning contract requires that the student also articulates individual learning objectives for her/his practicum. Additionally, we provide in- person site supervisor orientation upon request. The a ssistant director f or Student Affairs and the student's faculty advisor are expected to clarify expectations, identify needed resources, and solve problems prior to the student's beginning the practicum or during the practicum, as needed. Approaches for faculty supervision of students Each student must select a faculty advisor for his/her practicum. In some programs (e.g., Nutritional Sciences, Executive MPH) a single designated faculty member serves as the advisor for all practicums. The faculty adviser helps the student develop the learning contract/objectives and reviews and signs the contact prior to the field placement. The faculty advis or ensures that the field placement negotiated by the student and the site is appropriate and that it meets department and program requi rements and monitors the progress of the project with the student and site supervisor. Additionally, the faculty advisor is responsible for notifying the a ssistant d irector for Student Affairs if there are problems with a particular agency or site supervis or so that issues may be dealt with expeditiously. The faculty advis or is also responsible for evaluating the quality of the experience, and reviewing the site supervisor's evaluation of the student (see section below) and the written assignment and poster presentation. The faculty advisor authorizes academic credit upon satisfactory completion. Means of evaluating student performance Site supervisors complete a formal evaluation form for each student ( Appendix 2.4.A.vi ). This evaluation addresses the stud ent's professional habits and behavior, communication skills, and performance. In addition the site supervisor is asked to comment on the student's mastery of the learning objectives identified at the start of the practicum in the learning c ontract. The fa culty advisor reviews the student's practicum report and assesses the degree to which the student has mastered both the generic and individual learning objectives for the student's practicum. Finally, the student is asked to self -assess the learning and pr ofessional growth that has occurred during the practicum. In addition, the student completes a written assignment (see http://sph.washington.edu/practicum/assignment.asp for guidelines ) and creates a poster presentation describing the context, objectives, methods , and results of the practicum project. Means of evaluating practice placement sites and preceptor qualifications Students assess their practicum experience as part of their written assignment; however, we are developing a new form for the student evaluation of their practicum experience. This form is meant to solicit evaluative information about the quality of the experience and mentorship from the student's perspective (i.e. , \"Would you recommend this site to another student for their practicum?\"), as well as information about the site and the site supervisor. These evaluations will assist the a ssistant director of Student Affairs advising future students and/or in providing special assistance to sites. Criteria for waiving Students requesting a general waiver of the practicum must have a minimum of three years of population - based public health experience under the supervision of a master's level supervisor. Students must have docume ntation of \"experience in application of basic public health concepts and of specialty knowledge to the solution of community health problems.\" Because the practicum is supposed to provide an opportunity for students to apply public health concepts in a pr actice setting, students who want to waive the practicum must demonstrate that they have done this previously through a supervised and evaluated experience. Furthermore, to waive the practicum, the student must document that he/she has achieved the University of Washington School of Public Health Page 80 explici t learning objectives of the practicum (see above). Students must obtain the MPH Practicum Waiver Application from the a ssistant d irector of Student Affairs and submit it and supporting materials ( Appendix 2.4.A.vii ) within the first two quarters of their program. The Practicum Steering Committee reviews the application and makes a decision about the waiver request within one month, but may, in some cases, invite the student to a panel -style interview to answer questions about the experiences that are bein g proposed as a substitute for the Practicum. Community -Oriented Public Health Practice (COPHP) Practicum COPHP is a distinct MPH program within the department of Health Services for students who want to pursue a career in community- based public health practice. T he COPHP practicum is a six -credit experience (two credits per quarter over three quarters) during the student's first year and has comparable learning objectives as described above. The purpose of the practicum during the first year of the COPHP program is to provide students an opportunity to practice application of their classroom learning within a local health department. The student is expected to function in roles both as a student and practitioner within the health department. The student a pplies the theory, knowledge, and skills being learned in the classroom during the first year of her/his MPH studies. Field experience is considered to be service- learning and therefore students are expected to make a substantive contribution to the work o f the health department within the limits of their responsibility and authority. The result is a service -learning experience that should be of mutual benefit to the health department, the student, the University and, most importantly, the community served by the health department. During the first year, the COPHP Practicum consists of two modules, the Practicum Seminar and the Practicum Field Experience. The Practicum Seminar is an a utumn quarter course that is designed to provide the student with selected skills that will contribute to a successful field experience and an enhanced knowledge base about Public Health\u2014Seattle & King County (including its structure, functions, and the communities it serves). This knowledge enables the student to both learn and serve more effectively in the Practicum Field Experience offered during the w inter and spring quarters of the first year. The second module, Practicum Field Experience, begins during the w inter quarter and continues through the spring quarter of the first year. In this course, students are matched to a project or program within Public Health \u2014Seattle & King County, with supervision from a Public Health\u2014 Seattle & King County employee who is also a clinical faculty member at the University. The faculty member is responsible for ensuring that the student's site supervisor is well versed in the learning objectives of the practicum before they mentor a student. The student's faculty advis or collaborates with the site supervisor to provide supervision, consultation, and expert assistance to the student as appropriate. Public Health \u2014Seattle & King County has served as the field experience site for the first year due to its long history of collaboration with the University and because it is an outstanding example of a large community -oriented public health agency. Working in a single, yet large and diverse, agency provides the students with a common field experience problem during the first quarter and a common practice model for applying learning from the problem -based learning curriculum during the first year. Occupational Medicine Residency Practicum Occupational Medicine Residents have substantial field experience/practicum requirements that far exceed what is expected of other MPH students in time commitment, supe rvision, and rigor. The total time in these field experiences is 12 months, although approximately half that time is devoted to patient - care- oriented learning. The g oals of the Occupational Medicine Residency Practicum are to: Systematically analyze practi ce using quality improvement methods, and implement changes with the goal of practice improvement . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 81 Locate, appraise, and assimilate evidence from scientific studies. Participate in the education of patients, families, students, residents , and other health professionals . Work effectively as a member or leader of a health care team or other professional group . Demonstrate an awareness of and responsiveness to the larger context and system of health care, as well as the ability to call effectively on other res ources in the system to provide optimal health care. Work effectively in various health care delivery settings and systems relevant to their clinical specialty . Incorporate considerations of cost awareness and risk -benefit analysis in patient and/or popula tion-based care as appropriate. Advocate for quality care systems. Work in interprofessional teams to enhance patient safety and improve patient care quality . Participate in identifying system errors and implementing potential systems solutions. Residents work in the following off -site settings: Boeing Company Veterans Administration Puget Sound Work Clinic Group Health Cooperative Valley Medical Center Occupational Medicine Clinic Central Washington Occupational Medicine Clinic Washington Department of Labor and Industries Washington Poison Center International health agencies involved in worker protection Preventive Medicine Residents By arrangement with the U.S. Army, the SPH (among other schools of public health in the country) provides the academic course work for a small number of preventive medicine residents from the Public Health (PH) Residency Program of Madigan Army Medical Center, most of whom also pursue an MPH degree as part of their program. An extensive practicum year of their training occ urs at Madigan Army Medical Center, located at Fort Lewis, WA, and is accepted as fulfilling the practicum requirement for the MPH (see section below). Concurrent s tudents Concurrent (joint) students from the School of Medicine, the School of Social Work, and the School of Public Affairs are permitted to substitute their practicum/fieldwork requirements for the usual SPH practicum because 1) these experiences address the learning objectives of the SPH practicum, 2) the student s are closely supervised and evaluated, and 3) the fieldwor k requirements are far more extensive in terms of time and effort than the requirements for the SPH practicum. The fieldwork courses for these three schools are summarized in Appendix 2.13.B . 2.4.B. Identification of agencies and preceptors used for practice experiences for students, by program area, for the last two academic years. The SPH faculty believe that a wide range of organizations and agencies can provide a valuable field experience for students. In general, any organi zation that provides, plans for, coordinates, organizes, pays for, or regulates public health services is a valid training site. In the past two years MPH students have conducted their practicums in over 125 sites. These have ranged from placements with cl inics and University of Washington School of Public Health Page 82 administrative departments with local health departments to international placements in South America or Africa. MPH practicum sites for students are listed in Appendix 2.4.B. Some examples of practicum sights are : Federal agencies: Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration State, county, or city health departments Other state and local health and social service agencies Managed care organizations Neighborhood health centers and community clinics Hospitals (public, not -for-profit, for -profit, psychiatric, rehabilitation) Community mental health centers Environmental health consulting companies Industrial settings Nongovernmental organizations Government clinics an d hospitals in low -income countries 2.4.C. Data on the number of students receiving a waiver of the practice experience for each of the last three years. Students requesting a waiver must have a minimum of two years of substantial experience in application of basic public health concepts, skills, and knowledge. If a student can show that specialty knowledge acquired in their departmental program has been applied previously in a supervised field context using a population approach to health problems, a waive r will be considered. In 2012, more stringent criteria for waivers, described in Criterion 2.4.A , were implemented . Number of Waivers Granted by Year 2010: 19 2011: 16 2012: 3 2.4.D. Data on the number of preventive medicine, occupational m edicine, aerospace medicine and general preventive medicine and public health residents completing the academic program for each of the last three years, along with information on their practicum rotations. The UW SPH does not have a preventive medicine residency program, but provides the MPH training for Preventative Medicine Residents from Madigan Army Medical Center. We have graduated two Madigan Preventive Medicine Residents in the past three years. \"During this [practicum] year, residents gain a broa d experience in applying the tools of public health to address current public health issues. Residents manage the influenza, rabies, tuberculosis, and other communicable disease control programs; support the Fort Lewis Tobacco Cessation Program; investigat e and report sentinel diseases; provide travel medicine services; and provide education to commanders, soldiers, health care workers, and other beneficiaries on various public health programs. Residents gain extensive experience in occupational and environ mental medicine. Each resident completes an in -depth epidemiologic research project, and usually presents findings at a national meeting.\" (http://www.mamc.amedd.army.mil/prevent ivemed/phrp- training.htm ) We participate in an Occupational Medicine Residency program that is run in coordination with the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Program in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health. In the past three year s, seven students have completed the UW Occupational Medicine Residency. Their practicum experiences are summarized in Table 2.4.D , below.

Assessment of the extent t o which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths A wide variety of practicum experiences are pursued by MPH students in all departments. SPH has agreements with more than 10 0 community agencies, including local, state, and international agencies, for student practicum and research activities. (Students are also free to find additional sites for extramural academic pursuits.) University of Washington School of Public Health Page 84 We have recently developed an enhanced waiver proto col. We have developed n ew relationships with other professional schools at the UW whose experiences have been integral in helping us restructure our practicum program. Weaknesses/Challenges The practicum program at SPH is in transition. Although we have been able to provide our students with ample practicum opportunities in the past, our current process is working to improve the logistics of the practicum and to enhance the experience so that it is a cornerstone of the student 's learning. The past waiver policy did not conform to CEPH's expectations. Plans We are simplifying practicum processes and paperwork for students, faculty , and site supervisors. We are conducting a needs assessment to determine which software tools (e.g., web -based forms manageme nt and database) might best enhance the student learning experience and allow for better program management . We have revised the practicum learning objectives and requirements to make it a more effective and relevant educational experience for all MPH stud ents regardless of department, program, or student background. We are developing a practicum evaluation form for students to provide feedback on their experiences, sites, and site supervisors. We are working to enhance our outreach to community organizati ons by networking locally and at conferences in order to create more and better opportunities for our students seeking practicum sites. We are designing better training tools for site supervisors who wish to host our students . We are welcoming agency reps to campus for \"Lunch and Learn\" sessions , where students and potential supervisors can meet one another in an informal setting. We plan to coordinate our career services and alumni relations efforts with the practicum so that the practicum can become a l aunching pad and networking tool for our students as they prepare for graduation. This criterion is partially met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 85 2.5 CULMINATING EXPERIENCE All graduate professional degree programs, both professional public health and other professional degree programs, identified in the instructional matrix shall assure that each student demonstrates skills and integration of knowledge through a culminating experience. 2.5.A. Identification of the culminating experience required for each professional public heal th and other professional degree program. If this is common across the school's professional degree programs, it need be described only once. If it varies by degree or program area, sufficient information must be provided to assess compliance by each. MPH Program All MPH program s require a culminating experience . Master's Thesis Most of the MPH degree tracks require a master's thesis. The thesis is an opportunity for students to consolidate and advance the knowledge gained during graduate studies, to exerc ise and expand the research skills learned in the program, and to develop expertise in a specialized area of interest. The process of identifying a topic or question of interest, defining and designing a study to provide information on the topic, obtaining appropriate data, analyzing the data using proper techniques, interpreting the results correctly, and documenting the entire process in a written report, is a key component of the learning process and an important way to assess student performance. Each s tudent works closely with a thesis adviso r to identify an area or problem of interest, poses a number of potential project ideas, narrows and hones these ideas into a feasible thesis question or hypothesis, and designs the study, using either primary or se condary data to address the question. The design, conduct, write -up, and presentation of the thesis project is a major effort and is generally regarded by alumni as one of the most important and useful aspects of their graduate experiences. Examples of acceptable designs for the thesis include analytic studies (e.g., case- control studies), program evaluations, case studies, policy analyses, descriptive studies, and experiments or quasi -experiments (rarely performed for a master's thesis). When a thesis sign ificantly contributes to a scientific body of knowledge , the student is encouraged to publish the results in a scholarly journal. Master's Capstone Project The Executive MPH and the MPH degrees in Environmental Health , Health Services, and Community Orien ted Public Health Practice Programs give the student the option of doing a master's capstone project as an alternative to a master's thesis. Like a master's thesis, a capstone project is a major, rigorous, scholarship- based, and demanding undertaking. Wher e the thesis is designed to apply research methods to the challenge of creating new knowledge, the objective of the capstone project is to address a real public health problem in the community. (The COPHP C apstone H andbook , which is used nd in Appendix has the following goals: Experiential Goals To contribute to solving a community health problem in a meaningful, effective, and culturally sensitive fashion; specifically : To work to solve a public health proble m in a community setting . To find and apply evidence -based solutions to a defined community problem . To work productively with other people and to develop successful community partnerships and solutions . To explore problem -solving methods in the contexts o f specific communities and populations . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 86 To understand the organizational, political, economic, and social contexts that can promote or constrain public health interventions. Academic Goals To develop advanced public health assessment and problem -solving skills . To develop comprehensive knowledge in an area or areas of special interest . To evaluate the successes and weaknesses of the project through either formal evaluation and analysis or reflection . To hone communication skills and use them to summarize fi ndings in professional -quality written and oral presentations. Table 2.5.A compares the characteristics of the capstone project and the thesis. Table 2.5.A . Comparison of c apstone p rojects and thesis p rojects Master's Capstone Project Master's Thesis Principal intent To identify and solve a problem of practical importance to a public health agency or a defined community; to improve public health practice or community health To create new knowledge Is the report/thesis a \"scholarly\" project? Yes\u2014the stu dent must identify and synthesize evidence relevant to the project. The student must also identify local historical, social, organizational, economic, and community contexts i n which the community- oriented m aster 's project will occur Yes\u2014the student must identify and synthesize relevant to the research Is this a research project? It can be IF it has direct, practical usefulness to the sponsoring agency, organization, or community Yes Is data analysis involved? It can be IF it has direct, practical usefuln ess to the sponsoring agency, organization, or community Usually Does the student critically evaluate the results and quality of the project/research? Yes, including a self -reflective evaluation of the project Yes Principal audience Agency, organization, or community where the project is conducted; in some cases, the larger professional community Larger professional community Is the project/thesis report publishable in a professional journal? Yes (most likely in practice -oriented journals) Yes Master o f Health Administration Program The integrative project for the MHA program is called the Capstone Consulting Project. The project places student teams to work in a real -world environment , studying a problem of current importance to a health care organizat ion and recommending to the organization how the problem should be handled. The projects provide students with an opportunity to work directly with a project preceptor and others in the organization in identifying and analyzing a management problem and in the formulation and presentation of a recommended course of action. Through interim reports and final presentations, team members also have an opportunity to polish their presentation and communication skills. Throughout the project, University of Washington School of Public Health Page 87 students may discuss i ssues, ambiguities, and \"learnings\" that come from their experience with faculty and colleagues. Ultimately, successful completion of the project assignments requires students to organize and work as an effective team to \"get the job done.\" The projects ar e complex and time -sensitive. They also affect people in the organization, and therefore have political , as well as analytical dimensions. They provide exposure to the realities that often confront managers as they try to solve problems and make changes in their organizations. As such, the project experience is intended to help students transition from classrooms to jobs. 2.5.B. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths All professional degree students complete a rigorous culminating experience \u2014master's t hesis, capstone project, or c apstone c onsulting project \u2014that challenges students to integrate the skills and knowledge they have obtained dur ing their master's program. Each type of culminating experience is modeled to exercise and extend the specific skill -set emphasized in the student 's program. Master's students rate the adequacy of research and professional training highly. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best score, these ratings have averaged 4.0 over the past 3 years. Weaknesses/Challenges Students occasionally have difficulty finding faculty committee members 1) whose interests match the topic of the students' theses/capstones, or 2) who are willing to serv e on thesis committees. Some students in concurrent degree programs have difficulty completing the culminating project in a timely fashion. Plans The SPH is initiating workshops and providing resour ces to improve mentoring/advisi ng culminating projects. Advisors to concurrent students are encouraging these students to settle on a thesis/capstone early in their programs. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 88 2.6 REQUIRED COMPETENCIES For each degree program and area of specialization within each program identified in the instructional matrix, there shall be clearly stated competencies that guide the development of degree programs. The school must identify competencies for graduate professional public health, other professional and academic degree programs and specializations at all levels (bachelors, masters and doctoral). 2.6.A. Identification of a set of competencies that all graduate professional public health degree students and baccalaureate public health degree students, regardless of concent ration, major or specialty area, must attain. There should be one set for each graduate professional public health degree and baccalaureate public health degree offered by the school (e.g., one set each for BSPH, MPH and DrPH).

Conceive, conduct, and disseminate independent research. 2.6.B. Identification of a set of competencies for each concentration, major or specialization (depending on the terminology used by the school) identified in the instructional matrix. The school must identify competencies for all degrees, including graduate public health professional degrees, graduat e academic degrees, graduate other professional degrees, as well as baccalaureate public health degrees and other bachelor's degrees. Program - and t rack-specific competencies are listed Appendix 2.6.B , organized by degree. 2.6.C. A matrix that identifies the learning experiences (eg, specific course or activity within a course, practicum, culminating experience or other degree requirement) by which the competencies defined in Criteria 2.6.a. and 2.6.b are met. If these are common across the school, a single matrix for each degree will suffice. If they vary, sufficient information must be provided to assess compliance by each degree and concentration. See CEPH Data Template 2.6.1. Due to the large volume of information, we have included CEPH Data Templates 2. 6.1 for all degrees and programs outlined in Criteria 2.6.A and 2.6.B in Appendix 2.6.C .i. Syllabi for required courses are included by department or program in Appendix 2.6.C.ii . Schedules of course offerings for the last three years are included by depar tment or program in Appendix 2.6.C.iii. 2.6.D. An analysis of the completed matrix included in Criterion 2.6.c. If changes have been made in the curricula as a result of the observations and analysis, such changes should be described. The review and analysis of the degree and concentration competency matrices ( CEPH Data Templates 2.6.1) resulted in: Changes in the content of some of the core and track- required courses . Clearer definition of the generic learning objectives for the practicum . SPH Curriculum a nd Educational Policy Committee prioritizing the development of ideas for how to assure that learning in the areas of 1 ) public health biology, and 2) public health ethics is incorporated into the training and/or expectations for all MPH students. Furtherm ore, the work throughout the SPH that went into updating competencies was generally felt to be very useful in realigning the course content with changing expectations for our students; specifically, a greater emphasi s on information gathering, critical th inking, analysis, and synthesis . 2.6.E. Description of the manner in which competencies are developed, used and made available to students. Course learning objectives are developed by the instructors and are an integral part of the course syllabus. The SPH requires that all syllabi be organized in a standard format which makes them uniformly organized and readily available to students who are considering taking a course, to colleagues who are interested in the course, and to students who are enrolled in the course (http://sph.washington.edu/gateway/syllabi.asp ). Furthermore, the SPH has explicit expectations for the wording of learning objectives in the syllabi ( http://sph.washington.edu/gateway/learning_objectives.asp ). Instructors are likely to revise and update the course learning objectives each year based on developments in the field, issues of emerging importance, new k nowledge in the discipline, and feedback from students and colleagues. Any new course or significant course change requires a formal review that must be University of Washington School of Public Health Page 93 reviewed by the SPH Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee and then by the UW curriculum office. The SPH's Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee is responsible for coordination and review of the generic competencies for all degrees. Program -specific competencies are developed by the core faculty responsible for teaching in that program. Departm ents and specialty tracks, as a rule, have program review retreats, usually in the summer where both methods and content are discussed and revised. Degree competencies are posted on the departmental and SPH websites, as well as in some printed program ma terials , and are used as the basis for the annual Competency Survey (described in Criterion 2.7.A , below) of first -year and graduating students . 2.6.F. Description of the manner in which the school periodically assesses changing practice or research needs and uses this information to establish the competencies for its educational programs. The SPH has a number of means by which it assesses and updates the teaching in the SPH , including program competencies. In general, the SPH updates its learning objective s in response to needs and opportunities perceived by the d ean, faculty, students, alumni, and community, and in recognition of developments in public health education. First, feedback from students, alumni, and faculty provide insight to enhance, expand, or refine program learning objectives. These reviews are usually carried out as part of a regular curriculum revision process, so that the development of new learning objectives is linked to the revision or development of courses. Major revisions in curri culum are reviewed by the SPH Curriculum and Educati onal Policy Committee . Second, the departments assess their program competencies in relation to developments in the field through Graduate School reviews. These reviews of departmental graduate degree pr ograms are conducted every 10 years. They involve an extensive self -study and a site visit by external reviewers. Curriculum and the effectiveness of the degree programs are scrutinized as part of these reviews, and outside experts make recommendations, if appropriate, on the need for curricular development. Third, the stimulus for curriculum development \u2014and updating of competencies \u2014may arise in direct response to the assessment of developments in educational societies or from needs expressed by students, faculty, or alumni. For example, our programs in Health Informatics and Health Information Management are very responsive to guidelines promulgated by the American Health Information Management Association. Finally, the SPH Strategic Plan not only outlin es in detail the strategies f or \"Strengthening our teaching,\" it also requires the vigilant monitoring of the implementation of these strategies. The table below lists these strategies and the groups that are responsible for a) implementing the strategy , and b) reviewing progress. Of particular importance is Strategy 1.1, \"Review of the current MPH curriculum.\" This review is being conducted by an ad hoc MPH Review Work Group appointed by the dean. This group, whose membership includes students, faculty, s taff, and external stakeholders (Listed in Appendix 2.6.F ), has worked for the past year reviewing current MPH curricula, getting input from various internal and external stakeholders, and drafting models for a new MPH curriculum in the SPH. The group will be prese nting its recommendations this s pring (2013). The s pecial assistant to the dean has been given the responsibility to ensure that implementation is moving forward, and is responsible for reporting to SPHEC on the progress of the SPH Strategic Pla n implementation (see http://sph.washington.edu/strategicplan/implementation.asp for details ). The Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee and the Distance Learning/Learning Tec hnology Committee have lead roles in these efforts.

Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths Explicit competencies are articulated for all educational programs in the SPH . Course syllabi contain learning objectives that are consistent with these competencies . Faculty, curriculum committees, and special ad hoc committees review and update program competencies in response to developments in the field, and to faculty, student, alu mni, or external input , including the SPH's Strategic Plan . The MPH Review Work Group has undertaken a comprehensive review of the MPH programs in the SPH and will present its findings and recommendations in the spring of 2013. Students assess their mastery of degree competences at the end of their first year and in the s pring of the year in which they graduate . Weaknesses/Challenges Ensuring that faculty write properly constructed (i.e., behavioral) learning objectives for the syllabi of their courses. Plans The various curriculum committees ( SPH, department, and program) will continue to monitor and refine degree/program /track competencies. Departments and faculty will c ontinue to monitor developments in their fields and to expand curricular opportunitie s in emerging areas of public health . Disseminate, discuss and implement recommendations of the MPH Review Working Group. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 96 2.7 ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES There shall be procedures for assessing and documenting the extent to which each professional public health, other professional and academic degree student has demonstrated achievement of the competencies defined for his or her degree program and area of concentration. 2.7.A. Description of the procedures used for monitoring and evaluati ng student progress in achieving the expected competencies, including procedures for identifying competency attainment in practice or research, as applicable, and in culminating experiences. The SPH uses several procedures to monitor and ensure student progress toward meeting program competencies : Annual Competency Survey Each spring, students who have completed their first year of study and those who are graduating complete a self -assessment of their mastery of degree competencies. Students receive immedia te feedback via email listing the competencies that they indicate that they have not mastered satisfactorily. This information is particularly helpful for students just finishing their first year , as it points to areas where they need additional training. Statistical data from these surveys is used by the Curriculum a nd Educational Policy Committee. T he department and track curriculum committees scrutinize these reports for monitoring weaknesses in the curriculum and suggesting areas of needed improvement . These reports can be found at http://sph.washington.edu/gateway/competencies_survey_reports.asp . Classroom performance All students are required to take a prescribed set o f courses and a specified number of electives. These are described in program -specific guidelines (available for review at the site visit). All core courses must be taken for a grade (e.g., 4.0, 3.9, etc.), and all students must successfully complete the c lass examinations and assignments for each course. All graduate students are required to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 to graduate. A grade of 2. 7 or above is required in each course to be counted toward the degree requirements. Practicums The Pra cticums serve an important role, not only in giving students the opportunity for practical, hands - on experience in public health practice settings, but also in providing a means for faculty to assess and intervene regarding a student's skills and knowledge in areas outside the classroom. Many of the competencies established for MPH students cannot be assessed in the classroom alone. The Practicum (as well as the culminating experiences, below ) provide opportunities for both mastering and assessing important program -generated competencies. Assessment of the student's master of competencies is performed through evaluations by the site mentor, as well as though self -assessment and reflection, which are a required part of a student's practicum paper. Master's t hesis and c apstone projects MPH and MS students must meet a high standard of quality to receive credit for a thesis or capstone project . In many ways, the thesis \u2014and to a comparable extent , the capstone project \u2014serve s as a \"proof of the pudding\" demonstrat ion that a student can operate on a professional level , incorporating many of the competencies expected of master's level graduates. The thesis and the capstone project is reviewed and critiqued in detail as the student develops his/her project, carries it out, and writes it up in a prescribed format. The thesis or capstone report must be approved by at least two faculty members. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 97 Dissertation: preliminary and general examinations Similarly, all PhD students must write an acceptable dissertation and pass a final oral examination. This process, explicitly prescribed and monitored by the Graduate School, contains several intermediate outcomes to measure progress and to demonstrate that the student has achieved the level of skill necessary to contribute to knowledge in the field at the doctoral level. The dissertation is supervised and approved by the student's dissertation supervisory committee, which includes four or more faculty, at least one of whom (the Graduate School Representative) has an appointment outside of the student's department. The dissertation is presented at an open seminar and must be of sufficient quality and originality to be published in a peer -reviewed journal. Each PhD student must pass preliminary exams and a general exam, which are de signed to test comprehensive knowledge in the discipline as well as specific knowledge in at least one subject area (typically in the area of the dissertation). The Graduate School Representative formally evaluates the process of the exams, and the supervi sory committee evaluates the student's performance. SPH student performance is almost always rated \"above average\" or \"excellent\" compared to other doctoral candidates throughout the University. Advising Students are assigned a primary advisor upon enteri ng a program. To avoid potential performance problems, students undergo intensive scrutiny in the first quarter and throughout the first year, and appropriate assistance is offered if necessary. When a student begins work on a thesis or dissertation, the faculty member with whom the student is doing research often becomes the advis or. In addition, a ll departments , interdisciplinary programs, undergraduate programs, and some program tracks (e.g., Maternal and Child Health) employ graduate program assistants or advis ors to support and monitor the progress of students. During their time in the program and at the time of graduation, every student's program is checked by both the faculty advis or and the departmental graduate program staff to ensure that all requ irements have been met. In this way, both the faculty advis or and the graduate program staff monitor every student. This process certifies that program requirements are adequately met and ensures that any difficulties or deficiencies in the student's educa tional program are addressed. 2.7.B. Identification of outcomes that serve as measures by which the school will evaluate student achievement in each program, and presentation of data assessing the school's performance against those measures for each of the last three years. Outcome measures must include degree completion and job placement rates for all degrees (including bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees) for each of the last three years. See CEPH Data Templates 2.7.1 and 2.7.2. If degree completion rates in the maximum time period allowed for degree completion are less than the thresholds defined in this criterion's interpretive language, an explanation must be provided. If job placement (including pursuit of additional education), within 12 months f ollowing award of the degree, includes fewer than 80% of the graduates at any level who can be located, an explanation must be provided. Degree Completion CEPH Data Template 2.7.B is included in Appendix 2.7.B for our undergraduate, MPH, MHA, MS, and PhD programs. The Graduate School's maximum time for completion of a master 's degree is 6 years, and for a PhD it is 10 years. Generally , undergraduates declare majors in their sophomore year, and the expectation is that they complete the major in two years. Tables 2.7.B.i and 2.7.B.ii summarize the information for the most recent cohorts. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 98 Table 2.7.B.i . Degree completion rates (2010 -2012) Degree Target % completing within UW's expected or maximum time 70% graduated in: Undergraduate ~2 MPH 6 years 78-93% 3-4 years 4-7 years MHA 6 years 87-94% 2 years 2-3 years MS 6 years 81-89% 3-4 years 4-6 years PhD 10 years 80-83% 6-8 years 8 years Over 80 percent of MHA, MS, and PhD graduates who responded to the 2012 A lumni Survey reported finding employment or enrolling in additional graduate education within six months of receiving their degree from the SPH ( Table 2.7.B.ii ). Among MPH graduates, 76 percent reported finding employment within six months, which is approximate ly in line with the CEPH target of 80 percent for 12 months out. Table 2.7.B. ii.

An explanation of the methods used to collect job placement data and of graduates' response rates to these data collection efforts. The school must list the number of graduates from each degree program and the number of respondents to the graduate survey or other means of collecting employment data. The 2012 A lumni S urvey was conducted via an online survey tool. Requests to participate in the survey were sent to all available email address es of SPH alumni . The purpose of the survey w as 1) to learn about the current employm ent of the alums, 2) to get feedback on their education experience at SPH , and 3) to elicit suggestions for improving the SPH. Despite efforts to maximize r esponse rates to this survey , returns were disappointing ly low , possibly because many of the same po tential respondents were surveyed previously as part of the SPH s trategic planning process. Table 2.7.C summarizes the number of responses and response rates for recent graduates . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 99 Table 2.7.C .

In fields for which there is certification of professional competence and data are available from the certifying agency, data on the performance of the school's graduates on these national examinations for each of the last three years. Few students from the SPH have participated in the certifying exam of the Natio nal Board of Public Health Examiners (NBPHE). As a consequence of NBPHE policy , the SPH has not been provided aggregate data on the pass rate among students from the SPH . The Graduate Coordinated Program in Dietetics has experienced a 98 percent completio n rate over the last five years. Students graduating from the Nutritional Sciences program who take the exam have had a 100 percent first time pass rate since they were granted accreditation in 2009. They are one of very few programs in the country with a 100 percent pass rate. 2.7.E. Data and analysis regarding the ability of the school's graduates to perform competencies in an employment setting, including information from periodic assessments of alumni, employers and other relevant stakeholders. Methods for such assessments may include key informant interviews, surveys, focus groups and documented discussions. Table 2.7.E summarizes the assessm ent of respondents to the 2012 Alumni S urvey regarding how helpful their degree program was in 1) obtaining empl oyment , and 2) in preparing them for their current job. Table 2.7.E . Helpfulness of d egree in obtaining and performing c urrent j ob, 2012 alumni s urvey (scale of 1 to 5, 5 highest) Degree Helpfulness in obtaining current job Helpfulness in performing curre nt job MPH 4.1 3.9 MHA 4.3 3.9 MS 4.3 4.0 PhD 4.8 4.5 These data suggest that the education received at SPH was helpful for both obtaining employment and in preforming professional duties. PhD graduates appeared to have found their education to be mos t helpful. The s trategic p lanning process s urveyed 28 employers about the assessment of the preparedness of our graduates for work in their organizations. The following chart summarizes their responses. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 100 The majority of respondents thought students were \" well prepared\" or \"very well prepared\" in five of the eight areas (see Figure 2.7.E . below) : 81 percent (21) of respondents selected \"Subject matter expertise in chosen discipline (i.e. Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Environmental and Occupational Health Sci ences, Global Health, Health Services, or other specific discipline).\" 76 percent (19) selected \"Understanding of social and environmental determinants of health.\" 68 percent (17) selected \"Communication and collaboration skills.\" 62 percent (16) selected \"Quantitative skills (biostatistics, health economics, etc.).\" 54 percent (14) selected \"Practical experience in the field.\" Figure 2.7.E . Employer assessment of SPH graduates' preparation in various areas. The data above suggest that policy, leadership, and management preparation was rated as most lacking. These skills are often developed on the job; nevertheless, these results (discussed during the s trategic planning process) stimulated a number of strategic goals and strategies to rectify these deficiencies (see Criterion 2.6.F ). 2.7.F. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH uses an array of assessment mechanisms\u2014in courses, pr acticum, capstone projects, and dissertations, self -assessment tools, and mentoring \u2014to ensure that student s master the expected competencies for their respective degrees and tracks. In addition to the detailed competency s urvey that students take in their first and last years, course exams and assignments, practicum evaluations, and the rigorous supervised culminating experience enable the faculty to monitor and ensure mastery of expected competencies. The SPH Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee monitors curriculum in the SPH to ensure that all degree and program learning objectives are met through required courses, seminars, practicums, and culminating projects. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 101 More than 80 percent of graduate students graduate within the limits set by the Graduate School . Alumni and employer surveys indicate that graduates give high ratings to the quality of their educational experience. Weaknesses/Challenges Because alumni surveys are time- and resource -intensive for both SPH staff and respondents, they are conducted only every five to seven years. Low response rates and nonrespondent bias affect confidence in the findings of exit and alumni surveys. Policy, m anagement , and l eadership skills/preparation of graduates were found by employers to be less developed th an subject matter and analytic skills. Plans The SPH Curriculum and Educat ional Policy Committee will continue to monitor courses to ensure that they teach the articulated degree and specializatio n competencies. Programs will be encouraged to use the competency lists as a tool in ad vising and mentoring students. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 102 2.8 OTHER GRADUATE PROFESSIONAL DEGREES If the school offers curricula for graduate professional degrees other than the MPH or equivalent public health degrees, students purs ing them must be grounded in basic public health knowledge. 2.8.A. Identification of professional degree curricula offered by the school, other than those preparing primarily for public health careers, and a description of the requirements for each. The M HA/EMHA program curricula encourage students to master, synthesize, and apply knowledge from the full range of management disciplines while emphasizing leadership accountability for effective organizational and systemic performance. Above all else, the MHA prog ram aims to develop emotionally -aware, transformational leaders who are competent at early career -entry and mid- career entry levels through the MHA and EMHA programs, respectively. MHA and EMHA graduates will be immediately effective at creating, buil ding, and supporting transformati on of their chosen organizations and the nation's health care delivery system throughout their subsequent management careers \u2014through beginning placements in e arly career nonclinical management ( MHA) and nonclinical management ( EMHA )\u2014and transformational leadership roles upon graduation. Throughout the MHA and EMHA content development, the curricula balance and integrate classroom, experience- based, and practice- integrated learning. The educational experience, based on adult learning concepts, moves progressively from concept introduction, through skill development, to concept and skill integration, to competency development, and finally to leadership development. The MHA program curriculum consists of 75 quarter credits offered over two academic years. The curriculum is scheduled in a normal \" day program \" on-campus schedule with 60 percent of the credits offered in the first program year and 40 percent of the courses offered in the second program year. The program requires students to complete a summer internship in a health care delivery organization between the first and second years of the program. Students must compl ete a team -based consulting or c apstone project in the final quarter of the MHA prog ram. Students enter the program with minimal work experience and most frequently enter their careers in entry -level, nonclinical managerial roles. Twenty - five to fifty percent of MHA graduates enter the industry through administrative fellowships. The Exec utive MHA (EMHA) program curriculum consists of 68 quarter credits offered over 24 months. The program is scheduled as an on -site weekend -based program with three courses offered in three 3 -day weekend sessions over the eight quarters in the program. Students entering the program are mid -career executives, 75 percent of whom come from clinical backgrounds in health delivery organizations. The curriculum is heavily organized to take advantage of student experiences in current management roles using a strong adult -learning oriented leadership development model . 2.8.B. Identification of the manner in which these curricula assure that students acquire a public health orientation. If this means is common across these other professional degree programs, it need be described only once. If it varies by program, sufficient information must be provided to assess compliance by each program. Within the MHA and EMHA programs, public health content and context is strongly included and emphasized within each curriculum framework. This is done by requiring courses in the following areas as appropriate to the degree: a) Introduction to Health Services (HSERV 511, 4 cr .) b) Epidemiology and Critical Evidence Appraisal (HSMGMT 501, 4 cr .) c) Quantitative Methods in Managemen t (HSMGMT 570, 3 cr .) d) Health Policy Development (HSERV 552, 3 cr .) or Public Health Law (HSERV 551, (2 cr.) e) Organizational Behavior (HSMGMT 510, 4 cr .) f) Environment of Care (HSMGMT 577, 2 cr .) University of Washington School of Public Health Page 103 g) Health Economics (HSMGMT 514, 3 cr .) The total public -health -oriented credit load from these course areas is 28.6 percent of the total curriculum in each program (28.6% x 68 to 75 credit hours = approx. 19 to 2 1 quarter credits). 2.8.C. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The MHA degree is highly rigorous and devotes more than a quarter of its curriculum to core public health skills and knowledge. Students in the in -residence MHA program sit alongside MPH student s in some of their courses and have the opportunity to share and hear different views on topics such as health policy and systems development. Weaknesses/Challenges None. Plans The MHA program is developing its self -study in preparation for its re -accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHME ) during the 2013- 14 academic year . Over the next academic year, the MHA faculty will consider bringing additional social and behavioral content into the MHA/EMHA curricula. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 104 2.9 BACHELOR 'S DEGREES IN PUBLIC HEALTH If the school offers baccalaureate public health degrees, they shall include the following elements: Required Coursework in Publi c Health Core Knowledge: students must complete courses that provide a basic understanding of the five core public health knowledge areas defined in Criterion 2.1, including one course that focuses on epidemiology. Collectively, this coursework should be a t least the equivalent of 12 semester -credit hours. Elective Public Health Coursework: in addition to the required public health core knowledge courses, students must complete additional public health -related courses. Public health -related courses may i nclude those addressing social, economic, quantitative, geographic, educational and other issues that impact the health of populations and health disparities within and across populations. Capstone Experience: students must complete an experience that pro vides opportunities to apply public health principles outside of a typical classroom setting and builds on public health coursework. This experience should be at least equivalent to three semester -credit hours or sufficient to satisfy the typical capstone requirement for a bachelors degree at the parent university. The experience may be tailored to students' expected post -baccalaureate goals (e.g., graduate and/or professional school, entry -level employment), and a variety of experiences that meet universi ty requirements may be appropriate. Acceptable capstone experiences might include one or more of the following: internship, service -learning project, senior seminar, portfolio project, research paper or honors thesis. The required public health core cou rsework and capstone experience must be taught (in the case of coursework) and supervised (in the case of capstone experiences) by faculty documented in Criteria 4.1.a and 4.1.b. 2.9.A. Identification of all bachelor 's-level majors offered by the SPH . The instructional matrix in Criterion 2.1.A. may be referenced for this purpose. A Bachelor of Arts with a major in Public Health and a Bachelor of Science with a major in Public Health have been available within the School of Public Health since March 2012. Prior to this date, a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Individualized Studies: Public Health was available to students through the University of Washington's College of Arts and Sciences since 2000. The program is administered through the SPH office of the dean. A Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health has been available to students since an undergraduate program in sanitary science was established in 1947 in the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, in the School of Medicin e. Authority to grant the BS was transferred to the School of Public Health when it was established in 1970. The BS in Environmental Health is accredited by the National Environmental Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council (EHAC) and is admini stered by the SPH's Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS). The SPH also has a BS in Health Informatics and Health Information Management which is housed administratively in the Department of Health Services. This undergraduate program has been in operation for more than 20 years . It prepares individuals for a career in health information management and is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Health Inf ormation Management Education . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 105 2.9.B. Description of specific support and resources available in the school for the bachelors degree programs.

A full -time program and advising manager provides the day -to-day management of the program including advising and problem solving with students; serving as liaison between faculty, instructors , and undergraduate students; identifying experiential learning, scholarship, and fellowship opportunities and responding to outside funding proposals; ensur ing conformity to program, i nstitutional , and SPH policies and regulations; and providing operational support for program admissions, assessment, budgeting, records management , and office management. In addition, the program manager works closely with the director of the undergraduat e program and the Undergraduate Steering Committee on curriculum design, new course proposals , and revisions of program requirements. A full -time academic advising and recruiting coordinator is responsible for advising prospective and current students regarding course of study, career options, academic planning, degree requirements , and community development. In addition, the advisor works with the director of Student Affairs to develop outreach on campus, at community colleges , and in high schools. The Und ergraduate Steering Committee has representation from the SPH's contributing departments and interdisciplinary programs and serves to guide curriculum direction, new course approval, and evaluation of existing course work. The Undergraduate Student Public Health Association (USPHA) is a student -run organization that is active across campus and serves as a peer resource for students interested in public health. USPHA serves as a student voice to guide undergraduate public health academic offerings and operat ions. BS in Environmental Health The director of the undergraduate p rogram, Christopher D. Simpson, is an associate professor in DEOHS and is responsible for the overall direction, budgeting, and oversight of the program. A full -time program manager and advis or is responsible for the day -to-day operation of the program , including advising and problem solving with students; serving as liaison between faculty, instructors , and students; and supporting program admissions, assessment, budgeting, and records m anagement. The Curriculum Committee for DEOHS provides direction and evaluation for courses and program curriculum. Students pursue one of three interest areas within the major. E ach interest area has at least one DEOHS faculty member who serves as the primary link for professional and career advising. These same faculty comprise an internal advisory committee which meets regularly to help steer the direction of the program. Additionally, a senior lecturer assumes primary responsibility for the undergr aduate internship program. An Undergraduate Program Advisory Committee was established in 2005 in order to assist the undergraduate program in assuring a high- quality, relevant educational experience that will provide a strong foundation for careers in practice or further study of environmental health and its component disciplines. Committee members are drawn from environmental health professional roles in public, private , and nonprofit organizations. The committee reviews and provides feedback on the pro gram's thrust and emphasis, content of curriculum, and organization of program requirements and options. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 106 Undergraduate m inor in Global Health Building upon five existing and new Global Health courses and electives from multiple UW departments, the Depart ment of Global Health create d an undergraduate m inor in Global Health. This popular option attracts over 150 students a year , many of who m also choose to apply to the undergraduate public health major. A detailed description of the minor can be found at http://globalhealth.washington.edu/academics/undergraduate -minor/welcome . 2.9.C. Identification of required and elective public health courses for the bachelors degree( s). Note: The school must demonstrate in Criterion 2.6.c that courses are connected to identified competencies (i.e., required and elective public health courses must be listed in the competency matrix in Criterion 2.6.d). BA/BS in Public Health Please see Appendix 2.9.C.i for BA/BS in Publ ic Health program requirements and Appendix 2.6.C .i for the course mapping to identify undergraduate public health competencies. The course work provides a basic understanding of the five core areas with specific requirem ents for biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health, health services administration , and social and behavioral sciences. BS in Environmental Health Please see Appendix 2.9.C.i i for BS in Environmental Health program requirements. While competencie s and learning objectives do not directly reflect the organizational framework of the five core public health knowledge areas, the course work does provide a basic understanding public health with specific requirements developed around the criteria for EHA C accredited environmental health programs: Core areas: Epidemiology, Statistical Methods, Toxicology Related areas: Environmental Health Management, Risk Analysis Technical areas (each): Air Quality, Food Protection, Occupational Health and Safety, Wat er and Wastewater, Solid and Hazardous Materials and Waste Management, Disease Prevention Technical areas (choose four): Air Quality Control, All -hazard Preparedness, Built Environment, Disease Prevention, Environmental Health Planning, Food Protection, GI S, Global Environmental Health, Hydrogeology, Injury Prevention, Institutional Health, Occupational Health and Safety, Radiation Health, Recreational Environmental Health, Risk Analysis, Soils, Solid and Hazardous Material and Waste Management, Vector Cont rol, Water and Wastewater Field experience and problem -based learning Background areas in basic sciences, communication, mathematics, humanities, and social sciences 2.9.D. A description of school policies and procedures regarding the capstone experience . BA/BS in Public Health Students are required to complete a capstone project at the end of their senior year. It is intended to be an integrative experience that brings together knowledge and skills acquired during their time in the major and at the Unive rsity. There are two options for how this is completed. One is an independent study, and students work directly with a supervising faculty member. Students are required to identify and define a public health problem or issue, perform a literature review, i ntegrate field work as appropriate, develop an approach and methods to address the topic, apply theoretical concepts from coursework, and report findings in writ ing and through presentations. The second option is a class capstone project where students wor k in groups of 4- 6 with identified community programs on a service learning project. This option extends over two quarters and involves focused literature review and paper, service learning, and in-class reflective activities. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 107 BS in Environmental Health All students complete a 400 -hour field internship. An opportunity to use knowledge and skills learned in the classroom in an actual work setting, the internship is both practical and educational. Students are assigned to a local, state, or federal public he alth or environmental protection agency ; a nonprofit organization; or a private sector company ; for supervised application of public health practices and/or environmental control techniques , supervised observation and experience in environmental health program planning , and training in the utilization of community resources. The practical training experience has often led to employment opportunities and direct ed entry into the environmental health community for graduates. 2.9.E. Assessment of the extent t o which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH successfully transferred the undergraduate public health major from the College of Arts and Sciences to the SPH . The SPH has hired excellent new staff to manage and promote this program . The undergraduate Environmental Health Program continue s to attract strong students . The new undergraduate minor in Global Health has attracted over 150 students in its first year. The Activity -Based B udgeting system for funding teaching at the UW is allowing our undergraduate programs to expand in order to meet the demand from undergraduates . Weaknesses/Challenges Because of the large demand for undergraduate programs and courses in pub lic health, SPH departments and faculty are eager to create new opportunities in their areas of specialization. It has been a challenge to ensure that the development of undergraduate degrees, minors , and courses offered by the SPH are well coordinated an d that options for study are clearly communicated to students. Plans SPH will continue to expand its undergraduate courses and programs. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 108 2.10 OTHER BACHELOR 'S DEGREES If the school offers baccalaureate degrees in fields other than pu blic health, students pursing them must be grounded in basic public health knowledge. 2.10.A. Identification of other baccalaureate degrees offered by the school and a description of the requirements for each. The instructional matrix in Criterion 2.1.a m ay be referenced for this purpose. BS in Health Informatics and Health Information Management In addition to our two undergraduate public health degrees (Public Health and Environmental Health), the SPH offers a BS degree in Health Informatics and Health I nformation Management (HIHIM) through the Department of Health Services. The HIHIM baccalaureate prepares individuals for a career in health information management and is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Health Infor mation Management Education .

Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The Health Informatics and Health Infor mation Management undergraduate program is a popular and nationally recognized program. Weaknesses/Challenges None Plans In 2013 the HIHIM program, in collaboration with our Master of Health Administration program faculty, wi ll begin offering a new Masters in Health Informatics and Health Information Management to train leaders in this field. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 110 2.11 ACADEMIC DEGREES If the school also offers curricula for graduate academic degrees, students pursuing them shall obtain a broad introduct ion to public health, as well as an understanding about how their discipline -based specialization contributes to achieving the goals of public health. 2.11.A. Identification of all academic degree programs, by degree and area of specialization. The instruc tional matrix in Criterion 2.1.a may be referenced for this purpose. The SPH offers twelve MS and eleven PhD degrees. Degrees are administered though our five departments, including the Pathobiology PhD which, although technically an interdisciplinary pro gram, is located in the Department of Global Health. The MS and PhD degrees in Nutritional Sciences and Public Health Genetics are administered by their respective programs, with oversight by the a ssociate dean for Research and Programs . The PhD track in Statistical Genetics is a joint program between the Department of Biostatistics and the Department of Statistics in the College of Arts and Sciences. Table 2.1.A lists these degrees. 2.11.B. Identification of the means by which the school assures that stude nts in academic curricula acquire a public health orientation. If this means is common across the school, it need be described only once. If it varies by degree or program area, sufficient information must be provided to assess compliance by each. All stud ents in our MS and PhD programs are required to take courses in public health areas outside of their home departments and are encouraged to acquire a broader public health perspective through additional electives. Biostatistics MS and PhD students are required to take at least 9 credits from a list of courses in Epidemiology, E nvironmental H ealth, H ealth S ervices, and B iologic S cience related to public health. Furthermore, all students in Biostatistics take a consulting course in which students in other SP H departments bring in problems for which they need statistical help, thus exposing B iostatistics students to problems in other public health disciplines. Students in academic programs in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences are required to take 12 credits of B iostatistics and Epidemiology. Higher -level courses in these areas are also encouraged. In addition, the list of suggested electives for these programs includes courses in management, policy, and public health- related biolo gic science. Epidemiology students in MS and PhD programs are required to take 23 credits in B iostatistics and Epidemiology. In addition they must take two additional E pidemiology courses that focus on health problems and two other courses from a list of S PH courses \"with significant public health content.\" The expressed aim of these requirements is to encourage students to broaden their studies to include coursework in the basic areas of public health. Students in the new PhD program in Global Health speci alize in one of two areas of emphasis : metrics or implementation science. Metrics is dedicated to providing students with advanced training in independent, rigorous, and timely scientific measurements to accelerate progress on global health by identifying the world's major health problems, assessing how well society addresses these problems, and guiding resource allocation to maximize health improvements. Implementation science focuses on the systematic application of scientific approaches to ask and answe r questions regarding evidence of intervention efficacy to implementation. This science addresses how interventions can be scaled -up with greater speed, fidelity, efficiency, quality, and coverage. All students in both tracks must take at least eight credi ts of Epidemiology, eight credits of B iostatistics/ Quantitative M ethods, eight credits in Health S ystems research and four credits in Leadership and M anagement. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 111 MS and PhD students in the Department of Health Services must take eig ht credits of E pidemiol ogy and 8-12 credits of B iostatistics. Furthermore, required courses in H ealth S ervices as well as electives cover a wide range of additional public health issues and perspective including health policy, social and behavioral science, and health economics. The Pathobiology PhD (and MS) program is distinguished among basic science doctoral programs in that it brings together the fundamental concepts of biology, medicine, and public heal th, particularly as applied to global health issues. The program impart s a multidisciplinary perspective, as well as training in the latest research technologies, to the study of public health problems , such as viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases, as well as other conditions, such as cancer. Investigating the mechanisms und erlying multifactorial diseases emphasizes the preventive as well as the curative, and a broader view of disease etiology. In this program, students must take four credits of epidemiology and four credits of Global Health. The required Pathobiology Seminar (2 credits x 4 quarters) and the Current Literature in Pathobiology course (2 credits) and the Pathobiology Mini -course ( 2 credits x 2 quarters ) all address global health problems from multi -disciplinary perspectives, including Human B iology, E pidemiology , Microbiology, and H ealth Behavior. MS and PhD students in Nutritional Sciences take at 4-8 credits of B iostatistics, a 4 -credit course in Public Health Nutrition , as well as courses in Nutrition and Chronic Disease and Research Design. Seminars and elect ives also focus on biologic, health behavior, programmatic and policy issues related to human nutrition and health. Students enrolled in the MS in Genetic Epidemiology and the PhD in Public Health Genetics are required to take 8 or more credits of Epidemiology, 4 -8 or more credits of Biostatistics, a three credit course in l egal, e thical, and social issues in public h ealth g enetics, and (for PhD students) the introductory course in health services administration and policy (HSERV 511). It should be emphasiz ed that virtually all MS and PhD students write a thesis/dissertation that must address public health issues. The possible exception to this is Biostatistics, where student s may write a heavily methodologically oriented dissertation. However, in B iostatist ics, the qualifying exams include public health questions and the student is expected to be able to clearly relate his/her research to public health issues. 2.11.C. Identification of the culminating experience required for each academic degree program. If this is common across the school's academic degree programs, it need be described only once. If it varies by degree or program area, sufficient information must be provided to assess compliance by each. For the MS degree, the m aster 's thesis is the culmina ting experience. For almost all programs, this is a research thesis; however, the MS in Environmental & Occupational Exposure Sciences has an option for master's portfolio. The MS thesis and portfolio option require the same number of credits. The MS thesi s is oriented toward students interested in building their research skills and in applying advanced scientific tools available in their thesis work. The portfolio option expands the opportunities for development of practical skills for students focused on professional careers. Students selecting the portfolio option complete an internship, a field- based project and written report, and document their learning experience in a web -based portfolio. The MS Thesis (or Portfolio Option) require s a minimum of nine (quarter) credits . For doctoral programs, the dissertation is the culminating experience. All student s must meet the following Graduate School minimum requirements: Completion of a program of study and research as planned by the graduate program coordinat or in the student's major department or college and the Supervisory Committee. Creditable passage of the General Examination. Registration as a graduate student is required the quarter the exam is taken and candidacy is conferred. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 112 Preparation of and acc eptance by the d ean of the Graduate School of a dissertation that is a significant contribution to knowledge and clearly indicates training in research. Credit for the dissertation ordinarily should be at least one -third of the total credit. The c andidate must register for a minimum of 27 credits of dissertation over a period of at least three quarters. At least one quarter must come after the student passes the General Examination. Creditable passage of a Final Examination, which is usually devoted to the defense of the dissertation and the field with which it is concerned. Each department/ program has different specifications for the qualifying/general exams and other pre - requisites for the d issertation . Nevertheless, all departments/ tracks have rigorous requirements/exams that must be satisfactorily completed before a student is permitted to pursue a dissertation. The UW Graduate School monitors all dissertations by requiring that a G raduate S chool R epresentative (GSR \u2014a senior faculty member from a depar tment outside of the student's) be a member of the examining committee. Upon completion of the student's dissertation defense, the GSR completes a report to the Graduate School and rates the fairness and rigor of the process. Review of these reports indicates that all SPH doctoral exams in the past have been judged to be fair and rigorous. 2.11.D. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH has strong, nationally competitive MS and PhD programs. Students in academic programs write a scholarly thesis or dissertation. The dissertation and general exam process for SPH students are consistently rated by the Graduate School Representative to be rigorous and fair. Exit surveys indicate that more than 82 percent of PhD students publish at least one paper in a peer-revie wed journal prior to graduation. Among graduating PhD students, the average number of papers published while in the program was 3.5. Students in academic programs have opportunities to take public health courses together with students in professional programs and to collaborate with public health practitioners in research, consultation, and service activities. Weaknesses/Challeng es Both to improve the experience of our doctoral students and to reduce redundancy, SPH needs to create mini -courses that bridge the departments, e.g., research survival skills, human subjects , and career development . Faculty vary in their skills for ment oring students. Plans The SPH Office of Student Affairs i s planning to develop a series of \" SPH 101 \" short -courses to address practical topics in areas of cross- departmental importance a nd interest, such as grant writing, human subjects applications, and teaching skills, among others. Mentoring resources and workshops for faculty are being developed. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 113 2.12 DOCTORAL DEGREES The school shall offer at least three doctoral degree programs that are relevant to three of the five areas of basic public health knowledge. 2.12.A. Identification of all doctoral programs offered by the school, by degree and area of specialization. The instructional matrix in Criterion 2.1.a may be referenced for this purpose. If the school is a new applicant and has graduates from only one doctoral program, a description of plans and a timetable for graduating students from the other two doctoral programs must be presented, with university documentation supporting the school's projections. The SPH offers twelve PhD degree options, including Biostatistics, Environmental and Occupational Health , Epidemiology, Global Health, Health Services , Nutrition, Pathobiology, and Public Health Genetics. A PhD with a concentration in social and behavioral sciences can be pursued as a track of the Health Services PhD . Thus, students may pursue doctoral training in each of the five core public health areas. Degrees are administered primarily though our five departments. The Pathobiology PhD, although considered an interdisciplinary degree under the Graduate School, is administered though the Department of Global Health. The PhD degrees in Nutritional Sciences and Public Health Genetics are administered by their respective programs, with oversight by the a ssociate d ean for Research an d Programs. The PhD track in Statistical Genetics is a joint program between the Department of Biostatistics and the Department of Statistics in the College of Arts and Sciences. Table 2.1.A lists these degrees. 2.12.B. Description of specific support and resources available to doctoral students including traineeships, mentorship opportunities, etc. Traineeships and funding for doctoral students vary by department. While certain programs can guarantee support for students through departmental funding or tra ining grant stipends, others work with students to identify and apply for funding opportunities. Types of funding include: Research Assistantships Teaching Assistantships Training grant stipends and tuition support through agencies such as: the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the National Institutes of Health , and the Agency for Healthcare and Resource Quality Funding opportunities for doctoral students have also been created through collaborations with outside agencies and organizations such as: the Center for AIDS and STDs, the International AIDS Research Training Fund, and the Medical Education Partnership Initiative and the Medical Scientist Training Program at the University of Washington . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 114 2.12.C. Data on student progression t hrough each of the school's doctoral programs, to include the total number of students enrolled, number of students completing coursework and number of students in candidacy for each doctoral program.

Ident ification of specific coursework, for each degree, that is aimed at doctoral -level education. The required and recommended course work for each of our doctoral programs is listed in Appendix 2.12.D . Common to all doctoral (PhD) degrees in the SPH are requi rements for coursework in public health disciplines outside the student's department and for a rigorous research dissertation, which is formally defended as part of a student's General Exam. 2.12.E. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH offers doctoral degrees in the five core public health disciplines (a PhD in Health services can be in the Social and Behavioral Science track) . In addition, SPH offers doctoral degrees or degree tracks in other public health specialty areas: Statistical Genetics track (joint with the Department of Statistics), Global Health (Metrics and Implementation Science tracks ), Nutritional Sciences, Pathobio logy, and Public Heath Genetics. The new doctoral program in the Department of Global Health offers state -of-the-art training in Health Metrics and Implementation Science . According to data from the Association of Schools of Public Health, the doctoral programs at the SPH are among the most sought after and competitive public health doctoral programs in the nation. Weaknesses/Challenges Under Activity -Base Budgeting (ABB) the amount of revenues allocated by the University to the SPH from tuition sources doe s not fully cover the costs of teaching and advising PhD students. Differences between costs and revenues must be made up from other sources (e.g., undergraduate teaching, provost's supplemental funds, etc .) University of Washington School of Public Health Page 115 Plans SPH is exploring ways in which doctoral programs can require less subsidization from other revenue streams, e.g., by changing or creating new tuition categories, encouraging the UW administration to modify the allocation ABB formulae to recognize that educating PhD students may generate less ABB revenues than teaching undergraduates (who take mostly large lecture classes (which generate large revenues in the ABB system). This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 116 2.13 JOINT DEGREES If the school offers joint degree programs, the required curriculum for the professi onal public health degree shall be equivalent to that required for a separate public health degree. 2.13.A. Identification of joint degree programs offered by the school. The instructional matrix in Criterion 2.1.a may be referenced for this purpose. The SPH has worked with other degree -granting units of the University to develop a large number of concurrent (joint) degree program s to meet the strong interest in public health among students in other professional and academic programs. The large number of concurrent degrees also illustrat es the eagerness of the faculty in the SPH to be responsive to the needs of students in other UW departments and schools . We are assisted in creating these concurrent degrees by the policies of the Graduate School , which prom ote this kind of interdisciplinary collaboration. The purpose of the concurrent degree is to allow students to obtain two degrees in a timeframe that is less (usually by one year) than what would be required if they had to enroll in both degree s sequential ly. This is accomplished by counting selected required courses for each degree as electives for the other degree. The concurrent degree programs are identified in Table 2.1.1 and d escriptions of the programs are given below. These programs have all been developed in accordance with the guidelines specified by the UW Graduate School (Graduate School Memorandum No. 35, Concurrent Degree Programs, which is found in Appendix 2.13.A ). Students in these joint programs must be admitted to each degree program indiv idually and must fulfill the academic requirements for each program. Concurrent degrees are managed jointly by designated faculty in each participating program or school to ensure coordination of curriculum and adequate supervision and support of students. In general, each year only a few students enroll in a concurrent degree program. The MD/MPH and the MSW/MPH programs have the most students, approximately five to ten entering students per year in each program. MPH c oncurrent degree programs MD/MPH : Medi cal students may apply to the concurrent program during their first year in Medical School . Students complete all requirements of the MPH degree, which they usually do during an intense five-quarter period between their third and fourth year in medical sch ool. The objective of the program is to supplement the training of medical students with a broad understanding of public health and community medicine. Students generally choose to pursue the MPH in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health S ciences, Epidemiology Global Health, or the Department of Health Services. Recently there has been a significant growth in the interest of medical students in this opportunity. MN (Master of Nursing)/MPH : This three -year program, offered jointly with the S chool of Nursing and the Department of Health Services, allows students to develop competence in community health or parent and child nursing, an understanding of the organization and function of the health care delivery system, and the basic analytic skil ls necessary to do research and to perform competently in a variety of health services careers. Students take the core public health courses and the core curriculum in either community health care systems or parent and child health nursing. The objective of the program is to prepare professionals to work at the interface of nursing and public health in practice, research, planning, administ ration, and policy development. MPH programs in Global Health and Health Services participate in this program. MSW (Ma ster of Social Work)/MPH : This three- year program, offered jointly with the School of Social Work and the Department of Health Services, leads to an MSW/MPH degree with interdisciplinary preparation in the fields of social work and public health. Students usually have backgrounds in social, behavioral, or biological sciences ; or clinical health services. The objective of the program is to prepare professionals to work at the interface of social work and public health, in practice, research, planning, admini stration, and policy development. Various MPH tracks in the Department of Health Services University of Washington School of Public Health Page 117 participate in this program. MAIS (Master of Arts in International Studies)/MPH : This three -year program is offered jointly with the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies. Students take the required courses for the international health track of the MPH and a core MAIS curriculum that addresses global , political, economic, social, and anthropological issues. The objective of the program is to train public hea lth professionals, administrators, and policy analysts for careers focused on health issues in the developing world. The Departments of Epidemiology and Global Health participate in this program. MPA (Master of Public Administration)/MPH: The purpose of the MPA/MPH degree is to create a master's level opportunity for future leaders in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, to prepare for the breadth of issues facing management -level positions in public health management. The proposed educational progra ms create a curriculum designed to integrate knowledge and skills in organizational management, policy analysis, social and natural science, and public health management in ways suitable for professional development in the public, private, and nonprofit se ctors; and to create a collaborative and interdisciplinary learning environment in which master's students with different backgrounds can contribute to the coll ective educational experience. This program is offered through the Departments of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, Epidemiology, Global Health, and Health Services. MSD (Master of Science in Dentistry)/MPH : The purpose of the concurrent MSD/MPH degree is to train future leaders in pediatric dentistry for leadership roles in education, research, public health administration, advocacy, and public service for MCH populations, including children with special health care needs. This interdisciplinary program is aimed at educating pediatric dentists who can bring a public health orientation a nd rigor to their work with these populations at the community level or within health administration, academic, or policy arenas. The concurrent degree program creates a curriculum designed to integrate knowledge and skills in family -centered, culturally a ppropriate pediatric dentistry for underserved populations, including children with special health care needs, with knowledge of public health science and approaches to maternal and child health issues including epidemiology, biostatistics, principles of e vidence -based care, program development, analysis, and evaluation. The program provides a collaborative and interdisciplinary learning environment in which master's students and faculty from SPH and Pediatric Dentistry can contribute to the collective educational experience and develop joint initiatives and activities. Students in this program may choose between the MCH Tracks in Epidemiology or Health Services. JD (Juris Doctorate)/MPH : The overall goal of the concurrent degree and certificate programs is to train professionals who will be specially suited to advocate for and implement public health policy in both the national and international arenas. This concurrent degree program would offer students the opportunity to combine in- depth professional educa tional training in the two professions. Graduates with the JD/MPH concurrent degree would have the ability to move more directly into government, national and international public agencies, and public interest organizations focusing on public health and he alth care issues, services, and resources. Similarly, graduates will possess legal skills in addition to the public health knowledge they may bring to health departments and other public health agencies. For example, graduates will be attuned to the legal ramifications of the changing health care industry and public health arena. Graduates will be adept at interpreting laws and regulations, analyzing them, and determining what will be necessary for compliance. Graduates will also be prepared to serve effect ively a s change agents and advocates. Students may choose between MPH programs in the Department of Global Health, the Department of Health Services, or in the Public Health Genetics Program. PhD (Anthropology)/MPH : This concurrent degree program offers an interdisciplinary curriculum in the fields of public health and anthropology leading to the Master of Public Health (MPH) and Anthropology (PhD) degrees. The concurrent degree program is designed to prepare professionals who will function in multidisciplinary health settings in the areas of teaching, research, administration, planning, and policy development and implementation. Students admitted into the concurrent degree program will be those University of Washington School of Public Health Page 118 who have identified a strong commitment to devoting their caree rs to innovative approaches to solving the world's most pressing global health issues. The Departments of Epidemiology, Global Health, and Health Services participate in this program. MHA c oncurrent degree programs JD (Juris Doctorate)/MHA : The overall go al of this concurrent degree program is to train professionals who will be especially suited to roles in health administration in which both legal and administrative expertise would be advantageous. It offers students the opportunity to combine in- depth pr ofessional educational training in health administration and law so that they will be prepared to work in both venues or in positions requiring an understanding of both. Graduates with the joint degree will not be limited to the traditional career opportunities of legal work in a law firm. They will have the ability to move more directly into administrative positions in government agencies and health care entities such as hospitals, health plans, and health service organizations. Similarly, graduates will p ossess legal skills that they can bring to health care entities and government agency professional positions. MBA (Master of Business Administration)/MHA : This three -year program was established to provide a broader exposure and more in- depth knowledge wit hin both management and health services disciplines. The objective of the program is to train students who wish to pursue careers in the private sector of health care, through coursework in both the School of Business and the SPH. MPA (Master of Public Aff airs)/MHA : The purpose of the MPA/MHA degree is to create a master's level opportunity for future leaders in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, to prepare for the breadth of issues facing management -level positions in public health management. The educational programs created a curriculum designed to: integrate knowledge and skills in organizational management, policy analysis, social and natural science, and public health management in ways suitable for professional development in the public, pr ivate, and nonprofit sectors. This program c reate s a collaborative and interdisciplinary learning environment in which master's students with different backgrounds can contribute to the collective educational experience. MD/MHA : The concurrent MD/MHA is for students who want to combine education in health care management and policy with their clinical training. For medical students interested in playing a broader role than service provider in the system, clinical training is only a starting point. Students w ho plan a career in management or policy need both skills and contextual understanding in these areas. Students in this program can expect to use their concurrent degree either to broaden their perspective as clinicians/advocates/leaders or to take on broa der roles such as manager of a clinical department within a health care organization, medical director of a public program (e.g ., Medicaid), policy advis or, or consultant. MPH/MHA : Within the SPH, students may pursue a concurrent MPH/MHA degree to 1) enhan ce their public health training with additional management and leadership training , or 2) enhance their training in management with additional public health training. MS c oncurrent degree programs MPA (Master of Public Affairs)/MS : The purpose of the MPA/M S degree is to create a master's level opportunity for future leaders in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, and to prepare for the breadth of issues facing management -level positions in public health management. The proposed educational programs c reate a curriculum designed to: integrate knowledge and skills in organizational management, policy analysis, social and natural science, and public health management in ways suitable for professional development in the public, private, and nonprofit secto rs; and c reate a collaborative and interdisciplinary learning environment in which master's students with different backgrounds can contribute to the collective educational experience. This program is offered through the Departments of Environmental a nd Oc cupational Health Sciences and Epidemiology . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 119 PhD (Molecular and Cellular biology)/MS (Epidemiology) : This concurrent degree program is designed to address the demand for basic scientists who are prepared to conduct interdisciplinary research that translate s findings in the laboratory to the clinical and population- based settings, and vice -versa. The goal of this concurrent degree program is to train basic scientists in modern epidemiological research methods, providing them with skills and knowledge that wi ll position them for translational science- oriented post - doctoral positions and eventually leadership roles at academic research institutions as well as in industry. PhD c oncurrent degree programs MD/PhD : Exceptional medical students may combine the MD pro gram with a PhD program in Biostatistics, Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, Epidemiology , Health Services, or Pathobiology. All requirements for the PhD must be met. The objective of the program is to train physician- scientists for academic and research careers. In addition to the \" formal \" concurrent degrees, students are free to pursue \" informal \" concurrent degrees. The rules governing informal concurrent degrees are the same as for formal one s, the differences being a) they are not advertise d, b) they are developed on an individualize d, ad hoc basis, and c) the U niversity does not create separate \" codes\" for these dual degrees in the UW Student Database. In this regard, the Graduate S chool allows concurrent programs combining professional deg rees with an academic degree in another program. Several of our formal concurrent degrees began as informal concurrent degrees and were subsequently \" formalized. \" 2.13.B. A list and description of how each joint degree program differs from the standard degree program. The school must explain the rationale for any credit sharing or substitution as well as the process for validating that the joint degree curriculum is equivalent. The purpose of the concurrent degree is to allow students to obtain two degrees in a timeframe less (usually by one year) than if they had enrolled in both degrees sequentially. This is accomplished by counting selected required courses for each degree as electives for the other degree. Nevertheless, students pursuing these concurrent degrees must complete all requirements for both degrees . With very few exceptions, all concurrent students must satisfactor ily complete the same courses required of nonconcurrent degree students . Students in concurrent degree programs are expected to atta in the expected SPH core -, departmental - (and track -, if appropriate) related competencies. The only exception to this is that some students from the Schools of Medicine, Public Affairs, and Social Work who are in concurrent MPH programs can \u2014on a case by case basis\u2014substitute the field experience assignments of their non -SPH program for their MPH practicum . The reason for this flexibility is that, in the case of these three schools, their fieldwork/internship requirements exceed those of the practicum. Therefore, we allow these other experiences to substitute for the practicum i f the experience 1) is as substantive as the MPH practicum requirement, 2) require s at least as much time as the MPH practicum, 3) involves public health issues and skills, and 4 ) meets the explicit learning objectives of the MPH practicum. Detailed description s of the potentially substitutable field experiences in the Schools of Medicine, Public Affairs, and Social Work are provided in Appendix 2.13.B . The culminating experience (th esis or capstone project) of concurrent degree students must be done in the SPH and meet the expectations for focus, rigor, quality, and effort of the dissertation/thesis/capstone project for their respective SPH degree programs. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 120 2.13.C. Assessment of t he extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH offers a wide range of concurrent (joint) degrees. For each of these concurrent degrees, students must fu lfill all requ irements for their MPH, MS, PhD, or MHA degree in a manner equivalent to what would be required were they pursuing the degrees separately. The G raduate S chool formally recognizes these concurrent degrees and acknowledges them on the student's transcript . Weaknesses/Challenges The small number of students in these concurrent degree programs, combined with the complexities involved with coordinating the requirements and schedules for two separate programs , makes the management and advising for t hese students more resource- intensive than for single -degree students. Concurrent students in COPHP deal with additional financial issues due to the fee -based program tuition structure of the COPHP program. Plans The SPH will continue to be responsive to w orking with other degree -granting programs to create and enhance its concurrent degrees. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 121 2.14 DISTANCE EDUCATION OR EXECUTIVE DEGREE PROGRAMS If the school offers degree programs using formats or methods other than students attending regular on -site course sessions spread over a standard term, these programs must a) be consistent with the mission of the school and within the school's established areas of expertise; b) be guided by clearly articulated student learning outcomes that are rigorously evaluated; c) be subject to the same quality control processes that other degree programs in the school and university are; and d) provide planned and evaluated learning experiences that take into consideration and are responsive to the charact eristics and needs of adult learners. If the school offers distance education or executive degree programs, it must provide needed support for these programs, including administrative, travel, communication and student services. The school must have an o ngoing program to evaluate the academic effectiveness of the format, to assess learning methods and to systematically use this information to stimulate program improvements. The school must have processes in place through which it establishes that the stu dent who registers in a distance education or correspondence education course or degree is the same student who participates in and completes the course or degree and receives the academic credit. 2.14.A. Identification of all degree programs that are off ered in a format other than regular, on -site course sessions spread over a standard term, including those offered in full or in part through distance education in which the instructor and student are separated in time or place or both. The instructional ma trix in Criterion 2.1.a may be referenced for this purpose. The SPH offers two executive degree programs: The MHA program offers a n Executive MHA program (EMHA) , a part -time professional degree program that enables students to earn their master's degree i n two years without leaving their current positions. This program is offered only in an on- site format. The EMHA program offers in -residence courses but on a modified, intensive schedule that meets the time demands of working professionals . An executive MP H degree is offered through the e MPH program . This partial -distance program is a \"blended \" combination of distance learning and on- site weekend and summer sessions. The program can be completed in two years. 2.14.B. Description of the distance education or executive degree programs, including an explanation of the model or methods used, the school's rationale for offering these programs, the manner in which it provides necessary administrative and student support services, the manner in which it monitors the academic rigor of the programs and their equivalence (or comparability) to other degree programs offered by the school, and the manner in which it evaluates the educational outcomes, as well as the format and methods. Executive MHA program The EMHA prog ram is described in C riteri on 2.8.A . This program is offered as an executive program aimed at attracting mid -career working professionals. This program matriculates 40 -50 students each year in two cohorts ( vs. 25- 30 students each year in the trad itional in -residence MHA program) . The executive format is attractive to working professionals, 75 percent of whom are clinically trained and do clinical work. The MHA and EMHA programs have an approximately 90 percent course overlap ( both content and instructor ). Thus, the curriculum and instructional quality of the programs are virtually identical. All of the MHA instructors have academic appointments within the School of Public Health's Department of Health Services. Thus, the faculty evaluation and promotional st andards are those of the Department of University of Washington School of Public Health Page 122 Health Services. The program has dedicated administrative support, in addition to the support provided by the UW Professional and Continuing Education (PCE) division, which manages the financial aspects of both the in- residence and executive program. The evaluation of educational outcomes (including formats and methods) conform to the current accreditation standards of the Commission on Accreditation of Health Managem ent Education (CAHME) and are monitored by program f aculty, the Department of Health Services Curriculum C ommittee , and the SPH Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee in the same manner as the in -residence program . The MHA /EMHA curricula have been developed using the leadership competency model develop ed by the National Ce nter for Healthcare Leadership (NCHL) . Both the MHA and EMHA degree programs are taught by the MHA faculty of the Department of Health Services through PCE as fee- based or self -sustaining educational programs. The standards for all applicants for admission to these programs are determined and managed by the MHA/ EMHA faculty and operationalized through PCE. The applications are identical, as are the application documentation requirements (with the exception of a requirement to submit sta ndardized test scores (MHA [required] and EMHA [not required]). The faculty made this documentation requirement decision since they noted that 50 percent or more of the EMHA applicants were having the requirement waived because of completion of prior maste r or doctoral programs and because the faculty did not note any additional predictive benefit of the unequally applied test score requirement when compared to the predictive benefits of work experience and work performance as evaluated through \"work -based recommendations.\" Both MHA - and EMHA -enrolled students complete the SPH Competency Assessment, the results of which are reviewed by program faculty and leadership to correct deficiencies in curriculum and to ensure that self -assessed competency of the executive students match or exceed those of in -residence MHA students. A detailed description of the curriculum and requirements for the EMHA can be found at http://depts.washington.edu/mhap/emha . Executive MHP program The Executive MPH program (eMPH) is offered in a hybrid format, with slightly less than half of the educational content delivered in a distance format. The e MPH program is designed for mid- career professionals in public, community , and environmental health. It helps develop skills to effectively manage today's population health and health care issues. The e MPH is a partial -distance program that requires some on -site attendance. The program can be completed in two years. Studies continue while off - site using the internet and email. The e MPH provides: Graduate education in core public health disciplines ( Health S ervices, E pidemiology, Environmental H ealth , and Biostatistics) A focus on program management and evaluation, health promotion and educa tion, and evidence - based research An introduction to research methods and, for those who work on a thesis, the opportunity to conduct a literature search, design a study, and collect and analyze data An opportunity to design an individualized course of study using elective courses, the thesis or capstone project, and practicum experience An o pportunity for graduate -level education without quitting the workforce All of the instructors in the eMPH program have academic appointments with in the School of Public Health or, in a few cases, other schools at UW, and therefore meet the same requirements as in -residence teaching . The program has its own dedicated administrative support which is funded through program revenues. The quality of teaching and learning is monitored by program faculty, the Department of Health Services Curriculum C ommittee , and the SPH Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee in the same manner as in -residence MPH program s. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 123 The on- site commitment involves eight on -site sessions per yea r, over a two- year period. Each session lasts between two to five days, depending on the quarter and subject matter. Most sessions are two to three days. A detailed description of the curriculum and requirements for the eMPH can be found at http://depts.washington.edu/hsedp/degree . The University of Washington and the SPH require all distance education courses be reviewed in an intensive format by the curriculum committee of the respective department and the SPH Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee . 2.14.C. Description of the processes that the school uses to verify that the student who registers in a distance education or correspondence education course or degree is the same student who partici pates in and completes the course or degree and receives the academic credit. The EMHA program is taught on campus. Participation in classes, as well as attendance for exams, is monitored in the same fashion as for in- residence program s. The small class si ze allow s faculty to monitor \u2014and mentor \u2014students on a personal basis. Most courses for eMPH are offered in a hybrid format, so that students take their exams w hile on- site as opposed to at -a-distance. In some SPH distance courses offered through UW Profess ional and Continuing Education (PCE), students have the option of a proctored exam at PCE facili ties in Seattle or Bellevue, WA, or through a process by which students at a distance may find and request a particular proctor in their local area. The individ ual must meet specific PCE criteria to be a proctor and must then be approved by PCE before exams are sent to the proctor. Most students use library proctor services, other universities, strict work -related proctors, or others who meet the guidelines. 2.14.D. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH offers and supports a part -time, partial distance MP H degree through the e xecutive MPH program and a part -time, in -residence MH A degree through the Executive MHA program. These programs meet the needs of mid -professional s in the region and beyond. Each of these programs has carefully crafted learning objectives that are comparable to the learning objectives for the traditional MPH and MHA programs in the SPH . Each program practice s extensive, continuous quality control and improvement efforts, including student, peer, and outside evaluation, as well as periodic curriculum review and revisi on. The e xecutive MPH and Executive MHA programs are self -sustaining and generate adequate resources for educational and administrative support of the program s. Weaknesses/Challenges The nontraditional nature of these programs requires a separate administr ative structure and constant marketing efforts. Plans The SPH will c ontinue these two successful programs. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 124 CRITERION 3.0: CREATION, APPLICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE 3.1 RESEARCH The school shall pursue an active research pro gram, consistent with its mission, through which its faculty and students contribute to the knowledge base of the public health disciplines, including research directed at improving the practice of public health. 3.1.A. Description of the school's researc h activities, including policies, procedures and practices that support research and scholarly activities. The University of Washington is a R esearch I university . Since 1975, the University has ranked among the top five institutions in the United States in the receipt of federal research awards. For the past several years, the UW has ranked second overall in the nation and first or second among public institutions in receipt of federal funds. In 2011- 12, the UW received $1 .5 billion in external (largely fe deral) research funds. The SPH is the second largest recipient of research awards at the UW, exceeded only by the School of Medicine. A high level of research is crucial to fulfilling the SPH's mission of promoting better health, preventing illness and in jury, ensuring more efficient and cost -effective health care services, and meeting the SPH's principal goals \u2014particularly training public health researchers and practitioners. Excellence in research is one of the SPH's strategic goals and is essential for maintaining the SPH's national reputation, which in turn helps attract outstanding faculty and students. Many of the graduate programs in the SPH are research training programs, and the success and relevance of such training depends on faculty who are actively engaged in research. The SPH is among the top five schools at UW in attracting extramural funds for research . In 2011- 2012, the SPH received $185 million in grants and contracts. SPH faculty believe that excellent graduate programs and excellent research programs are symbiotic; the strength of the SPH's educational program depends on the strength of its research. The availability of research assistantships is a key element in recruiting outstanding students. The ability to attract professional trainin g grant support is enhanced by the research reputation of the faculty. In 2011 -12, the SPH provided research assistantships, primarily from federally supported research and training grants, to 220 students. Policies All SPH faculty members in the professo rial tracks are expected to make ongoing research contributions in their areas of expertise , seek and obtain external funding for research, and publish the results of their research in peer reviewed journals. The SPH Academic Affairs Handbook (Appendix 1.5 .B) delineates faculty expectations for research. It is recognized that the research record commensurate with a given level of achievement varies from discipline to discipline within the SPH. Continued productivity in rank is considered at the time of eval uation. The successful candidate's research record should be of high quality, and his or her research should demonstrate substantial impact. Evidence of high quality and impact might include: Positive evaluation of research productivity, quality , and impac t in letters from independent, recognized experts in the candidate's research area. Sustained productivity in publication, including substantial contributions as senior author, meeting the norms for the candidate's field . Scholarly reputation of the journa ls in which publications appear . University of Washington School of Public Health Page 125 Reputation of publishers of articles, books , and monographs . Citation of the research in other publications . Published evaluations of the research such as book reviews and responses in print . Awards received in recognition of outstanding research . Indications of research reputation among peers such as invitations to speak at or lead sessions at national or international scientific meetings; invited participation on advisory committees, peer review groups, and editorial board s; and leadership positions in professional societies. Serving as principal i nvestigator (PI) on funded grants or contracts . Serving as a major scientific contributor on a funded research grant. Senior authorships are considered according to the conventions of the field. Publications that bear the name of the faculty member's preceptee as senior author may be considered as a senior author publication of the faculty member if the candidate was a major contributor to the conceptual development and conduct of the research and to the preparation of the manuscript. This role should be described in documents accompanying the candidate's promotion packet. Important original contributions in books or monographs may also be considered when they are accompanied in th e promotion packet by a description of their significance. Some candidates will choose to emphasize academic public health practice as one venue for their scholarly contributions to public health. This is also described in the SPH Academic Affairs Handbook : Academic PHP includes a wide array of activities. Regardless of the specific activities undertaken, the candidate's portfolio of academic PHP activities should be of high quality and demonstrate: (1) scientific rigor; (2) positive impact on the target co mmunity, population or organization; (3) effective dissemination; and (4) leadership. The quantity of documented academic PHP activities expected for promotion depends upon the anticipated weight being given to these activities in the candidate's review. A clear trajectory of increasing impact that includes plans for future years should be explained in the self assessment or highlighted in the SPH Curriculum Vitae (CV), because this will carry weight in the review for promotion . It is recognized that this e mphasis will generally result in fewer contributions in the area of research, although peer -reviewed contributions and a national or international scientific -professional reputation are expected for all candidates up for promotion. Procedures and practice s Faculty develop research proposals for federal, state, and local agencies as well as private institutions. Proposals are submitted to the department chair, the d ean's office, and the Office of Sponsored Programs for review and approval before being forwa rded to the granting agency. The University's committees on Human Subjects (IRB) and Animal Care (IACUC) also review proposals when appropriate. The SPH associate dean for Research and Programs is a member of the University of Washington Human Subjects Policy Board to coordinate University- wide policy. After awards are made, the grant or contract is managed and administered by the principal investigator together with the appropriate department administrator. All principal investigators are periodically required to attend a University -sponsored workshop on grant and contract management. A portion of indirect cost returns from grants and contracts are returned to the SPH by the University; these are distributed to the departments in proportion to the funds generated each year to provide research infrastructure support for departments and to support new initiatives and interdisciplinary programs. Of the total indirect costs the University receives to support the research infrastructure , one third to one half goes to SPH and almost all of that is returned to the departments in which the grant is administered . The SPH retains a small portion of these indirect cost returns to support school -wide research activities. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 126 Research results are disseminated through peer -reviewed scholarly journals and presentations at professional meetings. These publications are listed in the Peer Reviewed Journals section of faculty CVs (Appendix 4.1.A.ii ) and the publication output of the faculty is summarized in Table 3.1.D , which indica tes that SPH assistant professors publish approximately three peer -reviewed articles a year, associate p rofessors, four per year, and full professors, seven per year. These publications are widely cited as reflected by H -index scores. Other methods of dis semination include final project reports, public testimony, public presentations, and various review publications. In addition, most faculty discuss current research findings and activities in class and seminar presentations. Research at partner i nstitutio ns Much of the research of SPH faculty is conducted through our partner institutions (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, Group Health Research Institute, etc.). Data on these grants/studies are not captured in UW data syst ems, but it is estimated that these grants account for at least 50 percent additional funding over those grant funds that come to UW directly. SPH r esearch c enters and institutes Although most research in the SPH is generated by investigator -initiated prop osals, the SPH houses , or is a partner in, many research centers and institutes which serve as focal points \u2014and homes \u2014for much of the research activities of SPH faculty.

The SPH's recently completed Strategic Plan 2012- 2020 identified six targeted areas for growth. The areas address pressing public health challenges and are based on strategic advantages such as existing strengths at the SPH , strength elsewhere at UW, and our potential to contribute to science and make a positive impact on the health of populations. Each topic has the potential to engage the entire SPH and build new bridges across departments and UW s chools and c olleges and affiliated community -based organizations. Growth in these areas will include each part of the SPH's mission: education\u2014preparing outstanding, innovative, and diverse University of Washington School of Public Health Page 128 public health leaders, research \u2014advancing public health science and policies, and service\u2014promoting the health and well -being of communities locally, nationally, and globally. While no specific timelines are included in this Strategic Plan , addressing these emerging public health areas will require a phased approach, including fundraising. Successful implementation will be carried out through consultation and collaboration across the SPH , the UW campus, and with community partners. Over the next eight years, the SPH will be hiring new faculty to address the following six eme rging challenges. A. Global Environmental Change and Human Health Accelerated changes in natural and built environments have unprecedented implications for human health and well -being on a global scale. Health can no longer be viewed solely through the len ses of medical care or public health. Long -term human security requires that gains in human health be accompanied by corresponding gains in the health and sustainability of ecosystems and built environments. There is a need for a systems approach that blen ds biomedical, social, and physical sciences, includes adaptive learning, and addresses decision -making in the face of uncertainty. Our strengths in this area include a robust Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, methodological ex pertise in biostatistics and epidemiology necessary for methods development, and a global health orientation that corresponds to the scale of many environmental changes. There is extensive expertise in UW's c olleges and s chools of Environment, Built Environments, and Engineering. The \"Climate Change and Global Health\" initiative, launched by the Department of Global Health, has engaged faculty from 10 UW s chools and colleges, focusing on food and water security under climate change. Moreover, there are stro ng funding prospects from private donors, foundations, and federal agencies. The UW has the opportunity to form a community of scholars across disciplines to become a leading academic center at the nexus of global environmental change and health. B. Genom ics and Public Health Advances in genomics will increasingly help guide public health practice. Understanding genetic differences in disease susceptibility holds great promise in prevention research, as a full understanding of the etiology of multi -factori al diseases will be essential to identifying effective prevention strategies to reduce the burden of diseases. It is becoming the case that nearly every epidemiological study has a genomic component. Virtually every component of public health will be subst antially impacted by changes in science and technology that relate directly to genomics. Genomic profiles may also determine how individuals respond to environmental exposures and so affect public health responses. At the individual level, rapid advances in molecular technology have led to the new -omics fields of genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and lipidomics. At the population level, similarly vast arrays of detailed medical records allow the detection of subtle patterns to aid the formulation of mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of diseases that have previously been impossible with limited study populations. The enormous challenges to managing and interpreting these data are matched by equally enormous potentia l benefits for public health. There is a particularly pressing need for the development of new statistical methodologies. Research and training are needed to address problems of design and interpretation of studies of - omic and medical record data. The UW is poised to be a national and global leader in this area. Within the SPH , faculty members in the Department of Biostatistics are leaders in developing and applying statistical methodologies for high - throughput - omic data in collaboration with researchers across UW and beyond. Existing strengths also include the Institute for Public Health Genetics, the Center for Genomics and Public Health \u2014one of only two centers in the nation focused on integrating genomic advances into public health practice \u2014and the Center for Ecogenetics and Environmental Health. The SPH houses coordinating centers for the multi -site GENEVA and GARNET whole -genome association study consortia. Additionally, there are relevant collaborations with UW Departments of Computer Science, Genome Sciences and Statistics, and the new Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine and the Northwest Genomics Center in the School of Medicine. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 129 C. Obesity, Food, Physical Activity, and Health Obesity is a public health issue of growing importance. About two- thirds of U.S. adults are overweight or obese, with the disease burden falling disproportionately on disadvantaged minorities and groups. The consequences on morbidity and mortality as well as the associated medical, social, economic, and psychological costs demand speedy and effective solutions. Both food intake and physical activity play important roles. An understanding of food intake requires a multidisciplinary approach, ranging from dietetics and nutritional science to agricultural economics to the soci ology and anthropology of food. An understanding of physical activity also requires a multidisciplinary approach, ranging from the design of buildings, neighborhoods, and cities, to the economic and social factors that determine health behaviors. UW is wel l positioned to consolidate existing strengths and build selectively to become a leader in addressing this complex of issues. Strengths at the School of Public Health include the Center for Public Health Nutrition, the Health Promotion Research Center, the Center for Obesity Research, and the interdisciplinary g raduate p rogram in Nutritional Sciences. Methodological strength in biostatistics and epidemiology will help advance the multilevel analyses and complex models needed in this field. Colleagues in the UW College of Built Environments have strong interests in the intersection of their work with health, and colleagues in the College of the Environment are leading researchers in agriculture. There are strong collaborative links with both schools. SPH rese archers also collaborate with partners at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Group Health Research Institute, and other partner institutions on investigations of obesity etiology and prevention, dietary and physical activity behavior change at wor ksites and in communities, and evaluation of health promotion programs and policies. In addition to such research activities, the SPH can assist with policy development and evaluation in the area of obesity prevention, healthy eating, and physical activity promotion by collaborating with local and state health agencies. D. Health Policy and Health Systems The U.S. health care system is the most expensive in the world. Yet the health of the U.S. population overall is demonstrably worse than that of most wealthy countries. The structure and incentives in our system have engendered fiscal inefficiencies and an inequitable and unpredictable distribution of care. And as the health care system continues to consume an ever greater share of our country's economy, health inequities in the system also continue to grow. A major impediment to achieving good outcomes, fairness, and fiscal efficiency in our system is the failure to infuse policy discussions with evidence and sound analysis. UW can offer a meaningful con tribution to the health policy dialogue locally, nationally, and globally. The School of Public Health has a history of health policy research, analysis, and service. This foundation will be expanded by applying the many strengths offered across our depart ments, including outcomes of research and comparative effectiveness research (Health Services); population risk assessment (Biostatistics and Epidemiology); environmental toxicants and occupational health services and outcomes research (Environmental and O ccupational Health Sciences); and global health metrics and evaluation (Global Health). The SPH will foster policy research, teaching, and service linkages across departments and research centers, such as the Centers for Comparative and Health System Effec tiveness and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and with other UW schools and colleges, such as the School of Law and the College of Built Environments. The SPH will leverage existing collaborative relationships in the community, for example, with public health and social services agencies, executive- branch leaders, health care providers and purchasers, and community organizations. Growth in the policy area will allow the SPH to bring evidence and sound analysis to policy discussions in an env ironment of rapidly evolving health care system changes. This contribution also will help position the SPH as a highly successful competitor for federal, state, and foundation support for both applied and translational research. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 130 E. Public Health Implement ation Science Implementation science is the study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence -based practices into routine practice to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services and care. Implementation science is an emerging field, both domestically and globally, and an essential component of translating effective public health programs from evidence to action. Implementation Science uses rigorous methods in practical field settings to improve health and well -being locally, nationally , and globally. Many public health professionals trained in the classical scientific disciplines of public health (e.g., biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health, health services) will go on to lead interdisciplinar y public health programs. Future public health scientists and leaders therefore must understand not only delivery of innovation, but also innovation of delivery. For example, several exciting developments, some led by UW faculty or graduates, will lead to new multicomponent HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Interdisciplinary training and field experience in public health program science will enable future public health leaders to understand and undertake such efforts, along a program science continuum from new evidence to monitoring impact. In a city rich with global health organizations and health agencies and with a faculty deeply experienced in implementing health programs, the University of Washington is well positioned to be a global leader in implementatio n science. The PhD in Metrics and Implementation Science, scheduled for launch in 2012, will be the first program of its kind in the United States, and will pave the way for further innovation in research, teaching, and service at the SPH and the Universit y. F. Social Determinants of Health Health is influenced by the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, and work, as well as the systems put in place to deal with illness. The social determinants of health are a major contributor to health inequities and the differences in health status seen within and between countries. The World Health Organization identifies health as a key contributor to a wide range of societal goals. Health inequities constitute a clear indicator of the failure of a society's policies across many domains including education, housing, justice, and security. In the words of Lancet editor Richard Horton, \"Public health is the science of social justice, overcoming the forces that undermine the future security of families, communities, and peoples.\" Research and education about the social determinants of health is occurring at the SPH in various centers and institutes including the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the Health Promotion Research Center, and the Cen ter for Disability Policy and Research. There are methodological challenges to building the evidence base, requiring statistical and epidemiologic expertise. The emphasis is on creating synergies around current work and developing new ideas that will advan ce the field of social determinants. Within the University of Washington there are opportunities to partner with the schools and colleges. 3.1.B. Description of current research undertaken in collaboration with local, state, national or international healt h agencies and community -based organizations. Formal research agreements with such agencies should be identified. In addition to research conducted within the UW research centers and institutes described above, SPH faculty engage in a large amount of inter -institutional sponsored and collaborative research with a wide range of local, national, and international agencies and community- based organizations. Funded community- based research and service projects are identified in Appendix 3.1.C (research) and Appendix 3.2.C .i (service). University of Washington School of Public Health Page 131 Our major research partners include: Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center* Group Health Research Institute * Health Alliance International * Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation * Institute for Systems Biology* PATH Public Health -Seattle & King County* Seattle Biomed * Seattle Children's Hospital Research Institute VA Puget Sound Health Care System* Washin gton State Department of Health* Washington State Department of Social an d Health Services Washington State Labor & Industry * (*organizations and agencies with formal agreements) Many of these partnerships focus on, or incorporate , research directed at improving public health practice or the health of the community, and many have specific community outreach components or otherwise work in collaboration with community groups. Northwest Center for Public Health Practice Since 2008, the faculty affiliated with the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice (NWCPHP) have develope d a portfolio of research activities in partnership with state and local health departments and associated community organizations to conduct research on practical questions of mutual interest. These have included several research activities on various asp ects of communications related to public health emergencies; how local health departments can use community -specific data about the projected health impacts of climate change; and how emergency call centers can work more effectively with callers whose Engl ish is limited. NWCPHP faculty and staff have also been active the Washington State Practice- Based Research Network which links nine local health departments, the state department of health, and several units within the University of Washington to conduct practice -based research. In the last five years , the NWCPHP has expanded a focus on research, including public health and climate change, emergency public health communicatio ns, and public health systems and services. ( http://www.nwcphp.org/research ) 3.1.C. A list of current research activity of all primary faculty identified in Criterion 4.1.a., including amount and source of funds, for each of the last three years. See CEPH Data Template 3.1.1; only research funding should be reported here. Extramural funding for service or training/continuing education grants should be reported in Template 3.2.2 (funded service) or Template 3.3.1 (funded training/workforce development), respectively. CEPH Data Template 3.1.1 is found in Appendix 3.1.C . (Note that the data in Appendix 3.1.C do not include the funded research of faculty members of Department of Global Health whose primary appointment s are in the School of Medicine , even though this research is primarily in area s of public health . This anomalous situation arises from the MOU that established the Department of Global Health as a joint venture between the School of Public Health and the School of Medicine (see Appendix 1.4.D ). This MOU specifies that a faculty memb er whose primary appointment is in the Department of Global Health can be primarily appointed in either Public Health or Medicine, not both. The data included in CEPH Data Templates 3.1.1, 3.2.2, and 3.3.1are only for faculty with primary appointments in t he SPH .) University of Washington School of Public Health Page 132 3.1.D. Identification of measures by which the school may evaluate the success of its research activities, along with data regarding the school's performance against those measures for each of the last three years. For example, schools may track d ollar amounts of research funding, significance of findings (e.g., citation references), extent of research translation (e.g., adoption by policy or statute), dissemination (e.g., publications in peer-reviewed publications, presentations at professional me etings) and other indicators. The SPH has an extensive research portfolio, with grants averaging above $1 million per primary faculty member. The faculty and students are successful in publishing their research, and the research of the faculty is widely cited as measured by the H -index. Table 3.1.D .

The thesis requirements for the MPH and MS prog rams and the dissertation requirement fo r the PhD programs ensure that students acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to pursue an independent research project and write the results in an acceptable form. It is common for students to publish in peer -reviewed journals while in the program or shortly after graduation. Typically, both master's and PhD students complete an independent research project resulting in a manuscript published in a peer -reviewed journal. For the master's degree, student research work often results in at least one published paper. PhD student s average three to four published papers . First authorship is expected for the MS, MPH, and PhD. On exit surveys, approximately 80 percent of SPH graduates reported that they have published or plan to publish their thesis or dissertation (see Table 3.1.E ). In addition to their own research, almost all PhD students and many master's students serve as research assistants on funded projects as noted in Appendix 3.1.C or are employed on an hourly ba sis on projects. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 133 Virtually all PhD students are supported by research assistantships \u2014approximately two -thirds through UW research and training grants and the remainder by research and training grants at our partner institutions (e.g., Fred Hutchinson Ca ncer Research Center, Seattle VA, Seattle Biomed, etc). Only 15 to 18 percent of MS and MPH students are supported by UW -based research assistantships. Table 3.1.E .

Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion . Strengths The SPH is one of the top sc hools of public health in the nation in external funding for research. The SPH has strong and productive research programs in all departments as measured by grant funding, faculty and student peer reviewed publications, impact of faculty publications, and doctoral involvement in research. The SPH houses or participates in a broad array of interdisciplinary research institutes. The SPH and the UW maintain a tradition of promoting cross -school (as well as inter - institutional) interdisciplinary research. Facu lty (and students) enjoy collegial ties and effective collaboration with faculty across SPH departments and in other UW Health Sciences schools, as well as with colleagues across the university and with researchers at neighboring institutions. Weaknesses/C hallenges Lack of on- campus space has caused geographical dispersal of faculty and research facilities. Support of master's students by research grants and traineeships is lower than desired. Continuing the current level of funding for research activities will be especially challenging in light of decreasing federal funds for research. Plans Continue to promote interdisciplinary research with colleagues within and outside the SPH, especially through the SPH Strategic Planning initiative to build/strengthen research programs in six emerging areas of public health. Pursue Strategic Plan hires of new faculty in areas of emerging public health importance. Protect student support from research and training grants to the greatest degree possible in the eventuality of reductions of federal funding. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 134 3.2 SERVICE The school shall pursue active service activities, consistent with its mission, through which faculty and students contribute to the advancement of public health practice. 3.2.A. Descr iption of the school's service activities, including policies, procedures and practices that support service. If the school has formal contracts or agreements with external agencies, these should be noted. The SPH and the Uni versity are strongly committed to their service roles. The University Policy Directory states that \"the University encourages faculty participation in public service. Such professional and scholarly service to schools, business, industry, and local, state, national, and international organizations is an integral part of the University's mission\" ( Faculty Code, Chapter 24, Section 24- 32). Service is a key component of the SPH mission as articulated in the SPH Strategic Plan 2012 -2020. As the only accredited U.S. school of public health in the Northwest, the SPH carries a responsibility to provide expert assistance to government and community agencies, industry, and business in the solution of regional public health problems. The SPH's service activities enable faculty to bring knowledge of current public health practice problems to the classroom and to research projects. In addition, a strong relationship with community agencies and businesses is needed for the field training of students. With the establishment of the Northwest Center for P ublic Health Practice, the SPH has strengthened its capacity for community involvement throughout the region. In addition to collaborating with state, local, tribal, and federal agencies and community -based organizations, SPH also has contracts with the MP H programs in the six northwestern states to assist in teaching activities. SPH also co -hosts an annual public health practice and environmental health conference with the new public health programs at Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia. Policies, p rocedures, and practices The SPH Academic Affairs Handbook clearly states that service is an expectation for all faculty (see Criterion 3.2.B , below.) An important development in the policy of the SPH is a revision to the Academic Aff airs Handbook that allows faculty to elect contribution to public health practice (PHP) as a criterion for promotion described as follows: Academic Public Health Practice: To encourage the advancement of scholarship in academic public health practice (acad emic PHP), the School of Public Health has established guidelines to evaluate scholarly academic PHP activities of faculty being considered for promotion. Faculty may choose to have their suitability for promotion be evaluated based in part upon their documented contributions to advancing academic PHP. It is recognized that individual faculty will differ in their respective emphases on academic PHP. Some faculty may have little or no involvement in academic PHP, while others may have contributed significant ly to advancing academic PHP. It is important that faculty who choose to become involved in academic PHP plan these activities as early as possible in the promotion cycle and establish clear, explicit objectives for these activities. The academic PHP plan should be discussed with the departmental chair at annual reviews and should be updated as needed to reflect changes in objectives. This promotion criteri on recognizes the importance to the SPH of faculty leadership and engagement in PHP. Northwest Center for Public Health Practice The Center's mission is to improve the quality and effectiveness of public health practice in the Pacific Northwest by linking academia and the practice community. The NWCPHP focuses its efforts on six states: Alaska, Idaho, Mon tana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 135 The Center was formed in 1990. In 2000, it became both an Academic Center for Public Health Preparedness, through funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Association of Schools of Public Health, and a Public Health Training Center, through funding from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration. The NWCPHP provides service to the practice community in many ways, in addition to the extensive array of workforce training . Activities have included providing program evaluation or coaching on program evaluation at the request of state and local health departments, providing technical assistance to health departments on an array of communications activities (such as editing and improving the layout of Oregon's plan for enhancing public health preparedness systems and skills), and coaching health departments that are moving toward accreditation. The Center works with state health agencies and tribal health organizations, primar ily through the Northwest Regional Public Health Workforce Development Network, to develop and implement a long- term, integrated approach to workforce development. The network assists the Center in setting goals and priorities and also provides mutual resources and support for its members. The Center's core activities focus on five areas: Developing educational content for practice -based continuing education. Conducting on- site and distance- learning training . Holding workforce and leadership training institutes . Providing technical assistance to state and local health departments. Coordinating special projects related to workforce and public health improvement. Health Policy Center Initiative The Health Policy Center Initiative in the Department of Hea lth Services helps move health policy analysis and decision -making forward at the local, regional, and national level through objective, rigorous, and accessible policy- relevant research, dissemination, and facilitation. The Initiative offers a variety of services, such as health policy research and analysis, strategic planning consultation, meeting and event facilitation, and policy information dissemination through publications, forums, web- based communication, and presentations. Initiative faculty and st aff participate on community advisory groups and boards, and on national academic research networks. The Initiative hosts the Safe Table Forums series, which brings together stakeholders in Washington State's health system for informed discussion on timely , controversial topics. Topics in 2012 include, \"Health Care Access for Adult Immigrants in Washington State\" and \"Family Planning Coverage for Low -Income Women in 2014.\" UW policy to promote outside consultation The University of Washington recognizes tha t faculty, librarians, and academic staff are experts in their chosen fields and are often offered consulting and professional opportunities for compensation beyond their UW employment. Executive Order No. 57 (http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/PO/EO57.html ) states: The University recognizes that individuals, the University, and the state benefit from faculty and staff involvement in and support of outside organizations and industry. Such involvement provides individuals opportunities to disseminate expert information outside of the traditional university employment structure while simultaneously providing individuals additional experiences, augmenting their ability to carry out their University responsibilities. The University benefits in its ongoing relationships with the local, regional, national, and international communities it seeks to serve. The UW permits faculty to use one day a week ( or 13 days per quarter) for o utside consulting. This policy encourages faculty to develop working relationships with public and community agencies, outside University of Washington School of Public Health Page 136 research organizations, and industry working in public health areas. UW faculty members complete an annual \"Summary of Outside Pr ofessional Services\" form that reports all outside activities, paid and unpaid. SPH awards for s ervice In 1995, the SPH initiated an annual Community Service Award for faculty that is equal in stature to the annual award in teaching. T he SPH also establis hed an annual Community Service Award for students. These awards are presented each year at a school -wide ceremony. Formal c ontracts or agreements with e xternal a gencies The SPH has more than 60 affiliation agreements or statements of understanding with ag encies throughout the Pacific Northwest. Examples of these agreements may be seen in Appendix 3.2.A . Examples are given below: State Health Departments in the Northwest . The Northwest Center for Public Health Practice has formal contracts or memorandums o f agreement with state health departments in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming, and the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board. Joint activities involve needs assessments, capacity assessments, preparedness training, informatics, and other training and consultative services as determined by the health departments. Public Health \u2014Seattle & King County . The SPH and Public Health \u2014Seattle & King County (PH -S&KC) were jointly awarded a grant in 2003 to develop an Academic Health Depart ment . Although CDC funding for this project only lasted one year, projects continue, such as enhancement of practicum opportunities for SPH students in the many activities conducted by PH -S&KC. Washington State Department of Labor and Industries Since 1963, the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences (DEOHS) has had a Memorandum of Understanding with the State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). DEOHS receives most of its state funding from L&I; in return DEOHS provides consultat ion, special field and laboratory investigations, and research on behalf of the industries and workers of the state. Staff members of the department's Field Research and Consultation Group, consisting of industrial hygienists supervised by faculty in indus trial hygiene and occupational medicine, carry out much of this work. 3.2.B. Description of the emphasis given to community and professional service activities in the promotion and tenure process. The SPH Academic Affairs Handbook explicitly describes the expectations for faculty service as follows: Service requirement for promotion: The faculty in the SPH can be considered to be a community of scholars. They are members of the larger University community and also of the broader community outside the Unive rsity. With these memberships come both benefits and responsibilities. Responsibility to the School includes the expectation that all faculty will serve the community at large in a professional capacity that enhances the standing of the School and the Univ ersity as a whole and provides benefits to the broader society. In addition, faculty maintain operation of the School and contribute to its reputation through efforts to improve its programs and facilities. Responsibilities to the faculty member's professi on include the expectation that faculty will contribute to the maintenance and growth of their profession....Service to the University and the broader community, and involvement in professional service activities outside the University, will be considered in recommending a faculty member for promotion. Such activities cannot substitute for teaching or research activities in meeting the minimum University of Washington School of Public Health Page 137 requirements for promotion, but they will be considered in evaluating a faculty member's overall suitability for prom otion. 3.2.C. A list of the school's current service activities, including identification of the community, organization, agency or body for which the service was provided and the nature of the activity, over the last three years. See CEPH Data Template 3.2.1. Projects presented in Criterion 3.1 should not be replicated here without distinction. Funded service activities may be reported in a separate table; see CEPH Data Template 3.2.2. Extramural funding for research or training/continuing education grant s should be reported in Templates 3.1.1 (research) and 3.3.1 (funded workforce development), respectively. Faculty engage in a wide variety of service activities ranging from voluntary work in neighborhood organizations to paid consulting for public and pr ivate health organizations. (See Appendix 3.2.C .i for CEPH Data 3.2.1 and Appendix 3.2.C.ii for CEPH Data Template 3.2.2). Examples of the types of service activities conducted by the faculty are listed below. Further details on faculty service ar e found in the individual faculty CVs available in the Appendix 4.1.A.ii . Grant Reviewing Bodies Advisory Boards Public Speaking to Community and Worker Groups Editorial Boards Manuscript Reviews (not included in Appendix 3.2.C .i) Consultancies Expert Pane ls Technical Assistance The faculty of the SPH participate in a wide range of collaborative service activities with partners in state and local public health agencies, advocacy/policy groups, and health care organizations, such as: Academic Alliance Founda tion Accordia Global Health Foundation Center for Studying Health System Change Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Community Pediatric Foundation of Washington de Beaumont Foundation, Inc. Directors of H ealth Promotion and Education (DHPE) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Healthy Housing Solutions, Inc.

Identification of the measures by which the school may evaluate the success of its service efforts, along with data regarding the school's performance against those measures for each of the last three years. Table 3.2.D . Indicators of service activities Indicator Target 2010-12 Percent of core faculty engaged in local or regional service activities 33% 40% Percent of core faculty engaged in national service activities 80% 77% Percent of core faculty engaged in international service a ctivities 33% 39% Percent of core faculty engaged in any service activities 100% 97% Virtually all SPH faculty are involved in local, regional, national, or international services activities (in addition to peer review of manuscripts); more than a third participate in international service (excluding research). The 3% of faculty who had no record of service on their CVs were primarily newly hired assistant professors or lecturers. 3.2.E. Description of student involvement in service, outside of those activities associated with the required practice experience and previously described in Criterion 2.4. The SPH views service as an integral part of our mission. Students contribut e a great deal to the field of public health through their engagement in service through both structured and unstructured opportunities with community agencies, government, industry, and others on a local, state, national , and international level. Examples of off -campus student service activities in the past three years: In partnershi p with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), faculty of the SPH have created an innovative program, \"Strategic Analysis, Research and Training\" (START) that combines the training of future global and public health professionals with the provision of high - quality research support services to organizations working in global health. Under the START program model, teams of graduate students and faculty mentors in public health, global health, medicine, epidemiology, business administration, and public pol icy provide analysis and research support to global health program efforts. Since its inception almost 2 years ago, START has worked with a variety of program teams at the BMGF and successfully completed over 30 University of Washington School of Public Health Page 139 research and analysis projects. Enthusiastic feedback has led to growing interest in expanding the services of this program to additional domestic and international organizations, including PATH, Public Health -Seattle & King County, and others. Faculty and students have worked with environmentally f ocused nonprofit groups such as Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility, the Washington Toxics Coalition, the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition and National Parks Service health programs . Students volunteer with a wide range of local nonprofits, such as Gay City Health Project, Lifelong AIDS Alliance, the Country Doctor Youth Clinic, Habitat for Humanity and SeaMar Community Health Center , Rainier Beach Urban Farm, Seattle Tilth, Cooking Matters, Food Lifeline, Marra Farms, the Hunger Intervention P rogram , and various food banks . Faculty and students have w orked with food and nutrition centered agencies such as organic farms . Faculty serve as members of local city and county councils advocating for issues such as bicycle safety, removal of foods with trans fats from restaurants, youth literacy , and access to housing. Faculty and students are involved with programs providing public education on current public health issues such as \"Paws on Science\" at the Pacific Science Center, facilitating interactiv e activities to introduce young kids and their families to core concepts and issues in public health genetics. Many of our students are involved in service on campus as well, e.g., in the following capacities: Our students developed and staffed an interactive table at Husky Days, where they engaged with kids and families to raise awareness about public health, gene -environment interactions, and the impact of healthy choices. Through active involvement on the organizing committee for the Western Regional In ternational Health Conference. This event, which began as a student - inspired, student -run conference, now draws close to 1,000 students, faculty, staff, residents, and community members from the western half of the United States and Canada and cites the University of Washington as its home institution. Student organizers are committed to pursuit of a career in global health, including nursing, medicine, social work, law, business, public health, dentistry, and pharmacy. Students are active members of the \"H ealth Equity Circle ,\" an interdisciplinary organization of University of Washington students and community members focused on creating health e quity . Main areas of focus include access to healthcare, food security, rural and immigrant health , and dispariti es. This group regularly plans and publicizes opportunities for students to engage in service, and hosts an annual service- learning \"kickoff\" event to connect students across our health sciences schools. Students are peer tutors, doing outreach and public health education for local hig h school and nonprofit groups. Because of i ts practice focus, the Community- Oriented Public Health Practice (COPHP) program requires a substantial service- learning component. This component uses extensive fieldwork with organizations, agencies, and communities to help students integrate course work with real -world experiences. During the first year, students work in a local health department or at other community -based field placements to help them acquire practical skills, of ten beyond the expectations for the practicum . In the second year, students select a community- based agency or organization with which to work on a year -long c apstone project. ( See Appendix 3.2.E for a description of these projects .) Additionally, much of the COPHP coursework involves working directly with community agencies to contribute to the solving of real -time public health issues. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 140 3.2.F. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is me t and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The school has a strong record of com munity and professional service. Faculty provide consultation to communities, government, biotechnology, and healt h care organizations, as well as to policy makers. Service activities of faculty are varied and compatible with the mission and goals of the SPH. Service and contributions to public health practice are explicit criteria for faculty promotion. SPH recogniz es academic public health practice as a pathway for promotion. The Northwest Center for Public Health Practice and the Northwest Center for Occupational Health and Safety provide extensive outreach, training, and service in the region. Student practicum an d capstone projects engage virtually all MPH and MHA students in local, regional, and international service activities. SPH undergraduate degree programs encourage service learning Weaknesses/Challenges Extensive infrastructure and resources are required t o maximize the benefit of student experiential/service learning (including the MPH Practicum). Although all faculty participate in service activities, and service is an explicit criterion for promotion, service is considered to be less important for promot ion than are teaching and research. Plans Continue to allow faculty to elect to have the option of using contribution to public health practice as a criterion for promotion. Continue to recognize service as a necessary requirement for promotion. Continue to provide annual faculty awards for exemplary service. Work with the Gates Foundation and Public Health-Seattle & King County to expand the very successful START program to address local and domestic public health challenges. The undergraduate Public H ealth m ajor program has partnered with the Carlson Leadership and Public Service Center, within the UW in the Center for Experiential Learning, to identify service - learning options through which undergraduate Public Health m ajors can complete their capston e requirement. The Carlson Center has extensive community connections, as well as a sophisticated infrastructure to help manage the student placements. Through this program, groups of four to five students will complete 50 hours of service learning to get exposure to people and public health issues. We anticipate we will offer three sections to serve 75 students in the next academic year. In order to enrich the learning experience of our students and to generate a sense of community across the school and af fect meaningful change, two school -wide service days are scheduled annually, in September and April , to provide direct experience and an opportunity for meaningful engagement with the populations with whom we work. The first of which is focused on incoming students and is a required component of new s tudent orientation. Institute monthly volunteer opportunities with the U ndergraduate Student Public Health Association . Publicize new volunteer opportunities on a \"volunteer opportunities\" page on our website. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 141 3.3 WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT The school shall engage in activities other than its offering of degree programs that support the professional development of the public health workforce. 3.3.A. Description of the ways in which the schoo l periodically assesses the continuing education needs of the community or communities it intends to serve. The assessment may include primary or secondary data collection or data sources. The Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences assesses needs for its continuing professional education and workforce training programs in several ways: Periodic alumni surveys Evaluation forms for continuing education courses that include a section for participants to describe their needs for additional training An email survey for p articipants in Occupational Medicine Grand Rounds after sessions, soliciting evaluation feedback and suggestions for topics for future grand rounds Informal mechanisms: discussions with faculty and participants at conferences, workshops, and courses Northwest Center for Public Health Practice (NWCPHP) uses several methods to ensure that its activities are responsive to the needs of the practice community. Training -related activities are planned with the involvement of a long- standing advisory group, the Regional Network Steering Committee (RNSC), which includes representatives of official state, local, and tribal public health organizations for all six states. The RNSC convenes formally twice a year to review and update plans and activities. Throughout the year, RNSC members also provide comments and reviews of proposals and serve as a channel to NWCPHP to identify emerging training needs or opportunities to serve the public health agencies and organization in other ways. The p rojects of the Department of Global Health's International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH) are collaborative undertakings with ministries of health and education. Together with national working groups in each country, I -TECH engages in th e planning and implementation of educational programs that are responsive to the specific needs and resources of the country. I -TECH also leads faculty development training to help the host countries become partners in education and eventually self -reliant . 3.3.B. A list of the continuing education programs, other than certificate programs, offered by the school, including number of participants served, for each of the last three years. Those programs offered in a distance - learning format should be identif ied. Funded training/continuing education activities may be reported in a separate table.

Description of certificate programs or other non -degree offerings of the school, including enrollment data for each of the last three years. SPH offers certificates through three mechanisms: Graduate certificates offered through the Graduate School The SPH offers 12 Graduate Certificate Programs, which are generally taken by matriculated students in the SPH \u2014or in graduate programs in other units of the UW \u2014during their graduate st udies. These Graduate Certificates provide a credential on the transcript documenting that the student successfully completed an organized, 15 -credit program in one of the specialty areas in the following table. Only six credits taken for a student's prima ry degree can count toward a Graduate Certificate. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 143 Table 3.3.B.ii. SPH Graduate Certificate Programs Certificate Certificate Objectives Advanced Clinical Research To provide introductory training in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, general researc h design principals, and design of clinical trials.

Public Health Genetics To provide training i n three primary areas of public health genetics: 1) Genetic epidemiology 2) Pharmacogenomics 3) Ethical, legal, and social issues connected with genetics University of Washington School of Public Health Page 144 Certificates offered through UW Professional and Continuing Education The MHA program, in collaboration with UW Educational Outreach, also offers a certificate program in Medical Management for mid -career physicians and other clinical practitioners seeking advanced preparation for executive positions in health care organizations. This four -course evening pr ogram allows clinically oriented professionals to gain knowledge and skills in planning, organizing, and implementing programs designed to address needs and improve the quality of patient care within the changing health care environment. This program does not confer UW academic credit. A Certificate in Public Health Practice is a for -credit program offered by the e MPH program to provide graduate -level educational opportunities to current practitioners in the field of public health who may not be able to mak e a long- term commitment to a full MPH program , or already have several master's or doctoral degrees, but want a better understanding of public health. This certificate program has been designed so that students complete the same introductory and core publ ic health courses taken by all first - year e MPH students. The work necessary to earn the certificate is conducted through a combination of on-site courses and partial distance- learning courses over three quarters. The Department of Biostatistics offers a t hree-course distance- learning Applied Biostatistics C ertificate based on its in- residence introductory biostatistics sequence (BIOSTAT 511, 512, and 513). This certificate program can be taken for UW academic credit or for continuing education credits. The Department is currently implementing a second certificate in Advanced Applied Biostatistics . The Department of Global Health and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation offer a not -for- credit Certificate in Global Health Metrics and Evaluation , funded by the Centers for Disease Control and targeted at residents in the Field Epidemiology Training Program and the Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program. The Department of Health Services, with the School of Pharmacy, offers a Certificate in Heal th Economics and Outcomes Research . Students in this program are introduced to the principles of health economics; improve decision- making in a complex health care environment; understand health care markets and systems throughout the world; evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatments, interventions and technologies through outcomes research; identify the value behind health care practices and policies; and gain experience with decision modeling, micro- simulation and assessment of uncertainty, and principles and practices of Health Technology Assessment (HTA). The Department of Health Services offers a post -baccalaureate Certificate in Health Informatics and Health Information Management which confers eligibility to sit for a national certifying exam to become a Registered Health Information Administrator (RHIA). Certificates offered through individual programs The Northwest Center for Public Health Practice, Pacific Northwest OSHA Education Center , and the International Training and Education Center for Health (described below) provide their own certificates for completion of some of their training programs. These certificates do not confer any University of Washington academic credit or credential. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 145 3.3.D. Description of the school's practices, polici es, procedures and evaluation that support continuing education and workforce development strategies. The SPH provides workforce development programs primarily through all of its departments. The largest efforts are in: the Department of Health Services th rough the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice the Department of Environmental Healt h Sciences through several on -going programs the Department of Global Health, primarily through their International Training and Education Center for Health These three programs are described briefly below. Training the public health workforce is one of the core functions of the Northwest Center for Public Health Practice (NWCPHP) funded by CDC and the U.S. Health Research and Services Administration (HRSA). The cen ter develops , in collaboration with partners in the six Pacific Northwest states, a variety of public health practice -oriented training programs each year, including its annual Summer Institute for Public Health Practice. Some of these are conducted locall y, while others are developed for region- wide audiences. NWCPHP is making increased use of the Internet for public health workforce training. The Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences conducts the following workforce development prog rams: The Northwest Center for Occupational Health and Safety Continuing Education program supports professional, employer, and worker education in industrial hygiene and safety, ergonomics, occupat ional medicine, and occupational health nursing. The Pacific Northwest OSHA Education Center offers open enrollment courses, which are tailored to individual employers, and Safety and Health Speciali st Certificate programs, and meeting standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The Northwest Center for Occupational Health and Safety (NWCOHS) offers continuing education courses for workers in safety and health, occupatio nal medicine, and environmental health. It is funded by contracts from NIOSH to DEOHS, and is nationally recognized for the quality and variety of its continuing education programs. Department faculty participate actively in program planning and lecturing, along with speakers from government agencies, other universities, medical facilities, private industry, unions, law firms, and consulting firms. The OSHA Education Center offers high quality, standards- based training for workers, management, and health and safety professionals in the private and public sectors. An experienced team of OSHA -authorized instructors presents information on federal and state safety and health regulations. The International Training and Education Center for Health (I- TECH) is a c enter in the University of Washington's Department of Global Health and has 10 offices and some 600 worldwide staff in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and the United States who work with partner organizations to support the development of health work forces a nd health delivery systems. I-TECH is housed in the UW Department of Global Health, which employs over 300 faculty, fellows, and research scientists in global health research and training and focuses on identification and evaluation of health problems and health inequities in underserved populations, and on the development and implementation of innovative interventions that can dramatically reduce disease burden. I-TECH is a global network that supports the development of a skilled health work force and wel l-organized national health delivery systems, in order to provide effective prevention, care, and treatment of infectious disease in the developing world. In addition, departments and programs in the SPH offer a small number of well -attended continuing and professional education programs throughout the year. For example, Biostatistics and Epidemiology conduct summer institutes. In 2013 there will be three University of Washington School of Public Health Page 146 institutes/conferences in Seattle: Summer Institute in Statistics and Modeling for Infectious Diseases, July 8-24, 2013; the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics, August and the SOG Conference: \"Impact of Large- Genomic Data on Quantitative Genetics November 24- 26, 2013: http://www.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sisg/general/ . Since 2004, the Master of Health Administration (MHA) program has sponsored a best p ractice workshop s eries for health care executives and governing board members. Typicall y, there are four seminars during the academic year . The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) co-sponsors an annual Global H ealth Metrics & Evaluation Conference (GHME), as well as numerous workshops throughout the year. All of the programs l isted above operate with steering committees that include UW faculty and external members of the profession. They produce annual reports for their respective steering committee and funders, which are also reviewed by the chairs of the department in which t hey are housed. Until recently, there has not been a central, school -wide oversight and planning body for these programs. Most operate using different distance learning technology. There has been little synergy among these centers, programs, and activities. Some programs operate independently and some utilize the UW Professional and Continuing Education Office to support their programs. The newly formed Distance Learning and Learning Technology Committee, chaired by the a ssociate dean for Academic Affairs, has been charged with helping these programs work together and share their experiences in order to develop the SPH's distance learning capacity with the best technology and pedagogy . 3.3.E. A list of other educational institutions or public health practic e organizations, if any, with which the school collaborates to offer continuing education. The UW N orthwest Center for Public Health Practice closely collaborates in offering short public health practice institutes with other state universities in the regi on, including the University of Alaska - Anchorage, Portland State University, Montana State University, and the University of Wyoming. Its steering committee includes representatives from the state health departments of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washi ngton, and Wyoming , the Washington State Association of Local Public Health Officials, the Washington Public Health Association , and the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB), which represents all 43 federally recognized tribes in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The Northwest Center for Occupational Health and Safety is one of 18 Education and Research Centers (ERCs) funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The Pacific Northwest OSHA Education Center is the only OSHA -authorized training facility in the Pacific Northwest. DEOHS is also a participant in the five -university Western Regional Universities Consortium, a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) funded effort to provide training f or superfund site workers, emergency response personnel, and hazardous waste transporters and workers. This funding support helps us collaborate with community- based and tribal organizations to provide training for underrepresented minorities. I-TECH partn ers with ministries of health and universities in over 16 low -income countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, as described on its website http://www.go2itech.org/where -we-work . 3.3.F. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH houses workforce development programs that serve the region and the world. The Northwest Cen ter for P ublic Health Practice has a 22 -year history of working with the practice community on workforce training, and service activities such as program evaluation and technical assistance. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 147 The Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences has exte nsive continuing - and worksite -educational programs in the region. The International Training and Education Center for Health is an internationally recognized leader in public health training. SPH offers a large number of certificate programs in a variety of areas of public health. Departments and programs in the SPH conduct regular courses and programs for professional development of researchers and practitioners. The UW and the SPH have a wide range of expertise and technology to assist in enhancing and expanding our distance learning and workforce development programs. Weaknesses/Challenges The SPH recognizes a large need for continuing education, work -force development, and assistance in developing capacity for public health education in low -income countries. The extensive activities in workforce development and distance learning have not been well coordinated or consistently \"branded.\" Plans The Dean has established a Distance Learning and Learning Technology Committee to coordinate, promote, and advanc e the eff ectiveness of these activities. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 148 CRITERION 4.0: FACULTY, STAFF, AND STUDENTS 4.1 FACULTY QUALIFICATIONS The school shall have a clearly defined faculty which, by virtue of its distribution, multidisciplinary nature, educational preparation, practice experience and research and instructional competence, is able to fully support the school's mission, goals and objectives. 4.1.A. A table showing primary faculty who support the degree programs offered by the school. It should pr esent data effective at the beginning of the academic year in which the self -study is submitted to CEPH and should be updated at the beginning of the site visit. This information must be presented in table format, organized by department, specialty area or other organizational unit as appropriate to the school and must include at least the following: a) name, b) title/academic rank, c) FTE or % time, d) tenure status or classification*, g) graduate degrees earned, h) discipline in which degrees were earned, i) institutions from which degrees were earned, j) current instructional areas and k) current research interests. See CEPH Data Template 4.1.1. The SPH has 151 primary faculty who support the teaching, research, and service mission of the school. Ninety percent are full -time or nearly so. Approximately one -third have tenure (which in the SPH is almost always 50 percent) or are tenure- track assistant professors. These faculty come from a wide range of academic backgrounds including biostatistics, epidemiol ogy, health economics, anthropology, medicine, microbiology. A detailed listing ( CEPH Data Template 4.1.1 ) describing these faculty members is found in Appendix 4.1.A .i. Curriculum Vitae for the primary faculty are found in Appendix 4.1.A.ii, organized by home department. 4.1.B. If the school uses other faculty (adjunct, part -time, secondary appointments, etc.), summary data on their qualifications should be provided in table format, organized by department, specialty area or other organizational unit as ap propriate to the school and must include at least the following: a) name, b) title/academic rank, c) title and current employment, d) FTE or % time allocated to the school, e) gender, f) race, g) highest degree earned (optional: schools may also list all g raduate degrees earned to more accurately reflect faculty expertise), h) disciplines in which listed degrees were earned and i) contributions to the school. See CEPH Data Template 4.1.2. In addition to the 151 primary faculty, 105 additional faculty member s participate in teaching, research, and service in the SPH. In addition to collaborating in research, these individuals devote anywhere from 5 to 50 percent of their time to the SPH, often teaching courses, chairing thesis and dissertation committees, advising students, and participating in department serv ice and governance activities. Although all of these faculty have full faculty appointments in the School of Public Health, they are not considered to be primary SPH faculty because 1) they have a j oint a ppointment in the SPH but their primary academic appointment is in another UW department or 2) they receive their salary from of one of our three affiliate institutions (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Veterans Administration Puget Sound Health Car e System , or Seattle Children's Hospital). A detailed listing of these faculty members is found in Appendix 4.1.B . (Note that the chair and vice chair of the Department of Global Health, who have joint appointments \u2014with full voting privileges \u2014in both the S chools of Public Health and Medicine, are not listed in this table because their primary appointment is in the School of Medicine. This anomalous situation arises from the MOU that established the Department of Global Health as a joint venture between the School of Public Health and the School of Medicine [see Appendix 1.4.D ]. This MOU specifies that a faculty member whose primary appointment is in the Department of Global Health can be primarily appointed in either Public Health or Medicine, not both. Beca use CEPH Data Template 4.1.1 is only for faculty with primary appointments in the SPH, faculty members in the Department of Global Health whose appointments are primar ily in the School of Medicine are not listed in Appendix 4.1.B , CEPH Data Template 4.1.2, regardless of their teaching, research, and governance responsibilities. ) University of Washington School of Public Health Page 149 4.1.C. Description of the manner in which the faculty complement integrates perspectives from the field of practice, including information on appointment tracks for practitioners, i f used by the school. Faculty with significant practice experience outside of that which is typically associated with an academic career should also be identified. Many members of the core SPH faculty have worked in public health agencies or practice prior to their appointment in the SPH: Centers of Disease Control: Howard Frumkin, Mark Oberle, Bud Nicola, Jeff Harris, Robert Martin, Ali Mokdad Food and Drug Administration: Larry Kessler State and Local Health Departments: Jack Thompson, Susan Allan, Kar en Hartfield Epidemic Intelligence Service: Fred Connell, Mark Oberle, Jeff Bill Dowling, Andy Stergachis, Mary Alice Hankin, Gretchen Murphy, Kathleen Peterson These individuals are critical members of the faculty; their experiences and expertise inform and enhance the teaching in the school. Recognizing the importance of having faculty members engaged in practice participate in the educational and research activities of the university, the UW prom otes the inclusion of faculty from outside of our school, by the use of three faculty titles for individuals who are employed outside the University. Clinical appointments : A clinical appointment in the appropriate rank or title is usually made to a person who holds a primary appointment with an outside agency in a non- academic unit of the University, or who is in private practice. Clinical faculty make substantial contributions to University programs through their expertise, interest, and motivation to work with the faculty in preparing and assisting with the instruction of students in practicum settings. Affiliate appointments : An affiliate appointment requires qualifications comparable to those required for appointment to the corresponding rank or title . It recognizes the professional contribution of an individual whose principal employment responsibilities lie outside the colleges or schools of the University. \"PDR\" ( paid d irect) appointments : A PDR appointment is similar to an affiliate appointment but is limited to persons a) who are employed by one of three closely affiliated institutions (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Children's Hospital, or Veterans Administration Puget Sound Health Care System ) and b) who were hired based on a joi nt search with a SPH Department. Over 400 faculty members with expertise in public health practice, policy, and science are appointed to the SPH using one of three of these titles , and all SPH departments benefit from the participation of these faculty who contribute to teaching, mentoring, and other activities of the SPH. Table 4.1.C lists some of these practice -based agencies and organizations. Table 4.1.C.

Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strength s, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH has an accomplished, productive, and internationally regarded faculty representing a very wide range of disciplines. The faculty includes more than 400 clinical and affiliate faculty whose skills and expertise in research and practice make them valued colleagues, teachers, advisors, and mentors. Student evaluations of teaching and academic standards are high. Weaknesses/Challenges The large number, geographic dispersion (see Criterion 1. 7), and multidisciplinary character of the faculty make all -school events challenging to plan and orchestrate. This geographic dispersion of faculty hinders student access to off -campus faculty. Plans SPH is actively seeking funding for a Public Health Bu ilding to bring more of the faculty together. Targeted faculty recruitment in areas of emerging public health importance is being undertaken as part of the SPH 2012- 2020 Strategic Plan. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 151 4.2 FACULTY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES The schoo l shall have well- defined policies and procedures to recruit, appoint and promote qualified faculty, to evaluate competence and performance of faculty, and to support the professional development and advancement of faculty. 4.2.A. A faculty handbook or ot her written document that outlines faculty rules and regulations. The rules and regulations governing faculty are documented in the University of Washington Policy Directory , available online at: http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/ . The portions of the Faculty Code from the UW Policy Directory that include specific information on rules and regulations for faculty appointment, promotion, and tenure may be found online at: http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/FCG/FCCH24.html . In addition, the SPH Academic Affairs Handbook provides detailed, school -specific information on appointment, promotion, an d tenure , and is found in Appendix 1.5.B . The Academic Affairs Handbook is the SPH website at: http://sph.washington.edu/gateway/handbook/ . 4.2.B. Description of provisions for f aculty development, including identification of support for faculty categories other than regular full -time appointments. Faculty development is recognized as a vital role of the SPH leadership and senior faculty. Numerous policies and efforts are devoted to enhancing the effectiveness, productivity, and satisfaction of the faculty. Opportunities for faculty development include: SPH faculty orientation : In addition to the orientation advice that the UW o ffers for new faculty, the SPH holds a half -day Facult y Orientation, during which faculty are introduced to the research, instructional, library, and computer resources of the SPH and University. In addition, the a ssociate d ean for Research and Programs, the a ssociate dean for Academic Affairs, and the chair of the Faculty Council address the new faculty on the \"faculty life cycle,\" covering issues including research, service, teaching expectations, promotion and tenure procedures and policies, and other concerns, such as the grant development process, human s ubjects procedures, and academic and student ethics. Annual reviews: All departments hold formal an nual reviews of junior faculty , during which senior faculty collectively review the record of each a ssistant or associate professor and lecturers. These deliberations, which in some departments extend over two days, provide a forum for thoughtful and constructive evaluation of the teaching, research, and service records of each faculty member. The outcomes of these reviews provide specific suggestions for imp rovement and/or additional opportunities for the individual faculty member; they are also likely to include recommendations to other faculty who could assist the individual through collaboration or additional mentoring. Based on these reviews, the chair of each department meets individually with each faculty member to review past performance and future plans. A formal letter from the chair to the faculty member is written after each of these meetings summarizing the discussion. Mentoring : Departments assig n senior faculty members to advise and guide junior faculty members. In some departments, the chair assumes this role. In addition to direct mentoring, the chair formally meets with junior faculty following the annual reviews to convey recommendations on i mproving, prioritizing, or redirecting their research, teaching, and service activities. The Department of Health Services has created a Professional Development Group to provide mentorship and encouragement on a group level for assistant professors. The UW Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) (http://www.washington.edu/teaching/ ) This is a university -wide instructional resource for faculty and teaching assistants, and it promotes excellence in teaching and learning at the University of Washington through its work with individual faculty and TAs, University of Washington School of Public Health Page 152 departments, campus -wide initiatives, and University leaders. CTL staff collaborate on the design, implementation, and assessment of ways to advance learning fo r all students in the diverse UW community. The Center for Curriculum Transformation (http://depts.washington.edu/ctcente r) promotes and supports curriculum development aimed at teaching and learning to critically think about cultural diversity. The Faculty Fellows Program is offered annually by the University's administration to work with new faculty on topics such as: Techniques for engaging students in lectures Using technology in the classroom Teach ing evaluation and assessment Finding a balance between teaching and research. The UW Health Sciences Research Funding Service and the UW Grants and Funding Information Service provide extensive web- based and consultative resources to SPH faculty. Paid pro fessional leave (sabbatical) : This may be granted to tenured faculty after seven years of service to increase their scholarship and professional development. Sabbatical leave may be granted for one, two, three , or four quarters . Other faculty resources: Departments may use their resources to fund faculty to attend conferences and professional meetings. A tuition exemption policy allows faculty to register for up to six credits per quarter for a minimal charge. 4.2.C. Description of formal procedures for ev aluating faculty competence and performance. In addition to student evaluation of classroom teaching, described in Criterion 4.2.D below, a ll faculty undergo periodic peer review of their teaching. The departments have varying procedures for peer review, but it generally involves review of the syllabus and instructional materials, observation in the classroom, and preparation of a written instructor evaluation. For lectures and assistant professors, approximately one course each year must be reviewed by their peers. These evaluations are reviewed by each department's curriculum committee and by senior faculty at the time of faculty reviews. They are a mandatory component of promotion and tenure packets. Recommendations based on these reviews are transmitted to the faculty member to assist in improving teaching effectiveness. The SPH Curriculum and Education Policy Committee is currently reviewing departmental peer review practices, with the aim of improving the efficiency, quality, and usefulness of these rev iews. Faculty performance is evaluated annually (except for professors who are evaluated every three year s), as described above. In addition, when the Washington Legislature allocates funding for faculty salary merit increases, another review of faculty pe rformance may be required, usually during spring quarter, to allocate merit raises. In most departments, faculty use both narrative comments and a numeric rating scale to assess performance. Student and peer evaluations of teaching, research, academic publ ic health practice productivity, and service are all considered in the annual evaluations. In compliance with University regulations, department chairs hold annual conferences with assistant professors to discuss results of the annual reviews. In the SPH, chairs are encouraged to hold these conferences with all faculty. The chair discusses strengths and weaknesses of the faculty member's record as it relates to advancement, explains the department's emphases on teaching, research or academic public health practice and service, discusses the \"goodness of fit\" of the faculty member's work and the direction University of Washington School of Public Health Page 153 and needs of the department, and makes suggestions to improve the faculty member's record. The chair then provides the faculty member with a written summar y of the conference, and a copy of this summary is given to the dean's office. It is the chair's responsibility to determine, together with the faculty member's mentor and others as appropriate, a plan to assist faculty members who are having difficulty, either in teaching or research. All promotion and tenure decisions require letters from at least four outside referees which are inherently evaluative; outside referees are asked to review/evaluate the candidate's CV, a sample of articles, and the candidat e's summary of his/her accomplishments. 4.2.D. Description of the processes used for student course evaluation and evaluation of instructional effectiveness. All SPH courses are evaluated by students each time they are taught. Most faculty use standard UW evaluation forms provided by the Office of Educational Assessment , which include both quantitative scales and anonymous narrative sections. These evaluations are reviewed by th e chairs and are included in the annual review materials for each faculty member . Aggregated statistics from these evaluations are used by the departments and the SPH to evaluate its teaching effectiveness. Additionally, all departments have developed formal processes of faculty (peer) review for teaching effectiveness. These processes include a review of syllabi and other written course materials, as well as in-class peer observation ; review of student evaluations, tests, assignments and grade distribution ; and evaluation s of teaching assistants. These assessments are shared with the instructor soon after they are conducted to support continual quality improvement of their teaching efforts. This material is included in the review packets for annual faculty reviews and promotions. The SPH rewards excellence in teaching. Each year, stu dents and faculty are invited to nominate faculty who are outstanding teachers. The Student Public Health Association reviews the nominations and selects a recipient for the SPH's Outstanding Teaching Award. A plaque and award check are presented annually at the SPH's graduation c eremony. 4.2.E. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the SPH's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The SPH has well -documented polices to recruit, appoint, and promote qualified faculty. The SPH evaluates faculty effectiveness continually through reviews by peers and students. The SPH and University provide substantial resources for faculty development. The SPH confers an Outstanding Teaching Award to one fac ulty member and an Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award each year to emphasize the importance of excellence in teaching. Weaknesses/Challenges Recruitment, retention, and growth of faculty may be limited by the uncertainty surrounding the future of tenure funds. The faculty of the SPH is largely supported by grants and contracts, and the majority of regular senior faculty do not have tenure. Furthermore, even when tenure is conferred, it has become the practice in the SPH to provide tenure at only 50 perc ent FTE. The aging of the current SPH leadership will lead to a large number of retirements and vacancies over the next 5 to 10 years. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 154 Plans The SPH will continue to identify/develop better opportunities for leadership training and development for its junior and mid -level faculty. Departments are developing succession plans and have successfully recruited a number of outstanding junior faculty in recent years. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 155 4.3 STUDENT RECRUITMENT AND ADMISSIONS The school shall have student recr uitment and admissions policies and procedures designed to locate and select qualified individuals capable of taking advantage of the school's various learning activities, which will enable each of them to develop competence for a career in public health. 4.3.A. Description of the school's recruitment policies and procedures. If these differ by degree (e.g., bachelors vs. graduate degrees), a description should be provided for each. The SPH seeks students who are strong academically, highly motivated, and c ommitted to public health. Students are recruited via informational tabling at local, regional, and national fairs; meetings and conferences ; presentations to high school, community college, and current University of Washington students; presentations at n ational, state, and local public health meetings; departmental web pages ; advertising in relevant publications , on various websites, and through social media outlets; electronic recruitment mailings ; direct contact with prospective students; and recommendations from alumni and college advisors. ( Appendix 4.3.A contains examples of informational/recruitments materials. ) International students are recruited through collaborative activities with institutions worldwide. The SPH also recruits students at the ann ual American Public Health Association and the Washington State Public Health Association meetings and participates in Association of Schools of Public Health out- reach and recruitment efforts. The SPH is also present at Health Sciences graduate school fairs and Idealist graduate school fairs in our region. Additionally, the SPH is committed to recruiting a diverse student population, and therefore works with on- campus resources and attends conferences such as SACNAS (devoted to advancing Hispanics, Chicano s, and Native Americans in Science) and ABRCMS (Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students). Additionally, departments hold regular information sessions and , once accepted, the SPH holds an admitted student visiting day, where prospective students can meet with current students, faculty , and staff. Recently, the Office of Student Affairs has begun to centralize recruitment efforts and outreach, while individual programs and departments continue to conduct more targeted recruitment activiti es. The SPH Office of Student Affairs recently hired a 50 percent FTE to focus specifically on recruitment and prospective student outreach, with an emphasis on diversity. This position, in partnership with staff and faculty within the SPH, as well as offi ces across campus, is in the process of developing a comprehensive plan to recruit and retain a diverse student population. Current efforts focus on the following: Assessing recruitment efforts that are currently underway within the school Networking with established University of Washington offices to include the SPH in diversity - related recruitment efforts locally, regionally, and nationally Developing a school-specific outreach plan, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities Updating existing and c reating new marketing materials Establishing pipelines with community colleges and high schools in the area 4.3.B. Statement of admissions policies and procedures. If these differ by degree (eg, bachelors vs. graduate degrees), a description should be prov ided for each. Prospective students who are undecided as to which of the SPH's programs best fits their education al and career goals are encouraged to contact the SPH Office of Student Affairs (OSA) for guidance. Whenever possible, the student will have an in -person meeting with an adviso r. Once the prospective student has selected a program, student services staff in the departments and programs coordinate their own admissions procedures to ensure that advising and other important student relationships are established and maintained. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 156 Applicants to the undergraduate Public Health major ( Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science ) must complete the following by the application deadline to be considered for admission: Minimum of 45 credits Minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 A minimum grade of 2.0 in one of the following: ENV H 111, HSERV 100, G H 101, or one 5- credit course from: Anthropology (ANTH only), Political Science, Psychology, or Sociology (200- level recommended) Minimum grade of 2.0 in one introductory science from the following list: BIOL 118, BIOL 180, C HEM 120, CHEM 142, CHEM 145, or PHYS 114 with lab (PHYS 117) The following factors determine the competitiveness of an applicant beyond the minimum requirements and are the criteria used when determining admission to the major: Overall academic record Grades in coursework relevant to the major The personal statement including writing ability and individual perspectives that would contribute to the program and field of public health Ability to make satisfactory progress towards the degree Application Requirements: 1.

The Environmental Health undergraduate major offers both a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences as well as the specific professional skills needed to thrive in the environmental health field. Most full-time students who want to complete the program within four years will need to begin chemistry courses in their freshman year and make significant progress on the upper division admission prerequisites by the end of their sophomore year. For early admission: Minimum grade of 2.0 in each course, minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0, and at least 30 college credits, including: Chemistry Series (CHEM 142, 152, 162, or equivalents), Calculus (MATH 124 or equivalent), English Composition (ENGL 131 or equivalent) For upper division admission: Minimum grade of 2.0 in each course, minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5, including: Chemistry Series, Organic Chemistry Series (CHEM 237, 238, 239, or CHEM 223, 224, or equivalents), Biology Series (BIOL 180, 200, 220, or equivalents ), Calculus, English Composition The application process for graduate students involves completion of both the University of Washington Graduate School application and the departmental program application. The University currently charges an application fee of $75 that may be waived based on financial need for qualifying U.S. citizens and permanent residents. All applicants for graduate programs are scr eened by the UW Graduate School to ensure that the University's minimum requirements are met. Graduate programs in the SPH require: A program application A minimum 3.0 GPA as an undergraduate College transcripts Narrative statement of professional goals an d objectives Three personal recommendations Specific prerequisite coursework for some departments University of Washington School of Public Health Page 157 GRE scores that are typically above the 50th percentile. Exemption from the GRE is provided for: oeMPH students may substitute the GMAT, LSAT , or MCAT oMPH and MHA applicants who possess a doctorate or medical degree from an accredited university in the United States oMHA applicants, who may substitute the GMAT for the GRE TOEFLscores for international applicants Each department supports an admissions committee that reviews applications. Applicants are not evaluated on a single criterion but on the basis of the entire application. All programs seek strong students who are highly motivated. Relevant work and/or research experience is weighted heavily by most progra ms. 4.3.C. Examples of recruitment materials and other publications and advertising that describe, at a minimum, academic calendars, grading and the academic offerings of the school. If a school does not have a printed bulletin/catalog, it must provide a printed web page that indicates the degree requirements as the official representation of the school. In addition, references to website addresses may be included.

University of Washington School of Public Health Page 158 4.3.D. Quantitative information on the number of applicants, acceptances and enrollment, by concentration, for each degree, for each of the last three years. Data must be presented in table format. See CEPH Data Template 4.3.1. The number of applicants to all degree programs has risen in the past two years. Generally, approximately 55 to 60 percent of applicants to the undergraduate programs are accepted; o f those accepted, about 50 percent of undergraduates choose to enroll. Approximately 50 to 65 percent of applicants to MHA programs are offered admission, compared to about 35 percent for the MPH and MS programs, and 25 percent for the PhD degrees. For graduate programs the matriculation rate is between 50 and 70 percent . In general, there has been an increase in applications; however the acceptance rates have remained consistent. There appears to be a declining trend in matriculation rates for our MHA, MS, and PhD programs. These data broken down by concentration can be found in Appendix 4.3.D. Table 4.3.D.

Quantitative information on the number of students enrol led in each specialty area identified in the instructional matrix, including headcounts of full- and part -time students and a full- time-equivalent conversion, by concentration, for each degree, for each of the last three years. Non -degree students, such as those enrolled in continuing education or certificate programs, should not be included. Explain any important trends or patterns, including a persistent absence of students in any degree or specialization. Data must be presented in table format. See CEPH Data Template 4.3.2. Table 4.3.E tabulates the numbers of students and FTEs in each of the SPH degree programs for the past three years. In general the numbers have been fairly consistent, with the following exceptions. The BA/BS in Public Health is a new program in the SPH (formerly it was in the College of Arts and Sciences). The PhD program in Global Health was started in 2012. Several MPH tracks in the Department of Health Services were discontinued/consolidated during this time period. Comparison of he ad-counts with FTEs suggests that most students are full -time.

Our graduate programs continue to be selective, and quality of newly enrolled students, as measured by GRE scores, has generally remained high for all degrees with no clear trend . Underrepresented applicants are as likely to choose SPH as other students, with the exception of applicants to PhD programs. This may be a function of our ability to guarantee financial aid to all students. 4.3.G. Assessment o f the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths The coordination and centraliz ation of recruitment activities through the Office of Student Affairs is produci ng a more comprehensive /consistent school -wide effort to recruit and admit students. The departments have a well -defined admissions process in addition to criteria that serve to admit a qualified and diverse student population. We continue to attract hig hly qualified students. Weaknesses/Challenges The indicators related to volume of applications, admission selectivity, and matriculation of accepted students have declined in recent years. While increased effort to coordinate is underway, it will take ti me to assess needs and develop a comprehensive recruitment plan. The wide variety of d epartment -specific admissions criteria pose a challenge when advising prospective students centrally . The need for funding specifically designated for underrepresented st udents poses an overall recruitment challenge. Plans Conduct a thorough outreach and recruitment needs assessment across the SPH . Network and collaborat e with established University of Washington entities to provide an opportunity to reach more diverse st udents . Create new, targeted , school -wide recruitment and marketing materials. Establish concrete metrics for evaluating the impact of specific recruitment efforts . Increase knowledge of d epartmental admissions criteria, centrally and on the SPH website, to provide comprehensive advising to prospective students . This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 162 4.4 ADVISING AND CAREER COUNSELING There shall be available a clearly explained and accessible academic advising system for students, as well as readily available career and placement advice. 4.4.A. Description of the school's advising services for students in all degree programs, including sample materials such as student handbooks. Include an explanation of how faculty are selected for and oriented to their advising res ponsibilities. Throughout the school, g raduate students are assigned faculty academic advisors when they enroll. Each advis or works with the student to design a course of study based on degree requirements and the student's experience and area of concentration. Typically , during the admissions process, students are matched with faculty with whom they would like to work or whose interests are most compatible with those of the student . When a student begins a thesis or dissertation, the faculty member with wh om he or she is doing research usually becomes the adviso r and chair of the supervisory committee. A thesis chair advises and assists students in defining the scope of a project as well as identifying an appropriate second faculty member for the thesis com mittee, if assistance is necessary. Advising also is provided by graduate program coordinators (faculty) and g raduate p rogram a dvisors (staff) who are knowledgeable about the rules and infrastructure of the University, SPH, and individual departments. Doct oral students work extremely closely with the chair of their committee but rely on other members frequently for substantive, methodological, or general academic advice. For the past three years, graduating doctoral students rate their satisfaction with supervision/guidance at 4.3 on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest. Faculty advisors are oriented to their role in many different ways. Individual departments have web resources addressing frequently asked questions specific to advising in addition to ref erring faculty to the University of Washington Graduate School's resources, such as the Mentor Memos series (http://www.grad.washington.edu/mentoring/memos/ ). Mentorship is a key element to student success in our programs. Faculty members in the SPH are committed to developing strong mentoring relationships with all students for the purpose of enhancing educational experiences and supporting student retention. Each student is assigned to an ad visor from the time of acceptance into the SPH , and faculty serve in mentorship roles through membership on dissertation committees. Many departments offer structured mentoring opportunities through workshops and intentional relationship building between incoming and current students, in addition to website resources. For undergraduate students, the SPH uses a \"team\" advising approach. Professional staff in the undergraduate programs serve as advisors, helping students navigate course planning and progress towards degree. Faculty serve in a mentorship role, providing guidance regarding career paths, professionalism, and access to professional networks. 4.4.B. Description of the school's career counseling services for students in all degree programs. Includ e an explanation of efforts to tailor services to specific needs in the school's student population. The SPH has created a career development website ( http://sph.washington.edu/careers/ ) for students. This website contains links to guidance for developing resumes, job searching, and job interviewing. It has an up- to-date job listing on which employers can easily post job opportunities (http://sph.washington.edu/careers/jobs.asp ) as well as a listing of local and national job sites (http://sph.washington.edu/careers/links.asp ). The MHA program employees a full -time career advisor, who connec ts students with opportunities, networks with employers, and organizes workshops for the MHA students. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 163 Professional development for graduate students is supported in numerous other ways across the school. The SPH Office of Student Affairs sends out regular job postings via e -mail and maintains the job postings web page and updates resources on the website about resume and cover letter writing and general job search skills. The Office of Student Affairs also implemented a public health specific career develo pment workshop focusing on various aspects of the career search process. Additionally, the director and a ssistant d irector of Student Affairs will meet with students one -on-one to review materials and offer individualized feedback. The MHA program also employs a full -time career services specialist. Departments refer students to University -wide resources and also offer their own discipline -specific workshops, events , and seminars focused on job search skills and staff members skilled in career advising. For example, both the Institute for Public Health Genetics, Public Health Nutrition and the Community- Oriented Public Health Practice Program hold career panels once a year as part of required coursework, and invite alumni to present stories and career paths and share advice. Additionally, the Global Health Resource Center organizes an annual Global Health week that is open to all Public Health students as well as the University community. Events include resume workshops, a career fair, information on global health certificate options, a career pathways workshop, lectures, film screenings, interview strategies, and networking tips. The MHA program in the Department of Health Services has a well -established (and well -subscribed) program that matches students one -on-one with health care professionals throughout the community. These leaders volunteer their time and offer students the opportunity not only to expand their thinking about applying their skills in the \"real world,\" but to ask questions and seek guidance in a more relaxed context outside of classroom demands. It also extends the reach of the program into the professional community by reminding mentors of the program's value in shaping future leaders. The SPH new student orientation also includes a popul ar alumni panel. This panel provides an opportunity for students to engage with alumni from across disciplines and explore the many career paths of our SPH graduates. With the panel as a vehicle, students are encouraged to seek out internships and practicu m opportunities that lend themselves to potential careers and to network with community members and alumni throughout their tenure at the SPH. 4.4.C. Information about student satisfaction with advising and career counseling services. Each year, the UW G raduate School conducts an E xit Survey of graduating students, in which they ask about the satisfaction with career mentoring. Data for the past three years are summarized below. Table 4.4.C. Satisfaction with career mentoring (scale of 1 to 5, 5 being high est) Satisfaction with career mentoring Target 2009 -10 2010 -11 2011 -12 Master's students 4.0 3.6 3.5 3.3 PhD students 4.0 3.9 4.0 3.9 It is recognized that, while generally acceptable and comparable to other schools/colleges at the University for PhD st udents, satisfaction among our master's students is not adequate and is, in fact declining (see Table 4.4.C , above). This was identified as an important issue for our SPH and, to address this, the new school -wide position of director of Student Affairs was created. One of the mandates for this position is to improve the quantity, quality, and professionalism in the SPH's approach to career counseling, and we have already seen improvements in the last year. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 164 4.4.D. Description of the procedures by which students may communicate their concerns to school officials, including information about how these procedures are publicized and about the aggregate number of complaints and/or student grievances submitted for each of the last three years. Student concerns may be voiced through multiple avenues including: departmental staff and faculty, including g raduate p rogram directors and/or the graduate p rogram a dvisor, s tudent a dvisors (academic advis or or thesis/dissertation advisor), and o ffice of the dean staff. Addit ionally, each department has an appointed student representative that serves as a G raduate and Professional S tudent S enator to whom they can communicate concerns. The Student Public Health Association (SPHA), with an executive board comprised of students f rom across the school, is advised by the director of Student Affairs and is also available and serves as the \"voice\" of the students. A representative from the SPHA is a member of the SPH Executive Council as well , and meets with the dean regularly . Also, the dean, in partnership with the SPHA, hosts monthly events attended by large numbers of students, in which students are able to submit anonymous questions; the events are geared towards SPH leadership hearing and responding to student feedback and concer ns. Departments communicate the mechanisms for g rievances to their students via new student orientation, e - mail, and internal portals. In general, when a student in dissatisfied with the conditions of his RA or TA appointment or is frustrated or unhappy i n general with their student experience, he/she is encouraged to speak to their preceptor or supervisory committee members. If this discussion is not fruitful or if the student feels uncomfortable doing so, they should approach their program director, the g raduate program coordinator, g raduate p rogram s taff, or the chair. If the situation cannot be addressed satisfactorily at the department level , the problem is referred to the a ssociate d ean for Academic Affairs. The ultimate arbitrator of student complain ts is the g raduate s chool. See Graduate School Memorandum 33 (http://www.grad.washington.edu/polici es/memoranda/memo33.shtml ) for grievance procedures (Appendix 4.4.D .i). Most grievances are minor and are handled satisfactorily at the departmental level without documentation. An informal survey of the graduate program staff in the departments suggests that these occur zero to twice a year in each department. The associate dean for Academic Affairs is asked to step in when a departmental solution cannot be reached. In the past three years, four situations have come to the associate dean for resolution: t wo involved disputes over the fairness of grades (one undergraduate and one graduate student); one doctoral student appealed her termination from her PhD program after failing the qualifying exam twice; and one graduate student appealed her termination fro m her PhD program because she did not complete the requirements communicated to her by her committee on numerous occasions. The University, with input from the SPH, has recently re -written the grievance procedures for post - doctoral fellows. This procedure is found in Appendix 4.4.D.ii . 4.4.E. Assessment of the extent to which this criterion is met and an analysis of the school's strengths, weaknesses and plans relating to this criterion. Strengths There is a strong system of student advising and counseling at the school, department, and program levels. Thesis, dissertation, and project advising involve close supervision and mentoring by faculty. The SPH has developed a comprehensive career services website to assist students and alumni in finding jobs in their chosen fields. The new d irector of Student Affairs considers developing stronger career services to be a priority . Challenges Some master's students, especially MPH students, need more career services. There is a need to develop a school -wide system fo r disseminating career development and job University of Washington School of Public Health Page 165 posting information for students. Some of the faculty are less skilled at or dedicated to student mentoring. Plans Building on the student mentoring resources recently developed by the Graduate School, new mentori ng workshops are being developed. New f aculty orientation and annual reviews will place greater emphasis on faculty mentoring skills and performance. The SPH has dedicated funds to provide training for the student services staff in career counseling . The director of Student Affairs is 1) improving our online resources for career development and job hunting 2) developing programs to provide hands -on career counseling throughout the SPH , and 3) meeting with students one -on-one to assist with career search needs. This criterion is met. University of Washington School of Public Health Page 166 "}
