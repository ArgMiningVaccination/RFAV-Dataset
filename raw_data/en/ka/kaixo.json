Duke's employees' health and safety are important to us. This health review process helps to ensure your ability to safely perform the essential job functions. Additionally we ensure that all incoming employees are compliant with Duke, state, and federal requirements, guidelines, and policies. Who has Access to my Personal Health Information? Your privacy is our utmost concern. All health information is maintained confidentially by EOHW and not shared with management or your department. EOHW only shares whether you are or are not safe for work with or without limitations. Where Can I Find my Vaccination Records? If you need official copies of vaccination records, or if you need to update your personal records, there are several places you can locate records: - If you are or have been employed in the healthcare field, a place to start is with your organization's Employee Health They likely will have similar requirements as Duke. Since their database is confidential, vaccinations or blood tests may not appear in other vaccination records. - Check with your doctor or public health Keep in mind that vaccination records are maintained at doctor's office for a limited number of years. School data may include vaccination records. - Check with previous employers (including the military) that may have required - Ask parents or other caregivers if they have records of your childhood - Visit [your closest health department](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/international/relres.html)and request your vaccine registry What is Required to Show Proof of Vaccination? Candidates must provide proof of vaccination or immunity which includes one of the following: - A form showing the signature or stamp of a physician or his/her designee, or public health personnel that shows the month, day, and year the vaccination dose or booster was administered. - An official immunization record generated from a state or local health authority or school that shows the month, day, and year the vaccination or booster dose was administered. - A document which provides titer test - Your identifying information (name, date of birth, etc) must be visible on the document. Please note, screenshots from patient portals, such as MyChart are often missing identifying information, and thus cannot be accepted. What If You Can't Find Your Records? If you can't find your personal records or records from the doctor, you may need to get vaccinated again. While this is not ideal, it is safe to repeat vaccines. Another option is to have blood drawn to check for immunity. These blood tests are called \"immunity titers\" and can be drawn for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (Chickenpox). These can be performed free of charge at your in person appointment with EOHW. What if my Urine Drug Screen is Positive? Some prescription medications can cause you to have a positive urine drug screening result. We require that you produce a copy of your CURRENT prescription for the medication the test detected. This result will be reviewed by a Medical Review Officer to determine if your prescription medication was the reason for the positive test result, in which case your drug screen result will be negative. Please note, the drug screen will test for marijuana, which is not a legal substance in the state of North Carolina. "}
