During detox, patients release their bodies from the physical and chemical controls of drugs and alcohol. Detoxing from drugs and even alcohol is not just a mental process but also a biological challenge. This process can be emotionally and physically exhausting...or even dangerous, which is why it is important to pursue a medically supervised detox with the help of clinical professionals. Safe, Comfortable, Medically Monitored Detox At many of our [Banyan treatment center locations](https://www.banyantreatmentcenter.com/facilities/), we provide medically monitored detox for a variety of substances. With a medical detox program, patients are given round-the-clock care throughout their stay, ensuring that dangerous withdrawals are properly treated for utmost patient safety. If you are seeking comfortable and safe detoxification options, medically supervised detox should be your first choice.

Some substances can take longer and be more dangerous than others during the detox process. For some substances, detoxing at one of our [addiction facilities](https://www.banyantreatmentcenter.com/addictions-treated/) is imperative. Alcohol, for example, can produce withdrawal symptoms that are incredibly uncomfortable and even [life-threatening](https://www.banyantreatmentcenter.com/2022/07/26/dangers-of-at-home-detox-delaware/). Without the right support and monitoring during detox, withdrawals can become deadly.

How Long Does Detox Take? The detox process varies from person to person. There are a variety of factors that can influence the duration of the detox and the symptoms experienced. Patient age, health, and the number of substances used can influence the severity of detox. Additional factors, such as whether a patient has detoxed before, are also influential in the detox process. Symptoms may include: - Digestive issues - Anxiety - Rapid heart rate - Excessive sweating - Depression - Tremors - Confusion - Stroke Withdrawals can vary from one person to the next. However, with medically monitored detox, patients can rest assured that they are receiving the necessary support for their safety, health, and sobriety. Typically, withdrawal symptoms start gradually. For some substances, such as heroin, withdrawals can develop within a few hours since the last use. Other substances may take longer in terms of withdrawals. With most substances, withdrawals peak a few days after the last use and then subside. For most patients, the detox process only lasts a few days. What Happens After Detox? Detox addresses the physical and chemical controls of drugs and alcohol, but it is not the only step in finding sobriety. The behavioral patterns, choices, and any situations that fed into one's addiction must also be addressed.
