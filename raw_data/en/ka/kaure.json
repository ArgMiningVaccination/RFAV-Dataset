While we totally concur with therecommendations from European experts, we feel that additional priorities in bronchiectasis should behighlighted for future research in China. 1) Regional distribution of bronchiectasis aetiology throughout China. The aetiological investigations published to date were mainly based in major cities such as Shanghai [2], Guangzhou [3], and Jinan [4]. Theprevalence of pulmonary infections ( e.g.tuberculosis, measles and pertussis) are expected to be significantly higher in rural areas because of the limited medical resources. Our understanding has been hampered by thelack of official documentation regarding regional distributions of bronchiectasis aetiologies in China. Futureinvestigations are warranted to prioritise our national healthcare plan for disease control. 2) The role of traditional Chinese medicine in bronchiectasis patients. The long Chinese history has nurtured the development of traditional Chinese medicine, a delicate medical system which is still regardedas a tremendous treasure trove that is complementary to western medicine. In fact, a considerable numberof bronchiectasis patients report that they have actively sought consultation from experts in traditionalChinese medicine. Patients had greater willingness to receive therapy with Chinese herbal compounds(typically for decoction) to minimise the potential adverse effects of western medicine (W.J. Guan andco-workers; unpublished data). To our knowledge, the efficacy of Chinese herbs for improving asthmacontrol has been documented [5]. We strongly feel that Chinese herbs may have a role in futuremanagement of bronchiectasis, for instance, by reducing the frequency of bronchiectasis exacerbations.However, in light of the lack of evidence-based reports, well-designed randomised, double-blind clinicaltrials are needed to thoroughly validate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbs for bronchiectasis. 3) The role of clinical phenotyping in improving management of bronchiectasis. The significant heterogeneity of clinical manifestations of bronchiectasis has been increasingly recognised. Clinicalphenotyping using unsupervised learning techniques [6, 7] has provided researchers with an invaluableopportunity to personalise therapy. Despite the absence of \"gold standard criteria \"for classification of clusters, clinical phenotyping is complementary to disease severity assessment because it takes into accountboth the homogeneity and heterogeneity of bronchiectasis. To justify bronchiectasis phenotyping, it wouldbe useful to investigate its added value to improve therapeutic outcomes and long-term prognosis. 4) The impact of bronchiectasis on fertility. Compared with Caucasians [6, 8, 9], Chinese bronchiectasis patients are significantly younger at enrolment [2 -4, 7]. The mean age of our cohort was 44.5 years [6], and62% of females were still of child-bearing age. Currently, no report documenting whether bronchiectasis decreased fertility has been published. Nonetheless, clinicians have been frequentlyconfronted with fertility counselling for bronchiectasis patients. It has become increasingly urgent to solvethis issue after the implementation of the two-child policy in China [10]. In our pilot study (W.J. Guanand co-workers; unpublished data), most female patients demonstrated varying magnitudes of concernabout infertility associated with bronchiectasis, despite the fact that most females successfully gave birth tohealthy infants. Concerns about infertility have cast a considerable shadow over patient 's daily life, leading to the development of anxiety and/or depression.

Additional important research priorities for bronchiectasis in China. Eur Respir advance future healthcare in terms of adding further evidence to genetic counselling and mitigating patient 's anxiety or depression. 5) Pathophysiological pathways leading to bronchiectasis -chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis -asthma overlap syndrome. There are various aetiologies underlying the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. In the British Thoracic Society guidelines [11], COPD or asthma should be considered as theunderlying aetiology of bronchiectasis. It should also be recognised that the determination of aetiology ischallenging in most patients, but the overlap of bronchiectasis with asthma or COPD can be assessed usingsimple tools such as lung function tests. Current knowledge indicates that bronchiectasis may have commonpathways with asthma macrophagic inflammation). Bronchiectasis can be readily identified in a considerable number of COPD and asthmatic patients using high-resolution chest computed tomography, particularly in those with a prolonged course of disease. How primary or secondary aetiologies stimulate exaggerated neutrophilic responses leadingto relentless degradation of the matrices of bronchial mucosa remains an area of profound interest. Unravellingthe most useful biomarkers ( e.g.periostin or fractional exhaled nitric oxide) to classify the clinical clusters and predict prognosis would provide clinicians with practical tools for disease intervention and management. These additional research priorities in China may have c omplementary significance to the statement from the EMBARC Clinical Research Collaboration [1].

The European Multicentre Bronchiectasis Audit and Research Collaboration(EMBARC) research priorities \"roadmap \"published in the European Respiratory Journal was specifically developed to address the issue of research priorities from the point of view of European experts, and withthis in mind, it is important to consider how these priorities may be different across different healthcaresystems in differing areas of the world [1]. Bronchiectasis appears to be heterogeneous across the world. In addition to the different characteristics observed in China compared to Europe, the emerging Indian Bronchiectasis Registry, as part of theEMBARC network, has reported a high rate of post-tuberculosis bronchiectasis and bronchiectasis relatedto chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [2, 3]. A further research priority is therefore to understand theprevalence, impact and outcomes of bronchiectasis following tuberculosis infection. In the US Bronchiectasis Research Registry, 63.4% of patients had a history of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) being present, an association, aetiology or complication seen much less frequently inEurope [4]. We may therefore add from a North American perspective, a key priority to identify theoptimal treatment for NTM infections as well as understanding the susceptibility factors and diseasecharacteristics associated with NTM infection with or without bronchiectasis [5]. While many of theresearch priorities for colleagues in Australasia would be similar to those of Europe, we might addpriorities to understanding the burden of disease and aetiology in indigenous populations [6]. Therefore, it is clear that across the world, patient populations and therefore research priorities may be different yet complementary, representing a tremendous opportunity to further inform the scientificcommunity and advance the science of bronchiectasis. Nevertheless, the desire and well overdue need toimprove patient outcomes and to find evidence for new treatments remains the same [7]. It is in this spirit that the international collaborative framework for the investigation bronchiectasis is now well established. The EMBARC network (www.bronchiectasis.eu) is closely aligned with research efforts inmany individual European countries, but most importantly is collaborating closely with internationalbronchiectasis networks [8]. The US Bronchiectasis Research Registry began data collection in 2008 across13 centres and incorporates data collection for bronchiectasis as well as NTM. The AustralianBronchiectasis Registry, under the auspices of the Australian Lung Foundation, has recently begunrecruitment and has the unique feature of collecting data on children. EMBARC India, the Indianbronchiectasis registry, is far advanced with >500 patients enrolled at the time of writing from >33 centres. Emerging bronchiectasis research programmes are in development in other countries, including in Latin America, Sri Lanka and South Africa. An important symbol of this new international consortium of bronchiectasis researchers was the first World Bronchiectasis Conference (WBC) in Hannover, Germany, in July 2016 (http://world-bronchiectasis-conference.com). This event saw the participation of >300 delegates from around the world who met todiscuss clinical and translational aspects of bronchiectasis under the auspices of the European RespiratorySociety, EMBARC and PROGNOSIS, and in collaboration with the US Bronchiectasis Research Registryand Australian Bronchiectasis Registry. In the wake of this major success, the second WBC has beenorganised to take place in Milan, Italy, in July 2017, with a special focus of bronchiectasis clinical trials andpulmonary NTM. We invite all those with an interest in bronchiectasis to participate in these international collaborative efforts. Specific objectives of our collaborations are: 1) to merge different bronchiectasis registries on acommon platform with shared definitions to allow comparative global studies and generalisable and wellas unique research findings; 2) to identify, integrate and compare research needs in the field; 3) to shareinfrastructures and competencies in order to design and conduct high-quality clinical intervention trialsaccording to a shared roadmap; 4) to plan educational policies to increase disease awareness, and expandthe clinical and scientific communities interested in bronchiectasis [9]; and 5) to facilitate the interactionbetween international patients with bronchiectasis.
