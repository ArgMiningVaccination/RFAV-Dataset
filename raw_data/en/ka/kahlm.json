Traditional Chinese Medicine combines herbs and acupuncture to treat excesses or deficiencies that are diagnosed using ancient techniques for assessing yin and yang energy along the meridians of the body. Herbal remedies are created specifically for your pet after an intensive assessment of his or her symptoms and their underlying causes. These remedies help rectify core imbalances - treating the whole animal. Acupuncture can alleviate pain, cure chronic health conditions, or simply support your pet's immune system. One of the safest and least invasive therapies available, acupuncture uses tiny needles, inserted into specific points along the body, to promote the healing process. Acupuncture can make an enormous difference in your pet's health, and it works quite quickly. You should notice a positive response in 2 to 6 treatments - or even sooner, depending on your pet's condition. Both cats and dogs tolerate acupuncture very well, often to the complete surprise of their guardians! Traditional Chinese Medicine Many chronic illnesses are due to an improper diet, or an inability to absorb nutrients into the body. Unfortunately, many commercially available pet foods are akin to fast-food - and no-one can thrive on that kind of diet! A nutritional consultation will identify any imbalances in your pet's diet. Once we've identified the problem using the principles of Chinese Medicine, as well as recent studies on nutritional therapy, we'll help you find the right food for your pet. Poor nutrition is a direct cause of many health concerns - from major diseases to unhealthy skin - and even a small shift in diet can make substantial changes in overall health. Nutrition Homeopathy is the second most widely used system of medicine in the world. It helps counter illness by introducing very small amounts of organic substances, which stimulate the body's natural healing defenses, into your pet's immune system. Homeopathy was developed 200 years ago by Dr. Samuel Hahneman, and can be used to combat a variety of illnesses. Homeopathy is gentle, effective, natural, and works in harmony with your pet's immune system. Since there are thousands of homeopathic remedies, it takes experience - and some trial and error! - to match the exact remedy to your pet's symptoms. "}
