In 2011, more than 1:10 children used complementary therapy. [ [McClafferty: 2017](#citation4429)] In children, especially those with special health care needs, taking non-vitamin, non-mineral natural supplements is the most common complementary practice. [ [Levy: 2015](#citation4430)] The prevalence of non-allopathic approaches demonstrates the importance of providing information to families who seek an integrative approach. Key Points Collaboration Consider collaborating with integrative medicine specialists to help patients struggling with pain, anxiety, depression, headaches, digestive disorders like constipation, menstrual problems, chronic fatigue, and arthritis. Recognize that these providers usually treat the whole person and do not focus on just \"the headache\" or \"the pain.\" While some modalities have eclectic certification programs, primary care providers should try and steer families toward trained and certified integrative medicine practitioners. Ask about alternative medicine use Primary care clinicians should ask specifically about the use of supplements and other complementary or alternative medicine practices. They can provide guidance on the potential for drug interactions, known side effects, potential exposure to toxins, or overdose. They can also provide a perspective on cost vs. benefit, point families toward evidence-based approaches that are considered safe and effective, and give referrals to practitioners who are licensed and boarded. Avoid having the child's neck manipulated For families who choose to obtain chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation for their child, advise them to avoid having the child's neck manipulated aggressively. Take special precautions with patients with increased risk of vascular dissection, instability issues (like atlanto-axial instability that can occur with Down syndrome), and hypermobility concerns (that can occur with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). Acupuncture vs. needling Not all acupuncture is the same. A licensed acupuncturist's training is close to 3,000 hours, whereas physical therapists who perform needling often get 40-200 hours of training. Dry needling (with or without electrical stimulation) done by physical therapists is controversial and illegal in multiple states. Advise precaution if having needles placed around the pleural cavity as pneumothoraces can occur. Herbalists training varies greatly The [American Herbalists Guild](https://www.americanherbalistsguild.com/) recommends a program of at least 1600 hours of study at a school of herbal medicine, including a 400-hour clinical requirement to become a practicing herbalist. Practitioners who have a Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine or Masters in Oriental Medicine have fulfilled this requirement of study. A licensed acupuncturist and a licensed chiropractor will not have the same level of training. Essential oils could have deleterious effects on children's bodies Although high-quality research is lacking, several case studies link lavender and tea tree oil to prepubertal gynecomastia in boys and possible premature thelarche in girls; these have been dubbed potential \"endocrine disruptors.\" Encourage families interested in using essential oils to work with a certified professional. The [National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA)](https://naha.org/), an organization promoting standards for certification in aromatherapy, offers a database of providers. Practice Guidelines - [McClafferty H, Vohra S, Bailey M, Brown M, Esparham A, Gerstbacher D, Golianu B, Niemi AK, Sibinga Integrative Pediatrics. 2017;140(3). [PubMed abstract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=28847978) Speaking with Families about Integrative Medicine The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health offers the acronym ARMED (Ask, Respect, Monitor, Educate, and Distribute) to help clinicians talk with families about integrative and complementary health practices. Other recommended practices: - Ensure families have access to standard services and are actively involved in all treatment decisions. - Attempt to determine an etiologic of the child's condition. Explain current biologic understanding of the child's condition. - Discuss controversial as well as complementary therapies as part of the initial management plan and whenever asked. - Be knowledgeable about the standard and nonstandard treatments, or refer for consultation. Since it is difficult to keep current on all the alternative therapies, the primary care clinician may ask the family to schedule a follow-up appointment to allow the provider time for a literature review and time to discuss the proposed therapy in depth. - Schedule ample time for the discussion, making certain your comments are not taken as an endorsement. Discuss the placebo effect and the importance of controlled research trials. Be ready to explain the difference between a case report and a controlled trial. - Provide information about the specific treatment, discuss decision-making, and emphasize the red flags, such as the claim of an unrealistic cure or that every child will benefit. - Identify any confounding factors, e.g., opinions of relatives. - Be willing to support a trial of therapy in select situations; require clear treatment objectives and pre/post evaluation of symptoms. - Remain actively involved even if you do not agree with the parents' decision. If you can't do this and maintain an open therapeutic relationship, consider a referral to a medical home where the parents and the provider may more closely share the same philosophy. - If you feel that the alternative therapy and/or the declining of traditional therapeutic approaches for the alternative therapy is too risky, suggest that the family establish a new medical home that feels more comfortable with the family's choice. Further details about how to speak with families about integrative medicine can be found at [ [McClafferty: 2017](#citation4429)] and [ [Nickel: 2003](#citation436)]. Types of Integrative Medicine In the United States, many people consider allopathic or Western medicine (e.g., performed by a medical doctor, osteopathic doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant) to be \"mainstream\" or \"conventional.\" However, this framework depends on what system the family is most familiar with; a newly immigrated family may not consider Western medical practices to be \"conventional.\" Practices that can be combined with Western or allopathic medicine are considered complementary; those practices used instead of allopathic medicine are often considered \"alternative.\" Integrative health brings together mainstream and complementary practices for a holistic approach to health.
