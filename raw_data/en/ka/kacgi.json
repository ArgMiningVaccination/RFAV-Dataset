In contrast, macrophage dysfunction leads to multiple diseases, including cancer and fibrosis. Until recently, researchers have only focused on the influence and mechanisms of soluble and diffusible cues on macrophage function and behavior. However, throughout the body, macrophages encounter and reside in tissues with a wide range of physical properties that can modulate their function. Therefore, we wanted to understand the role of mechanical cues, especially substrate stiffness, from the extracellular matrix (ECM) onto which macrophages remain anchored in modulating their behavior during wound healing. Here, we identified YAP as a crucial molecule sensing substrate stiffness and controlling inflammation in macrophages. Further, we found that manipulating the biomaterial stiffness alters the inflammatory state and YAP signaling in macrophages. This study will help identify strategies to suppress the inflammation during diseases and design immunomodulatory biomaterials. | | | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Macromolecular phase separation is thought to underlie the spatial and temporal organization of cellular matter. Of particular relevance is the formation and dissolution of membraneless bodies, known as biomolecular condensates, at the right place and time. This talk will focus on our recent discoveries that have been driven by the physics of associative polymers. The talk will highlight insights that emerge from are more nuanced view of macromolecular phase transitions, the focus being on phase separation coupled to percolation in simple and complex mixtures of multivalent protein and RNA molecules. As a synopsis for the talk, the following perspective, published in Molecular Cell, might be of interest: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276522004853](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276522004853) | | Background: Dr. Arun Shastry joined Dystrophy Annihilation Research Trust (DART), Bangalore to set up India's first Research and Development facility dedicated in finding a cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in 2013. He established the in-vitro pre-clinical research department by creating Cell Lines of DMD patients and set up in-vivo platforms for studying long-term efficacy and toxicity of AON's in its potential as a therapy for DMD patients. In 2017, Hanugen Therpaeutics Private Limited a spinoff from DART was started which specializes in customized Antisense Oligonucleotide (AON's) Synthesis.

However, the cellular basis that detects the transient dopamine signaling has long been unclear. Using two-photon microscopy and optogenetics, I have shown that transient increases and decreases of dopamine modulate plasticity of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing cells in the nucleus accumbens, respectively. At a behavioral level, I characterized that these D1 and D2 cells cooperatively tune learning by generalization and discrimination learning. Interestingly, disturbance of the dopamine signaling impaired D2 cell plasticity and discrimination learning, which was analogous to salience misattribution seen in people with schizophrenia. | | Nearly 70% of all breast cancers are thought to be driven by the hormone estrogen. Despite effective hormonal therapies targeting the Estrogen Receptor (ER), resistance to therapy is common, leading to fatal disease. ER is a transcription factor that can both activate and repress genes upon stimulation by its ligand. Its binding patterns are known to be dramatically reprogrammed in tumors, compared to normal mammary epithelial cells. ER binding patterns have been shown to further change in metastatic disease. What directs ER to assume these differing roles is unclear. Pioneer factors such as FOXA1 are thought to be one mechanism that influence activity of hormone receptors like ER. Pioneer factors have the innate ability to open condensed chromatin and allow ER to bind and introduce transcriptional changes. We discovered that in addition to FOXA1, KLF4 is a pioneer factor that is required for ER binding. KLF4 has been established to be a pioneer factor in pluripotent stem cells and is one of four transcription factors required for stem cell reprogramming. Our preliminary results indicate that silencing of KLF4 leads to a subset of ER binding at a subset of it sites, coinciding with reduced chromatin accessibility at these regions and loss of ER driven gene expression changes. Imaging studies have previously shown that ER forms distinct foci or nuclear condensate structures. These structures thought to play a role in maintaining higher order chromatin formation and important in recruiting of transcriptional machinery. We observe that that KLF4 is required to maintain these foci in a subset of ER+ cells, indicating a role in maintaining chromatin structure. In addition to KLF4's chromatin functions, we observe that silencing of KLF4 disrupts transcriptional heterogeneity at the single-cell level, indicating that the factor may impart a level of plasticity to cancer cells. We hypothesize that our multi-faceted studies will uncover he role of KLF4 in breast tumorigenesis and regulating ER and chromatin function. We anticipate that our studies will help identify novel therapeutic targets to treat breast cancer. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Animals and humans replay neural patterns encoding trajectories through their environment, both whilst they solve decision-making tasks and during rest. Under a common assumption that we build models of the world and recognize and plan actions using those models, such intrinsically generated patterns are ideal for various forms of model inversion, giving us access to fast and effective methods for sensory processing and decision-making. I will discuss recent investigations using magnetoencephalography to detect replay in human subjects as they perform decision-making tasks. In a simple choice task, we found evidence for various forms of replay, which differed between subjects who flexibly adjusted their choices to changes in temporal, spatial and reward structure and those who were slower to adapt to change. The former group predominantly replayed comparatively less good trajectories during task performance, and subsequently avoided these inefficient choices. The latter replayed comparatively preferred, but suboptimal, trajectories during rest periods between task epochs. We suggest that online and offline replay both contribute to planning, but each are associated with distinct model-based and model-free decision strategies. This is joint work with Eran Eldar, Zeb Kurth-Nelson, Ray Dolan, GeorgyAntonov and Chris Gagne. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The ability of neurons to respond differentially to specific temporal and spatial patterns of stimulation underlies the storage of memory and information in neural circuits. Synaptic plasticity, the experience-induced change in connections between neurons, conveys this abililty to neurons. Most of our understanding of synaptic plasticity derives from in vitro experiments with precisely repeated stimulus patterns; however, neurons exhibit significant variability in vivo during repeated experiences and experience a diversity of inhibitory inputs. Further, the spatial pattern of synaptic inputs to the dendritic tree influences synaptic plasticity, yet is not considered in most synaptic plasticity rules. Here, we investigate how spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns produce plasticity with in vivo-like conditions using a data-driven computational model with a plasticity rule based on calcium dynamics. Our synaptic plasticity rule, based on amplitude and duration of calcium transients, can correctly predict the direction of synaptic plasticity for both spike-timing and frequency-based stimulation protocols. A novel and important function of inhibition is to enhance the difference in calcium between stimulated and non-stimulated, i.e., to enhance synaptic specificity. Using in vivo spike train recordings as inputs, we show that plasticity is strongly robust to trial-to-trial variability of spike timing. In addition, we derive general synaptic plasticity rules describing how spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs control the magnitude and direction of plasticity. Synapses that strongly potentiated had greater firing rates and calcium concentration later in the trial. Spike timing alone could not predict changes in synaptic strength. Coordination of firing between neurons was critical, as shuffling the inter-spike intervals eliminated strong potentiation. The neighboring synaptic activity influences the direction and magnitude of synaptic plasticity, with small clusters of spines producing the greatest increase in synaptic strength. Together, our results reveal that calcium dynamics can unify diverse plasticity rules and reveal how spatiotemporal firing rate patterns control synaptic plasticity. | | Error-free chromosome segregation during cell division is essential for accurate organismal growth and development. Defective chromosome segregation often results in aneuploidy, a chromosomal numerical aberration implicated in cancer and congenital disabilities. Establishing, monitoring and ensuring the correct physical attachment of chromosomes to the centromeric chromatin and subsequent establishment of chromosome bi-orientation are essential requirements for accurate chromes segregation. However, molecular and structural level mechanistic understanding of these crucial processes is not well understood. In this presentation, I will discuss our ongoing integrative structure-function efforts to unravel the mechanisms of error-free chromosome segregation. | | Stochastic gene expression variability is intimately linked to cellular plasticity, which while being an integral part of development and stress response, presents challenges for cancer therapy. I will present our recent work showing existence of transcriptionally distinct subpopulation of healthy pancreatic acinar ductal-acinar progenitor state pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Parallels between development and cancer has long been noted and recent works have identified activation of developmental programs in cancer. I will briefly describe our recent unpublished work showing a broad misappropriation of developmental splicing programs by cancer. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) receives excitatory inputs from both sensory and motor cortical regions. In the neocortex, sensory responses are affected by motor activity, however, it is not known if such sensorimotor interactions also occur in the striatum and how they are shaped by dopamine. To determine the impact of motor activity on striatal sensory processing, we performed in vivo whole-cell recordings in the DLS of awake mice during the presentation of tactile stimuli. Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) were activated by both whisker stimulation and spontaneous whisking, however, their responses to whisker deflection during ongoing whisking were attenuated. Dopamine depletion reduced the representation of whisking in direct-pathway MSNs, but not in those of the indirect-pathway. Furthermore, dopamine depletion impaired the discrimination between ipsilateral and contralateral sensory stimulation in both direct- and indirect-pathway MSNs. Our results show that motor activity affects sensory responses in basal ganglia circuits and that both processes are dopamine- and cell type-dependent. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Neuromodulators are substances that act on slower timescales relative to classical neurotransmitters, and may modify many parameters of neural function. Examples are amines like dopamine and peptides like tachykinins. Over the last fifty years, owing to studies in many invertebrate nervous systems, appreciation has grown for the role that neuromodulators play in setting neuronal intrinsic and synaptic properties. Nevertheless, in most cases, it is difficult to establish the behavioral consequences of neuromodulatory effects on single neurons. In my talk, I will present our recent work to show how dopaminergic neuromodulation at the single neuronal level leads to reconfiguration of spinal motor networks and faster swimming behavior in larval zebrafish. Such mechanistic links spanning cellular, network and behavioral levels will be key to understanding how neuromodulation affects organisms. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Neuromodulation of neocortical microcircuits is one of the most fascinating and mysterious aspects of brain physiology. Despite over a century of research, the neuroscientific community has yet to uncover the fundamental biological organizing principles underlying neuromodulatory release. Phylogenetically, Acetylcholine (ACh) is perhaps the oldest neuromodulator, and one of the most well-studied. ACh regulates the physiology of neurons and synapses, and modulates neural microcircuits to bring about a reconfiguration of global network states. ACh is known to support cognitive processes such as learning and memory, and is involved in the regulation of arousal, attention and sensory processing. While the effects of ACh in the neocortex have been characterized extensively, integrated knowledge of its mechanisms of action is lacking. Furthermore, the ways in which ACh is released from en-passant axons originating in subcortical nuclei are still debatable. Simulation-based paradigms play an important role in testing scientific hypotheses, and provide a useful framework to integrate what is already known and systematically explore previously uncharted territory. Importantly, data-driven computational approaches highlight gaps in current knowledge and guide experimental research. To this end, we developed a multi-scale model of cholinergic innervation of rodent somatosensory cortex comprising two distinct sets of ascending projections implementing either synaptic (ST) or volumetric transmission (VT). The model enables the projection types to be combined in arbitrary proportions, thus permitting investigations of the relative contributions of these two transmission modalities. Using this model, we find that the two modes of cholinergic release act in concert and have powerful desynchronizing effects on microcircuit activity. Furthermore, we show that this modelling framework can be extended to other neuromodulators, such as dopamine and serotonin, with minimal constraining data. In summary, our results suggest a more nuanced view of neuromodulation in which multiple modes of transmitter release - ST vs VT - are required to produce synergistic functional effects. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Incentive stimuli and environmental stressors are encoded at the level of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits, which send their glutamatergic excitatory several neuromodulatory regions, including the Locus Coeruleus (LC), the major source of norepinephrine (NE) for the entire forebrain. Despite the potential implications for NE-mediated regulation of action control, it remains to be established how LC neuronal activity is shaped by impinging PFC inputs (PFCLC) to affect behavior. Raffaella Tonini will discuss unpublished work from her lab showing how local neuromodulators released by LC neurons at PFCLC synapses affect the PFC-LC reciprocal connectivity, by shaping the release of NE in the cortex. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Across the life span, the brain learns to choose adaptively between different behavioral options to reach specific goals. This process requires behavioral flexibility and is supported by frontostriatal circuits and their optimal modulation by ascending neuromodulatory systems (i.e. dopamine) and local neuromodulatory signals (i.e. endocannabinoids). Raffaella Tonini will discuss recent findings from her lab that mechanistically establish the role of striatal astrocytes in the modulation of glutamatergic signaling relevant to behavioral flexibility. She will also present evidence that behavioral flexibility is subserved by a subcellular spatial reorganization of signaling macromolecular complexes striatal glutamatergic synapses. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| 90% of cancers attain immortality by reactivation of an enzyme called telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). How TERT is reactivated in human cancers remains a fundamental unsolved problem in biology. I will present two unpublished and unexpected set of results that emerged from our studies to decipher how TERT is reactivated. The first set of observations uncover a novel transcription factor with unrecognized roles in physiology. Targeting this unusual transcriptional complex may have clinical implications beyond telomerase and cancers. The second set of results provide exciting evidence that RNAs and their binding partners (RBPs) could be the next generation drug targets in human cancers. Since only ~2% of our genomes code for proteins, drugging the non-coding genome is likely to open vast therapeutic opportunities. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The mission of the Sapiens Labs Center for Human Brain and Mind at Krea University is to understand and enable the human mind. This includes understanding the diversity of our collective brain and mind, the relationship between them, and how they are evolving with our changing physical, social and technological environment, with a view to drive positive impact. Some specific challenges include: How do we understand and tackle the alarming global decline in the mental wellbeing of younger generations?

Interest in these extinctions goes back to the days of Alfred Russell Wallace, who famously stated that \u00e2we live in an impoverished world, from which all the hugest, fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared\u00e2. Wallace was referring to the demise of giant mammals like the mammoth and the woolly rhino. Indeed, continents like North and South America, Australia, and the European subcontinent lost most of their large mammals, Africa and Asia still retain a diverse mega-fauna. While considerable efforts have been put into studying these extinctions in most parts of the world, the Indian Subcontinent has largely remained in the dark. In this talk, I will review what we know about recently extinct megafauna in India, and present recent work that I have done to uncover the pattern and process of the extinctions in the region. Lastly, I will discuss the implications of these extinctions on our understanding of the Anthropocene, and how South Asia\u00e2s fauna has changed over the last 100,000 years. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein) is the primary minus end-directed motor protein in most eukaryotic cells. Dynein remains in an inactive conformation until the formation of a tripartite complex comprising dynein, its regulator dynactin and a cargo adaptor. How this process of dynein activation occurs is unclear, since it entails the formation of a three-protein complex inside the crowded environs of a cell. Here, we employed live-cell, single-molecule imaging to visualize and track fluorescently tagged dynein. First, we observed that only ~30% of dynein molecules that bound to the microtubule engaged in minus end-directed movement, and that too for a short duration of ~0.5 s. Next, using high-resolution imaging in live and fixed cells and using correlative light and electron microscopy, we discovered that dynactin remained persistently attached to microtubules, and endosomal cargo remained in proximity to the microtubules and dynactin. Finally, we employed two-colour imaging to visualise cargo movement effected by single motor binding. Taken together, we discovered a search strategy that is facilitated by dynein's frequent microtubule binding-unbinding kinetics: (1) in a futile event when dynein does not encounter cargo anchored in proximity to the microtubule, dynein unbinds and diffuses into the cytoplasm, (2) when dynein encounters cargo and dynactin upon microtubule-binding, it moves cargo in a short run. Several of these short runs are undertaken in succession for long-range directed movement. These discoveries were confirmed in a stochastic model incorporating dynamic motors binding to stationary cargo located along microtubules, and in a 3-state run-and-tumble particle (RTP) model that faithfully recapitulates the emergent cargo behaviour. In conclusion, we demonstrate that dynein activation and cargo capture are coupled in a step that relies on reduction of dimensionality to enable minus end-directed transport in cellulo. | | Mammalian genomes harbor a large number of transposable elements (TEs) and their remnants. Most TEs are incapable of retrotransposition as most TEs are epigenetically repressed. However transcriptional silencing is partially released to permit developmental or tissue-specific expression of TEs. Some TEs have also evolved as cis-regulatory elements (CREs), enabling them to recruit host-encoded transcription factors. Dysregulation of TEs is implicated in neurological disorders and cancer. Previously, the noncoding long terminal repeat (LTR) part of the endogenous retrovirus (ERV) families has been shown to function as transcriptional enhancers (cis-regulatory elements). We have previously shown H4K16ac and H3K122ac marks transcriptional enhancers. I will present our recent work which demonstrates that MOF/MSL mediated H4K16ac regulates TE transcription by maintaining a permissive chromatin structure. Since TEs constitute nearly 50% of the genome, our data shows that H4K16ac and H3K122ac regulate a significant portion of the mammalian genome by opening local chromatin structure and transcriptional activity at TEs.
