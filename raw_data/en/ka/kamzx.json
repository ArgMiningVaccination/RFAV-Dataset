A striking feature of this research area is the diversity of the narratives that are used in the various studies. Narratives that convey a health message differ widely on a large number of dimensions related to the content, form and context. We expect that these characteristics are potential explanatory factors in the effectiveness of the narratives. To provide an overview of the different characteristics of narratives in health effects research and of the persuasive effects that were found, we review 153 experimental studies on health-related narrative persuasion with a focus on the narrative stimuli. The results show that: a) with regard to the content, showing the healthy behavior in a narrative (as opposed to the unhealthy behavior with negative consequences) may be associated with effects on intention. Narratives that contain high emotional content are more often shown to have effects. b) With regard to the form, for print narratives, a first-person perspective is a promising characteristic in light of effectiveness. c) With regard to the context, an overtly persuasive presentation format does not seem to inhibit narrative persuasion. And d) other characteristics, like character similarity or the presentation medium of the narrative, do not seem to be promising characteristics for producing health effects. In addition, fruitful areas for further research can be found in the familiarity of the setting and the way a health message is embedded in the narrative. Because of the diversity of narrative characteristics and effects that were found, continued research effort is warranted on which characteristics lead to effects. The present review provides an overview of the evidence for persuasive narrative characteristics so far. Suggested citation: De Graaf, A., Sanders, J., & Hoeken, H. (2016).

As a content characteristic, showing the healthy behavior in the narrative seems to be associated with effects on intention. A promising form characteristic of print narratives is the use of a first-person perspective. An overtly persuasive context does not necessarily preclude narrative effects in a health context. The diversity of narrative characteristics and effects invites continued research on health-related narrative persua - sion.

Because differences such as these are sub - stantial, we expect that they can be important for explain - ing the contradictory results that were found for the ef - fectiveness of narratives (cf. Shaffer & Zikmund-Fisher, 2013). Addressing these differences may shed light on why certain studies have found persuasive effects and others have not. In addition, when such differences are not con - trolled, they might constitute threats to the internal valid - ity of research findings. To control for them, a system - atic review is necessary. This study reviews the existing research on health-related narrative persuasion with a focus on the narrative materials. It provides an overview of the different characteristics of narratives in health ef - fects research and of the persuasive effects that were found. Definition of Narrative To delineate the research field, it is important to start with a definition of the key term: narrative. Several schol - ars who study narrative effects give different definitions, but most scholars agree that the definition of narrative includes at least one character, who experiences at least one event (Bal, 1997; Green, 2006; Kreuter et al., 2007; McDonald, 2014; Rimmon-Kenan, 2002). A character is an agent who is human or human-like in that they act with intentions to achieve goals (Bal, 1997, Rimmon- Kenan, 2002). An event is a transition from one state to another temporally and causally connected state (Bal, 1997; McDonald, 2014). Most narratives consist of mul - tiple events that are also connected in such a sequential, causal way. The term causal here refers not only to cau - sality in a strictly necessary way (e.g., Mary released the breaks of the car on top of the hill and thus it started rolling down), but also to reasons for events (e.g., Mary was mad at her friend and thus she started spreading rumors about her). Although events may be presented in a non-chronological order, the underlying structure is one of cause and effect or action and reaction, that connects the narrative events and characters in a story structure (Green, 2006; Rimmon-Kenan, 2002). As narratives present characters experiencing events, they are set in a spatiotemporal framework (Herman, 2009; McDonald, 2014). The events take place at a certain time and place, also called the setting. These elements (i.e. characters, events, space and time) make narratives Narratives are increasingly used in health communica - tion to reach public health goals, such as promoting be - haviors that are aimed at the prevention and detection of illnesses (Frank, Murphy, Chatterjee, Moran, & Baezconde-Garbanati, 2015; Thompson & Kreuter, 2014). For instance, narratives, in which experiences of charac - ters are presented, have been developed to promote health behaviors as diverse as smoking cessation (Houston et al., 2011), breast cancer screening (Kreuter et al., 2008), and HIV prevention (Berkley-Patton, Goggin, Liston, Bradley- Ewing, & Neville, 2009). Research has shown that nar - ratives can serve as effective health interventions. Com - pared to other types of messages, some narratives are able to create story-consistent beliefs and attitudes, increase behavioral intentions, and stimulate healthy behaviors (e.g., Dillard, Fagerlin, Dal Cin, Zikmund-Fisher, & Van den Bulck, 2010). However, not all research shows effects of narratives. Some narratives are found not to be powerful enough to create an effect on determinants of health behavior (e.g., Greene, Campo, & Wakefield, 2014). Meta-analytic studies that narratives have small effects on persua - sive outcomes overall, but significant variation in these narrative effects is also detected (Braddock & Dillard, in press; Shen, Sheer, & Li, 2015; Zebregs, Van den Putte, Neijens, & De Graaf, 2015). These findings suggest that even though narratives can serve as a promising health communication tool, not all narratives are effective. Thus, it becomes an important question which narratives are used in this research area and which are the active ingre - dients of these narratives (cf. Green, 2008). When surveying the area of health-related narrative persuasion research, it becomes apparent that the narra - tive materials that were used differ widely on a large number of dimensions. For instance, on one hand, Dillard et al. (2010) used a print narrative about a person who decides to have a colonoscopy after having thought about the pros and cons. On the other hand, Dunlop et al. (2010) used a narrative of video stills with a voice-over about a woman who experiences negative consequences of smok - ing. These narratives differ in the type of behavior that they show (the promoted, healthy behavior vs. the discour - aged, unhealthy behavior) and the presentation medium of the narrative (print vs. audio-visual), among other Characteristics of narrative interventions and health effects91 2016, 4, 88-131Their results indicated that there was a difference in ef - fects on beliefs and attitudes on one hand, and effects on intentions on the other, in that statistics were more effec - tive for beliefs and attitudes, whereas narratives were more effective for intention. In contrast, Braddock and Dillard (in press) selected for their meta-analysis 74 stud - ies that compared narratives to a control condition that included no (relevant) message. Their results showed that, compared to a zero-effect baseline, narrative had effects on story-consistent beliefs, attitudes and intentions. How - ever, they also found indications for significant variation in the effects that were not due to the tested moderators: fictionality and medium. Therefore, they urged research - ers to look for other moderators. Other reviews have focused on the association of nar - rative engagement (Tukachinsky & Tokunaga, 2013) and transportation into a narrative world (Van Laer, De Ruyter, Visconti, & Wetzels, 2014) with narrative effects. Tukachinsky and Tokunaga (2013) concluded on the basis of 45 studies that engagement with the narrative and its characters was positively related to attitudes and inten - tions implied by the narrative. Van Laer et al. (2014) showed that the specific type of engagement with a story conceptualized as transportation, or the extent to which a story recipient imaginatively enters the story world, predicted beliefs, attitudes and intentions. Thus, the link between narrative engagement and persuasion has been firmly established by previous reviews. Therefore, we will include results on engagement variables in our review, but these will not be our primary focus. The emphasis of the present review is on narrative characteristics. We will do a systematic review of all relevant studies in order to give a complete overview of the narratives that have been used in research on narrative health communication, that can serve as a starting point for further research. Narrative Characteristics In studies on health-related narrative persuasion, dif - ferent types of narratives have been used. For instance, some studies have used narratives that mainly consist of positive events experienced by characters (e.g., Falzon et al., 2015; Lu, 2013), whereas other studies have used stories that focus on negative events for characters (e.g., De Wit, Das, & Vet, 2008; Dunlop et al., 2010). As another specific and concrete. Narratives are about particular instances occurring to a specific person or persons in a certain setting. The focus on specific instances contrasts to, for instance, scientific explanations that give informa - tion on how the world tends to be, based on multiple in - stances and persons (Bruner, 1986; Herman, 2009). The presentation of individual cases of something that hap - pened to certain characters in a certain situation (e.g., Sarah, aged 16, was vaccinated against HPV yesterday), is what sets narratives apart from other types of mes - sages. Non-narrative messages like informational or statistical texts present more general information that is abstracted from multiple cases (e.g., 60% of girls between 14-18 have been vaccinated against HPV). Based on these considerations, the definition of narrative that is used in this review is: A presentation of concrete event(s) expe - rienced by specific character(s) in a setting. Previous Reviews Several previous reviews on narrative effects have shown that narratives can be effective in entertainment- education (Shen & Han, 2014) and persuasive contexts (Zebregs et al., 2015), providing valuable insight into the overall strength of narrative effects. However, these re - views have not distinguished between different types of narratives based on their characteristics, which is what this review sets out to add to the research field. Shen and Han (2014) meta-analyzed 22 studies on entertainment- education. They found that entertainment-education nar - ratives had a small but significant effect on persuasion. Shen et al. (2015) assessed 25 studies comparing narrative to non-narrative messages. They found a small but sig - nificant effect of narrative, and identified the type of advocated behavior as a moderator. Narratives had effects for prevention and detection behaviors, but not for cessa - tion behaviors (e.g., quitting smoking). We propose that, in addition to the type of behavior, characteristics of the narrative itself can also be factors responsible for variation in research results, and such knowledge on features of effective narratives should enable us to offer guidance for message design and production in health interventions and campaigns. Zebregs et al. (2015) included 15 studies that tested persuasive effects of narrative versus statistical texts. De Graaf, Sanders & Hoeken92 www .rcommunicationr.orgof a text, or whether the presented information is pre - dominantly positive or negative, can differ in narratives as well as in other text types like informational or argu - mentative texts (Updegraff & Rothman, 2013). The present review will explore the characteristics of narrative stimuli in existing health-related narrative per - suasion research as potential explanatory factors of their effectiveness. In this context, effectiveness refers to chang - es in story-consistent beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behavior that are directed at the physical and mental health of a person. Of course, narrative characteristics are not the only factors that play a role in the effectiveness of a story. This process is also influenced by characteris - tics of the recipient and the situation in which the recipi - ent is exposed to the narrative (Bilandzic & Busselle, 2013; Green & Brock, 2002). Research has shown that recipient factors can increase engagement and effectiveness, like transportability or the propensity to become engaged in narratives (Dal Cin, Zanna, & Fong, 2004), prior knowl - edge (Green, 2004), and need for affect (Appel & Richter, 2010). In addition, factors in the situation can distract the recipient and decrease engagement, like carrying out an added secondary task (De Graaf, Hoeken, Sanders, & Beentjes, 2009; Green & Brock, 2000) or being exposed to noise in the environment (Zwarun & Hall, 2012). Most likely, the full process of persuasion is determined by a joint function of narrative, recipient and situational fac - tors. However, we isolate the narrative factor in this equation to achieve optimal clarity. In this way, we at - tempt to identify promising characteristics that seem to make narratives more effective in a health context. Method Search Strategy We systematically searched for studies that tested the persuasive effects of narratives. The databases Commu - nication and Mass Media Complete, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE were consulted. We used key terms related to the independent variable of narrative and synonyms such as story, testimonial, exemplar, and anecdot*. These were paired with search terms related to the dependent variable persuasion such as persuas*, belief, attitude, and example, a narrative can be told from different perspec - tives (Bal, 1997). In prior research, both first-person nar - ratives, in which someone tells what happened to him- or herself (e.g., De Wit et al., 2008; Falzon et al., 2015), and third-person stories, in which a narrator tells about events that happened to someone else (e.g., Dunlop et al., 2010; Gray & Harrington, 2011), have been used. Since mes - sages that differ on these sorts of characteristics still present specific cases of what happened to characters, they all fall under the definition of narrative. However, they exhibit such variety that their persuasive impact may depend on their specific characteristics. Narrative characteristics can vary along different di - mensions. A fundamental distinction lies in the content and form of the narrative (see Bal, 1997; Rimmon-Kenan, 2002). Main elements of the content are the characters, events, and setting that are presented in the story. For instance, characters can be more or less similar to the target recipients and events can differ in their valence (Shaffer & Zikmund-Fisher, 2013). The form refers to the way the content is presented in the narrative. For instance, the view the reader is given on the story content can vary between different perspectives; and the events can either be presented chronologically or non-chronologically (Brewer & Liechtenstein, 1982). An additional dimension relevant to health-related narrative persuasion research is the context of the presentation of the narrative. For instance, the context of a narrative can consist of an en - tertainment format. In such a context, the reader is gen - erally unaware that the narrative has a persuasive inten - tion (Slater & Rouner, 2002). The context of a narrative can also consist of an advertisement or a health education brochure (e.g., Chang, 2008; Dillard et al., 2010), in which the persuasive intent is more explicit. These dimensions of narrative content, form and context are presented in Table 1 together with examples of characteristics. These dimensions will guide the review of narrative character - istics carried out in this paper. As Table 1 shows, some of the characteristics are spe - cific to narrative in that they are irrelevant to other text types. These characteristics are tied to the definition of narrative, with its characters, events and setting. Perspec - tive for instance refers to the point of view from which the narrative events are presented (Bal, 1997). Other characteristics are non-specific to narratives and are pres - ent in other text types as well. For instance, the valence Characteristics of narrative interventions and health effects93 2016, 4, 88-131veloping their cognitive skills (Strasburger, Wilson, & Jordan, 2014). Therefore, narrative effects on children may be different and should be studied separately. Applying the selection criteria to the papers found in the database search resulted in a total of 141 papers that reported 153 (quasi-)experimental studies in which par - ticipants were exposed to a narrative and health-related effects were measured (see references marked with * in reference list). When multiple articles reported on the same data, the article that reported the most relevant information was retained. When the same data were presented in both published (peer-reviewed journal articles) and unpublished reports (e.g., conference papers and dis - sertations), we included the published article. This selec - tion covered a wide range of narratives from profession - ally produced audiovisual entertainment-education programs (e.g., Asbeek Brusse, Smit, & Neijens, 2010) to a few lines of anecdotal evidence embedded in a print advertisement (e.g., Cox & Cox, 2001). In addition, a variety of health topics and procedures were included, from mental health (e.g., Chang, 2008) to osteoporosis (e.g., Volkman & Parrott, 2012), and from influenza vac - cination (e.g., Prati, Pietrantoni, & Zani, 2012) to HIV/Aids prevention (e.g., Igartua, Cheng, & Lopes, 2003). Finally, many different target groups were studied. Both student samples with a relatively high level of education (e.g., Banerjee & Greene, 2012a) and specific groups with a relatively low level of education (e.g., McQueen, Kreuter, Kalesan, & Alcaraz, 2011) were targeted with the narra - tives. In addition, both people who were already diagnosed with a certain disease (e.g., Falzon et al., 2015) and peo - ple who were not (yet) ill (e.g., Gray & Harrington, 2011) were studied. The selected studies had one of two different designs. Either the study compared a narrative condition to a control condition, such as a non-narrative message (e.g., Moyer-Gus\u00e9 & Nabi, 2010) or a no message condition (e.g., Lapinski & Nwulu, 2008), or the study compared different versions of a narrative, in which a characteristic of the narrative or its context was manipulated (e.g., Hoeken & Sinkeldam, 2014). Some studies combined both possibilities (e.g., Keer, Van den Putte, De Wit, & Neijens, 2013). From the comparison of a narrative condition to a control condition, conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of the narrative used in the study. From the comparison of different versions of a narrative, conclu -intention. This search resulted in a list of possibly relevant journal publications, conference papers and dissertations. In addition, prior review articles (e.g., Tukachinsky & Tokunaga, 2013; Van Laer et al., 2014) and central em - pirical articles were consulted for relevant references (e.g., Moyer-Gus\u00e9 & Nabi, 2010; Murphy, Frank, Chatterjee, & Baezconde-Garbanati, 2013). Finally, we searched for articles that included references to central theoretical and empirical articles (e.g., Braverman, 2008; Green, 2006). Selection Criteria From the search results, we selected studies for inclu - sion in the systematic review on the basis of several cri - teria. First, the study had to include participants who were exposed to a narrative. This criterion means that at least a part of the participants had to read, view or listen to a representation of events happening to specific character(s), thus including textual, as well as audio or audiovisual narratives. However, we excluded studies on interactive narratives (e.g., Downs, Murray, de Bruin, Penrose, Palmgren, & Fischoff, 2004), because in these studies the narrative elements presented to the participants were not stable within conditions. Second, the study had to measure persuasive effects of being exposed to the narrative. Persuasive effects could be effects on beliefs, attitudes, intentions or actual behaviors. Beliefs included different perceptions that persons can have about the real world, such as risk perceptions, beliefs in benefits of the health behavior, or self-efficacy. Third, the study had to address a health topic. Health was defined broadly, as any topic relating to the physical and psychological well - being of a person. Included topics could also concern the health of another person as the recipient, such as organ donation, or decisions for others (e.g., whether to vaccinate a child). Fourth, the study had to have a (quasi-) experi - mental design. Thus, the study exposed different groups of participants to different conditions, so that conclusions could be drawn about effects. Fifth, the study had to be published since the year 2000. This criterion was based on the publication of the founding article that coined the term narrative persuasion , by Green and Brock (2000). This article provided the impetus for the research field of this review. Finally, the study had to use either college-aged participants or older. Studies with children of high-school age or younger were excluded because they are still de -De Graaf, Sanders & Hoeken94 www .rcommunicationr.orgmore often add to the persuasiveness of narratives and which characteristics do not, and we will identify gaps in the literature of which characteristics have not been re - searched enough to draw clear conclusions. To characterize the narratives used in the studies, we will discuss the characteristics they show based on the dimensions outlined in Table 1 . We will provide an over - view of the narrative characteristics in the studies and of the effects that were found on health-related beliefs, at - titudes, intentions, and actual behavior. In this way, we aim to characterize the narratives in health-related nar - rative persuasion research and attempt to find patterns in the results of these studies. Results Comparing Narratives to Control Conditions Table 2 describes studies that have compared a narra - tive to a non-narrative or no message control condition (and did not include an additional manipulation within the narrative). The table lists effects that were found in these studies on persuasion (beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behavior) and engagement variables (transportation, identification and related constructs). Only direct effects are included in the table. Moderated effects (by factors like participant group) are not reported. When the study included multiple control conditions (e.g., a statistical message and a no message control), the control condition in which the least information was provided to participants was selected (e.g., no message, or a health warning with - out evidence), if sufficient information on this condition was provided in the report. The table shows that these studies employed a wide range of narratives, with print, audio and audiovisual narratives being represented. In the print narratives, there was generally one clear pro - tagonist who carried out health-related actions and/or experienced health-related consequences. In the audiovi - sual narratives, it occurred more often that multiple char - acters were involved in the health-related sequence of events (e.g., discussing screening or urging others to get screened, Murphy et al., 2013). In some studies, it also occurred that participants were exposed to multiple (print or audiovisual) narratives with different protagonists (e.g., sions can be drawn about the effectiveness of the charac - teristic that the study manipulated. We will review both types of studies and compare results across research de - signs. Review Strategy To gain insight into the characteristics of the narrative stimuli, we reviewed the selected reports for inclusion of the materials that were used. Of 29 studies, the materials were available either in the report or in a digital appendix. In addition, materials of 23 studies could be found in other sources, like a dissertation that reported the same experiment, or the episodes of entertainment programs that were used. Of 63 studies, we located authors and contacted them to request the materials that they had used. We obtained narrative materials of 36 studies in this way. In sum, we collected 88 narratives. Some of these narratives were used in multiple studies. Thus, we could analyze the narrative materials of 91 studies (59.5% of the 153 included studies). The stimuli of the remaining 62 studies included in the review were not obtained, either because we were unable to locate the authors, or the au - thors did not respond or were unable to provide us with the narrative materials. For the review of the character - istics of the latter narratives, the descriptions and exem - plary passages in the reports will be used. First, we will review the studies that compared a nar - rative condition to a non-narrative condition (or no mes - sage control). We will analyze the characteristics of the narratives used in the studies that found an effect and the ones that have not and try to discern a pattern. If certain types of narratives produce effects more often, this would be an indication that the characteristics of these narratives are promising for persuasion in a health context. Second, we will review the studies that compared different ver - sions of a narrative. We will identify which characteristics have been manipulated and provide an overview of which version was more effective in the different studies. If a certain version is consistently more effective, this would be an indication that this type of narrative seems persua - sive. Studies that combined manipulations of the narrative and comparisons of a narrative to a control condition will be included in the review of manipulations, because nar - rative characteristics varied within these studies. Finally, we will draw conclusions about which characteristics Characteristics of narrative interventions and health effects95 2016, 4, 88-131tive was less clear-cut. Audiovisual narratives often fea - tured multiple characters and regular cuts in which the camera angle changes from one character to the other. Almost all audiovisual narratives employed in these stud - ies contained multiple characters, whether they found effects on beliefs and attitudes or not. Regarding the way a message was embedded in the narrative, almost all nar - ratives integrated the message within the causal structure of the sequence of events, regardless of effects. A few narratives also included the message in dialogue between characters (e.g., Murphy et al., 2013). These characteris - tics did not show enough variation to allow for inferences about a pattern with regard to their effectiveness. Regarding the context, the narratives that produced effects on beliefs and attitudes, showed substantial dif - ferences. Some were embedded in a public service an - nouncement, which clearly had persuasive intent (e.g., Limon & Kazoleas, 2004), whereas others were presented in an isolated way, which made persuasive intent less clear (e.g., Greene & Brinn, 2003). The finding that narratives in contexts with as well as without explicit persuasive intent produced effects, suggests that it does not matter whether the context indicates clear persuasive intent for impact on beliefs and attitudes. Intention. Approximately half of the studies that compared nar - rative to control conditions measured intentions. Several of these studies found effects of the narrative on at least one story-related intention. With regard to the content, the narratives that produced effects on intention differed in the events they present. In half of these narratives, the protagonist showed healthy behavior like exercising (Falzon et al., 2015) and in the other half, the protagonist showed unhealthy behavior like tanning (Greene & Brinn, 2003). However, when this was compared to the studies that did not find an effect on intention, only one of the narrative stimuli included a protagonist that showed healthy behavior. The other studies that did not find an effect on intention used narratives that presented unhealthy behavior. These results suggest that even though the ma - jority of studies used narratives in which unhealthy be - havior was shown (with negative consequences), the few studies in which the narratives showed healthy behavior more often found an effect on intention. Even though Jung Oh & LaRose, 2015; Shaffer, Templin, & Hulsey, 2013c). In addition, the narratives were presented in sev - eral different contexts, from advertisements in which the persuasive intent is clear to isolated texts with implicit persuasive intent. Several of the narratives in these stud - ies produced persuasive effects on story-consistent beliefs and attitudes, intentions and/or actual behavior compared to the control group. We will discuss effects on each of these persuasive outcomes and the content, form, and context characteristics of the narratives that were used. Beliefs and attitudes. Approximately half of the studies that measured health- related beliefs or attitudes found an effect of the narrative on story-consistent beliefs or attitudes. Regarding the content that was presented, the narrative stimuli in these studies differed in several respects. Some of the narratives showed the character's compliance with a recommended healthy behavior, like a protagonist who decided to get screened (Dillard et al., 2010), whereas other narratives showed noncompliance with a recommendation and hence negative consequences, like a protagonist who did not get vaccinated and thus contracted hepatitis B (De Wit, Das, & Vet, 2008). In addition, some of the characters had a background similar to the target group, resulting in a familiar setting (Hernandez & Organista, 2013), whereas other characters were not matched to the recipients (Bahk, 2001). These content characteristics also varied in the studies that did not find effects on story-consistent beliefs and attitudes, giving no clear indication of promising narrative characteristics. Regarding the form of the narratives, equal numbers of print and audiovisual narratives were used in the stud - ies that found effects on beliefs or attitudes and the stud - ies that did not find effects, suggesting that the presenta - tion medium of the narrative is not related to persuasion. However, within the print narratives that produced effects on beliefs and attitudes, all were in the first-person per - spective. Within the print narratives that did not find effects on beliefs and attitudes, about half used a first- person perspective, whereas the other half used a third- person perspective. Thus, although a first-person perspec - tive does not guarantee persuasive impact, it does seem to increase the chance of effects on predictors of behavior. In narratives presented through other media, perspec -De Graaf, Sanders & Hoeken96 www .rcommunicationr.orgmation instruction, which clearly indicated that the nar - rative was intended to help you form a healthy intention, whereas Lemal and Van den Bulck (2010) presented the narrative without an overtly persuasive context. These results again indicate that both overtly persuasive and covertly persuasive narratives can have persuasive effects. Final observations on comparing narratives to control conditions. Only two of the studies found a negative effect of nar - ratives in the sense that the control messages appeared more persuasive than the narrative messages. Nyhan et al. (2014) showed that a narrative text about a young child who became very ill with a measles infection (that he contracted because he was not vaccinated) increased beliefs in the side-effects of the measles vaccination. It is possible that recipients of this narrative misinterpreted the consequences presented in the narratives as resulting from the vaccination. Thrasher et al. (2012) found that cigarette label warnings in narrative form resulted in lower perceived effectiveness than cigarette label warnings in didactic form. However, this was also the only study that used a measure of perceived effectiveness instead of actual beliefs or attitudes. As single studies cannot give indications of systematic variation on their own, this finding cannot be used to infer a pattern. With regard to the underlying process of persuasion, about a quarter of the studies included measures related to engagement with the narrative, such as transportation or identification. Most of these studies found an effect of the narrative on at least one of the measures. These stud - ies that found effects on engagement-related variables included different content, form and contexts. Only two studies did not find differences between the narrative and the control condition, which also differed on most of the dimensions. Therefore, there was not enough systematic variation to identify a pattern in these results. In sum, narratives can produce effects on several per - suasive outcomes. The characteristics that seem promis - ing for health-related persuasive effects are a first-person perspective and the presentation of healthy behavior. In addition, an overtly persuasive context does not seem to inhibit persuasive potential. Other characteristics, such as the matching of characters to the target group and the presentation medium of the narrative, appear to be unre -negative stories can also have effects on intention, positive stories showing healthy behavior and desirable conse - quences seem to be associated with effects more often. Other characteristics varied within the narratives that produced effects as well as within the narratives that did not produce effects on intention. Many studies used nar - ratives with student protagonists when participants were students, but some studies did not (Asbeek-Brusse, et al., 2010; Dunlop, et al., 2010). Medium as well as perspective also varied, regardless of whether effects on intention were found. The context was about equally divided be - tween overtly indicating persuasive intent (e.g., being read from a script by a health educator in Larkey & Gon - zales, 2007) and not clearly indicating persuasive intent. Similar to the results for beliefs and attitudes, this indicates that context does not play a role in effects of the narrative. Behavior. Only five studies measured actual behavior. Two of these studies found persuasive effects of the narrative (Jung Oh & LaRose, 2015; Lemal & Van den Bulck, 2010). With regard to the content that was presented, the narra - tive materials that were used in these studies differed in several respects. Lemal and van den Bulck (2010) exposed participants to one narrative with a single protagonist, whereas Jung Oh and LaRose (2015) used four testimoni - als of different characters. In addition, the protagonist in the narrative used by Lemal and Van den Bulck showed unhealthy behavior with negative consequences, being diagnosed with skin cancer, whereas the characters in the stories of Jung Oh and LaRose showed healthy behavior with positive consequences, snacking fresh and nutritious food. With regard to the form of the narratives, the studies that found effects on behavior both used print narratives in the first-person perspective, whereas two of the studies that did not find effects on behavior, used narratives in the third-person perspective (Greene Dugan, Spencer, Burgwinkle, & Gurwitz, 2007). This result is in line with the results for beliefs and attitudes, suggesting that a first-person perspective in - creases the chance that persuasive effects are found. With regard to the context of the narratives, the studies that found effects differed. Jung Oh and LaRose (2015) pre - sented the materials after giving an implementation for -Characteristics of narrative interventions and health effects97 2016, 4, 88-131for the condition with a dissimilar participant (Lee & Bichard, 2006; McKinley, 2010). Both these studies ma - nipulated similarity by varying events that happened to the character. For instance, McKinley gave a description of the protagonist either as a college student who has typical college experiences or as an orphan who was raised by his older brother. This type of manipulation varied more than only character similarity, like the orphan character being more of an 'underdog', which could evoke more empathy. These additional differences may explain the findings. In sum, similarity of a character to recipients does not seem to be a very promising characteristic to increase persuasiveness of narratives. Only a character with a similar living location was found to lead to per - suasive effects. This type of similarity is related to the setting of a story, suggesting that perhaps familiarity of the setting is a more promising characteristic to make a narrative more persuasive than similarity of the characters. Framing. Another content characteristic that was tested in sev - eral studies combined variations of the character and the sequence of events. A character was either shown carry - ing out the healthy behavior that was promoted by the narrative, or a character was shown carrying out the unhealthy behavior that was discouraged, thus constitut - ing either a positive or a negative role model (Bandura, 2001). Showing the recommended or discouraged behav - ior was often combined with the outcomes of these actions in that positive role models experienced positive conse - quences of their healthy behavior, whereas negative role models experienced negative consequences of their un - healthy behavior. These variations were contrasted in studies that used a manipulation of gain vs. loss framing. This type of manipulation has been used extensively in studies about non-narrative health messages, in which a gain frame focuses on the benefits of engaging in a recom - mended behavior, whereas a loss frame focuses on the disadvantages of not engaging in this behavior (Updegraff & Rothman, 2013). Several studies have now also inves - tigated gain and loss frames in narratives (see Table 4 ). The results of the studies that compared a narrative that showed healthy behavior to a narrative that showed unhealthy behavior, were mixed. On one hand, Cox and Cox (2001) compared a narrative in which the protagonist lated to persuasive impact. However, the results also uncovered a wide variety of effects found using different narrative materials, making it hard to come to conclusions only on the basis of the analysis of studies comparing narrative to control groups. Another factor that may have influenced these results is the type of control group that was used. Some studies included a no message control group, in which participants were not exposed to any message, whereas other studies exposed participants in the control group to a non-narrative message. However, the non-narrative message may have had a persuasive effect as well (compared to no message), thus obscuring effects of the narrative and making it harder to identify which narrative characteristics are responsible for effects. Therefore, this analysis is complemented by a review of studies that manipulated narrative characteristics to pro - vide more evidence for promising narrative characteristics. Comparing Different Versions of Narratives: Content Similarity. Several studies compared versions of a narrative that differed on content characteristics like characters, events and setting. With regard to the characters, some studies tested the effects of similarity between character and recipient (see Table 3 ). Only two of the studies reported a higher persuasiveness for the condition with a similar participant (De Graaf, 2014; Knobloch, Zillmann, Gibson, & Karrh, 2002). Four studies found no differences between the similar and dissimilar conditions. With respect to the type of similarity that was manipulated, the studies that found effects seem to have focused more on the surround - ings of the characters. De Graaf (2014) manipulated whether participants were similar in their living situation (i.e. whether they lived in student housing or not), and Knobloch et al. (2002) manipulated whether the location that characters lived in was similar to participants' living location. This tentatively suggests that similarity of the place where characters live may be most effective in in - creasing persuasion, whereas other aspects, such as sim - ilarity in pre-existing health beliefs between characters and recipients (Dillard & Main, 2013), seem less effective. In contrast, two studies reported higher persuasiveness De Graaf, Sanders & Hoeken98 www .rcommunicationr.orgFor instance, Keer et al. (2013) found that including af - fective outcomes in a narrative increased persuasiveness compared to including instrumental outcomes in the narrative. On the other hand, the strategy of describing actual outcomes versus imagined outcomes did not affect narrative engagement or persuasive effects. Thus, it seems that descriptions of emotional experiences may be a prom - ising characteristic to increase persuasiveness, whereas it matters less whether outcomes are described as actual or imagined. Final observations on content. A final content characteristic that was manipulated in multiple studies was the level of responsibility the character had for their own health. The character could either be presented as being highly responsible for their own health status by deliberate actions, or as having low responsibility by having been influenced by factors out of their control, like government policies (see Table 6 ). Some studies found that the cause presented in the story had an effect on the belief about the cause of the health issue in general. For instance, Boiarsky, Rouner, and Long (2013) found that a protagonist who took personal respon - sibility for her illness led to higher individual cause beliefs for the illness in general. Niederdeppe, Kim, Lundell, Fazili, and Frazier (2012) showed that a narrative with a protagonist who held the community responsible for her health produced higher societal cause beliefs. However, several other studies found no effects on causal beliefs of a responsibility manipulation, or further attitudes and intentions. Only Jansen, Croonen, and de Stadler (2005) found an effect of an exemplar who had low responsibil - ity for contracting HIV on the attitude towards support - ing people with HIV. This finding could be related to the fact that Jansen et al.'s narrative was focused on the un - healthy behavior of contracting HIV, whereas for instance Niederdeppe, Shapiro, Kim, Bartolo, and Porticella (2014)'s narrative was focused on the healthy behavior of losing weight. In sum, the narrative characteristic of the level of character responsibility does not seem to have a consistent association to persuasiveness. Several other studies manipulated characteristics of the content, but these differed too much to review them systematically and find patterns in results. For instance, Chung and Slater (2013) varied whether a character was lived to see her grandchild grow up because she had an annual mammogram, to a narrative in which the pro - tagonist may die because she did not have an annual mammogram. They found that the loss frame led to more positive attitudes towards the recommended behavior (mammography) than the gain frame. On the other hand, Gray and Harrington (2011) compared a story in which exercising regularly led to positive consequences, to a story in which not exercising regularly led to negative consequences. Their results showed that the gain-framed narrative produced a more positive intention to exercise. Even studies with similar topics showed opposite results, as Wirtz and Kulpavaropas (2014) also used narratives to promote physical activity, but found that the loss frame was more persuasive than the gain frame, in contrast to the results of Gray and Harrington (2011) who addressed the similar topic of exercising. The lack of evidence for an advantage of either the gain or loss framed narratives contrasts to the results of the studies that compared narrative to control conditions, which suggested that showing the healthy behavior had a higher chance to produce effects. However, this result was specifically found for effects on intention. In the studies comparing gain and loss frames, intentions also seem to be influenced by gain frames more often. Perhaps showing the healthy behavior is a promising characteris - tic to increase intentions towards the behavior, but not to increase effectiveness on other outcome measures, such as beliefs and attitudes. Emotional outcomes. With regard to the sequence of events, the type of outcomes that were presented in the narrative could also play a role in narrative persuasion. Different studies tested the effects of different outcomes, but they had in common that they were related to the level of emotion that was expressed by the narrative. For instance, two studies compared actual outcomes to imagined outcomes (Appel & Richter, 2010; So & Nabi, 2013), with actual outcomes assumed to be more emotional than imagined outcomes. Therefore, they were termed high vs. low emo - tional (see Table 5 ). Results showed that in three studies, high emotional stories were more effective. The narrative materials in these studies expressed emotions by describ - ing emotional outcomes of health behaviors by characters. Characteristics of narrative interventions and health effects99 2016, 4, 88-131increased persuasiveness of a first-person narrative com - pared to a third-person version (Nan, Dahlstrom, Richards, & Rangarajan, 2015) and another of a second-person narrative compared to a third-person version (Houska, 2010). These results suggest that a third-person perspective has a lower chance to produce effects. However, there were no differences between the first- and third-person perspectives in another study (Meadows III, 2012), indi - cating that a first-person perspective does not always increase persuasive effects. This conclusion is in line with findings on the comparison between narrative to control conditions, in which first-person narratives were associ - ated with significant effects more often, even though it did not guarantee effectiveness. Message embedding. The way a message was embedded in a narrative was only investigated in three studies. Quintero Johnson, Harrison, and Quick (2013) used stories about avian flu and chlamydia in which there either was a high degree of integration between the narrative and the educational content or in which there was a high degree of distance between the narrative and educational content. In the high integration conditions, the story was about a char - acter that was afraid to be infected and went to the doctor to get checked for the disease, whereas in the low integra - tion conditions, the story was about a character that was running late for work while hearing information about the disease. Results showed that participants in the high integration conditions recalled more health information from the story than participants in the low integration conditions. However, further persuasive outcomes were not reported. Cohen (2012) varied message implication by either adding a conclusion scene in which four char - acters persuaded another character to become an organ donor or not to an episode of a crime drama in which organ donation was advocated by showing the black market for organs that was fueled by the shortage of organ donors. There were no direct effects of the conclusion scene on beliefs or intentions towards organ donation. However, Moyer-Gus\u00e9, Jain, and Chung (2012) used a similar manipulation of adding an explicit persuasive appeal by an actor to the end of an episode discouraging drinking and driving and found an effect on the attitude towards this behavior. Thus, there are no consistent a member of a highly stigmatized group or not, whereas Hoeken and Sinkeldam (2014, Study 1) manipulated the likability of a character. Even though both are character - istics of the narrative characters, they cannot be meaning - fully compared (see the references for a full list of the reports that were included in the review, marked with *). In addition, several studies addressed the effect of differ - ent distributions of multiple narratives. For instance, Ubel, Jepson, and Baron (2001) varied the number of testimonials from patients who had benefitted from a treatment versus those who had not. However, since this is not a characteristic of a narrative but of a combination of narratives, these manipulations are beyond the scope of this review. We will next turn to the effects of form characteristics of narratives. Comparing Different Versions of Narratives: Form Medium. An important aspect of the form of a narrative is the medium through which it is presented. Some studies compared different media within an experiment (see Table 7 ). Braverman (2008) compared printed narrative texts to audio versions of the same texts in three studies and found no differences between these media. Other studies found no differences between video and printed versions of narratives either on persuasive outcomes or on engagement variables. These studies included both videos that presented the same text as the printed version spoken by actors (e.g., Winterbottom, Bekker, Conner, & Mooney, 2012) and videos that used drama formats in which the narrative events were acted out (e.g., Luna Nevarez, 2013). These results indicate that medium is not likely to be a narrative characteristic that consistently influences persuasive effects. Perspective. A form characteristic that could be important for nar - rative persuasion by print narratives is the perspective through which the narrative is told. Only four studies compared narratives in different perspectives in a health- related context (see Table 8 ). One of the studies found De Graaf, Sanders & Hoeken100 www .rcommunicationr.orgin which information was given on how to perform the self-exam that was promoted by the narrative resulted in higher intentions to perform this exam (Morman, 2000). However, two other studies did not find effects of effi - cacy information (Kim, Bigman, Leader, Lerman, & Cappella, 2012; Knobloch-Westerwick & Sarge, 2015). Therefore, an efficacy message does not seem to be a promising way to increase persuasiveness of the narrative. Finally, a few studies manipulated other factors in the context of a health-related narrative. For instance, some studies tested the effect of labeling the story as fictional or factual, without finding indications of persuasive ef - fects (Caputo & Rouner, 2011; Green & Donahue, 2011). Other studies compared instructions that either encour - aged participants to become engaged in the story or not, and found inconsistent effects of these manipulations (Batson, Chang, Orr, & Rowland, 2002; Carpenter, 2013). In sum, there are no systematic indications of factors in the narrative context that are associated with persuasive - ness. Conclusion and Discussion This paper set out to review studies on health-related narrative persuasion research with a focus on the narra - tive stimuli to provide an overview of the different char - acteristics of narratives in health effects research and of the persuasive effects that were found. We looked at narrative characteristics on three levels: the content, the form and the context of the narrative. With regard to the content, the analysis of studies comparing narrative to non-narrative materials suggested that narratives that presented the healthy behavior were more often associ - ated with effects on the intention to carry out the healthy behavior than narratives that showed the unhealthy be - havior. The studies that compared narratives with a gain- frame in which the healthy behavior is presented to nar - ratives with a loss-frame in which the unhealthy behavior is presented, also suggested that an effect on intention occurred more often for the gain frame. However, it is important to note that this pattern of results was not found for other persuasive outcomes, like beliefs and attitudes. Therefore, the suggestion that presenting the healthy behavior seems to be a promising characteristic is only given for effects on intention. indications on how a message should be embedded in a narrative. Final observations on form. Another form characteristic that was manipulated in a few health-related narrative persuasion studies is the use of humor. The use of humor in a narrative can be distinguished from emotional outcomes because the out - comes are part of the narrative world in that they are emotional for characters, whereas humor is mainly ap - parent to the recipient. Weber, Martin, and Corrigan (2006) compared a public service announcement (PSA) about organ donation that used humor to advocate sign - ing of an organ donor card to a PSA that used a sad story to convey the same message. They found that the humor - ous PSA was more effective at getting recipients to sign an organ donor card than the sad PSA. However, Moyer-Gus\u00e9, Mahood, and Brookes (2011) tested the effect of a situation comedy about an unplanned pregnancy compared to the same episode with the pregnancy-related humor edited out. Results showed that intentions to engage in unprotected sex were higher when the original episode with pregnancy-related humor was viewed. Their results indicate that humor resulted in boomerang effects, since the health message implied by an unplanned pregnancy is to use protection. Thus, humor can be a risky narrative characteristic to use in conveying a health message. Other form characteristics like the presence of music (Costabile & Terman, 2013) or of freedom threatening language (Quick, Scott & Ledbetter, 2011) were only ad - dressed in single studies, making it impossible to review the results systematically. The final characteristic we focus on is the context in which the narrative is pre - sented. Comparing Different Versions of Narratives: Context No studies consistently varied the format in which a narrative was presented between for instance an advertis - ing context with explicit persuasive intent and an enter - tainment context with implicit persuasive intent. The only characteristic of the context that has been manipulated in multiple studies is the presence of an efficacy message (see Table 9 ). One study found that an efficacy message Characteristics of narrative interventions and health effects101 2016, 4, 88-131suasive intent (Dal Cin et al., 2004; Green & Brock, 2002), such covertness of persuasive intent does not seem to be necessary in studies on narrative health communication effects. There were also several narratives in an entertain - ment context that produced effects, showing that in the absence of clear persuasive intent, narratives can also be persuasive. However, when the context is overtly persua - sive, narratives can also produce effects. It is important to note that the review shows large variation in the results of health-related narrative persua - sion studies. Therefore, the suggestions about promising narrative characteristics are relative rather than absolute. The characteristics of narratives, like first-person perspec - tive and showing the healthy behavior, seem to be associ - ated with effects more often, but they do not guarantee effectiveness. That is why this review can best be seen as a starting point for further research on this topic. More research is necessary to identify when certain character - istics are effective (e.g., in relation to the target group or the health topic of the narrative). In other words, future research should identify moderators of effects of charac - teristics. For instance, in research on gain and loss frames in non-narrative health messages, it has been suggested that for recipients who perceive a health behavior as risky, loss frames are more effective, whereas for recipients who perceive a health behavior as less risky, gain frames are more effective (Updegraff & Rothman, 2013). It is war - ranted to study this in a narrative context as well, by varying the riskiness of the promoted behavior (e.g., HIV testing as risky for people who have had unprotected sex vs. less risky for people who have not) and testing wheth - er for people who perceive the behavior as risky, present - ing the unhealthy behavior with negative consequences is more effective, and for the people who perceive the behavior as less risky, presenting the healthy behavior with positive consequences is more effective. In addition, the results of this review show several gaps in the literature regarding health effects of narratives that should be filled with further research. With regard to the content, very few studies have investigated charac - teristics related to the setting of the narrative. Because the studies that found an effect of similarity of the pro - tagonist to the recipient seemed to be related to familiar - ity of the setting of the narrative, this is an important characteristic to conduct further research on. With regard to the form, no studies on health-related narrative persua -Content characteristics related to the characters, such as the number of characters and the similarity of charac - ters to the target group, were not found to have consistent effects. The only studies that showed effects of similarity addressed similarity in the surroundings of the characters, suggesting that familiarity of the setting may be more promising than other types of similarity. However, this was based on only two studies, which makes it necessary to explore this possibility more fully in future research. Another content characteristic that seemed promising in narrative persuasion is the expression of emotions in the narrative, by emotional adjectives and descriptions. This type of content increased persuasive effects in several studies. For a final content characteristic that was ma - nipulated in several studies, the level of responsibility of the character, the results were too inconsistent to draw clear conclusions. With regard to the form of the narrative, a first-person perspective came across as a promising characteristic in the studies comparing narratives to non-narratives. All print narratives that produced effects on story-consistent beliefs and attitudes used a first-person perspective. Even though not all studies that compared different perspec - tives found an advantage of the first-person perspective, none of these studies showed an advantage of the third- person perspective. Thus, a first-person perspective seems to be a promising characteristic of print narratives with regard to persuasiveness. The form characteristic of me - dium did not show promise as an influential factor in whether narratives have persuasive effects or not. There were consistently no differences between narratives pre - sented through different media, regardless of whether audiovisual narratives featured a character talking about their experiences or showed characters carrying out ac - tions and experiencing consequences. For other form characteristics like the integration of the health message in the narrative and the use of humor, not enough evidence was yet available to identify a pattern. Finally, with regard to the context, a notable pattern occurred. About half of the studies that found effects of a narrative compared to a non-narrative, used narratives in a clearly persuasive context like persuasive advertising or a session with a health educator. It is likely that re - cipients were aware of the persuasive intent of narratives in these contexts. Thus, even though it is sometimes as - sumed that narratives persuade because they mask per -De Graaf, Sanders & Hoeken102 www .rcommunicationr.orgspective, the results indicate that a third-person perspec - tive seems less likely to produce effects than both a first and a second-person perspective. It would also be interest - ing to compare a first-person to a second-person perspec - tive to test which of these forms is more promising. In addition, there is limited research on the role of perspec - tive in narratives with multiple main characters. Prior research has shown that varying the perspective in a narrative in which there are two opposing main characters has an impact on narrative persuasion in the context of social issues (De Graaf, Hoeken, Sanders, & Beentjes, 2012). The review that has been carried out in this study has several limitations. First, several factors that may have played a role were not analyzed. For instance, we did not address whether a study was published in a peer-reviewed journal or unpublished and found in outlets like a dis - sertation or conference paper. We made this choice to deal with the file drawer problem as well as we could, which means that studies that did not find an effect are less likely to be published. By including unpublished studies, we avoid drawing too positive conclusions (i.e., publica - tion bias), but rather give a nuanced picture of effects. In addition, factors like whether the design of the study was experimental or quasi-experimental, or whether the mea - sures were validated were not included. Even though these factors may be an indication of quality, they also limit the evidence base, which is why we chose to provide an overview of a wide range of studies. Another limitation is that moderated effects were not included in the review. Several studies found effects of a narrative for a particu - lar group of participants, but not for another group. How - ever, the moderators that were tested differed too much to provide a clarifying overview. This observation is in line with the choice to not include recipient and situation factors as explanatory factors in narrative effects in this review. For instance, the exclusion of studies with children of primary or secondary school age limits our conclusions to the college-aged and older groups that we have in - cluded. On the other hand, research with college samples may have limited generalizability to adult samples as well. Therefore, future research should test interactions between narrative characteristics and other factors, like the age of the participants to gain further insight into narrative ef - fects. A clear limitation is the fact that effect sizes were not sion have compared different orders of events (chrono - logical vs. non-chronological), even though this can influ - ence the emotions readers feel (Brewer & Liechtenstein, 1982) and thus may be hypothesized to produce effects. The lack of research on the effects of chronological vs. non-chronological presentation is a research gap that presents an interesting avenue for further research. In addition, only some studies have been conducted that address the way a health message is embedded in a nar - rative. In research on non-health-related narrative persua - sion, it has been shown that it is important whether the persuasive message is integrated in the causal structure of the narrative or not (Dahlstrom, 2010; 2012), showing that it is relevant to study this for health narratives as well. With regard to the context, a presentation format with different levels of persuasive intent has not been addressed in health-related narrative persuasion studies. It is important to directly compare different contexts, for instance between a narrative in an advertising context and an entertainment context, so that it can be tested whether a perception of persuasive intent has effects on engagement, resistance, and ultimately persuasive effects. The results regarding the frame of the narrative also provide interesting avenues for further research. In ana - lyzing the narrative materials used, it became apparent that some of the versions did not present a pure gain or loss frame, but rather showed a transition of the character from unhealthy to healthy behavior. Such a combination of frames may be especially beneficial (see Bandura, 2001). To study this possibility, research should compare a pure gain frame only showing the healthy behavior and a pure loss frame only showing the unhealthy behavior to a transitional frame in which the character shows both types of behavior. In addition, analyzing the narratives used in the studies comparing narrative to control conditions showed that some narratives presented the healthy behav - ior without a focus on consequences. For instance, Dillard et al. (2010) used a testimonial about a person deciding to have a colonoscopy, but did not include information on the health outcome of whether colon cancer was de - tected early or not. Narratives that showed the unhealthy behavior did consistently focus on negative health out - comes of this behavior. These observed differences make it interesting to study whether showing the behavior or presenting consequences is more important for narrative persuasion. With regard to the form characteristic per -Characteristics of narrative interventions and health effects 103 2016, 4, 88-131that analyzed direct effects to ensure comparability be - tween studies. Therefore, it would be good practice to report direct effects of manipulations in an experiment in addition to indirect effects. In conclusion, this review has shown a large amount of variation in the narratives that were used to convey a health message and the effects that were found in narra - tive persuasion research. Narratives as diverse as episodes of entertainment programs as well as print testimonials and stories told by a health educator in a face-to-face set - ting produced effects on beliefs, attitudes, intentions and even behavior of recipients. Within this diversity, certain patterns could be identified, suggesting that showing the healthy behavior and using a first-person perspective are promising narrative characteristics. In addition, the fa - miliarity of the setting and the presentation format of the narrative are characteristics that should be investigated further. In this way, the diversity in characteristics and effects invites future research on health-related narrative persuasion. Hopefully, the present review supports a continued research effort on the role of narrative charac - teristics in health effects.statistically compared as in a meta-analysis. The aim of this review was to give a complete overview of different types of studies on health-related narrative persuasion. Studies that compared narratives to control conditions cannot be combined with studies that compared different versions of a narrative in one meta-analysis. In addition, a considerable amount of studies did not include enough information for effect size calculation, which would have severely limited the number of studies we could include in our review. However, now that promising narrative characteristics have been identified on the basis of a large base of studies, an interesting next step is to carry out a meta-analysis testing the effects of these narrative char - acteristics. Finally, a review largely depends on the stud - ies it includes. Another limitation that we encountered was that a considerable amount of studies did not include the results relevant for this review. Quite some studies compared different versions of a narrative and measured persuasive outcomes, but did not include tests of the direct effects on these variables, because indirect effects were the focus of the report.
