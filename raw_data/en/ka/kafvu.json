Obviously not - because a new one is about to emerge. In mid-January, [THE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE AND INTEGRATED HEALTH](https://collegeofmedicine.org.uk/a-very-happy-christmas-from-the-college-of-medicine-as-we-prepare-to-publish-our-10-year-manifesto-hope-for-the-future/) (COMIH) will launch the [Integrated Medicine Alliance](https://collegeofmedicine.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d27ed46c970632b6ab9ada14d&id=39a824a7bd&e=87fb6f5923) bringing together the leaders of many complementary health organisations to provide patients, clinicians and policy makers with information on the various complementary modalities, which will be needed in a post COVID-19 world, where: - patient choice is better respected, - requirements for evidence of efficacy are more proportionate to the seriousness of the disease and the safety of the intervention, - and where benefit versus risk are better balanced. We already saw this in 2020 with the College advocating from the very beginning of the year that people should think about taking Vitamin D, while the National Institute for Clinical Excellence continued to say the evidence was insufficient, but the Secretary of State has now supported it being given to the vulnerable on the basis of the balance between cost, benefit and safety. Elsewhere we learn more about the [Integrated Medicine Alliance](https://collegeofmedicine.org.uk/ima/) (IMA): The IMA is a group of organisations and individuals that have been brought together for the purpose of encouraging and optimising the best use of complementary therapies alongside conventional healthcare for the benefit of all. The idea for this group was conceived by Dr Michael Dixon in discussion with colleagues associated with the College of Medicine, and the initial meeting to convene the group was held in February 2019. The group transitioned through a number of titles before settling on the 'Integrated Medicine Alliance' and began work on developing a patient leaflet and a series of information sheets on the key complementary therapies. It was agreed that in the first instance the IMA should exist under the wing of the College of Medicine, but that in the future it may develop into a formal organisation in its own right, but inevitably maintaining a close relationship with the College of Medicine. The IMA also offers 'INFORMATION SHEETS' those leaflets revealing. They tell us, for example that the Reiki practitioner channels universal energy through their hands to help rebalance each of the body's energy centres, known as chakras. About homeopathy, we learn that a large corpus of evidence has accumulated which stands the most robust tests of modern science. And about naturopathy, we learn that it includes ozone therapy but is perfectly safe. Just for the fun of it - and free of charge - let me try to place a few corrections here: - Reiki healers use their hands to perform what is little more than a party trick. - The universal energy they claim to direct does not exist. - The body does not have energy centres. - Chakras are a figment of imagination. - The corpus of evidence on homeopathy is by no means large. - The evidence is flimsy. - The most robust tests of modern science fail to show that homeopathy is effective beyond placebo. - Naturopathy is a hotchpotch of treatments most of which are neither natural nor perfectly safe. One does wonder who writes such drivel for the COMIH, and one shudders to think what else the IMA might be up to. "}
