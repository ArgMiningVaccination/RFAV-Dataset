Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Valmet The COVID-19 pandemic impacted Valmet's operations during the first half of the year. COVID-19 related travel restrictions and lower capacity utilization in graphical paper mills impacted Services' business environment. Many customers restricted access to their sites, which led to disturbances especially in field services and mill improvement projects. Also the Automation business line was negatively impacted by access restrictions to some customer sites. The Pulp and Energy, and Paper business lines have managed challenges caused by COVID-19 well, and therefore the pandemic has not caused major impacts on the capital business. The organization has performed well under the new circumstances and found new ways to operate, which can be utilized to improve Valmet's and customers' processes also after the pandemic. For example, the increased use of Industrial Internet and remote connections resulted in lower travel expenses in January-June. On November 24, 2020, Valmet announced that due to financial and production related reasons, especially because of the decreasing workload, the company was to start co- determination negotiations for temporary lay-offs in Finland on November 24, 2020. The employees under negotiations were Services business line's employees in Finland and the employees of the EMEA area organization in Finland. The lay-offs were estimated to last up to 90 days at maximum and to concern around 360 employees. On December 2, 2020, Valmet announced that the co-determination negotiations have been completed, and as a result altogether 372 employees, 227 in the Services business line and 145 employees in the EMEA area organization in Finland were to be temporarily laid-off due to low workload. The lay-offs concerned all employee groups. The lay-offs were to be implemented until the end of April, 2021, and the scope and length of a lay-off varied up to 90 days at maximum per person.

Valmet has an annual strategy process, where, among others, Valmet's strategy, Must-Wins and financial targets are reviewed. Valmet's financial targets are the following: Financial targets Net sales for stable business to grow over two times the market growth Net sales for capital business to exceed market growth Comparable EBITA: 10-12% Comparable return on capital employed (pre-tax), ROCE: at least 20% Dividend payout at least 50% of net profit Continued focus on improving profitability Valmet continues to focus on improving profitability through various actions in e.g. sales process management, project management and project execution, in procurement and quality, as well as in technology and R&D. To improve sales process management, Valmet is focusing on key account management and analyzing the customers' share of wallet.

Valmet is continuously improving its project management and project execution by training personnel and implementing a Valmet-wide project execution model. By focusing on improving project management and execution, Valmet is targeting continuous improvement of gross profit. Valmet has set a long-term savings target for procurement. In order to decrease procurement costs, Valmet is focusing on design-to-cost and adding supplier involvement through supplier Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2021 | 16relationship management. Valmet has also set a target for quality cost savings and is adding focus on root cause analysis of quality deviations. Furthermore, Valmet is continuing to adopt the Lean principles and methodology. Valmet is constantly focusing on new technologies and R&D to improve product cost competitiveness and performance. The renewal of Valmet's ERP system will increase efficiency once implemented. Progress in sustainability During the first half of 2021, Valmet progressed with the actions defined in its Sustainability360 agenda. In March, Valmet introduced its climate program - Forward to a carbon neutral future - in the company's Capital Markets Day. The program has received excellent feedback from stakeholders, and the program's concrete actions have proceeded well across the value chain, including Valmet's own operations, the supply chain, and the use of Valmet's technologies by its customers. The progress of the actions will be reported in more detail in the end of the year. In July, the climate program's targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, which means that the targets are based on the latest climate science and in line with the Paris Climate Agreement's 1.5-degree pathway. During 2021, Valmet has continued to develop its climate-related financial disclosures according to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting recommendations. In line with TCFD's recommendations, Valmet has also published a scenario analysis of how climate change will potentially affect its operations and business environment by 2030. Valmet continued to further strengthen its sustainable supply chain by conducting ten supplier sustainability audits globally, seven in China, one in India and two remotely in South America. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, Valmet has not yet continued sustainability audits in other areas. Valmet's target is to conduct at least 40 sustainability audits by the end of 2021. During the first half of 2021 Valmet ran its core people processes. The Annual Review process, which includes a review of past performance, development planning, and target setting, was completed by 98 percent of white-collar employees. The annual salary planning process was run in line with Valmet's remuneration principles of driving high performance, competitive remuneration to retain talent with the best fit, and fairness and sustainability. Valmet is committed to a strong pay-for-performance culture for its employees throughout the whole organization. The Talent Review process, which helps strengthen Valmet's successor pool and develop talent, was completed for around 8,300 employees and identified 2,885 successor candidates. A new work-life integration approach was also launched, focusing on six core areas: staying connected, adapting to change, managing workload, professional growth, life goals and healthy lifestyle. At the end of June, Valmet's lost time incident frequency rate (LTIF) for own employees was 1.4 (1.8 at the end of June 2020) and the total recordable incident frequency rate (TRIF) for own employees was 3.2 (3.6 at the end of June 2020). Valmet also continued preventive and protective measures as part of its global COVID-19 management activities. Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2021 | 17Lost time incident frequency (LTIF)1 and total recordable incident frequency (TRIF)2, own employees LTIF, rolling 12 of injuries resulting in an absence of at least one work day per million hours worked. 2LTIF + medical treatment and restricted work cases Lawsuits and claims Several lawsuits, claims and disputes based on various grounds are pending against Valmet in various countries, including product liability lawsuits and claims as well as legal disputes related to Valmet's deliveries. Valmet is also a plaintiff in several lawsuits. Valmet announced on December 22, 2016, that it has received a reassessment decision from the Finnish tax authority for Valmet Technologies Inc. The reassessment decision is a result of a tax audit carried out in the company, concerning tax years 2010-2012. During the first quarter 2017 Valmet paid additional taxes, late payment interests and penalties in total of EUR 19 million related to the reassessment decision. Valmet considers the Finnish tax authority's decision unfounded and has appealed of the decision. Valmet's management does not expect to the best of its present understanding that the outcome of these lawsuits, claims and disputes will have a material adverse effect on Valmet in view of the grounds currently presented for them, provisions made, insurance coverage in force and the extent of Valmet's total business activities. Corporate Governance Statement and Remuneration Report Valmet has published a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2020, which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies.

As at June 30, 2021 , Valmet's Board of Directors had not used the authorizations given by the Annual General meeting on March 23, 2021. Share-based incentive plans Valmet's share-based incentive plans are part of the remuneration program for Valmet's key personnel. The aim of the plans is to align the interests of the shareholders and the key employees in order to increase the value of Valmet in the long run, to steer the key employees towards achieving the Company's selected strategic targets, to commit the key employees to the Company, and to offer them a competitive reward plan based on holding the Company's shares. Any shares to be potentially awarded are, or have been, acquired through public trading, and therefore the incentive plans have no diluting effect on the share value. Long-term incentive plan 2018-2020 In December 2017, the Board of Directors of Valmet Oyj approved a long-term share-based incentive plan for Valmet's key employees. The plan included three performance periods, which were the calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Valmet's Board of Directors decided on the performance criteria and targets in the beginning of each performance period. The plan was directed to approximately 130 participants (including Executive Team members, key employees and management talents).

Long-term incentive plan 2021-2023 In its meeting on December 17, 2020, the Board of Directors of Valmet Oyj decided on new share-based long-term incentive plans, a Performance Share Plan and a Deferred Share Plan, for Valmet's key employees. Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan is directed to the Executive Team members. It includes a three- year performance period parallel to a one-year performance period. Valmet's Board of Directors decides on the predefined performance measures and targets in the beginning of each performance period.

More information about share-based incentive plans can be found in Valmet's Remuneration Report, which is available at www.valmet.com/governance .

In respect of the approval of the Remuneration Report 2020, the majority of votes objected to the approval of the Remuneration Report. The decision is advisory. Valmet will further analyze the voting recommendations and voting results in order to ensure that the remuneration report will better meet the shareholders' expectations.

Per Lindberg was elected as a new Board member. The term of office of the members of the Board of Directors expires at the close of the Annual General Meeting 2022. PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy was elected as the Company's auditor for a term expiring at the end of the next Annual General Meeting. Valmet published a stock exchange release on March 23, 2021, concerning the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting and the organizing meeting of the Board of Directors. The stock exchange release and meeting materials can be viewed on Valmet's website at www.valmet.com/agm . In compliance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting, on April 7, 2021, Valmet paid out dividends of EUR 135 million, corresponding to EUR 0.90 per share. Risks and business uncertainties Valmet's operations are affected by various strategic, financial, operational and hazard risks. Valmet takes measures to exploit emerging opportunities and to limit the adverse effects of potential threats. The assessment of risks related to sustainable development holds an important role in risk management. If such threats materialized, they could have material adverse effects on Valmet's business, financial situation and operating result, or on the value of shares and other securities. The objective of Valmet's risk management is to ensure the implementation of an effective and successful strategy for achieving both long- and short-term goals. The task of Valmet's management is to regulate risk appetite. Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2021 | 23In assessing risks, Valmet takes into consideration the probability of the risks and their estimated impact on net sales and financial results. Valmet's management estimates that the Company's overall risk level is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of its operations and the practical measures available for managing these risks. Financial uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with fluctuations in exchange rates and tightening financial market regulations, may have an adverse effect on the availability of financing from banks and capital markets and could reduce the investment appetite of Valmet's customers. Valmet estimates that the high proportion of business derived from stable business (Services and Automation) and the geographical diversification will reduce the possible negative effects that market uncertainties may have. If global economic growth weakens, it might have adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in the order backlog. Some projects may be postponed, suspended, or canceled. In the case of long-term delivery projects, initial customer advance payments are typically 10-30 percent of the value of the project, and customers make progress payments as the project is implemented. This significantly decreases the risks and financing requirements related to Valmet's projects. Valmet continually assesses its customers' creditworthiness and their ability to meet their obligations. As a rule, Valmet does not finance customer projects. If economic growth slows down significantly, the markets for Valmet's products may shrink, which may lead to, for example, tougher price competition. Changes and uncertainty in future regulation and legislation can also have critical effects, especially on the energy business. Large fluctuations in energy prices can affect the global economy. These fluctuations can also affect Valmet and its customers, especially in the energy business. Changes in labor costs and the prices of raw materials and components can affect Valmet's profitability. Wage inflation is continuing, but Valmet's goal is to offset this at least partly through increased productivity and strict price discipline. It is possible, however, that tough competition in some product categories will make it difficult to pass on cost increases to product prices. On the other hand, some of Valmet's customers are raw material producers and their ability to operate and invest may be enhanced by strengthening commodity prices and hampered by declining commodity prices. To ensure a high level of quality in both production and services, it is important to sustain a high level of competence and talent availability. This includes, for example, maintaining efficient recruitment programs, utilization of existing talent and sharing knowledge globally. Through acquisitions, Valmet may become exposed to risks associated with new markets and business environments. The actual acquisition process also includes risks. Other risks associated with acquisitions include, but are not limited to, integration of the acquired business, increased financial risk exposure, retention of key personnel and achieving the targets set for the acquired business. Management of project business risks important An important part of Valmet's business consists of project business. Pulp business projects in particular can be large, thus project-specific risk management is crucial. Key risks related to projects are project cost estimation, scheduling, project risk management, quality and performance risks, and materials management risks. Risk analysis shall, as a minimum, take place for all significant project quotations. The work concerning threat and opportunity Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2021 | 24assessment continues during the execution phase of the project. Risk management is based on careful planning and continuous, systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project risks are managed by improving and continuously developing project management processes and the related systems. There may be changes in the competitive situation of Valmet's individual businesses, such as the emergence of new, cost-effective competition in the markets. Valmet can safeguard its market position by developing its products and services, and through good customer service and local presence. Availability of financing crucial Securing the continuity of Valmet's operations requires sufficient available funding under all circumstances. Valmet estimates that its liquid cash assets and committed credit limits are sufficient to secure its immediate liquidity and to ensure the flexibility of financing. The average maturity of Valmet's non-current debt, excluding lease liabilities, is 3.2 years . Loan facilities include customary covenants, and Valmet is in clear compliance with the covenants at the balance sheet date. Net working capital and capital expenditure levels have a key impact on the adequacy of Valmet's financing. Setting aside investments into the renewal of the ERP system, Valmet does not expect any significant increase in annual capital expenditure and estimates that it is well-positioned to keep capital expenditure at the level of total depreciation. Of the financial risks that affect Valmet's profit, currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial. Exchange rate changes can affect Valmet's business, although the wide geographical scope of the Company's operations reduces the impact of any individual currency. Economic insecurity typically increases exchange rate fluctuations. Valmet hedges its currency exposures linked to firm delivery and purchase agreements. Changes in legislation and the way authorities interpret regulation, for example regarding taxation, can also have an impact on Valmet's financials. As at June 30, 2021 , Valmet had EUR 716 million (EUR 687 million ) of goodwill on its statement of financial position. Valmet assesses the carrying value of its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable. Valmet has not identified any indications of impairment during the reporting period. The principles used for impairment testing are presented in the Financial Statements. The COVID-19 pandemic Depending on the success in suppressing the COVID-19 pandemic and in case the outbreak will be further prolonged, there could be further adverse impact on Valmet's operations, customer investment activity, project deliveries, supply chain and availability of financing for both Valmet and its customers. Epidemic outbreaks and potential other pandemics remain a heightened risk to Valmet's operations also after COVID-19. Pandemics might have impact on the supply chain and business operations by increasing the likelihood of interruptions. Valmet's operations are scattered all around the world, we have a global customer base and our suppliers operate in several countries. This mitigates the overall impacts of risks to Valmet, should there be any disruptions in some isolated country or case. Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2021 | 25Valmet currently has a solid order backlog, strong balance sheet and liquidity coupled with a flexible organization, and a structured way to operate in changing circumstances. This will support Valmet in mitigating the global challenges caused by COVID-19 and other pandemics. Valmet has also a Global Incident Management Team (IMT), and regional and local IMT structure established to manage Valmet's response to pandemics. Events after the reporting period On July 1, 2021, Valmet announced that it has completed the acquisition of EWK Umwelttechnik GmbH and ECP Group Oy following the agreements that were announced on June 10, 2021. EWK Umwelttechnik is a German company manufacturing and supplying air emission control systems and after-installation services. The company employs approximately 50 employees and had net sales of approximately EUR 22 million in 2020. ECP Group is a manufacturer and maintainer of electrostatic precipitators (ESP), focusing on power plants and pulp and paper industry, in Finland. Net sales of ECP Group were approximately EUR 6 million in 2020 and it employs around 20 employees. EWK Umwelttechnik and ECP Group will be included in Valmet's financial reporting for the first time in Valmet's third quarter financial reporting 2021. EWK Umwelttechnik became a part of Valmet's Pulp and Energy business line. ECP Group will be reported under Valmet's Services business line. On July 2, 2021, Valmet announced that the Boards of Directors of Valmet Oyj and Neles Corporation have signed a combination agreement and a merger plan to combine the two companies through a merger. The combination is subject to, among other items, approval by a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast and shares represented at the respective Extraordinary General Meetings of Valmet and Neles, and the obtaining of merger control and other regulatory approvals. The completion is expected to occur on or about January 1, 2022, subject to all conditions for completion being fulfilled. There have been no other subsequent events after the review period that required recognition or disclosure. Guidance for 2021 Valmet reiterates its guidance issued on April 16, 2021, in which Valmet estimates that net sales in 2021 will increase in comparison with 2020 (EUR 3,740 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2021 will increase in comparison with 2020 (EUR 365 million). Market outlook General economic outlook according to OECD The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cast a long shadow over the world's economies. Prospects for the global economy have improved, but to a different extent across economies. In the advanced economies, the progressive rollout of an effective vaccine has begun to allow more contact-intensive activities to reopen gradually. At the same time, additional fiscal stimulus is helping to boost demand, reduce spare capacity and lower the risks of sizeable long-term scarring from the pandemic. However, in many emerging-market economies, slow vaccination deployment, further infection outbreaks, and associated containment measures, will continue to hold down growth for some time. Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2021 | 26The world economy has now returned to pre-pandemic activity levels, but will remain short of what was expected prior to the crisis by end-2022. OECD forecasts global GDP to rise by 5.75 per cent in 2021 and close to 4.5 per cent in 2022. (OECD Economic Outlook, May 31, 2021) Short-term market outlook Valmet estimates that the short-term market outlook for services has improved to good/ satisfactory (previously satisfactory). Valmet reiterates the good short-term market outlook for automation, pulp, board and paper, and tissue and the weak market outlook for energy.

The business combination accounting for the acquisition of PMP Group was finalized on June 30, 2021.

Reporting segments and geographic information The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the President and CEO of Valmet. Valmet's four business lines are highly integrated through complementing product and service offerings and joint customer projects. Thus, the operations and profitability of Valmet is reported as a single reportable segment with the key operative decisions being made by the CODM at the Valmet Group level. The performance of the Group is reviewed by the CODM. One key indicator of performance reviewed is Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA). Performance is also assessed through Comparable EBITA, i.e. with EBITA excluding certain items of income and expense that reduce the comparability of the Group's performance from one period to another. The alternative performance measures of EBITA and Comparable EBITA are published by Valmet as part of regulated financial information to enable users of the financial information to prepare more meaningful analysis on Valmet's performance. Items affecting comparability consist of income and expenses arising from activities that amend the capacity of Valmet's operations, such as restructuring costs, and gains or losses on sale of businesses or non-current assets, and income and expenses incurred outside Valmet's normal course of business, such as impairment charges and income and expenses recorded as a result of settlement payments to/from third parties (e.g. penalties incurred as a result of tax audits or settlements to closed law suits) as well as income and expenses arising from changes in legislation expected to affect Valmet temporarily only (e.g. customs or other tariffs imposed by authorities on Valmet's products).

Paper, and Pulp and Energy business lines' revenue is derived from large long- term capital projects, for which revenue is mostly recognized over time based on the cost-to- cost method. Service business line's revenue arises from large volume of short-term contracts with relatively low individual value, for which revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time. Automation business line's revenue consists of long-term contracts and short-term service contracts. The nature of long-term contracts, and therefore also the revenue recognition method, is similar to capital projects although with average contract values being lower. Revenue for short-term service contracts is recognized at a point in time. Nature of revenue in each area in any given reporting period is driven by volume and size of ongoing capital projects.

During the reporting period Valmet had not entered into any material contracts where the period between when Valmet transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or more. Neither were there any ongoing projects from previous reporting periods for which the former would apply. The creditworthiness of a customer is verified before entering into a contract. However, if a risk of non-payment arises after contract inception, the probability of collection of consideration is re-evaluated and if assessed improbable, recognition of revenue is discontinued. An allowance for non-collectability of open receivables and contract assets is established as concluded appropriate. Valmet receives payments from customers based on invoicing schedules as set out in the customer contracts. Changes in contract assets and liabilities are due to Valmet's performance under the contracts. Amounts due from customers under revenue contracts primarily relate to Valmet's right to consideration for work completed but not yet invoiced at the reporting date. These assets are transferred to trade receivables when right to consideration becomes unconditional, which is typically at the time when Valmet has contractual right to issue an invoice. Significant part of amounts due to customers relate to advance consideration received from customers in long-term capital contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These amounts are recognized as revenue as (or when) Valmet performs under the contracts. Following tables provide specification of movements in amounts due from customers under revenue contracts and amounts due to customers under revenue contracts over the reporting period. Revenue recognized in the period also includes revenue recognized related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods, the amount of which however is insignificant.

Valmet does not issue service-type warranties. As at June 30, 2021 , Valmet had no costs to obtain or fulfill contracts capitalized under IFRS 15.
