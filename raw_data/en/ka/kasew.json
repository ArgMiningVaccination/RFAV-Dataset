Funding is recommended for and allocated among Texas State Technical Colleges (TSTCs) based on the additional direct and indirect state tax revenues generated as a result of the education provided to students by the TSTCs. The funding methodology is based on the following components: a. The model includes the cohort of TSTC graduates (earning an associate's degrees or certificate), transfers, and leavers (students who were not found in Texas higher education for two years following the last time they were enrolled in the TSTC) with a minimum completion of nine semester credit hours from 2012 and 2013. b. The cohorts were matched with Unemplo yment Insurance wage records for employment and wage information for five years after the students graduated from or left the TSTC to establish annual wages for each student. Direct value- added was defined as the incremental state tax revenue attributable to former TSTC students' jobs, based on the difference between former TSTC students' annual wages and a base wage representing a full -time employee earning minimum wage (7 percent of the wage delta). Indirect value- added was defined as the direct value- added multiplied by 1.5, an economic multiplier derived from a U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis study. Total direct and indirect values -added were summed for each group of students by campus across five years. c. Values -added were reduced by a certain percentage, based on the assumption that the benefits would accrue both to the state and TSTCs but with only a portion of the added value included in the formula calculations. d. Values -added by campus were divided into the total TSTC value added to define each institution's proportional share of overall formula funding. The Texas State Technical College System shall continue to work with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the Legislative Budget Board a nd other relevant agencies to refine the new Returned Value Funding Formula for the TSTCs. It is the intent of the Legislature that recommended adjustments to the formula shall be ready for implementation in the 2024 -25 biennium and shall further the goal of rewarding job placement and graduate earnings projections, not time in training or contact hours. 12. Small Institution Supplement. The Small Institution Supplement, as a set -aside within the General Academic Institution Infrastructure Formula, shal l provide supplemental funding to the Texas State Technical Colleges with headcounts of fewer than 10,000 students. For the 2022 -2023 biennium, Texas State Technical Colleges with a headcount of fewer than 5,000 students shall SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING ONLY TO COMPONENTS OF TEXAS STATE TECHNICAL COLLEGE (Continued) AS21 -Conf -3-D III-232 May 22, 2021 receive a small institution s upplement of $1,316,566. The small institution supplement shall decrease proportionate to the increase in headcount above 5,000 until the institution reaches 10,000 headcount. Once an institution reaches 10,000 headcount, it shall no longer be eligible for this supplement.

The minimum formula shall generate additional funding per student, on a sliding scale, with programs with small enrollments receiving m ore additional funding per student. 2. Infrastructure Support Formula. Funding to the health related institutions for plant support and utilities shall be distributed by the infrastructure support formula which is driven by the predicted square feet for t he health related institutions produced by the Space Projection Model developed by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. The rate per square foot is $5.58 in fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023 for all health related institutions. Because the Space Projection Model does not account for hospital space, separate infrastructure funding for hospital space at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and The University of Texas Health S cience Center at Tyler shall be included in the total funding for hospital and center operations. 3. Research Funding. The health related institutions shall retain 100 percent of indirect research costs recovered on grants. Each institution also receives research enhancement funding of $1,412,500 plus 0.93 percent in fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023 of its research expenditures as reported to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. 4.
