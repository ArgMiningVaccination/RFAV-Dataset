It was designed as a comprehensive dietary supplement to be combined with a healthy balanced diet for lifelong vitality and wellness.* Studies show that very few people meet the Recommended Dietary Intakes (RDIs) for most vitamins and minerals\u2014even those with a healthy and balanced diet. The food nutrient complex includes a balanced blend of essential antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E, and an energy complex of B vitamins presented in a patented glycoprotein matrix. For those who may have difficulty or digestive discomfort with nutritional supplements, it also contains a full spectrum digestive enzyme blend and doTERRA's tummy tamer botanical blend of Peppermint, Ginger, and Caraway for efficient digestion.* Trying to get the RDIs of all 26 essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements (micronutrients) from foods alone is next to impossible, even if you eat a wholesome, balanced diet. Fruits and vegetables are rich in these micronutrients, plus they contain important phytonutrients (carotenoids, polyphenols, essential oils, etc.), but hardly anybody eats enough fruits and vegetables and even fewer eat them in their whole unprocessed form. For the 9 out of 10 adults who are not currently meeting RDIs, supplementing with a multivitamin and mineral complex is a necessity for optimum health and wellness.* What Makes Microplex VMz Unique? Microplex VMz provides a lot of benefits over other conventional multivitamins found in the supplement industry. One of the primary issues with nutritional supplements is bioavailability\u2014the fraction of the ingested amount that is absorbed and reaches systematic circulation. Microplex VMz includes a patented glycoprotein matrix, which introduces the food-derived vitamins and minerals to a culture of yeast or lactobacillus so that it is more recognized in the digestive process. The vitamins and minerals contained in Microplex VMz are efficiently used within the body, instead of being excreted through the urine.* The trend today in dietary supplements is megavitamins, or products that offer synthetic vitamins and minerals in doses far exceeding recommended guidelines. This trend is interesting because a higher dosage does not generally offer more benefits; many vitamins and minerals are even toxic at high levels, and may simply result in your body having to work harder to expel the excess. Microplex VMz is designed to work with your diet to meet RDIs without risk of toxicity or waste. When it comes to taking dietary supplements, digestive discomfort often becomes an issue. Many people cannot take dietary supplements due to digestive concerns, which leaves them lacking in certain vitamins and minerals. Microplex VMz includes a full spectrum of digestive enzymes and doTERRA's tummy tamer blend to ease possible digestive discomfort\u2014something that is not always found in other supplements throughout the industry.* Microplex VMz Benefits 1. Microplex VMz provides 22 essential vitamins and minerals to support normal growth, functioning, and maintenance of cells.* It provides highly bioavailable vitamins and minerals in optimum amounts for lifelong health and vitality.* 2. This blend also fights free radicals with the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E.* Organisms degrade over time because cells experience free radical damage. The included antioxidants help the body deal with free radicals and oxidative stress.* 3. Looking to support a healthy metabolism and cellular energy? The vitamins and minerals in Microplex VMz are designed to synergistically support healthy metabolic function and cellular energy for those looking to maintain a healthy metabolism and sustain cellular energy in the body.* 4. Another benefit of Microplex VMz is that it can support healthy immune function.* A healthy immune system is one of the most important factors in lifelong health, and it is important to protect the body, especially when seasonal or environmental threats are high. Microplex VMz provides the vitamins and minerals necessary for nutritional support of the immune system for those who are concerned about boosting and protecting immunity.* 5. Microplex VMz is also useful for promoting healthy bones.* It supports bone health with calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D.* The blend provides 500mg of calcium, 150mg of magnesium, 15mg of zinc, and 800 IU of vitamin D to help maintain optimal bone health at any age.* 6. While other supplements might include toxins or fillers, Microplex VMz includes a balanced blend of only minerals including calcium, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, and vanadium. 7. Although Microplex VMz is a strong supplement on its own, it has been specially formulated to be used daily with [xEO Mega\u00ae ](/US/en/p/xeo-mega) and [Alpha CRS+\u00ae](/US/en/p/alpha-crs-plus) as a comprehensive dietary supplement. This combination will help any healthy person set the foundation for a lifetime of vitality and wellness.* 8. For those with dietary restrictions or allergies, it can be difficult to find a supplement that fits your needs. Thankfully, the ingredients of Microplex VMz offer a helpful solution for those who have specific supplement needs. 9. This special formula has also been designed to work with your own diet to meet, not exceed, Recommended Daily Intakes. As mentioned, many other supplements tend to provide higher dosages, but this doesn't always result in bigger or better benefits. Highly bioavailable sources of vitamins and minerals, in precise amounts, means less waste and risk for toxicity. 10. Another common problem among supplements is that many formulas are not designed to help the body absorb the nutrients, so many of the ingredients are wasted or excreted. With Microplex VMz, enhanced bioavailability through a patented glycoprotein matrix means your body absorbs more of the nutrients it takes in.* 11. As mentioned, unlike other supplements, Microplex VMz is ideal for those who often struggle digestive distress.* Microplex VMz offers a whole-food botanical blend of black pepper, chamomile, fennel seeds, rose hips and organic trace minerals for better absorption and less digestive stress.* How to Take Microplex VMz Adults, take 4 vegetable capsules per day, with food. Microplex VMz is formulated to be used daily with Alpha CRS+ and xEO Mega. (Taking with the fatty acids in xEOMega will support absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins in Microplex VMz).
