That's almost always because of some underlying inflammation happening in the body. Why Does It Occur? If you have an injury or infection, your body needs inflammation to help get it under control. The body starts an inflammatory process; it peaks and slowly comes down. For many people, they experience that process that goes up and stays there and never comes back down, and that is a problem that happens for a few reasons: #1. Our immune system isn't functioning properly and has dysfunction that prevents inflammation (and associated pain) from coming back down. #2. Unhealthy habits. Many people are stuck in an inflammatory state for years or decades (e.g. arthritis sufferers). One of the most common things people are doing that causes them to be stuck in that state is eating inflammatory foods. The Top 3 Dietary Culprits White processed sugar is by far the biggest offending \"food.\" If you eat any, it can cause an inflammatory process that can last weeks to months. The second is dairy (not eggs), but milk products such as ice cream, cheese, and yogurt. Cow's milk doesn't belong to the human body, as it produces mucus and is loaded with estrogen. Wheat comes in third. Gluten, in particular, is extremely inflammatory. Because of the way it is processed in the United States, wheat is a toxic food. Adding Insult to Injury Let's say you have a lower back injury and eat sugar, dairy or wheat. When there's inflammation, it will target the areas already injured, which cause more pain in places where you already have discomfort, which prevents you from getting better and experiencing pain relief. If you eliminate those culprits for 10 days, it will make a huge difference in how you feel. How Supplements Can Help After eliminating those harmful foods, consider taking some supplements. An excellent one to add to your diet is turmeric, which can modulate systemic inflammation. While the turmeric won't get rid of the inflammation, it will help your body do what it's supposed to for a healthy immune system response. We also recommend Boswellia, a highly safe herb that helps modulate targeted inflammation, such as joint pain. It's important to ensure you purchase high-quality supplements. [Dr. Ritchie ](/dr-david-ritchie/)can make recommendations. Omega 3 is also helpful in addressing both types of inflammation. We recommend a high dose of at least 4 grams (4,ooo to 6,000 milligrams) a day. Please note that some of these supplements may not be appropriate for everyone, so please seek Dr. Ritchie's guidance first. Contact Us Today We want to help your body heal as it's intended.
