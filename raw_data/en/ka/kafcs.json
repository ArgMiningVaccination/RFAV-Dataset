PhRMA 's mem- bers produce innovative medicines, treatments, and vaccines that save and improve the lives of countless individuals every day. Since 2000, PhRMA 's members have invested more than $900 billion into discovering and developing new medicines , including an esti- mated $79.6 billion https://www.phrma.org/About . PhRMA's members are l eading the way in developing new vaccines and treatments for COVID -19, with nearly half of all clin- ical trials using products invented by PhRMA's members. See PhRMA COVID -19 Treatment Progress, PhRMA, https://phrma.org/Coronavirus/ Activity -Tracker (last updated July 20, 2020) [herein- after COVID -19 Tracker].

The burdens of product liability litigation are already substantial for life sc iences companies, and a regime that permits these companies to be held liable for omitting warnings deemed unwarranted by FDA un- der the existing science would unfairly compound that liability in a manner that could deter development of new medicines and impede post-approval safety re- search . The Court should reverse the Third Circuit 's judgment . INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT FDA brings extensive scientific expertise to bear in approving medically -appropriate labeling for prescription medicines , both before and after they come to market. Congress granted FDA authority to review and approve labeling because of the agency 's unique institutional capacity to assess how best to communicate complex risk and benefit information, including by determining whet her the available sci- ence justifies a warning at all . In recognition of that authority, this Court held in Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 571 (2009), that state -law tort claims are preempted when ever there is \" clear evidence \" that FDA would have rejected the labeling that a plaintiff asserts state law requires . And in Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Albrecht , 139 S. Ct. 1668, 1672, 1680 3 (2019), the Court explained that \"clear evidence \" ex- ists when a company \"fully inform[s] the FDA of the justifications for th e warning \" by submitting \" all ma- terial information ,\" with FDA informing the company that it \" would not approve a change to the drug 's label to include that warning. \"2 In this case, after considering all material in- formation addressing a potential new saf ety issue, FDA rejected GSK' s propos ed warning based on the agency 's considered judgment that the existing sci- ence was \" inadequate \" to support it . Pet. App. 64. That rejection provides clear evidence that FDA would have likewise rejected a ny earlier labeling change reflecting the same rejected warning , includ- ing one submitted under the Changes Being Effected (\"CBE\") regulation, especially given that the science was even less developed at earlier point s in time . Yet the Third Circuit rejected GSK 's preem p- tion defense by re-casting what it means for FDA to be \"fully informed \" in ways that disregard this Court 's precedents and FDA regulations. Rather than assess whether FDA was \"fully informed \" of all existing \"ma- terial information\" at the time FDA issued its rejection , the Third Circuit engaged in a retrospective 2 Although FDA's formal rejection of a warning upon receipt of full information constitutes clear evid ence, such evidence can also be established through other means. See, e.g. , Dolin v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC , 951 F.3d 882, 890- 91 (7th Cir. 2020) (Albrecht does not require showing that a company \"actually re- quested a change for the label and that the FDA rejected it \"); Cerveny 2019) argument that \" Albrecht 'dictates that only la- beling changes sought by the manufacturer can le ad to preemption' \"). 4 analysis of whether additional support for the warn- ing emerged after FDA 's disapproval. The Third Circuit further suggested that FDA is not \" fully in- formed\" of the justifications for a warning wh enever it requests additional information, regardless of whether that requested information show s anything differe nt than what FDA already knows or whether it could e ven support a labeling change. The Third Circuit 's decision places life sciences companies in the impossible position of facing civil li- ability for not adopting warning s that FDA prohibited after evaluating all material, state -of-the-art infor- mation bearing on the potential safety issue . Because scientific knowledge is ever -changing, the Third Cir- cuit's unrealistic preemption standard will hamper innovation and endanger public health by potentially exposing life sciences companies to liability when sci- entific knowledge accumulates after FDA 's rejection of proposed labeling and after the time in which the labeling is alleged to be deficient . Making matters worse , the holding below irrationally penalizes com- panies for undertaking post-approval studies that advance scientific knowledge. The Court should grant the Petition. ARGUMENT I. Given the Massive Costs Associated w ith Developing New Medicines, Preemption of Failure -to-Warn Claims that Conflict with FDA Determinations Is Critical for Innovation and Public Health Bringing a new medicine to market is a lengthy and expensive process. On average, d eveloping a new 5 medicine and obtaining FDA approval takes ten to fif- teen years and costs $2.6 billion.3 These research efforts involve tremendous risk, as j ust one out of every 5,000 to 10,000 compounds under development, and just one out of every eight m edicines entering clinical trials, obtains FDA approval.4 For example, just four out of 150 medicines developed since 1998 to treat Alzheimer 's disease have secured FDA approval , with one medication recently failing at the final stage of clinical testing after a company had invested $3 bil- lion into its development .5 Due to the high risk of failure, life sciences com- panies necessarily develop multiple medications in parallel, each at great expense. Today, approximately 8,000 potential new medicines ar e under study, with 3 PhRMA, Biopharmaceuticals in Perspective: S ummer 2019 , at 33 (2019), https://www.phrma.org/- /media/Project/PhRMA/ P h R M A - O r g / P h R M A - O r g / P D F / P - R / P h R M A _ 2 0 1 9 _ C h a r t P a c k _ Final.pdf [hereinafter Biopharmaceuticals in Perspective ]; see also Joseph DiMasi et al., Innovation in the Pharmaceutical In- dustry: New Estimates of R&D Costs, 47 J.

The current COVID -19 health crisis demonstrates how protections from unpredicta- ble and unfounded litigation can foster innovation. In 2006, after Dr. Anthony Fauci testified that fear of lit- igation had generated \"considerable reluctance on the part of industry\" to develop emergency vaccines and urged lawmakers to \"reduce the liability risks that dissuade companies from producing pandemic coun-termeasures,\" Cong ress passed the Pandemic and All - Hazards Preparedness Act . 7 The Act address es the overwhelming liability issues that might otherwise in- hibit innovation by protect ing manufacturers of medicines and other \"covered countermeasure[s],\" in- cluding vaccines, from the risk of da mages in the event of a declared public health emergency . 42 6 Biopharmaceuticals in Perspective , supra note 3, at 26; PhRMA, 2019 PhRMA Annual Membership Survey 4 t bls. 2 -3 (2019), h t t p s : / / w w w . p h r m a . o r g / - / m e d i a / P r o j e c t / P h R M A / P h R M A - O r g / P h R M A - O r g / P D F / P - R / P h R M A _ 2 0 1 9 _ m e m b e r s h i p _ s u r v e y _ Final.pdf [hereinafter Annual Membership Survey ]. 7 Avian Flu: Addressing the Global Threat: Hearing Before the H.

Today, more than 1,350 clinical trials are ongoing, involving 442 unique ther-apies and 23 unique vaccines. See COVID -19 Tracker, supra. By contrast, t he anti -nausea drug Bendectin, used to treat severe morning sickness in pregnant women, illustrates the potentia l for unfettered liabil- ity to deprive patients of innovations that improve quality of life . In 1983, a fter Bendectin was named as the cause of birth defects in thousands of lawsuits in centralized multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\") proceed- ings, its manufact urer withdrew Bendectin from the market, only later to be vindicated by scientific stud-ies showing that Bendectin posed no maternal fetal risk. 8 In 2013, after nearly thirty years off the mar- ket, Bendec tin returned under a new name.9 In the interim, hosp ital admissions for excessive vomiting during pregnancy had doubled, costing the U.S. econ-omy an estimated $1.7 billion annually in time lost from work, caregive r time, and hospital expenses. 10 8 See Joseph Sanders, From Science to Evidence: The Testimony on Causation in the Bendectin Cases , 46 Stan.

Reg. 2848, 2851 ( proposed Dec. 4, 2007) ( before approval, \" FDA undertakes a detailed review of the proposed labeling \").

Even before 2007 , FDA possessed considerable practical ability to generate labeling 11 approval if it believes the drug is unsafe, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.150(a)(2). In short, FDA brings to bear its ex- pertise at all times to ensure that medications are safe, effective, and accompanied by appropriate warn- ings. Conflict preemption takes proper account of FDA 's labeling supremacy and serves as an essential check against absolute tort liability. W here a life sci- ences company promptly brings a potential safety risk to FDA and the agency disagrees about the necessity of a warning, sub sequent civil litigation challenging that decision serve s only to undermine FDA 's over- sight .

Pharm. Co. v. Bartlett , 570 U.S. 472, 477 (2013). 13 II. Because Science Continually Evolves, the Third Circuit 's Framework Makes No Logical Sense \"[K]nowledge of drugs is not binary but contin- ues to evolve over time.\"19 Real- world use of a medicine produces information about adverse drug re- actions that may not have be en observed in clinical trials, with \"an excess of adverse events compared to what would be expected \" indicating a potential safety risk.20 Additionally , scientists inside and outside the company commonly undertake further study of the medicine after approval, producing greater under-standing regarding safety and efficacy . See Part III. And FDA itself collect s adverse ev ent reports throug h a voluntary reporting system and uses electronic health care data to monitor medicine safety . 21 FDA regulations account for this evolving knowledge by requiring companies to submit updated 19 H.G. Eichler et al., Adaptive Licensing: Taking the Next Step in the Evolution of Drug Approval, 91 Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics 426, 427 (2012); see also Geoffrey Hazard, Jr., \"Practice\" in Law and Other Professions , 39 Ariz. L. Rev. 387, 390 (1997) (in medicine, \"evolving science continually inflicts obsoles-cence on established knowledge\"). , at *3. 21 See MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program , FDA, https://www.fda.gov/Safety / MedWatch/default.htm und. 14 evaluations s benefits and risks at spec- ified intervals . See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 310(c)(2) (requiring quarterly reports for three years and annual reports thereafter). These reports must take into account \"any new information that has arisen during the re- porting interval, \" including from post -approval clinical trials and other completed studies, scientific literature , and adverse event reporting .22 The Third Circuit 's decision exposes companies to potential retroactive liability whenever some later scientific development might support a warning in the future , notwithstanding that FDA 's earlier actions confirm ed that the science during the time period at issue did not support that warning . See Pet. App. 16 (\"[B]y arguing that it did not have access to the FDA 's requested data and information unti l after the FDA 's issuance of the Letter, GSK undermines its own argu- ment that the FDA was ' fully informed. '\"). New scientific information is always emerg ing, and a preemption rule that allows retroactive liability whenever a new and previously unknown sa fety issue arises effectively renders prior FDA determinations on the science meaningless \u2014a result that cannot be squared with Levine and Albrecht . The facts of this case illustrate the error in the Third Circuit's decision . Respondents allege that from 2 000 to 2006, Avandia 's labeling should have contained additional warnings regarding its cardio- vascular risks. See Br. of Pl. -Appellants at 62, In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Practices & Prod. Liab. Litig. , 22 FDA, E2C(R2) Periodic Benefit -Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) : Guidance for Industr y (2016), 2016 WL 4058992 , at *12- 29 [hereinafter FDA PBRER F.3d 749 (2019) (No. 18- 1010), 2018 WL GSK submit- ted\u2014i.e. , all material information in existence bearing on the potential safety risk \u2014and concluded that this information was \"inadequate \" to justify additional cardiovascular warnings like those Respondents s eek. Pet. App. 64; see also 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57(c)(6)(i) (re- quiring \"reasonable evidence of a causal association \" for a warning ).23 If the state of the science was \"inad- equate \" in 2007, it necessarily was \"inadequate \" before 2007, when even less support for Respondents ' proposed warnings was available .24 Under those cir- cumstances, it was impossible for GSK \" to comply 23 FDA formally rejected GSK's Prior Approval Supplement (\"PAS\") application via a \"not appr ovable letter,\" the method set forth in the pre -2008 regulations for FDA to officially communi- cate, upon \"complet[ion] of its substantive review,\" its conclusion \"that the information contained in the application [was] unable to support \" approval. 47 Fed. Reg. 46,622, 46,639 (proposed June 23, 1982); see also 21. C.F.R. \u00a7 314.120(a) (reserved Aug. 11, 2008). 24 See, e.g. , Rheinfrank v. Abbott Labs., Inc. , 680 F. App'x 369, 386 (6th Cir. 2017) (\" Given, then, that as of 2008 the FDA did not believe the state of the data supported a developmental delay warning, it stands to reason that as of 2003, with even less data to go on, the FDA would similarly have rejected a developmental delay warning . . 2017) (FDA's 2009 conclusion that warnings were \"unjustified\" provided clear evidence that FDA would not have approved a warning in 1992); Drescher v. Bracco Diagnostics Inc. , 2020 WL (D. Ariz. Jan. 31, 2020) (\"FDA's conclu- sion that no known causal association existed in 2017 precludes finding that Defendants could have made a CBE label change years earlier.\"); Seufert v. Merck Sharp & Corp. , Supp. 3d 1163, 2016) (\"In light of the FDA's Feb-ruary 2014 conclusion that evidence of a causal association was 16 with both its state -law duty to strengthen the warn- ings\" and \"its federal -law duty not to alter \" them. Bartlett , 570 U.S. at 480. Instead, the Third Circuit held that data from the RECORD trial that did not yet exist prevented FDA from being \"' fully informed . . . greenlighting Respondents' claim that GSK failed to warn of a risk that was sc ientifically unknown until years later. Pet. App. 17 (alterations in original) (quoting Albrecht , 139 S. Ct. at 1678) .25 That holding does not comport with common sense. Newly -emergent scientific knowledge can support a label ing change only once it emerg es. See Roberto v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharm., Inc. , 2019 WL 5068452, at *21 (Conn. Super. Ct. Sept. 11, 2019) (scientific knowledge that emerged after plain- tiff's injury \" obviously could not have provided the basis for a label change that might have pre vented\" that injury).26 By permitting plaintiffs to present indeterminate, it is clear that the FDA would have rejected a la- beling change any time prior.\"). 25 There can be no doubt that the RECORD results were a pre- requisite to FDA's approval of a warning. FDA's not approvabl e letter emphasized the need for \"accruing information from ongo-ing clinical trials\" ( i.e., RECORD), Pet. App. 65, and FDA later remarked that of the various clinical trials presented at the Ad-visory Committee meeting, \"the inte rim results of the RECORD trial\" were \"[m]ost notabl[e],\" CA3.JA.1643. 26 See also, e.g. Healthcare Pharm. Inc. , 2019 WL 4771136, at *4 (D. Mass. 30, \"manifest[] . WL 8621437, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 10, 2019) (literature published after plaintiff's medicine use was \"outside 17 these \" back -to-the-future \" claims to juries, the deci- sion below deprives life sciences companies of the ir constitutional protection s. That the Third Circuit is home to three- quarters of the world 's largest pharma- ceutical companies only amplifies the impact of that deprivation .27 Moreover, t he Third Circuit arrived at its incor- rect holding by distorting this Court 's precedent s. FDA regulations permit companies to utilize the CBE process only to \"' reflect newly acquired information .'\" Albrecht , 314.70(c)(6)(iii)). Even then, \"' FDA retains author- ity to reject labeling changes made pursuant to the CBE regulation .'\" Id. at 1677 (quoting Levine , 555 U.S. at 571) . Accordingly, the preemption analysis proceeds in two steps: First, a plaintiff must identify \"'a labeling deficiency that [ the defendant] could have corrected using the CBE regulation '\"\u2014i.e. , a warning for which the company possessed \" newly acquired in- formation.\" Gibbons v. Bristol -Myers Squibb Co. , 919 F.3d 699, 708 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting In re Celexa & Lexapro Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig. , 779 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2015)) . If a plaintiff can point to such ev- idence, the defendant can still show \"' clear evidence that the FDA would not have approved [the] change. '\" Id. (quoting Levine, 555 U.S. at 571) . 28 of the relevant time frame\"); McGrath v. Bayer HealthCare Pharm. Inc. , 393 F. Supp. 3d 161, 168 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (similar). 27 See Pharmaceuticals , Sta te of N.J. Business Portal, https:// www.nj.gov/njbusiness/industry/pharmaceutical . 28 For other cases that have articulated this two -step analysis, see, e.g., Ridings v. Maurice, 2020 WL 1264178, at *4 (W.D. Mo. 18 Under this framework, which flows directly from Albrecht , Levine, and the governing regulations , science demonstrat ing a new or greater risk that emerges after FDA 's rejection of a proposed warning is relevant to the first step. Such information can pro- vide \"newly acquired information \" that could permit a subsequent CBE labeling change and allow a failure - to-warn claim for plaintiffs injured after the risk emerges . See Br. for United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting Pet 'r at 2 7, Albrecht , 139 S. Ct. 1668 (2019) (No. 17- 290), 2018 WL 4562163 [hereinafter Br. for United States ] (information that \"arose after FDA 's decision \" would permit an argument that \"in- formation that FDA did not consider constitutes 'newly acquired information '\"). But the proper ques- tion under the second prong is whether FDA was \"fully informed \" of all material existing information at the time it \" informed the drug manufacturer that [it] would not approve [the] change .\" Albrecht , 139 S. Ct. at 1672. Information that did not exist at the time FDA rejected a warning cannot keep FDA from being \"fully informed\" under Albrecht . III. The Third Circuit 's Decision Punishes Life Sciences Com panies for Their Continual Study of Medicine Safety Before studying a new medicine in humans, a life sciences company must conduct a broad range of laboratory and animal studies to test how the medi- cine works and assess its safety. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.23(a)(8). If the results are promising, the com- pany can seek FDA approval to study the medicine in Mar. 16, 2020); Mahnke , 2019 trials generally occur in three phases , which on average take six to seven years to complete .29 If the results show that the med- icine 's benefits outweigh its risks, the company can seek FDA approval to market the medicine. See 70 Fed. Reg. 57,607, 57,608 (Sept. 26, 2005). But research on new medicines does not end with FDA approval . Because medicines are used in real-world clinical settings by much broader popula- tions of patients , post-approval study can uncover new safety information, particularly regarding rare ad- verse events or those that take years to develop.30 These p ost-approval discoveries are not \" a failure of 29 See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.21; PhRMA, Modernizing Drug Discovery, .org/sites/default/files/pdf/proactive -policy Opening Pandora' s Pillbox: Us- ing Modern Information Tools t o Improve Drug Safety , 24 Health Affairs 938, 940 (2005), available at https:// www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.24.4.938 (noting the difficulty of \" recruit [ing] rigorous clinical trials sufficiently large \" to detect \" rare or uncertain problems \"). Whereas most clinical trials involve 1,000 to 5,000 patients, a study would need to recruit more than 600,000 volunteers to have a 95 percent chance of detecting an adverse event that occur s once in every 5,000 patients.

This real- world evidence can take a variety of forms, including additional clinical trials, observational studies, elec- tronic health record or payor administrative claims reviews, , and meta -analyses . In 2018, PhRMA 's s invested more than $9.2 bil- lion in post-approval research that advances clinicians' understanding of a medicine's risks, bene- fits, and potential uses, with more than 750 industry - funded post-approval clinical trials and observatio nal studies currently underwa y.32 31 Alastair Wood et al., Making Medicines Safer \u2014The Need for an Independent Drug Safety Board , 339 New Eng. J. Med. 1851, 1852 (1998). 32 Annual Membership Survey , supra note 6, at 4 tbl. 3; U.S. Nat'l Library Med., ClinicalTrials.gov, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov (last visited July 24, 2020) . Reflecting the value of post -approval research, Congress in 2007 granted FDA the authority to man- date post-approval clinical trials and studies. See 2 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(o)(3)(A). This research is subject to FDA oversight, includ- ing input on a study's design. See FDA, Guidance for Industry: Postmarketing Studies and Clinical Trials \u2014Implementation of Section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (2011), 2011 WL 28 36589, at *9- 10. Companies must make pe- riodic reports to FDA regarding any study mandated by FDA or voluntarily undertaken \"to investigate a safety issue .\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(o)(3)(E)(ii). And companies are required to include infor- mation about clinical trials and non -interventional studies they sponsor in their Periodic Benefit -Risk Evaluation Reports . See FDA PBRER Guidance , supra note 22, at *18- 19. 21 A. Assessing Whether FDA Was Fully Informed by Reference to Later Science Penalizes Companies for Contributing to Scientific Discovery By holding that data or other information gen- erated after FDA 's rejection of proposed la beling can prevent FDA from being \" fully informed \" at the time of rejection, the Third Circuit 's decision penalizes life sciences companies for undertaking post -approval re- search . This case is a perfect example. Pre-approval studies suggested that Avandi a's cardiovascular safety profile was \"benign. \" CA3.JA.914. Initial GSK- sponsored post-approval research one meta -analysis showing \"' regarding the myocardial ischemia, Cert. Pet. 7 (quoting CA3 .SA.280), and another show- ing \"an increased risk ,\" Pet. App. 64. In June 2007, FDA rejected GSK 's proposed warning to account for this mixed record, concluding that the existing data and analysis were \"inadequate \" to support it. Pet. App. 64. Had GSK pe rformed no additional study or analysis , Respondents' claim that Avandia 's pre -2007 label failed to warn about the cardiovascular risk would have been preempted under a straightforward application of Albrecht . Instead, GSK sponsored a more robust study, R ECORD, which when added to the pre -existing data appeared at the time to support \"a conclusion that Avandia increases cardiac ischemic risk. \" CA3.JA.1085. As FDA Division Director Robert Meyer stated at the Advisory C ommittee, \"considering 22 the results in the interim [RECORD] analysis many, myself included, find the data quite informative.\"33 According to the Third Circuit, because the RECORD results came into existence after June 2007 , \"FDA was not ' fully informed ' at the time \" it rejected GSK' s PAS in June 2007 .34 Pet. App. 17. The holding below thus penalizes life sciences companies who pro- actively conduct and fund vigorous post -approval safety research . This Court could not have intended such an upside -down result when it \"elaborate[d] S. Ct. at 1676. B. If Information Revealing No Different or Greater Risk Can Be Material, Companies that Zealously Participate in Scientific Research Will Be Least Able to Assert Preemption The Third Circuit 's materiality ruling furt her magnifies the litigation risk for companies that pur- sue post -approval research. As data becomes more robust, FDA can more readily fashion requests to re-analyze it in different ways. If , as the Third Circuit 33 Tr. of Joint Meeting of Endocrinologic & Metabolic Drugs A d- visory Comm. & Drug Safety Management Advisory Comm. (pt. 3), at 243, FDA (July 30, 2007), available at h t t p s : / / w e b . a r c h i v e . o r g / w e b / 2 0 0 8 0 9 2 1 0 7 3 7 3 1 / h t t p : / / w w w . f d a . g o v / o h r m s / d o c k e t s / a c / c d e r 0 7 . h t m # E n d o c r i n o l o g i c M e t a b o l i c [hereinafter Advisory Comm. Tr.]. 34 Remarkably, the Third Circuit did not reach far enough into the future to account for FDA's 2013 decision \u2014upon review of the final RECORD dat a\u2014directing removal of the black box warning it had previously added based on RECORD's interim re- sults. See CA3.JA.1641. 23 suggested , any information requested by FD A is pre- sumptively material regardless of whether it sh ows a different or greater risk, then companies that gener- ate a large body of new information through a n extensive study of a medicine 's safety will be most prone to follow -on FDA requests and least ab le to avail themselves of a preemption defense. Instead, any consideration of materiality must give due consideration to the information that FDA it- self considers material: information that would permit a label ing change. See Pet. App. 16 (\"[T]he FDA, and only the FDA, can determine what infor- mation is ' material ' . . . .\" ). Because l abeling at all times reflects FDA 's \"careful balancing of how the risks and benefits of the product should be communi-cated\" based on the agency 's \"comprehensive scientific evaluation\" and \"thorou gh . . . review of th e pertinent scientific evidence ,\" 73 Fed. Reg. at 2849, 2851, CBE label ing changes require information that \"reveal[s ] risks of a different type or greater severity or fre-quency than previously included in s ubmis sions to FDA, \" 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 314.3(b) , 314.70(c)(6)(iii). 35 Data or information that is \"cumulative of \" or \"consistent in type, severity, and frequency with information previ-ously provided\" offers no reason to upset FDA 's \"careful balancing \" and therefore d oes not justify a la- beling change. 73 Fed. Reg. at 2849 -50. Put simply , information is material to FDA 's evalua tion of pro- posed label ing if it demonstrates a different or greater 35 Although promulgated in August 2008, section 314.3(b) merely \"codif[ied] the agency's longstanding view on when a change to the labe ling . . . may be made in advance of the agency's review and approval.\" 73 Fed. Reg. at 2849. FDA did not consider sec- tion 314.3(b) \"to be a substantive change.\" Id. at 2851. 24 risk, but not if it is merely cumulative of or consistent with previously -submitted information. See Br. for United States, supra, at 28 n.11 ( \"If for instance, FDA previously determined . . . that evidence of X was in- sufficient to warrant a warning about risk Y, the existence of additional but similar information about X would be insufficient to justify a warning. \"). 36 Al- brecht itself recognizes this balance, requiring companies to \" fully inform[] the FDA of the justifica- tions for the warning ,\" not of every available scrap of cumulative data. 139 S. Ct. at 1672 (emphasis added) . The Third Circuit failed to assess the materiality of the information that FDA requested from GSK under this framework.37 36 See also, e.g. 'reasonable evidence' was presented to the FDA and that agency determined not to give different or more expansive warnings,\" additional information was not newly ac-quired). 37 Had the Third Circuit conducted such an analysis, it would have been compelled to conclude that the underlying data from the ADOPT, DREAM, and Nissen studies was immaterial, par-ticularly when GSK had already provided FDA with the results of those studies. FDA ultimately concluded that ADOPT and DREAM were inconclusive about the risk of myocardial ische- mia, and the Advisory Committee remarked about the close similarities between the Nissen meta- analysis that FDA re- quested and the ICT -42 meta- analysis that had been the basis for GSK's PAS application. See CA3.JA.743, 748- 49 (ADOPT and DREAM \" have not confirmed or excluded \" an increased risk); Advisory Comm. Tr. (pt. 5), supra note 33, at 422 (\"One thing that I was struck by when I reviewed the data was how similar the analyses were by the sponsor, by the F DA and by Nissen.\"). 25 CONCLUSION The petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted.
