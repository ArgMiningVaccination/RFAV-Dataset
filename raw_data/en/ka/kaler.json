As part of a major university, it accepts and fulfills five major responsibilities: (1) it provides its students with the opportunity to acquire a sound basic education in medicine and fosters the development of lifelong habits of scholarship and service; (2) it advances knowledge through research in biomedically oriented studies, and studies related to the cultural and behavioral aspects of medicine and the delivery of health care; (3) it provides graduate education in order to produce practitioners, teachers, and investigators through clinical residency programs and advanced degree programs in the basic medical sciences; (4) it offers continuing education programs aimed at maintaining and improving the competence of those professionals engaged in patient care; and (5) it provides multiple services to the people of the state of Indiana in all areas of the medical sciences and health care. The Indiana University Medical Center (IUMC) campus covers some 85 acres within one mile of the center of Indianapolis. Half of the first- and second-year classes are on the IUMC campus; the other half are on one of eight campuses throughout Indiana located on or near IU and other universities in the state. Including the third- and fourth-year medical students, there are approximately 873 M.D., 211 Ph.D., and 43 M.D./Ph.D. students on the IUMC campus. During the third and fourth years of medical school, the M.D. students participate in rotations to physician offices and hospitals throughout the state. Contact Information School of Medicine 1120 South Drive Fesler Hall 302Indianapolis, IN 46202-5114 (317) 274-8157 Contact Office of Admissions History The Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) was founded in 1903, and its first students were enrolled on the Bloomington campus. It was the fourth medical school in the United States, after Johns Hopkins, Harvard, and Western Reserve, to require two or more years of collegiate work for admission. The school awarded the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree to its first class of 25 in 1907. Following the union of all medical schools in the state with Indiana University in 1908, the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, in 1909, mandated that Indiana University assume the responsibility for medical education in the state. Initially, students had the opportunity of taking the first two years of their medical school work at either Bloomington or Indianapolis. In 1912, all students entered through the Bloomington program and moved to Indianapolis for their second-, third-, and fourth-year courses. This remained in effect until 1958, when the work of the Bloomington division was transferred to Indianapolis. Excellent facilities for the teaching of the basic medical sciences and a strong nucleus of basic science faculty remained in Bloomington. Consequently, in 1959, a new experimental program of medical education was started in Bloomington in cooperation with the College of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School. This program, the Medical Sciences Program, included studies that could lead to combined M.D., M.S. and M.D., and Ph.D. degrees. In 1965, a faculty committee of the School of Medicine recommended the adoption of a comprehensive plan for medical education throughout the state of Indiana. The plan involved the use of regional facilities in addition to those of the Medical Center in Indianapolis. The plan would coordinate and utilize elective programs in community hospitals, preceptorships with practicing physicians, internship and residency programs, and continuing medical education programs throughout the state. The plan also resulted in the formation, within existing educational institutions, of ''Centers for Medical Education'' for teaching basic medical science courses to first-year medical students. In 1971, the General Assembly of the State of Indiana unanimously authorized legislation that led to the completion of the Indiana Statewide Medical Education System. This legislation mandated that the Indiana University School of Medicine be responsible for selection, admission, and assignment of students, for curricular development, and for evaluation and accreditation of the system. The institutions presently involved in this program, in addition to the Medical Sciences Program at Indiana University Bloomington, are Purdue University, the University of Notre Dame, Ball State University, Indiana State University, the University of Southern Indiana, and Indiana University Northwest. In addition, a first-year program was initiated in 1981 at the Fort Wayne Center for Medical Education on the campus of Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne. Further development of the Indiana Statewide Medical Education System was approved in the 1979 Indiana General Assembly. Approval for planning and funding for4 July 13, 2011 a second year of medical study at each of the Centers for Medical Education was passed. Consequently, second-year students were first appointed to all centers, except Fort Wayne, in the fall 1980 semester. Funding for second-year students at the Fort Wayne campus began in the fall of 1990. The school awarded 261 M.D. degrees and enrolled a total of 1,173 medical students the 2007-2008 academic year. Mission The mission of the school is broad, and the hub of the Indiana Statewide Medical Education System is the Indiana University School of Medicine on the Medical Center campus in Indianapolis. Facilities The School of Medicine includes several facilities on the IUMC campus, including Fesler Hall, VanNuys Medical Sciences Building, Indiana Cancer Pavilion, IU Cancer Research Institute, Research Institutes II and III, the Rotary Building, and Emerson Hall. The William H. Coleman Hospital, Robert W. Long Hospital, and the Willis D. Gatch Clinical Building have been renovated to provide research and administrative offices at IUSM. Approximately one mile east of the IUMC campus, along the historic canal, sits the Medical Information Science Building, the Clarian Pathology Building, the Radiology Education and Research Institute, and Fairbanks Hall. Hospitals that are staffed by IUSM faculty and provide residency training programs on the IUMC campus include Wishard Memorial Hospital (a city-county hospital recently listed among the top 100 U.S. public hospitals), Roudebush VA Medical Center, Riley Hospital for Children, and Indiana University Hospital and Outpatient Center. Riley and IU hospitals separated from the Indiana University School of Medicine in 1997 to join Methodist Hospital of Indiana to form Clarian Health Partners. Clarian Health is committed to the school's mission of advancing education, research, and patient care. Located approximately two miles from IUMC, Methodist Hospital provides additional significant educational opportunities to IU students and residents. The IU School of Nursing (the largest in the country), the IU School of Dentistry, and the IU School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences are also on the IUMC campus. These health science schools are part of the larger campus created by Indiana University and Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI), which offers IU and Purdue undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Clarian Health's hospitals\u2014Riley Hospital for Children, IU Hospital, and Methodist Hospital of Indiana\u2014currently record approximately 1 million in- and outpatient visits per year. The affiliated hospitals\u2014Wishard and Roudebush\u2014 together handle another 1 million patient visits each year. This enormous patient base provides a broad range of superb clinical educational opportunities. The hospitals host 76 residency and fellowship programs with more than 1,000 residents and fellows, and provide clinical experiences in both inpatient and outpatient facilities to second- through fourth-year students. IUSM's nearly 800 teaching faculty staff all the hospitals. In addition, the hospitals host educational programs for nursing, dentistry, and allied health sciences students as well as Purdue University pharmacy doctoral students.IUSM Library The mission of the Library is to meet the information needs of the school's faculty, students, and staff throughout the state.

It is an area undergoing rapid growth and expansion through which the Ohio River flows as both artery of commerce and backdrop for cultural and recreational activities.6 July 13, 2011 Because the region's principal medical referral center is Evansville, our students have access to the expertise of the physicians and specialists who staff the city's clinics and hospitals. Over 200 of these physicians are members of the clinical faculty, providing instruction in the first- and second-year curricula, third-year family practice clerkships, and fourth-year senior electives. A substantial number of these volunteers are Indiana University School of Medicine\u2014Evansville (IUSM-E) alumni. IUSM-E occupies the third floor of the Health Professions Center at the University of Southern Indiana. In addition to offices and research facilities, other features include two tiered classrooms, a multipurpose teaching lab, a gross anatomy lab (with showers for post-dissection clean-up), a center library with a dedicated computer room, private study rooms and carrels, and a student lounge. Campus-based faculty members guide students through the courses that form the framework for their understanding of medicine. First-year students begin their course work with Biochemistry, Gross Anatomy, Histology, and Introduction to Medicine I: Patient-Doctor Relationship. Second semester courses are Physiology, Microbiology/Immunology, Neurobiology, and Introduction to Medicine I: Patient-Doctor Relationship. The second-year student advances to Pharmacology, General Pathology, and the self-study Biostatistics tutorial in the first semester, and returns from semester break to Medical Genetics and Systemic Pathology. The backbone course of the second year, Introduction to Medicine II, begins in late August and ends in early May. Enhancing the student-to-physician/instructor dialogue are IUSM-E-sponsored seminars, hospital grand rounds, continuing medical education symposia, the summer research studies for qualified students, and social events with members of the medical community and the Vanderburgh County Medical Society. Through the teaching hospitals, Deaconess and St. Mary's, students have a wide choice of third-year clerkships and fourth-year electives. Students who are interested in a family practice residency may elect to take the majority of their senior electives in Evansville. The University of Southern Indiana (USI), IUSM- E's state-supported host institution, is the fastest growing of Indiana's colleges and universities. Offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs, USI's enrollment exceeds 10,000. IUSM-E students are accorded special graduate student status entitling them to take advantage of the academic, entertainment, athletic, and recreational facilities available to USI students.

Muncie is an agricultural-industrial community with a population of approximately 80,000. IUSM\u2014Muncie is located in the northwest portion of the city. Ample student housing is available in the immediate vicinity of the center.8 July 13, 2011 Ball State University has an enrollment of approximately 18,000 students pursuing both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Among the resources available at Ball State University is a library complex, which is available to students at IUSM-Muncie. In the physical education department, an indoor track and an Olympic- size swimming pool are available for student use. Among the cultural opportunities available at Ball State University are the Muncie Symphony, Artists Series, Concert Series, and Muncie Ballet Company. The Muncie Civic Theatre also provides entertainment throughout the year. IUSM-Muncie has six full-time faculty members, ten part- time members, and 65 volunteer physicians involved in the first- and second-year programs. One of the major advantages of the Muncie center is its proximity to IU Health-Ball Memorial Hospital. Ball Memorial Hospital is a 400-bed community hospital with a full range of specialists. The medical staff of Ball Memorial Hospital is committed to medical education, and there are currently 62 residents involved in postgraduate education at Ball Memorial Hospital. Residencies are offered in family medicine, internal medicine, and transitional. Freshman students at IUSM-Muncie are invited to shadow house staff members.

Ball Medical Education Building, Room 201 Ball State University Muncie, IN Dean and Director: Professor BankstonThe Patient-Centered Learning Program The academic program at the Northwest Campus is designed around the principle that the learning of essential basic science information should occur in the context of patient interaction, patient case studies, and practice of clinical skills. To that end, the faculty of the Northwest Campus have dedicated themselves to a student-centered and patient-centered approach that involves their widely acclaimed Problem-Based Learning Curriculum, the unique History and Physical Learning Center, the Steven C. Beering Library, externship opportunities with local physicians and hospitals, and the participation of 132 volunteer community physicians. The Northwest campus Patient-Centered Learning Program provides an unique opportunity within the Indiana System for students to experience a different, and we think excellent, approach to medical student learning. We welcome visits from prospective students who would like to learn more about our Patient-Centered Learning Program and to participate with our first- or second-year medical students in one of the case-based learning sessions described below. Please contact Dr. Pat Bankston, Assistant Dean and Director, pbanks@iun.edu, to schedule a visit. Our Problem-Based (Case-Based) Learning Approach For 19 years after its founding in 1972, Indiana University School of Medicine\u2014Northwest offered a traditional first- and second-year medical curriculum. Beginning with the 1989-1990 academic year, the Northwest Campus introduced an innovative curriculum with heavy emphasis on problem solving and active learning. The highlights of this new curriculum include: (A) problem- based learning (PBL) sessions, where small groups of five to seven students meet three times a week for two hours to discuss and analyze patient cases in the presence of a faculty moderator. During these student- directed PBL sessions, students set learning objectives, generate and test hypotheses, share learned information, and apply knowledge of basic science principles to the care of patients; (B) small numbers of lectures presented by experienced faculty supplement the PBL sessions by providing helpful overviews of key concepts; (C) organization of the first and second year curricula into seven sequential \"Steps\" or units; this approach allows students to concentrate all of their studies to one subject at a time; (D) basic science laboratories in Gross Anatomy, Histology, Neuroscience, and Pathology provide active-learning experiences that reinforce and expand the knowledge base attained during PBL sessions and lectures; and (E) PBL sessions, lectures, and laboratories end by noon each day, allowing ample time for independent study and one or more afternoons per week for other patient-based activities. The 7 Steps (courses) of the IUSM\u2014Northwest PBL curriculum are: 1st Year Step 1 The Molecular Basis of Medicine (Biochemistry, Molecular Biology) 6 weeks Step 2 Human Structure (Gross Anatomy, Histology, Cell Biology) 11 weeks Step 3 Systemic Function and Drug Action (Physiology) 6 weeksJuly 13, 2011 9 Step 4 Neural Control and Disease (Neuroscience) 6 weeks Step 5 Medications and Disease (Pharmacology) 6 weeks 2nd Year Step 6 Invasion and Defense (General Pathology, Microbiology, Immunology) 11 weeks Step 7 Pathophysiology and Advanced Problem Solving (Introduction to Medicine, Systemic Pathology, Advanced Doctor/Patient Relationship) 24 weeks Doctor/Patient Relationship (dispersed throughout the first-year) Component Descriptions Behavioral Scienc The Behavioral Science curriculum deals with systemic introduction to human development involving learning, conditioning and perception. Cases, including those used in Step 1 through Step 5, will be used to emphasize human behavioral studies regarding those concepts that are considered useful in understanding and treating disturbed behavior. The development of personality and the role of mental mechanisms in healthy and unhealthy adjustments are also reviewed. Medical Ethics Medical Ethics consists of a series of seminars devoted to discussion of various topics such as disclosure, confidentiality, informed consent, and death and dying. Cases posing dilemmas that relate to step cases will be presented, along with abstract material to facilitate conceptual and ethical analysis. History Taking and Physical Diagnosis The H & P Learning Center's goal is to support medical education, evaluation, and research. It uses standardized patients to create simulations of history and physical findings of real patients. Standardized patients are individuals trained to present a patient's history and physical examination findings in a consistent manner. They are also trained to evaluate the clinical and interpersonal skills of individual medical students. Students will be involved in many projects utilizing the H & P Learning Center and standardized patients during the Doctor/Patient Relationship course. History Taking The fundamentals of history taking consist of five introductory history-taking sessions in the first half of the freshman year. To aid in the development of history- taking skills, students will be participating in several projects involving hands-on training with standardized patients in the H & P Learning Center. In addition to the introductory history-taking sessions, students will be involved in a series of preceptor visits. Each student will be paired with a local area family practitioner. The student will shadow the preceptor in a primary care setting. As the student develops history-taking skills, he/she will interview patients seen in the preceptor's office. Preceptors will critique the student's write-ups and provide feedback so improvement can be made on their history-taking skills. At the end of the history-taking instruction, students will be evaluated by standardized patients in the H & P Learning Center. Physical Diagnosis The second term of the freshman year will continue with instructing the fundamentals of the Physical Examination. This portion of the curriculumconsists of ten sessions. Each week a portion of the physical exam will be presented first by demonstration on a standardized patient, and then by having students pair up to practice. Standardized patients will also be used in a series of learning sessions in the H & P Learning Center. During this segment of the curriculum students will have an opportunity for hands-on experience in the physical exam. Students will examine standardized patients \"from head to toe\" in several H & P Learning Center Projects. The history and physical exam instruction will culminate in a testing session using standardized patients in the performance of a head-to-toe physical exam with history and health-risk appraisal in the H & P Learning Center. Chronic Patient Program At the beginning of each academic year, freshmen students will be assigned one chronic patient to monitor and care for consistently for the two years they stay at the Northwest Center. Students will be expected to visit or speak with their patient on a weekly and/or biweekly basis. They also will be expected to keep a detailed journal of their experiences in treating their patient. In turn, the patient will utilize their medical student as a resource for questions concerning treatment, and as a means of emotional support. The intent of this project is to introduce students to the art of building a solid doctor- patient relationship. Students look to their preceptors for help and guidance during this experience. All students must report any significant patient comments or physical exam findings to the patient's primary care physician. All charts and journals will be considered confidential material and only first names should be used when documenting any information about the chronic patients. Discussion Series In addition to Behavioral Science, Medical Ethics and History Taking, and Physical Diagnosis, the Doctor/Patient Relationship will include a group discussion segment which has been characteristic of this portion of the curriculum since its inception at the Northwest Center. The Discussion/Brown Bag Series is designed to encourage group cohesion among students and to provide a mechanism for communication for both the students and the faculty. The discussion series will be interspersed with preceptor visits the first ten weeks of the freshman year. Sessions will consist of guest speakers, panel discussions, and student discussions. These sessions will be organized around topics which integrate the various components of the Doctor/Patient Relationship. The series may include such topics as professionalism, the Managed Care Plans, family systems, prevention and health maintenance, medical malpractice, the importance of community in health care systems, spirituality and cross-cultural issues in patient care, and issues in documentation and confidentiality. Faculty members involved in all areas of the Doctor/Patient Relationship will be encouraged to attend these sessions so all issues will be viewed from a variety of perspectives. Our library, librarian, and library assistant help students gather information and provide a place to study. To facilitate self-directed study, students have 24-hour access to the Steven C. Beering Medical Library and Medical Resource and Learning Center, which houses a Student Learning Center with 19 computer stations, audio-visual and computer-directed learning programs, and an extensive series of periodicals, textbooks, and other reference materials. A professional librarian and10 July 13, 2011 assistant are available to help students locate the latest in medical information to aid their studies. The library complex has ten comfortable study rooms for students and a lounge area for reading journals or medical literature. The Northwest campus is the only regional campus in the School of Medicine that maintains a large medical library and student study center of this nature. Our Doctor/Patient Course facilitates learning of professional skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors important to our student doctors. An important part of the IUSM\u2014Northwest Patient Centered Learning Program is the Doctor/Patient Relationship course. One element of this course is eight weeks of exposure to patients in family practice physician's offices beginning in the first week of medical school. A similar eight-week experience with specialty physicians begins the second year of medical school. Student clinical skills are taught by local doctors who instruct students in the fundamentals of doctor/patient interactions, patient interviewing, and many other aspects of primary care ambulatory medical practice. The topics \"medical ethics\" and \"behavioral science\" are also part of the Doctor/Patient Course. The History and Physical Learning Center helps student doctors learn and practice interviewing and physical exam skills early in their curriculum. To facilitate the Doctor/Patient Relationship course, the Northwest campus maintains for the exclusive use of its students a state-of-the-art History and Physical Learning facility, the largest and most extensive H & P learning facility of all the regional campuses. The facility has six private examination rooms for students to practice their skills with standardized patients (SPs). SPs are individuals trained to present a patient's history and physical examination findings in a \"standardized\" manner and also to evaluate the clinical and interpersonal skills of the medical student examiners. Instruction and extensive practice sessions in H & P skills at IUSM\u2014Northwest is offered during the first year of medical school (all other programs at IUSM teach these skills in the second year); thus, our students are uniquely prepared to apply their H & P skills to real patient experiences between the first and second years (summer externships). Students follow an ill patient as the patient's own student doctor for two years to learn the real life problems, family situations, financial difficulties, and changes that occur in the course of receiving medical care. In an exciting, innovative approach unique to our campus, medical students will be part of an \"interprofessional health care team\" together with nursing students and social work students from the College of Health and Human Services at IU Northwest. Some students become like family members, attending birthday parties, visits to the doctor, and surgeries. Through these interactions, each student learns about the humanistic side of medicine and gains knowledge of patient social, financial, cultural, and spiritual matters that may influence medical care and patient management. Competency Education is an easy matter in our student-centered and patient-centered approach. The Northwest Campus has been a leader in the implementation of the IUSM Competency-BasedCurriculum, and all courses and all faculty participate in competency training and assessment. The goal of the Competency Curriculum is to develop and graduate physicians with characteristics that represent the highest aspirations of the profession. We expect our students to strive for the qualities of altruism, honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, accountability, and excellence, and upon graduation to pursue their work as a virtuous activity and a moral undertaking. In other words, our goal for our students is for them to become virtuous physicians. At IUSM\u2014Northwest, the patient-centered approach, the small student to faculty ratio, three-times-per-week small group PBL sessions, and H & P training with SPs allow multiple opportunities to teach competencies and to provide fair evaluations, feedback, and timely help if skills need improvement. Scholarships available A limited number of Northwest Indiana scholarships are available for eligible students attending the Indiana University School of Medicine\u2014Northwest. Inquiries should be made to Dr. Bankston. Summer Research Opportunities A small number of research-oriented medical students are chosen each year to participate in the Summer Research Fellowship Program. Students in this program are awarded a stipend to work on biomedical research projects under the supervision of a campus faculty member in the summer between the first and second year. Medical students at IUSM\u2014Northwest are also welcome and encouraged to attend any of the numerous educational programs hosted by the Northwest campus, including (a) our annual fall and spring seminar series in basic and patient-based research; (b) visiting professor lecture-hour series presented by guest lecturers; and (c) any of the large number of additional medical-educational activities that are offered by seven local hospitals. Student-Centered Approach The philosophy of the faculty and support staff toward medical students is one of helpfulness and nurture of adult learners, as student doctors learn the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes characteristic and unique to the special profession that they are entering. The faculty and support staff see themselves as partners, facilitators, and resources to help students realize their goal of becoming the best doctor they can be, for their own sake and that of their future patients.

The Indiana University School of Medicine requires applicants to include in their undergraduate study a minimal number of required science courses (see below). It is also expected that successful applicantswill have included in their undergraduate experience a significant number of courses in the humanities and social and behavioral sciences. In this fashion, students gain a better understanding of contemporary society and human experience, and greater insight into their patients' backgrounds, problems, and illnesses. Applicants are expected to be competent in speaking and writing the English language. Selection of the Class Students are offered places in the class on the basis of scholarship, character, personality, references, performance on the Medical College Admission Test, and personal interview. The medical school faculty has specified nonacademic criteria (''Technical Standards for Admission and Retention in Medical School''), which all applicants are expected to meet in order to participate in the medical education program and the study of medicine. The successful applicant will usually have a record of 1) extracurricular experience in a clinical setting and/or shadowing of physicians and 2) volunteer work/community service. Except for Early Decision Program candidates, accepted applicants will normally be notified on October 15, November 15, December 15, January 15, February 15, March 15, and at intervals thereafter until the class is filled. The successful applicant should keep in mind that acceptance is granted subject to the satisfactory completion of all School of Medicine requirements. If the student does not maintain the scholastic average and course load that were evident at the time of acceptance, the committee reserves the right to withdraw acceptance. Indiana University School of Medicine does not discriminate on the basis of age, color, disability, ethnicity, gender, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status. Requirements It is strongly recommended that the applicant complete a B.A. or B.S. degree in a school accredited by one of the regional accrediting agencies. The minimum amount of college course work required is three academic years (90 credit hours, excluding physical education and ROTC courses). Any major from the traditional arts and sciences curriculum is acceptable. Students with educational backgrounds in areas outside the usual liberal arts and sciences curriculum (education, business, engineering, pharmacy, etc.) will be evaluated based on a minimum of 90 credit hours (three academic years) of college course work of arts and sciences equivalence. Such students are invited to consult with the Admissions Office about School of Medicine policy regarding academic course work outside the arts and sciences area. The Admissions Committee encourages highly qualified students to enroll in undergraduate honors courses. The following science course work is required for admission; each course must include a minimum of six credit hours of lecture and two credit hours of laboratory component: General chemistry, 8-10 credit hours (one academic year)14 July 13, 2011 Organic chemistry, 8-10 credit hours (one academic year) Physics, 8-10 credit hours (one academic year) Biological sciences, 8-10 credit hours (one academic year) Neither grades nor credit hours from subjects offered in the medical curriculum will be accepted toward fulfilling the required 90 credit hours of undergraduate course work or the above specific science requirements. The Admissions Committee reserves the right to determine which courses will fulfill its requirements. Scholastic Record Every grade becomes a part of the permanent record and is calculated in the overall scholastic average. A student who is an Indiana resident cannot usually expect to gain entrance to the class if his or her average of credit points is below 3.2 on a 4.0 scale. The applications of nonresidents will be considered on an individual basis (see below at ''Residence''). Greater weight is given to the quality of work than to an excess of credit hours over the minimum required. A scholastic record that shows a large number of withdrawals and/or a repetition of subjects in order to remove grades of F or to raise low grades will obviously be less impressive than a record showing work of uniformly good quality. A student who has withdrawn or been dismissed from another medical school is usually not eligible for admission to the first-year class at Indiana University. Residence Preference will be given to applicants who are residents of the state of Indiana. Nevertheless, a number of nonresidents are accepted each year, and well-qualified nonresidents with an interest in obtaining a medical education at Indiana University are encouraged to apply. The applications of nonresidents who have significant ties to the state of Indiana may be given greater consideration. The Admissions Committee uses the Indiana University System Residency Policy to determine the residency of applicants for IU fee purposes http:///www.iue.edu/ registrar/policies/residency_rules.php . Application Procedure The Indiana University School of Medicine participates in the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Application information is available on the Web site of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) at www.aamc.org . The deadline for AMCAS's receipt of application and transcripts is December 15 for the following year's entering class.

Additional information is available from AMCAS and from the Admissions Office. Interviews Beginning in September, members of the Admissions Committee will interview students by appointment only. In general, appointments for interviews are scheduled in the order in which applications are received unless the applicant has not taken the Medical College Admission Test.Transcript It is the applicants' responsibility to send an updated transcript to the Admissions Office at the conclusion of each grading period during the application process. Medical College Admission Test All applicants must take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) in order to be considered for admission. Registration information may be obtained from www.aamc.org . Students are urged to take this test in the spring of the year preceding the application. Ordinarily, acceptance will not be granted in the absence of an MCAT score. Technical Standards The medical school faculty has specified the following nonacademic criteria (''technical standards'') that all applicants/medical students are expected to meet in order to participate in the medical education program and the practice of medicine. Observation: The applicant/medical student must be able to participate actively in all demonstrations and laboratory exercises in the basic medical sciences and to assess and comprehend the condition of all patients assigned to him or her for examination, diagnosis, and treatment. Such observation and information acquisition usually requires the functional use of visual, auditory, and somatic sensation. Communication: The applicant/medical student must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients in order to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity, and posture; assess nonverbal communications; and effectively and efficiently transmit information to patients, fellow students, faculty, staff, and all members of the health care team. Communication skills include speaking, reading, and writing, as well as the observation skills described above. Motor: The applicant/medical student must have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers; be able to perform basic laboratory tests; possess all skills necessary to carry out diagnostic procedures; and be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities: The applicant/medical student must be able to measure, calculate, reason, analyze, and synthesize. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the applicant/ medical student must be able to comprehend three- dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. The applicant/ medical student must have the capacity to perform these problem-solving skills in a timely fashion. Behavioral and Social Attributes: The applicant/ medical student must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his or her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the developmentJuly 13, 2011 15 of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients and others. Applicants/medical students must also be able to tolerate taxing workloads, function effectively under stress, adapt to a changing environment, display flexibility, and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, commitment, and motivation are personal qualities that each applicant/medical student should possess. Transfer Admission Indiana University School of Medicine currently does not accept applications for transfer. Financial Assistance It is important to recognize that it costs considerably more to provide a quality medical education than what the student actually pays in tuition and fees. Every student attending the Indiana University School of Medicine benefits from the subsidies provided by the state of Indiana through state-legislated appropriations. These funds enable Indiana University to keep tuition and fees at the lowest reasonable amount possible. In addition, Indiana University benefits through its many generous friends and supportive organizations that assist in making a medical education affordable to all School of Medicine students. The purpose of the School of Medicine's scholarship and financial aid programs is to assist students whose personal and family resources are not sufficient to meet the total cost of their medical education. To meet the financial needs of our students in a fair and equitable manner through the most desirable aid programs possible, most financial aid programs are made available to students with documented financial need. The school cannot assure that it will be able to fully meet each student's financial need, and therefore, some students will need to investigate other options in meeting their educational expenses. Student eligibility for financial aid programs is determined by evaluating both the student's and the parents' ability to defray the cost of a medical education. To apply for most desirable financial aid programs, regardless of the independent status of the student, students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) http://www.fafsa.ed.gov . The FAFSA results will be made available electronically to IUPUI. Beginning in April, students will be notified of their eligibility for all federal aid programs for the academic year. Keep in mind that all financial information received is held in strict confidence and is used only to determine the student's eligibility for financial assistance. The Dean's Office for Medical Student Affairs-Student Financial Services (MSA-SFS) makes available via the MSA Web page, the IUSM Financial Aid Guide, the financial aid application materials, and other information about specific programs. Students are encouraged to investigate outside sources of aid that may be available through bank trusts, churches, and fraternal and professional organizations. Financial Assistance Programs The following financial assistance programs are available to medical students attending the Indiana UniversitySchool of Medicine (IUSM). Any questions you may have about these programs can be answered by contacting our office: Medical Student Affairs Student Financial Services Medical Sciences Building 119 635 Barnhill Drive IU School of Medicine are described in further detail in the IU Financial Aid Guide for Medical Students at http:// msa.iusm.iu.edu . Federal Primary Care Loan Federal Subsidized Stafford Student Loan Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Student Loan Federal Graduate Plus Loan Federal College Work-Study Program (CWSP) Child-of-Disabled-Veteran Award (CVO) (available to Indiana residents only) Scholarships to Disadvantaged Students (SDS) Loans to Disadvantaged Students (LDS) Indiana Primary Care Scholarship Scholarships, Fellowships, and Loans The School of Medicine Scholarship Committee awards students more than $3 million in scholarships and fellowships from annual gifts and scholarship endowments. The scholarship awards range from $1,000 to full tuition. While some programs have donor restrictions, the School of Medicine maintains a philosophy of equal opportunity. All students who complete the school's Application for Financial Assistance will be considered for all of the IU School of Medicine scholarships and fellowships listed at msa.iusm.iu.edu in the IU School of Medicine Financial Aid Guide. While most scholarships are awarded for a combination of financial need and academic achievement, some scholarships are based strictly on academic achievement and a small portion based strictly on financial need. To receive need-based awards, students must first apply for federal aid and submit parental information (regardless of independent status) on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Parental information is a factor in granting scholarships based on need or a combination of need and academics. Academic awards honor outstanding medical school achievement. Medical students receiving the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarships (AFHPSP) or the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) will not be considered for scholarships based on financial need or a combination of need and academics. Eligibility for and renewability of scholarship assistance has been outlined by the IUSM Scholarship Committee in the following policy statement: The receipt of any academic or combined need and academic scholarship by a student is contingent upon: (1) the student applying when required, (2) the criteria of the scholarship award, and (3) the student maintaining16 July 13, 2011 good academic standing. A student is in good academic standing, as seen by the Scholarship Committee, when the student is not on academic probation for any reason during the entire preceding academic year. The Indiana University School of Medicine Student Manual defines what constitutes good academic standing. In addition, renewability will be contingent upon the student having demonstrated financial need and the availability of funds. Fees Annual tuition for students in the M.D. program in the School of Medicine for 2010/2011 is $29,652.50 for residents of the state of Indiana and $42,980.50 for nonresidents. A General Fee that contains University assessments for student activities, athletic development, technology, and general services is also assessed to all students with each registration and is included with the tuition charge. Specific assessments associated with class year and center of instruction are also levied. All students are required to carry personal health insurance. Students not covered under an insurance policy meeting certain minimal criteria as determined by the school must enroll in the school-sponsored health insurance plan at an annual cost of $2,800.00 for 2010/2011. Tuition and fees are subject to change by action of the Board of Trustees. All fees may be confirmed by contacting the school. An application fee of $50 is required of all new applicants for admission to Indiana University. Students taking Graduate School courses should consult the appropriate graduate office for relevant fee information. The School of Medicine possesses a sufficient number of excellent binocular microscopes to meet the needs of all of its students. These are available on a use-charge basis. If a student wishes to provide his or her own microscope, it must meet rigid specifications and be approved by the microscope committee of the School of Medicine. Storage space for personal microscopes is not available in the teaching laboratories. Programs The Indiana University School of Medicine offers academic programs leading to the MD degree, graduate degrees in the biomedical sciences, and continuing medical education for practicing physicians. Doctoral Programs Doctor of Medicine Doctor of Philosophy in Medical Biophysics Doctor of Philosophy in Medical Neuroscience Other Doctor of Philosophy Programs Doctor of Medicine With an undergraduate student body of 1,300 and an average class size of 325, the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) is the nation's second largest medical school. As the only medical school in the state of Indiana, IUSM is committed to producing knowledgeable, skilled, and caring physicians.Recognizing that the art of medicine requires more than excellent medical knowledge and procedural skill, IUSM was among the first of a growing number of schools in the nation to adopt an innovative curriculum designed to support student development in nine areas of competency: (1) Effective Communication; (2) Basic Clinical Skills; (3) Using Science to Guide Diagnosis, Management, Therapeutics, and Prevention; (4) Lifelong Learning; (5) Self-Awareness, Self-Care, and Personal Growth; (6) The Social and Community Context of Health Care; (7) Moral Reasoning and Ethical Judgment; (8) Problem Solving; and (9) Professionalism and Role Recognition. Additional information about the curriculum can be found at http:// medicine.iu.edu/meca/ . The School of Medicine, in cooperation with other institutions of higher learning, has expanded educational opportunities for first- and second-year students on several campuses throughout Indiana. Matriculates begin their first two years of study at one of nine campus locations throughout Indiana, including: Medical Science Program on the campus of Indiana University\u2014Bloomington; IUSM\u2014Evansville on the campus of University of Southern Indiana; IUSM\u2014Fort Wayne on the campus of Indiana University\u2014Purdue University at Fort Wayne; IUSM\u2014Indianapolis on the campus of Indiana University\u2014Purdue University at Indianapolis; IUSM\u2014Lafayette on the campus of Purdue University; IUSM\u2014Muncie on the campus of Ball State University; IUSM\u2014Northwest on the campus of Indiana University\u2014Northwest; IUSM\u2014South Bend on the campus of University of Notre Dame; IUSM\u2014Terre Haute on the campus of Indiana State University. For the third and fourth years of study Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Northwest, South Bend and Terre Haute campuses offer all four years. Bloom\u00acington, Evansville, Lafayette and Muncie offer the first two years with plans to include clerkships in the future. IUSM course and non-course work reflect the competency focus. Small group work emphasizes foundational science content along with communication, problem-solving, and lifelong learning. Introduction to Clinical Medicine courses address clinical, social, behavioral, and basic sciences in addition to communication, professionalism, medical ethics, cultural diversity, and spirituality. Year one focuses on the physician-patient relationship through interaction with faculty and patients in a variety of settings. In year two, the competencies are increasingly integrated into patient care through direct patient contact at the bedside. Students demonstrate their developing competencies in various settings, including Objective Structured Clinical Examinations with standardized patients trained to present specific health problems and give students immediate feedback. In year three, student learning in the competency areas is furthered through the medical care programs of the hospitals. During clinical clerkships, students assumeJuly 13, 2011 17 increasing responsibility for all aspects of patient care. Clerkship opportunities range from preventive medicine and outpatient care through emergency services, general hospital ward work, and specialized medical services. The annual AAMC Graduation Questionnaire indicates that students value the exposure to a wide variety of hospitals, patient populations, and clinical experiences that are available. Fourth-year students widen their experience through three required clerkships, advanced-level projects in three of the nine competency areas, and six months of elective study. Students may choose from electives in basic and clinical science departments, hospital systems throughout the state, private practice preceptorships, or foreign study. The formation of a physician's professional identity is not accomplished solely through the formal curriculum. Learners also assimilate patterns of relating what they experience in the social environment, or informal curriculum, during their training. The desired outcome is a culture that consistently reflects the ethical, professional, and humane values expressed in the formal curriculum. Additional information about the informal curriculum can be found at http://medicine.iu.edu/meca/informal- curriculum/ . The school follows an evaluation system that includes both course and competency grades. The course grading system includes grades of honors, high pass, pass, and fail. Achievement of the nine competencies is tracked and documented each year, culminating in a competency transcript upon graduation. The competency grading system is satisfactory or non-satisfactory. In order to graduate, students must pass all course and competency requirements (all nine competencies at Levels 1 and 2 and three selected competencies for Level 3) and Steps 1 and 2 (Clinical Skills and Clinical Knowledge portions) of the United States Medical Licensing Examination. A graphical representation and detailed information about planned competency experiences, evaluation, and assessment for all campuses and Levels can be searched within the Database of Competency Curriculum (DoCC) at http://meded.iusm.iu.edu/docc/home.aspx . Student Honors Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society The Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society was organized on August 25, 1902. Each year, undergraduates are elected to membership based entirely on scholarship, personal integrity, and potential leadership. It is the duty of members to foster the scientific and philosophical features of the medical profession, to look beyond the self to the welfare of the profession and of the public, to cultivate social-mindedness as well as an individualistic attitude toward responsibilities, to show respect for colleagues and especially for elders and teachers, to foster research, and in all ways to ennoble the profession of medicine and advance it in public opinion. Gold Humanism Honor Society IUSM received a grant from the Arnold P. Gold Foundation to establish a chapter of the Gold Humanism Honor Society. By encouraging the creation of chapters in medical schools around the country, the Gold Foundation seeks to honor senior medical students, residents, role-model physician-teachers, and other exemplars who demonstrate excellence in clinical care, leadership, compassion anddedication to service.

Master of Public Health Public health is the science and art of protecting and improving community health through health education, promotion, research, and disease prevention strategies. Public health is the knowledge and application of multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, population-based methods of research, teaching, service, and practice involving various academic disciplines. Indiana University School of Medicine offers a comprehensive curriculum leading to the Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) degree. This program provides students with a clear understanding of the roles of core disciplines in public health and knowledge of the theory and terminology used by these disciplines that allows effective participation in interdisciplinary public health efforts. Students obtain specialized skills in epidemiology, health policy and management, or social and behavioral health science. The M.P.H. Program provides a broad, contemporary perspective for future health care leaders to focus on prevention of injury and disease in populations by addressing issues such as tobacco and drug abuse, air and water contaminants, infectious and chronic diseases, and cost-effective use of health care technologies. The M.P.H. degree is 45 credits in length. Medical Sciences Program (Bloomington) Assistant Dean and Director: Professor Watkins The Medical Sciences Program is located on the Indiana University Bloomington campus. The program is designed to provide medical students with an excellent curriculum in the basic sciences, which involves extensive clinical integration at Bloomington Hospital. The hospital provides an auditorium, classrooms, examining rooms, a library, a student lounge, and offices used by the program. Considerable emphasis is placed by the program on close personal contact between medical students and the basic science and clinical faculty, which fosters a rich cooperative environment for learning. Our medical curriculum is strong because major courses are taught over the entire academic year rather than being confined to a particular semester. This allows students a longer time to master these subjects. For example, during the first semester, freshman medical students enroll in Gross Human Anatomy I, Human Physiology I, Medical Biochemistry I, Human Microscopic Anatomy, Patient/ Physician Relationship I, and Microbiology/Immunology. In the second semester, they enroll in Human Gross Anatomy II, Human Physiology II, Medical Biochemistry II, Neuroscience, and Patient/Physician Relationship II. Sophomore medical students take year-long courses in Pathology, Pharmacology, and Introduction to Medicine, along with semester-long courses in Medical GeneticsJuly 13, 2011 23 and Biostatistics. Thus, the sophomore year also provides students with increased time to master these important medical subjects by having them taught throughout the academic year. The Medical Sciences Program also provides medical students with the opportunity to pursue graduate studies leading to the combined M.D./Ph.D. degree. The program leading to the M.D. degree is administered by the School of Medicine and the Ph.D. degree program is offered by the University Graduate School. A coordinated flexible schedule provides a basis for advanced study and research in a specific field. Close personal faculty guidance is provided in the preclinical curriculum, which is adjustable to the background, needs, and special interests of each student. The student may complete the requirements for an advanced research degree prior to, concurrent with, or upon completion of the clinical years of medicine. The 1,930-acre Bloomington campus lies in scenic, rolling, heavily wooded terrain in southern Indiana, 50 miles south of Indianapolis. The hilly, wooded acres of the campus are traversed by a small stream, the Jordan River, which creates the illusion of a forest. Most of the university buildings, including Jordan Hall where the Medical Sciences Program is housed, are constructed from native limestone from nearby quarries. The campus is the home of the movie Breaking Away and the famous Little 500 bike race. Bloomington and its surrounding area offer outstanding cultural and recreational opportunities for students and their families. The university's world-famous School of Music provides an annual calendar of events that includes opera, chamber groups, ensembles, several orchestras, and student and faculty recitals. The University Theater offers year-round productions. The Indiana University Art Museum exhibits paintings, sculptures, and other art objects, and schedules frequent displays of visiting art collections. The Indiana University athletic teams are part of the Big Ten Conference and provide a wide variety of spectator sports including soccer, swimming and diving, basketball, track, football, gymnastics, and wrestling. All of the recreational sports facilities of the School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation are available for student use.
