He was a superb teacher, one of our best. He made a dif cult subject very interesting and always had stories to illus-trate his points. Two of us in of the class of D52, served in the Navy under Dr. Glidden during WorldWar II. He was the chief medical officerfor the First Naval District, located at 150 Causeway Street in Boston. Dr. Donald Blackstone and myself were pharmacistmates and X-ray technicians stationed atthe Boston Navy Yard. We received manyX-ray requests from Dr. Glidden. Only later, when talking to him as stu- dents at the dental school, did we discoverthat he was our boss in the service. arno bommer, d52 peabody, massachusetts :743\u001b16/<57<5\u000e3F>3@73<13 We just wanted to let you know that gradu-ation weekend was an awesome experience,and in our view, Tufts School of DentalMedicine is a rst-class act in every regard. We so much enjoyed attending the Omicron Kappa Upsilon national dentalhonor society induction and dinner onFriday night of this special weekend. Thiswas a dignified and meaningful event.On Sunday we headed for the graduation ceremonies on the Medford/Somerville campus. The speeches were excellent, andthe atmosphere in the arena was one thatexuded excitement and a true respect for academic and clinical accomplishments. From the first day our son Joseph was accepted to Tufts (the same week hegraduated from Dartmouth College) and received a Merit Scholarship award, he felt he was a valued member of the Class of2009. He has been inspired by many out-standing doctors and support personnel at Tufts; he has mentioned Dean [Lonnie] Norris and Dean [Mark] Gonthier manytimes, always with gratitude and apprecia-tion of their efforts. Joseph has also men- tioned the highly respected members of the clinical faculty. It takes very special peopleto uphold the high standards at Tufts, andwe are in awe of the four years that our sonspent at the School of Dental Medicine.He not only thrived, but the experience changed his life. He made some lifelong friends, and he had the privilege of work-ing with some of the best, brightest, mostskilled and caring faculty and postgradu-ate residents in the field of dentistry. Wewould like to say thank you for setting thebar high and for upholding the standardsof this extraordinary dental school. richard and robin pechter, d09p vero beach, florida For more on Commencement weekend, turn to page 31. \u2014 Editor D3@G\u000e7;>@3AA32 I recently started my General PracticeResidency at Maimonides Medical Centerin Brooklyn. There are six residents intotal, all of whom went to different dentalschools. The residency program directorsaid he had never had such a range of den-tal schools represented as was the case thisyear. The program director was reviewingmaterials we will use in our residency. Hebegan by asking what each of us used inour dental schools. With each response, hebecame more impressed with one school\u2014you guessed it, Tufts. He was impressed with our undergradu- ates' use of rotary instrumentation for endo and with our clinical materials, even some-thing as simple as having several choicesfor impression materials. There has yet to be a material or instrument I did not learn to use at Tufts. As my residency continues,I have come to realize how truly great myeducation at Tufts was. I can honestly saythat my education left nothing out. joel preminger, d09 lawrence, new york B/:9\u000eB=\u000eCA Tufts Dental Medicine welcomes letters, concerns and suggestions from all its readers.

T ufts University School of Dental Medicine continues to be a national leaderin the number of applications received forits D.M.D. program. For our newest class(D13), the school received 4,524 applica-tions for 173 slots\u2014a 4.1 percent increaseover last year. Of significance is the fact that we're continuing to elevate our aca- demic standards and still attracting high-caliber students. The applicant pools for the school's six postgraduate and three fellowship pro-grams also are growing. Four of the post-graduate programs, now located on thesecond fl oor of One Kneeland Street, will move to new space that is more than doublein size once our expansion project is com-plete. As of January 2010, Endodontics andI am pleased to share with you some highlights from the 2008-09 academic year at the Schoolof Dental Medicine. Even in a down economy,and with the need to adjust to the inconve-niences of ongoing major construction at ourbuilding at One Kneeland Street, the schoolhad an outstanding year, achieving its primarymissions of educating competent oral health professionals, providing high-quality patient care, advancing researchand promoting community service. In alignment with university measures to address the current economic cli- mate, the school remains nancially solid, with a balanced budget. Our clinic revenues remained stable; we curtailed discretionary expenses such as travel; and adhering to university policy, we limited merit raises. Most important,we were steadfast in funding our academic priorities, including the comple- tion of the construction project to add ve fl oors to our building. The main pillars of the school's budget\u2014tuition and fees, and clinic and educationalactivities\u2014are strong. We remain a highly sought-after institution for a dental education. Applications for admission are at an all-time high.

Led by the Department of Public Health and Community Service, the school has been active in Boston's Step Up program,which is administered by the city in coor-dination with Tufts University and fourother universities. The program providescomprehensive services, including dentalprevention and treatment, to students in select Boston public schools. In addition to services provided by the School of DentalMedicine, the Friedman School of NutritionScience and Policy at Tufts is spearheadinginitiatives in healthy eating and physicalactivity. The Step Up dental team worksfive days a week in urban neighborhoodsthroughout the school year and has caredfor more than 5,000 children in 30 Bostonschools since Tufts started participating inStep Up in 2007. Step Up is one way our school is help- ing to address the access-to-care issue, which is projected to reach its worst pointin New England and around the countryby 2020, as more dentists retire than enterthe profession. The need is especially acute in Maine, which has just one dentist for every 3,400residents, compared to the national ratio of one dentist per 1,700 residents. The Maine Dental Association predicts that about 20percent of the state's dentists will retire overthe next ve years. Clearly, that is not wel- come news for patients, as they contend withpractices that aren't accepting new patients or months-long waits for an appointment. To address the growing shortage of dentists in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine, our school has been working more with community health centers in thosestates to establish externship sites for stu-dent rotations. One of Tufts University's core values is active citizenship. Realizing that studentindebtedness can infl uence career decisions, including where our dental graduates prac- tice, the university last year established theTufts Loan Repayment Assistance Program (LRAP) to help alumni pursuing careers in public service to pay a portion of their edu-cation loans. I was extremely pleased at thenumber of awards granted to our students. You'll meet four of them in this issue of themagazine (see page 12). The economic downturn also affected research funding this year. Federally fundedscientists saw cuts ranging from 7 percent to20 percent in their current project budgets. However, the availability of federal stimulus monies through the AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009generated a high number of grant appli-cations from our faculty. Pamela Yelick received a two-year, $1.53 million grant from the National Institutes of Health(NIH) for her research using zebra sh as a model for growing replacement teeth. Theschool is evaluating space needs and costsfor bringing in an NIH-funded researcherto work in Dr. Yelick's lab. Also, DrissZoukhri recently received noti cation of $1 million in funding over two years fromthe National Eye Institute. As this issue went to press, the school anxiously awaited decisions on additional proposals for stim-ulus funding. As a result of mentoring by our research faculty, our students' interest in a broadrange of clinical and basic science researchis at an all-time high. In addition to con- ducting research here at Tufts, our students are being accepted to nationally competitiveresearch programs. Samantha Jordan, A06, D10, was the only dental student chosen to participate in the 2008 Howard HughesMedical Institute-National Institutes ofHealth (HHMI-NIH) Research ScholarsProgram, which each year brings 42 tophealth science students from across the country to the NIH campus in Bethesda, Md., to pursue biomedical research. Thisyear, our dental school became the rst in the country to have students accepted to the Research Scholars Program for two consec- utive years. Urvi Ruparelia, D11, is workingat the NIH now (see story, page 7). Our alumni and friends remain gen- erous supporters of our school. Over thelast decade, donations to the annual fund have grown continuously. However, this year, although the Tufts Dental Fund onceagain exceeded the $1 million mark, it didnot meet its ambitious goal for 12 percent growth. The decline can be attributed to anumber of factors, including the economicdownturn and the lack of a 25th reunion class this year (there was no Class of 1984in the D.M.D. program because the schoolwas transitioning from a three-year to afour-year curriculum). Even though the stagnant economic cli- mate affected all of us, it is gratifying thatyou made the school a priority for your phil-anthropic support. One of the highlights ofthe year was the second naming gift for our expansion project, from Louis Fiore, D62,and his wife, Jean. In 2007, they named the Dean's Suite, which will be on the new f- teenth fl oor. Now Dr. Fiore has once again demonstrated his generosity with a $1 mil-lion gift to name the new continuing educa-tion amphitheater in honor of his mother,Rachel (see story, page 42). His gifts to ourexpansion project total $1.26 million. Our new, state-of-the-art building is on target for a grand opening ceremonyon November 20. Remarkable progress has been made (see story, page 24). Last year at this time, crews were just placing thestructural steel beams. Now the ve-fl oor addition is completely enclosed, and nal work is under way on the plumbing, walls, fl oorings and countertops. Equipment for the new clinic spaces and furniture willarrive early this semester. This newest jewelof our community will provide the criti-cally needed space to advance our mission of providing an exceptional education and top-quality patient care. Our expansion project was well-timed, since other dental schools are building facilities or adding onto existing ones, andsome brand-new dental schools are beingplanned. With the new building, Tufts University School of Dental Medicine is uniquely positioned to remain competitivewith its peers and to continue to attract rst-rate faculty, students and staff. These are extremely exciting times at Tufts Dental. Now, more than ever, we are relying on your participation and continued support. On behalf of our students, staffand faculty, I extend our sincere apprecia- tion for your commitment to our school. lonnie h. norris, d.m.d., m.p.h.A SCAN OF PEOPLE, PLACES & EVENTS fall 2009 tufts dental medicine 5orphaned and vulnerable children from impoverished and war-torn African nations, including Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Nigeria and Uganda.

The pediatric dentistry department provided oral-health services through Chernobyl Children Project USA, a nonpro t that provides medical treatment and respite care for children from Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Even though the children had not been born when the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded in Ukraine in April 1986, elevatedlevels of radiation are still detectable. The children are experiencing the aftereffects: cancer; orthopedic, heart and eye conditions; kidney disease; a failure to grow. Each summer some of the Chernobyl children are brought to Tufts Medical Center and Tufts' pediatric dentists for care. Over two days on July 16 and 17, all 32 children received a comprehensive exam, and most of them spent a good half-day in treatment. Russian physi- cians who travel with the children assist with language translation. Mario Lucca, D02, chief resident in oral surgery, and Richard Sorbera, DG65, a clinical professor, removed a large benign tumor from the upper jaw of a 10-year-old boy. Fifteen Boston-area hospitals donate more than $450,000 in medical services to the children every year. Since Chernobyl Children Project USA was established in 1995, more than 1,500 children have received free medical and dental care.

If we could get children in here early enough, we could make dentistryobsolete,\" says Alexander, comparing him- self to a smallpox researcher who would be glad to put himself out of business. The Tufts students who train in the clinic are as grateful for the experienceas the children they treat. \"These kids who visited our depart- ment and entertained us with their tal- ented voices and dancing were a great window for us residents to see how somuch can be achieved if the right amount of time and guidance is invested in chil- dren,\" says Mohammed M. Ahmed, apostgraduate resident who treated Josh, the boy with the broken tooth. \"Our experiences with these children, alongwith other children who we treated in the past, just prove to us how simple treat- ments can touch their lives heavily.\" Out in the waiting room, Ahmed, DG09, gives Cornmesser detailed instruc- tions about follow-up care for Josh. \"No hot food, no hard or crunchy food untilhe heals,\" he says as he hands Josh a bag of dental swag. The boy, his mouth packed with gauze, rifl es through his goodie bag: a new toothbrush, toothpaste, floss and the bright plastic sunglasses the pediatric clinic uses as eye shields. Cornmesser wraps her arms around the boy. \"I'm just really happy to get my kids taken care of,\" she says.

She pored through more than 700 patient charts, pulling outdata for a study of the relationship betweensmoking and tempomandibular pain. Itwas a great experience that left Rupareliawanting to do more research. But as any dental student can tell you, between clinic, classes and exams, extra time for side proj-ects is hard to come by. So imagine her delight when she foundout that she will be conducting her very own research project, mentored by world- renowned scientists at the National Institutes of Health and using lab facilitieson the NIH campus in Bethesda, Md. Andshe has a whole year to do it. As one of only two dental students chosen by the Howard Hughes MedicalInstitute to take part in the HHMI/NIH Research Scholars Program this year, Ruparelia is taking a year off from Tufts tolearn how to be an investigator. \"It's meant for students who have had aThe Boston-to-Bethesda route is getting to be well-traveled around here by Julie Flahertylittle bit of research training, but nothing extremely formal,\" she says of the program,which funds research by 42 top medical,dental and veterinary students chosen fromaround the country. When she arrived onthe NIH campus in late August, she didn'tneed to know exactly what her project wouldbe. \"I just have to have an interest and driveto do it,\" she says. Most of her research experience came as an undergraduate at Georgia Tech, whereshe studied biomedical engineering. She spent much of her senior year on a cell and tissue engineering project that looked at thebone-grafting process. The daughter of a physician, Ruparelia decided to study biomedical engineering soshe could eventually help cure or preventillnesses at their source. \"I wanted to nd solutions that would help or treat more than one person,\" she says. She rst thought about dental medicine when she took a course on biomedical engi-neering in dentistry in which local dentists gave presentations on prosthetics, implants and the like. Ruparelia, who had herself got-ten an implant when she cracked a toothdown to the root her freshman year (andhas had her fair share of other dental proce- dures), says she was \"completely intrigued.\" Another dental student, Samantha Jordan, A06, D10, recently returned to Tufts from her year as an HHMI/NIH Research Scholar (see story, page 26).Ruparelia will have the chance to visit thevarious labs at NIH and meet with sev-eral scientists before choosing her proj-ect, which may end up having nothing to do with dentistry. Inspired by the medi- cal courses that are the foundation of thedental school curriculum (\"Tufts is really good about teaching you to not just look at the mouth,\" she says), she may want to dosomething involving autoimmune disor-ders or genetics. Ruparelia admits she is a little nervous about leaving Tufts, if only temporarily.\"I've become so attached to my classmates in the last two years,\" she says. But the timing is good. \"When I come back, I'll get my own patients and be able to fully go into the clinic.\" Plus, it's always good to have some friends who have lived throughthird year and can show you the ropes.Urvi Ruparelia, D118 tufts dental medicine fall 2009 PHOTO: PROFESSOR MIODRAG STOJKOVIC/PHOTO RESEARCHERS INC.HEN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH released new guidelines in July that removed barriers to the responsible use of human embry- onic stem cells in research, there was a frisson among American scientists who work with these promising cells. CountJonathan Garlick, head of the dental school's Division of Cancer Biology and Tissue Engineering, and his research team among them. Earlier this year Garlick's lab was the rst to grow multilayered tissues from human embryonic stem cells. These novel tissues closely mimic the top two layers of skin or oral tissues, and provide an invaluable model tostudy all kinds of oral diseases and potential drug therapies for them. Human embryonic stem cells, or hESCs, are powerful biomedical research tools because of what scientists call their pluripotency\u2014their ability to give rise to all of the human body's cell and tissue types. Garlick's team used an NIH-sanctioned line of embryonic stem cells (the cells okayed for federal research funding by theBush administration in 2001) to grow two separate populations ofcells: ectodermal cells, which comprise the top, protective layer of skin and oral tissues, and mesenchymal cells, the second, supportive layer in the skin and mouth. When the scientists seeded the two cell types onto the same three-dimensional scaffold made of collagen, the most abundant protein in skin and the mouth, the cells organized themselves intonaturalistic, multilayered tissues within two weeks. Led by rst author Kyle J. Hewitt, a graduate student in cell, molecular and develop- mental biology at the Sackler School, who works in Garlick's lab, the researchers reported their ndings in April in the online edition of the journal Tissue Engineering (A) . Previously, stem cell investigators were limited to studying single- layer tissues grown as two-dimensional cells in Petri dishes. \"We know the world is not fl at,\" says Garlick. \"Neither is biology. By usingpluripotent stem cells to make 3-D tissues that mimic their human counterparts, we are a step closer to a practical therapy for a variety of oral diseases.\" The lab's success in growing multilayered tissues also advances the researchers' ultimate goal: to learn how to transplant lab-grown replacement products to repair damaged and diseased tissues in human patients. The Garlick lab is also building on recent breakthroughs at Kyoto University in Japan and the University of Wisconsin, where research- ers were able to make adult skin cells revert to pluripotency with theinsertion of four genes. Since these reverted adult cells, known as induced pluripotent stem cells, share many of the features of em- bryonic stem cells, their use may allow scientists to circumvent theongoing ethical debate about the use of human hESCs. The discovery of pluripotent stem cells \"shatters the longstanding dogma in biology that the specialized state of adult cells is irreversible,\" says Garlick. Collaborating with Konrad Hochedlinger at Massachusetts General Hospital and Gustavo Mostoslavsky at Boston Medical Center, Garlick's team is comparing tissues derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to those derived from embryonic stem cells. If the tissues are biologically comparable, induced pluripotent stem cell researchcould pave the way for patient-speci c, personalized medicine. For example, an individual's own skin cells could be used to generate a customized tissue sample to test the safety and ef cacy of pharma- ceuticals or even cosmetics. \"It's an exciting time in the eld. I am surprised every day that we can do this,\" says Garlick. \"The implications for the future of humanhealth are dramatic.\" Long a hot-button issue, human stem cells at last may ful ll their promise as an invaluable tool for biomedical research by Jacqueline MitchellBREAKTHROUGH WLEADING-EDGE SCIENCE \u0093 We know the world is not flat.

The Tufts developmental biologist Pamela C. Yelick and her colleagues at three other universities are opti- mistic that the genetic machinations of the ice sh could shed light on what causes osteopenia\u2014a precursor to the brittle-bone disease osteoporosis in humans\u2014and ultimately how to arrest it. Millions of years ago, the Antarctic Ocean was not the unforgiving, frigid ecosystem we know today, but a temperate habitat that washome to many species of sh. Back then, ice sh species lived on the sea fl oor, an environment to which they had adapted so completely that they lost their swim bladder, an organ that regulates buoyancy inmost other kinds of sh. But about 34 million years a g o ,ac o m b i n a t i o no fa t m o -spheric and geologic conditions caused the Antarctic water tem- p e r a t u r e t o d r o p a b o u t 4 1 d e- grees Fahrenheit, to below zero, over just a few million years\u2014ablink of an eye in evolutionary terms. When other sh species died out or migrated to warmerwaters, the bottom-dwelling ice- s h w e r e po i s e d t o e x p l o i t t h e n e w l yv a c a t e do c e a nf e e d i n g grounds. Lacking swim bladders, the ice sh embarked on an evolu-tionary solution to their buoyancy problem. O v e rt h ec o u r s eo fa b o u t four million years, the spiny, prehistoric-looking ice sh shed bone density\u2014so much so that you can make out the shape of their organs through their fragile skeletons. The genetic adaptation allowed the former bottom-dwellers to swim and feed higher up in the ocean'swater column. At the same time, different ice sh species\u2014like Darwin's nches\u2014developed specialized jaw and facial morphology to exploit the new kinds of prey available to them. Yelick, G89, a professor of oral and maxillofacial pathology at the dental school, and her collaborators\u2014H. William Detrich, a biochem- ist at Northeastern University; R. Craig Albertson, a biologist atSyracuse University; and University of Oregon neuroscientist JohnPostlethwait\u2014are investigating the demineralization of the ice sh skeleton as a model for osteopenia. (Albertson worked in Yelick'slab at the Forsyth Institute in Boston before she came to Tufts in 2006.) Funded by a $2.48 million, ve-year grant from the National Institutes of Health, the researchers hope to identify the genes thatcontrol bone density in the ice sh. They suspect the same genes also regulate bone density in humans. \"The evolution of this decreased bone density is analogous to the development of osteopenia over a human lifetime,\" says Yelick, who directs the School of Dental Medicine's Division of Craniofacial and Molecular Genetics. \"You can use these slow evolutionary changes to study changes that might occur in a human lifetime,\" she told the journal Nature . Studying ice sh should reveal more about the genetic and molecular aspects of osteopeniain humans than the traditional scienti c methodology so-called \"knock-out manipu- lated to develop thinning bones. Osteopenia affects an estimated 34 million women and 12 million men in the United States, andthe disease often leads to the more-crippling osteoporosis.

What do you think you had to offer that the others didn't? I was pretty shocked when I was offered the job. I'm very much out of the mold of asso- ciation executives. Because I bring a little bit of academia, a fair amount of private prac-tice, a fair amount of senior management and a good deal of public health, I really bring an eclectic collection of experiences and skill sets. I think the board of directors cast a very wide net on purpose because they were looking for ways to refine their own thinking rather than going out and saying \"we're looking for an association executive.\" I admire their courage. My core values may have been part of what the board was look-ing for: integrity, accountability, acceptance, optimism and a focus on truth. It was really my husband who encour- aged me to express my interest in the posi-tion. Just from the description that was in the ADA News he said, \"This sounds like a good t for you.\" Q: What's on your to-do list? I have two very clear objectives: support the public's health and promote the profession. [The ADA has] had interim executive direc- tor leadership in the last year and a half, and I would like to move quickly and give the staff con dence that things are progressing in the right direction. I'm here to support them in their work. I de nitely see my role as working on behalf of the members and board of trust-ees. This isn't my show; this is their show. Q: Are they an innovative group? I would describe the ADA as kind of the Queen Mary: you change a vector today, and the outcome will be visible in a year or two. But there's a lot of innovative thinking, lots of various approaches, and especially passion for both the public good and the profession. Q: With the economy as it is, what are den- tists most concerned about right now? And what are patients most concerned about? Dentists are de nitely seeing postponement of preventative services, high-end services and even routine services. Dentists are reporting that they are booked out less far in advance than they were. At the same time they've seen an increased demand for services by people who are afraid of losing their jobs. I think many dental Medicaid programs will be in jeopardy. Dental disease among vulnerable people\u2014low-income kids, underemployed adults and frail elderly\u2014the need is escalating faster than we can meet it. If you superimpose this economic crisis on top of that, it's going to make for a ter-rible situation. I worry that we will lose the gains we've made in the last several years in increasing policymakers' awareness of how important oral health is. Q: Before you took this job, you spent some time consulting for Tufts Dental School, didn't you? I did some work on how to manage the cur- riculum when they lost the use of the simu- lation clinic during the vertical expansion project. The solution was to get students into the clinic during their first year and have them function as pseudo-assistants who are there to observe, to learn to be comfortable with patients, to watch treatment-planning decisions and get first-hand experience of what it's like to be in the dental practice. Q: Was the plan your idea? Consultants may like to take credit, but no. I listened and learned from what the faculty and students were telling me. The only way you can give anybody a good solution is to listen to them and understand what they need. I'm doing a lot of listening right now. Q: You were the rst female class president at Tufts Dental School, the school's rst female valedictorian, and now you're the rst woman to be executive director of the ADA. Do you attach any signi cance to that, or is it old hat by now? Kind of old hat, but I also think I'm [part of] that transition generation of women who went from the home front to the executive suite. It isn't as hard for women now as it was 20 years ago. Finally, I think the world accepts female senior executives as women with a dif- ferent style of leadership, not women dressed up like men and behaving in the workplace like men. I bring many traditional female qualities, such as empathy and nurturing, to my leadership style, in addition to effective decision making and disciplined execution. And I think that's great. I think women are accepted for their style, which is clearly dif-ferent. It's not better or worse, just different. Q: Are women well represented in the ADA leadership? Right now, the majority are men. But to become a leader in any profession it takes you 20 years. There is a lag period where leaders emerge. When I was a dental student, women made up 12 percent of the class. Now 50 per- cent of dental school classes are women, and I think within 15 years we're going to see a huge change in the complexion of organized den-tistry. You're going to see a lot more women moving up through the ranks. [The American Dental Association has] already had two women presidents, which is better than the United States. TDMkathleen o'loughlin, d81, isn't afraid of new challenges. in 2002, after spending 21 years caring for patients in her practice in Medford and later in Winchester, Mass., she changed course, saying goodbye to hands-on dentistry to become president and chief executive of cer of Delta Dental Plan of Massachusetts. In her ve years there, she helped the insurance company double its reserves and increase its mem- bership by 400 percent. Now she is executive director and chief operating officer of the American Dental Association, the world's oldest and largest national dental organization. With her background in private practice, teaching, research and health-care management, including a degree from the Harvard School of Public Health, she isn't your typical professional association adminis-trator. But after only a short time on the job (she began June 1) she has already pronounced the experience \"great.\" 12 tufts dental medicine fall 2009 \u0093 It\u0092s my job to get them out of pain.

His patients, of course, aren't exactly like those a dentist would see in private prac- tice. Some have complicated psychiatric pro les; others belong to gangs or have committed violent crimes. He sees more neglect, more hepatitis and more HIV than he might outside the penal system. More of his patients grew up mired in poverty or experienced periods of homelessness\u2014not situations where oral health care is a priority.With an assist from Tufts, these alums are able to care for inmates, veterans, Native Americans and rural folk BY JACQUELINE MITCHELL PHOTO: CATHERINE KARNOW14 tufts dental medicine fall 2009 PHOTO: KAREN SHELL But \"we treat everybody the same; every- body deserves the same standard of care,\" Chang insists, rephrasing that sentiment several times over the course of a conversa-tion. \"It's my job to get them out of pain,\" he adds. \"I don't do it just for a paycheck.\" But because he has about $100,000 in student loans, Chang does need to keep an eye on his nances. That's why he applied for, and received funds from, the Tufts Loan Repayment Assistance Program, or LRAP, which helps alumni working in public ser- vice careers pay their education debt. Thought to be the rst university-wide program of its kind, LRAP gives Tufts alumni the nancial breathing room they need to pursue the relatively low-salaried jobs in the nonpro t and public sectors. Given that a 2008 survey by the American Dental Education Association found more than 79 percent of dental school graduates have debts totaling more than $100,000\u2014as well as the School of Dental Medicine's focus on serving the underserved\u2014it's no surprise that a large number of Tufts Dental alumni sought assistance from LRAP, which awarded its inaugural grants last December. Funded by the interest from the Omidyar-Tuf ts Microf inance Fund\u2014 established in 2005 with Pierre Omidyar, A88, and Pamela Omidyar, J89\u2014and the Hargens Loan Repayment Assistance Fund, LRAP provided nearly $500,000 to 300 alumni, including 25 Tufts dentists, during its rst year. \"I really felt like my dental education could be used to provide dental care and promote overall good health for persons in underserved communities,\" says Jong-Bum John Seo, D07, who works at the Navajo Reservation in Winslow, Ariz. \"But the reality is that dentists in public health, on average, do not make as much as private-practice dentists,\" says Seo, who notes he has \"substantial\" debt from dental school. \"By participating in the LRAP program, I was able to worry a little less about the stresses of repaying loans.\" Seo, who grew up in Toronto, rst worked with the Navajo population in the Winslow Dental Clinic during a five-week extern- ship his senior year of dental school. It was a reality check. He was shocked by the need he saw, and by how few providers were around \u0093 Tufts cares about underserved communities, not only in Massachusetts, but also on the Navajo Reservation through graduates like me.\u0094 \u2014Jong-Bum John Seo, D07PHOTO: DAVID NEVALA to meet that need. \"Everyone from toddlers to the elderly needed so much dental educa-tion and care,\" says Seo, who returned to the Navajo Indian Nation with his wife, Yvonne Lee, D07, as a resident after graduation. He has been a staff dentist there for a year. Working in a geographically isolated area (Winslow is a town of 9,000 about halfway between Albuquerque and Las Vegas) means Seo performs all kinds of dentistry on all kinds of patients, from pediatric to geriat-ric and everyone in between. He's had to quickly become a dental jack-of-all-trades, doing xed and removable prosthodontics, endodontics, orthodontics, oral surgery and restorative dentistry. \"You don't get to pick and choose what you want to do,\" he says. \"If the doctors here don't perform services, no one else will.\" The Winslow clinic and its two satellite of ces in Leupp and Dilkon care for 18,000 patients every year. His work with the Navajos of northern Arizona, Seo says, is very rewarding. He is proud that he has taught children to use a toothbrush for the first time. He recalls delivering dentures to an elderly patient and seeing him smile with his new toothy grin. \"Tufts has equipped me with the tools to be able to infl uence people's lives,\" he says. \"LRAP shows that Tufts cares about underserved communities, not only in Massachusetts, but also on the Navajo Reservation through graduates like me.\" MORE RURAL, MORE NEED Roughly 25 million Americans lack access to adequate dental care as well as insur- ance to pay for it. In addition to racial and socioeconomic disparities that limit access to care, there are also geographic barriers. In 2001, the federal government estimated that 31 million Americans live in \"dental shortage areas,\" meaning there is less than one full-time dentist for every 5,000 people. Almost three-quarters of the 2,235 federally designated shortage areas are in rural parts of the country. Oregon, the Dakotas, Texas and most of the southeastern U.S. are expe-riencing the most acute need for dentists and other health-care professionals. Americans who live in remote areas gen- erally have poorer oral health, and overall health, than non-rural residents, according \u0093 It feels like home up here in northern Wisconsin, and I can see myself here for a long time.\u0094 \u2014Christina Dahlke, D05 fall 2009 tufts dental medicine 1516 tufts dental medicine fall 2009to a report from the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpro t think tank in Washington, D.C. Rural residents visit a dentist less often, and therefore have higher rates of untreated decay. They are less likely to drink municipal water and so are less likely to have access to the decay-prevent-ing bene ts of fl uoridated water. On top of that, a report of the National Rural Health Association found that just 14 percent of general dentists in the United States practice in rural communities. Among that tiny cadre of general prac- titioners is Christina Dahlke, D05, who, because of Tufts' loan assistance program, has been able to pursue her passion for living and working in some of the most remote and underserved regions of the country, despite owing $88,000 in education loans. A National Health Services Corps schol- arship paid for her last two years of dental school in exchange for her commitment to work in an area that does not have enough dentists. Dahlke spent more than three years at a community health center in Talkeetna, Alaska, a tiny rail town two and half hours north of Anchorage that fewer than 800 people call home. Despite its remoteness\u2014 or perhaps because of it\u2014Dahlke found that overall oral health in Talkeetna wasn't as bad as one might expect, although Alaska as a whole \"has some of the most compli- cated access issues and some of the worst oral-health disease in the nation,\" she says. \"Families eat pretty healthy out there because they have less access to convenience stores, fast-food restaurants and other junk food,\" she says. Alaska's state insurance plan covers kids' dental care, she notes. But it's a different story in Ashland, Wisconsin, where Dahlke has worked since last spring. Home to about 8,000 people on the southern shore of Lake Superior, Ashland once was a bustling shipping port, but the region has struggled with a stagnant economy since the second half of the 20th century. \"In rural Wisconsin,\" says Dahlke, \"the dental IQ is so low. Kids have way more early childhood caries than kids in Alaska.\" In neighboring Bay eld County, a pro- gram to provide sealants and varnish to chil- dren in the public schools and Head Start programs exposed a deep need for more dental care in the region. \"It seemed like every kid had unmet needs,\" says Dahlke. In response, the Lakes Community Health Center opened in Ashland in March 2009. Dahlke is the dental director and the clinic's only dentist. \"When the clinic opened, we had an over- whelming response,\" she says. \"Most dentists don't take Badger Care (Wisconsin's state health insurance), so there is a lot of unmet need in patients of all ages,\" says Dahlke, who estimates about 90 percent of her patients are covered only by Badger Care or Medicaid. The closest pediatric dentist who accepts Medicaid is three hours away, near Eau Claire. At rst, Dahlke tried to keep emergency slots for adult dental emergencies open in her daily schedule to alleviate some of the burden on the local hospital emergency room. Every day those slots were lled by children in pain. Dahlke also sees many adults at the clinic, especially medically compromised adults, with HIV or diabetes. \"It's a tragic situation. We're working pretty hard,\" she says.Although working two more years at the Lakes Community Health Center will ful- ll her commitment to the National Health Services Corps, Dahlke has no plans to leave the clinic or Ashland anytime soon. \"It feels like home up here in northern Wisconsin, and I can see myself here for a long time\u2014as long as I can get a co-worker,\" she laughs. PART DENTIST, PART COUNSELOR Michelle Hamilton also credits LRAP with helping her nd a permanent niche, living and working in an underserved commu-nity. You can hear the reverence in her voice as she talks about the men and women she treats at the Togus VA Medical Center in Augusta, Maine. When she mentions her youngest patient, an 18-year-old just back from Afghanistan, she uses the U.S. govern-ment's of cial title for the war, Operation Enduring Freedom. She calls the veterans of World War II, including her oldest patient, who is 103, \"a special group.\" But Hamilton, D05, has a soft spot for the Vietnam veterans she treats, many of whom feel marginalized to this day after serving in a politically divisive, unpopu-lar war. \"I really like hearing their stories,\" says Hamilton, who characterizes her job as \"part dentistry, part counseling.\" To some degree, all dentists need to be attuned to their patients' anxiety. But for many of Hamilton's patients, fear and stress take center stage. \"I think what happens is a lot of veterans come home with post-trau- matic stress disorder (PTSD), and dental care becomes a low priority because they are dealing with so many other things,\" she says. And when they do come to the VA clinic, Hamilton has to be aware of their existing or previous injuries; she needs to be care-ful not to trigger bad memories or anxiety. \"I tend to have to really work closely with the veterans to manage their care, especially those who suffer from PTSD,\" she says. The Togus VA Medical Center serves some 40,000 veterans each year. Staffed by four dentists, two residents (including Peter G. Vayanos, D09) and two student externs, Togus is the only VA dental clinic in the vast, mostly rural, often-snowy part of Maine sur-rounding the state's capital.

But after graduating in 2005, Hamilton did her residency at Togus. She says she found the work so gratifying that when a permanent position opened up in 2007, \"I decided I'd like to stay.\" \"Working for the government, we'll never make as much as in private practice,\" acknowledges Hamilton, who took the VA job before she learned about the Tufts loan assistance program from Mark Gonthier, the dental school's associate dean of admissions and student affairs. \"I accepted that, but it's nice to have some help,\" she says, noting that many loan assistance programs do not con- sider VA employees eligible. \"Tufts' program is unique that way.\" \"Every student who graduates with a loan worries about how to pay it off,\" Tufts President Lawrence S. Bacow says. \"We hope the LRAP program will make it easier for our graduates to pursue their passions and make a difference in the world.\" For Chang, LRAP has done just that. He describes himself as having been at a \"crossroads,\" looking to purchase a private practice, when the opportunity to work in the California correctional system pre- sented itself. \"It took me about a year to gure things out, but right now, I can hon- estly say I love my job, and I'd like to stay with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,\" he says. \"Perhaps I'll get into private practice when I retire in nine-teen years,\" he jokes.

He is bowed over his sheet music, his hand marking time to the playback of a recording. Only when Adrina DeVitre takes the stage and begins her dance solo does Lockhart look up from the page, his hand still keeping the beat, to watch. Although her smile is probably choreographed to enhance the appearance of effort-lessness, she looks genuinely happy. Is it the playful dance steps? The prestigious locale? Or is she just glad to be taking a break from studying for her physiology exam? As a professional dancer and a dental student, DeVitre is most likely the only member of the class of D12 who can perform a grand jet\u00e9 as easily as a cavity prep. Between high school and college, she spent three years performing professionally with the Boston Ballet, the Dance Theatre of Harlem and the BalletMet Columbus. While she put most dancing on hold during her rst year of dental school, this special performance with the Pops in May was a welcome outing. Sitting for several hours in class isn't easy for someone so used to constant movement. \"I was very excited to run off and go to rehearsal a couple times a week for this,\" she says. fall 2009 tufts dental medicine 1920 tufts dental medicine fall 2009Dentistry and dancing have long been a part of her life. Her parents, Virginia Shahinian, D77, DG79, and Rustam DeVitre, DG76, DI77, met at Tufts. As a girl, DeVitre often assisted them in their dental practices in Boston and Hingham. \"My mom would be called in during off hours\u2014'Adrina, get in the car'\u2014so I started like that,\" she says. \"It just felt natural. I would go assist my parents, and I would crave grab-bing the instruments. I love the little trinkets, all the burs, and those kinds of things.\" And dancing? Even as a little girl, she says, \"I wouldn't play with dolls or games or anything like that. Just run around the house dancing.\" Not wanting to dampen her daughter's creativity and sense of spirit, her mother didn't sign her up for lessons until she was about 8, and when she did, DeVitre wasn't very enthused. Her teacher paid more atten- tion to the girls she had trained since they were toddlers. DeVitre's real interest in ballet began at age 10, when she earned a tiny role in the Boston Ballet production of The Sleeping Beauty . \"I walked out on stage with a massive wig and hat, carried a tray to the Lilac Fairy, and then marched off,\" she says. The role was minimal, but seeing the costumes, the live orchestra and the beautiful dancers opened her eyes. \"Wow,\" she thought. \"This is such a magni cent world.\" The next year, she tried out for the Boston Ballet's production of The Nutcracker . Although she showed up late and slightly disheveled for the audition (\"My mom wasn't much of a stage mother, because, you know, she was a dentist\"), she landed, to her great surprise, the central role of Clara. DeVitre thinks her enthusiasm and expres- sive style gave her an edge. \"When I dance, I feel like I'm in my element and can communicate my emotions or those of my character freely,\" she says. She performed so well she was asked to repeat the role the following year. By eighth grade, she was commuting to Boston six days a week to attend class at the Boston Ballet School, often not returning home until 10 p.m. \"I would be so tired I would go to sleep and wake up at four in the morning to do my homework,\" she says. Dental school may be tough, but it's noth- ing compared to balancing dance training and academics at Milton Academy, where she went to high school. The dichotomy was harder on her psyche than her toes. In school, her teachers expected her to bring her insights to lively class discussions. But in ballet class, where the teachers are con- sidered all-knowing (she has trained with luminaries Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, Patricia Mcbride and Violette Verdy, three of George Balanchine's favorite dancers, for example), silence was the rule. \"I went from being expected to contrib- ute and having a voice to being in ballet and having no voice\u2014being a body, an instru-ment,\" she says. Even so, by age 16 she knew she wanted to be a professional ballet dancer. She deferred her admission to Columbia University and went to dance for the Boston Ballet. At 5-feet, 3-inches, she is on the smaller side for ballet dancers, which means she is often cast in fast roles with lots of jumps and turns, such as the Cupid Variation in Don Quixote , which is \"about balancing and fl irting with the audience,\" she says. If the part calls for spunky, bubbly and lots of per-sonality, it's hers. Unfortunately, after dancing with two other companies in New York and Ohio, a knee injury threatened her ability to dance full time. She began to look at other career options. Besides, she says, \"I wanted to get back into the classroom and continue stimulating my brain.\" After three years of deferrals, she told Columbia University she was ready. Throughout college, where she studied pre-med and French, she experimented with different dance styles. She joined an Indian classical fusion dance troop as well as a hip-hop group called Raw Elementz, which often performed at halftime during Columbia basketball games. \"I went from performing in these beau- tiful old theaters to the basketball court,\" she says. \"But it was so much fun, and the crowd was so enthusiastic.\" DeVitre, who has always loved learn- ing about the body, chose dentistry as a profession in the hope it will give her the fl exibility to continue dance training and performing. Her parents may have been something of an infl uence, too. \"I can't deny that they encouraged me to pursue a dental career,\" she says. Her dance training has prepared her in unexpected ways for dental school. When her professor presents the class with a cav-ity prep to copy for a practical, it reminds her of the countless times she has had to replicate a teacher's dance step. By now, copying is something of a forte for her. She also enjoys doing wax-ups, sculpting a complete tooth based on a fragment. After years of studying the body and the myriad ways a foot can turn or a hand can be posed, she appreciates the lines and contours of a tooth. \"I think ballet helps me see details that can often be overlooked,\" she says. And when some of her classmates were struggling to use the mouth mirror to work on upper teeth, she was amused that \"indi- rect vision\" was second nature to her. \"It's just very intuitive to me how to move the drill because I've been basing my move-ment off a mirror my whole life,\" she says. \"In ballet, you continuously look in the mir- ror to assess the way your body moves.\" If barre work is suddenly added to the dental school curriculum, you'll know who to thank.

Zarb mentioned that he was traveling to Sweden because he had read some compelling scientific literature by Per-Ingvar Br\u00e5nemark on the possibility of dental implants becoming a reality. \"And I pooh-poohed it,\" Chapman recalls. \"I said, 'Oh, that's not going to happen. All these charlatans talk about dental implants, and they are just trying to make money.' \" A few years later, Zarb introduced dental implants to North America, making a science-backed case that impressed even the skeptical Chapman. Now it was his turn to convince Tufts Dental School to embrace the technol- ogy. He and Norman Shepherd, D64, DG67, then a professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery, volunteered to give lectures about implants to students after-hours. They got a company to donate materials, persuaded the school to invest $30,000 in equipment (\"In 1985, this was a lot of money,\" Chapman says), and the Tufts Dental Implant Center, one of the rst in the country, was born. The implant center is just one milestone for Chapman, professor and chair of the depart- ment of prosthodontics and operative dentistry, who retired in August after 35 years on the faculty. He has lectured internationally on prosthodontics, occlusion, craniofacial function, quality of life in dentistry and dental implants. He has written articles, research abstracts and textbook chapters. He is a triple Jumbo who is leaving a legacy of teaching, research and even ethics reform. Not that he's particularly slowing down.

But perhaps most important, he worked for an inspiring oral surgeon, Robert Middleton, who led the den-tal service at Oakland Naval Hospital, where Chapman did his internship. \"He was one of those people who had tremendous curiosity about everything,\" Chapman says. \"He knew a lot because he read a lot. And he encouraged all us interns to read a lot,\" includ- ing dental journals from other specialties. That was how Chapman came to learn about temporomandibular disorders, a lesson that helped him make the rst big difference in a patient's life. The patient, a naval of cer's wife, had persistent head pain that no one could explain. \"For years she had been seeing psychia- trists and ear, nose and throat special-ists,\" Chapman recalls. The woman had had extractions as a kid, but without replacements for those missing teeth, her jaw muscles and joints were not properly positioned. \"I made her dentures that opened up her bite, and she became pain-free for the first time in 20-some years. I was so proud of myself.\" After the Navy, Chapman was offered a teaching fellowship in the prosthodontics department at Tufts. He earned his postgradu-ate certificate in 1974 and stayed on as a faculty member. When he returned to Tufts, Chapman brought along the curiosity he had learned from his mentor, Middleton. \"If something really interests me, I start investigating it and putting together what might seem to be very disparate pieces of information,\" he says. \"That has probably been one of the things that has made me successful in some ways and thought of as being a little wacky in others.\" For example, a friend who practiced transcendental meditation led him to a book on how meditation can bene t the body, includ- ing lowering blood pressure. Chapman wondered if TM could help with wound healing. Although he couldn't test meditation per se, he and his colleagues at Tufts did nd some interesting connections between its opposite\u2014psychological stress\u2014and the immune system. Looking at saliva samples from dental student volunteers, they found that students had fewer salivary immu-noglobulins (markers of immune health) during exam periods and more after less-stressful times, such as summer break. The results were published in the Lancet in 1983. With his interest in the immune system piqued, he went on to study how well bone heals around different implant surface materials. But perhaps Chapman's biggest embrace of the disparate was seeing a connection between dental health records and DNA. It came out of conversations with his brother-in-law, a Compaq executive who sold supercomputers to the biologist Craig Venter for use in mapping the human genome. As soon as electronic health records systems became available to dental schools in the early 1990s, Chapman saw the potential for mining that data. Just as the map of the human genome has provided scientists with new avenues for advances in medicine, the properly coded den- tal records of large numbers of patients could help researchers identify patterns, such as links between certain medications and periodontal disease. Chapman, the school's director of informatics, founded and chairs a consortium of 20 dental schools that have adopted a standardized form for collecting patient information; eventu- ally, they will share their data. \"There are a million patient visits a year out of these 20 schools,\" he says. In his spare time, Chapman has sought to enhance ethics educa- tion at the School of Dental Medicine. He was instru- mental in establishing the school's ethics committee in 1996 and creating a two- year ethics course that all students take. It warns students of the moral\u2014and practical\u2014 pitfalls of actions like \"taking money from insurance without doing the work or claiming more [work] than is warranted,\" he says. \"If you're caught, you suffer badly.\"If nothing else, retirement may give Chapman more time with his partner of nine years, Marc Yang, a professor of French literature at Wingate University in North Carolina, and with Yang's two teenage daughters, who he counts as part of his family. Asked how his students would characterize him, Chapman replies, \"Past students would say tough but fair.\" When other faculty members started teaching the bulk of the classes in the department, he only had to be fair. \"One thing I learned in the Navy was the captain should always be the good guy,\" he says. \"The executive of cer is the S.O.B.\" TDM Julie Flaherty, a senior health sciences writer in Tufts' Of ce of Publications, can be reached at julie.fl aherty@tufts.edu.\"IF SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTS ME, I START INVESTIGATING IT AND PUTTING TOGETHER WHAT MIGHT SEEM TO BE VERY DISPARATE PIECES OF INFORMATION.\" \u2014Robert Chapmanor months, faculty, students, staff and alumni have absorbed the details of the vertical expansion project that has added ve fl oors to the building at One Kneeland Street. They've read the updates on elevator openings and closings, and, for the most part, nodded approvingly when they saw the architectural drawings and fl oor plans. \"And then they see the space,\" says Mark Gonthier, associate dean of admis- sions and student affairs, \"and to the person, it's 'Wow.' \" They comment rst on the abundant natural light, let in by long swathes of fl oor-to-ceiling windows, and encouraged across the rooms by glass walls, soft paint colors and maple cabinetry. Then they marvel at the spaciousness\u2014 the 108-chair pre-clinical simulation laboratory, which runs nearly the entirelength of the fourteenth fl oor, and the 75-seat continuing education amphi- theater, which frames a phenomenal view of downtown Boston. \"The people who have seen the postgraduate clinics,\" Gonthier says, \"haveappreciated the quality of the space,\" includ- ing the open operatories and private treat- ment rooms. The clinics are complementedby separate laboratories for prosthodontics and orthodontics, plus specially designedand ventilated porcelain, casting, plaster and CAD/CAM rooms. The major construction is done, aside from the front entrance, which will soon feature a more striking glass entryway in keeping with the design of the upper fl oors. New microscopes, X-ray machines, furniture and artwork are on their way.

Opposite page: the 108-seat simulation clinic features a wall of windows. administrative of ces (including some people who have been working in rented space out-side One Kneeland Street) will begin movingto the fourteenth and fteenth fl oors. Once the clinics close for the winter break on December 17, the endodontics and orthodon-tics departments will moveto the eleventh floor, and theperiodontics and prosthodon-tics departments will take upresidence on the twelfth fl oor. By the time second semester begins on January 4, the wait-ing rooms will be ready to receive patients. Everything is on schedule, right down to the arrival of ahalf dozen tractor-trailers that delivered the new dental chairs and con- soles in the beginning of August. This adherence to the timeline is all the more amazing considering the building remained open for teaching and patientcare throughout the 18-month construc- tion project. To minimize disruptions, the builder, the project manager and theschool engaged in some careful chore- ography, planning around exam periods and occasionally relocating classes so thatnoise and vibrations would not disrupt thelearning process. \"We really have not lost a single day because of construction,\" says A. JosephCastellana, the school's executive associate dean. \"This is not to say that there haven't been inconveniences.\" The underpinnings ofa new freight elevator, for example, are now positioned in what used to be the of ce of Stanley Alexander, D75A, chair of pediatricdentistry. \"Dr. Alexander has been perma- nently displaced from his of ce,\" Castellana says. \"He took it extremely well.\" The project was recently nominated for a Building of America Award by Real Estate & Construction Review magazine, in part because of the ingenuity required toexpand a skyscraper in a crowded urbanarea. Because the building is bordered bybusy streets, a subway line, a sky bridge and narrow alleys, there was no maneuverableand structurally sound spot to secure thecrane that hoisted construction materialsto the ve new fl oors. \"We had to ultimately bolt it to the roof of the building,\" says Tony Miliote, man-aging director of health care and science for Shawmut Design and Construction, which is doing the work. Although suchworkarounds have been done before, \"it is very, very rare,\" he says. The contractor also had to think from the top down when it came time to erectthe fa\u00e7ade of the building. With no ground area to secure a scaffold, they suspended 19 scaffolds around the face of the building,a more dangerous and more complicated process. Even so, \"it's been a very smooth job,\" Miliote says. One of Castellana's favorite features is the internal staircase that unites the clinics on fl oors 11 and 12. The architects, he says, were sensitive to the fact that they \"were taking programs that were physically in very close proximity\u2014in fact, in too close proximity\u2014and spreading them out not only from onefl oor to two, but in twice the square footage. We segregated them but didn't want to alterthe way clinicians and patients among thefour programs interact.\" The central staircase, he says, is \"vast and bright and airy\" and visually connectsthe two fl oors. A similar staircase between the fourteenth and fteenth fl oors shouldfoster interactions between the continuing education center and the alumni lounge onefl oor above. \"It is also a way to help alumni engage with the school,\" he says. One design change could have an important impact on the veryculture of the dental school. Boththe eleventh and twelfth fl oors are divided into two distinct halves:patient treatment and consultationareas on the west side, and sup-porting offices, conference areas and locker rooms on the east. Castellana, a former hospi- tal administer, was introduced tothe concept at a medical center in Louisiana, although the idea is based on Disney World, where employeesare always in character in the pub- lic areas, but can speak candidly about park business in areas behind the scenes. Faculty have already begun referring to the \"on-stage\" and \"off-stage\" areas oftheir departments, Castellana says. Theon-stage areas are all about attending topatients. \"When you go off stage, you cantalk about how dif cult the exam was, or discuss a student's skill or de cits in a set- ting where the conversation is confiden- tial,\" Castellana says. A similar on-stage/off-stage design is planned for floors 2, 3 and 4, which will be getting their own makeover in the com- ing years; preliminary plans may be drawnup as early as 2010. In the meantime, small changes, such as replacing the ceiling, lighting and sound system in the eighth-floor pre-clinic, should improve life forpre-doctoral students. With the new space only months from occupancy, Gonthier thinks back to what itmust have been like for the dental school to move to 136 Harrison Avenue in 1949 and to One Kneeland Street in 1972. \"And now you have the next chapter,\" he says, \"which I think in many ways is positioning us to have the best facility inthe country and the best resources in thecountry.\" PHOTOS: ALONSO NICHOLS fall 2009 tufts dental medicine 25ON CAMPUS 26 tufts dental medicine fall 2009 PHOTOS: JOANIE TOBINThe Other Side of Dentistry learned more in one summer than some people learn in an entire year,\" Farah Assadipour, D11, says Yelick, G89, direc-tor of the Division of Craniofacial and Molecular Genetics, and her colleagues are trying to grow replacement teeth for patients who were not born with a full set or have lost some as a result of disease or injury. Assadipour spent last summer trying to nd the ideal material on which to grow the tiny cluster of cells, known as a tooth bud, into a full-sized, well-shaped tooth. Working with Weibo Zhang, a postdoctoral associate in Yelick's lab, Assadipour cultured the tooth-bud cells and seeded them on two types of collagen-Matrigel scaffolds to determine which would yield the best tooth. They analyzed protein expression inthe young tooth-bud cells to determine how they were thriving anddifferentiating. \"It was a lot of trial and error,\" says Assadipour, who is completing her analysis and follow-up on those initial ndings. It was Assadipour's rst foray into research and one that she had hoped would be \"a unique experience for me.\" She wasn't dis-appointed. \"I got to learn something nobody else has,\" she says. More than that, Assadipour says, engaging in research is a char- acter-builder. Researchers, she notes, learn to deal with failure and solve problems and adapt to rapidly changing situations. \"Doingresearch really taught me to make decisions on the spot to the best of my ability and to be proud of my choices in the end,\" she says. \"This was my project from beginning to end.\" At this year's Bates-Andrews Day, Assadipour's project, \"Bioengineering Dental Microtissues in a Collagen-MatrigelConstruct,\" received the Research Committee Award for BasicScience Research.

While she is still leaning toward a career in clinical practice, Assadipour says she won't rule out research. \"I'm more complete as astudent now,\" she says. \"This has been an irreplaceable experience.\" A YEAR IN THE BIG LEAGUES Tufts University and research are practically synonymous, saysSamantha Jordan, A06, D11. As an undergraduate majoring in bio- chemistry, she worked in the lab of Larry Feig, professor of biochem- istry at the School of Medicine and director of the biochemistry pro-gram at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. Shestudied the ras protein, which facilitates communication betweencells and also plays a role in early can-cer development. When she enrolled atTufts School of Dental Medicine, thetransition to Jonathan Garlick's lab\u2014where researchers investigate oral can-cer progression in three-dimensional tissue models\u2014seemed natural. It was Garlick, director of the Division of Cancer Biology and Tissue Engineering, who encouraged Jordan to apply for a Howard Hughes Medical Institute-NationalInstitutes of Health (HHMI-NIH) Research Scholarship. Jordanwas the only dental student in the country to receive one of 42 scholarships awarded for the 2008-09 academic year. She spent the year at the NIH in Bethesda, Md., working with Christian C.Abnet, a scientist in the National Cancer Institute's nutritional epidemiology branch. Jordan's NIH research, \"A Prospective Study of Tooth Loss and Cancer Risk in a Cohort of Male Smokers,\" won the Massachusetts Dental Society/ASDA Public Health Award at this year's Bates- Andrews Day. The study looked at\u2014and found\u2014a link betweentooth loss and some kinds of cancer in men who smoke. Using data from a long-running Finnish nutritional study, Jordan determined the number of teeth smokers had when they rst enrolled in the study in 1985 and calculated their risk of contracting 18 kinds of cancer over the next 20years. She discovered that smokers with fewer teeth indeed ran a higher risk of developing some types ofcancer, including lung, esophageal and pancreatic,than did smokers who had more teeth. Because smoking is known risk factor for both tooth loss and cancer, Jordan had to be sure she was seeing areal association between the conditions, not just two unfortunate consequences of smoking. To do that, she adjusted her model for both the number of years themen smoked and the number of cigarettes they smokedeach day. Additionally, she ran another model compar-ing only people who smoked a pack of cigarettes per day.Both models showed a direct link between edentulismand several types of cancer. That's important because while the link between oral health and cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and overall health hasbeen well established, Jordan found little research on the relation- ship between oral health and cancer. \"One of the major goals of public health is to identify modi able risk factors for disease and to develop effective interventions forprevention,\" she says. \"Oral health is a modi able risk factor, and it's one that has often been neglected. Compared to smoking, poororal health may have a much smaller effect on the risk for systemic disease, but it might be easier to get someone to pick up a tooth- brush than to put down a cigarette.\" Abnet, Jordan's research mentor at NIH, hypothesizes that the association between edentulism and cancer may have to do with the oral bacteria that causes tooth loss. Something about the bac- teria itself might increase the risk of developing cancer, or thechronic infl ammation it causes may predispose the body to the disease. Or, Jordan adds, an underlying genetic component couldexplain the link. Now back at Tufts, Jordan's next step is to get her results pub- lished. After she completes her D.M.D., she hopes to pursue more formal epidemiology training. She eventually plans on a careercombining clinical practice and research.

Wright, an assistant professor of public health and community service, and BEST Oral Health, a state- funded preventative dentistry program that serves preschoolers inwestern Massachusetts, to quantify how oral health affects children's quality of life, including their ability to eat, play and learn. Coleman had the dental hygienists in the Bringing Early- Education Screening and Treatment (BEST) program distribute anoral-health questionnaire to the parents of children they treated.The 14-question survey asked parents to rate their children's oral health on a scale from one to ve, where one was excellent and ve was poor. Another set of questions asked about eating and sleeping habits and social life.Questions such as \"did your child not feel like playingwith his/her friends because of his/her mouth?\u2014werealso scored on a scale from one to ve, one being \"all of the time,\" and ve being \"did not happen.\" Parents of 390 kids whose average age was 3, com- pleted the survey. As Coleman hypothesized, the data showed significant correlation between oral health status and quality of life. Coleman wants to build on his Bates Day research, \"Early Childhood Caries and Quality of Life inPreschool Children,\" by checking in on the 390 chil-dren surveyed. Because the kids receive treatment through the BEST program, \"I hope to see that their quality of life went up,\" he says. It is a population that is in dire need of dental care. Kids in the Greater Springfield area develop toothdecay at twice the national rate. \"I came to the health profession to help,\" Coleman says. \"With public health research, you can seethe impact on patients immediately. It' s reallygratifying.\"ON CAMPUS To provide patients with ever-higher- quality care, dental education needs to fully embrace biomedical research and all its bene ts and teach students to think critically, said Bruce J. Baum, D71, in his keynote address at this year's Bates-Andrews Day, the School of Dental Medicine's annual student research fair. \"As health-care professionals we are obliged to improve the standard of care avail- able. I was taught that lesson on my rst day at Tufts by Dean [Louis J.P.] Calisti,\" said Baum, chief of the gene transfer sectionat the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. Research provides the intellectual basis of dentistry, he said, citing ndings on fl uoride, antibiotics andvaccines that led to paradigm shifts in clini- cal practice. Baum himself is renowned for pioneer- ing research that could lead to quality-of-life improvements for many oral-cancer and dry-mouth patients. Baum still remembers sitting at the back of a lecture hall and chatting to a friend when his \"Eureka moment\" hit. Heknew that radiation treatments for head and neck cancers routinely destroy the salivaryglands\u2014as do certain autoimmune diseas- es\u2014and the resulting xerostomia leaves pa- tients at high risk for tooth decay. He thought he could deliver genes to make salivary ductsdo the work of the damaged gland. \"But I had no background in that,\" he said. Trained as a protein chemist, it was his ability to think critically that allowed him to transfer his skills to a different eld andbuild on his fl ash of inspiration, he said. In 1997, Baum and his colleagues published a seminal paper in the Journal of Dental Research , describing novel gene transfer techniques to get dysfunctional salivaryTHE THOUGHTFUL PRACTITIONER \"With public health research, you can see the impact on patients immediately,\" says Daniel Coleman, D11.

Dental students and educators must \"recognizethat critical thinking is a technique itself,\" he said. \"That is what scientists do,\" he noted, drawing a parallel between a researcher gathering data to develop a hypothesis and a clinician identifying symptoms to developa diagnosis. Baum said he was heartened by the research showcased at this year's Bates-Andrews Day. \"I am blown away by the spectrum of different projects,\" he said.\"Take advantage of these opportunities at and outside Tufts if you can,\" Baum urged.\"You'll be a much better clinician.\" \u2014jacqueline mitchell \" It doesn't matter if you practice in the third world or the rst world ... patientsbene t from dental clinicians who aretrained to think logically,\" says Bruce J.

Her major focus has been as principal investigator on clinical trials involving various aspects of dry mouth (xerostomia), including drug therapy for patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syn-drome, a disease that causes a person's immune system to attack and destroy the salivary glands.UNIVERSITY NEWS THE WIDER WORLD OF TUFTS fall 2009 tufts dental medicine 41 PHOTO: ALONSO NICHOLSUNIVERSITY NEWS THE WIDER WORLD OF TUFTS o most bostonians, the idea would be patently absurd.What if the umpires calling aRed Sox-Yankees game were on the Steinbrenners' payroll? \"It's a pretty basic principal\u2014we all recognize that people in a position of judg-ment shouldn't have ties to the parties theyjudge,\" said Adam C. Urato, assistant pro-fessor of obstetrics and gynecology at theSchool of Medicine. He was the keynotespeaker at a Tufts symposium on confl ict of interest in academic medicine. Urato first became concerned with conflicts of interest in medicine in 2005,while attending grand rounds at TuftsMedical Center. He heard a speaker fromGlaxoSmithKline advocate universal prena-tal herpes screening. He knew that screening the 4 million U.S. women who are pregnant every year for the herpes virus would resultin about a million prescriptions for the drug company's antiviral medication, Valtrex. He also knew that while there is no proven ben-e t of universal prenatal screening, there is evidence the practice can increase the likeli- hood of Caesarian deliveries. \"No expert panel recommends herpes testing during pregnancy, but we have this oddball scenario where physicians in theUnited States are more likely to learn thewrong protocol because these continu-ing education activities are sponsored by[pharmaceutical companies],\" Urato said. Now Urato is worried about drug com- panies' infl uence on the debate surround- ing antidepressant use during pregnancy.In 2006, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study that found that women who discontinue antidepres-sant medications during pregnancy have a high risk of relapsing into depression. But, noted Urato, the article failed to address the well-known problem ofwithdrawal from antidepressants, nor did it mention pregnancy outcomes of womenwho took medications during gestation. The authors also didn't disclose their closeties to the pharmaceutical companies thatmake antidepressant drugs, claiming theirstudy did not advocate any particular classor brand of antidepressant, and thereforewas confl ict-free. \"Who buys that argument? Not the edi- tor of the New York Times , who called it 'pre- posterous,' \" Urato said. While 94 percent of physicians have relationships with drug anddevice makers, 85 percent of the public nds these arrangements unacceptable. Doctors ignore the public's skepticism at their peril, Urato said. \"Medicine is los-ing the public's trust for the same reason we don't trust Ronald McDonald when he tells us where to buy a hamburger,\" he said. \"Wesimply can't be both paid spokesmen and unbiased authorities.\" \"Medical research enjoys a huge percent- age of the federal budget for research,\" addedTufts Vice Provost Peggy Newell, a panelist at the May 13 symposium, which was spon- sored by the University-wide CommitteeHow do we make sure that academic medicine isn't tainted by ties to drug companies? by Jacqueline MitchellUneasy Alliance Ton Ethics. \"Once the public loses faith in research done in hospitals and universities,they will not be so eager to support it, so it'scritical that all of us worry about confl icts of interest,\" said Newell, whose of ce man- ages Tufts researchers' collaborations with industry. Newell tells researchers that beforethey sign any agreements, imagine the dis-closure of their nancial ties splashed across the front page of the New York Times . A QUESTION OF INTERPRETATION Such disclosure of nancial ties is \"neces- sary but not suf cient to solve the prob- lem of conflict of interest,\" argued pan-elist Jerome P. Kassirer, DistinguishedProfessor of Medicine at Tufts. Kassirer,the author of On the Take: How Medicine's Complicity with Big Business Can EndangerYour Health , is a well-known critic of con- fl icts of interest in medical research. \"The individual listening to an expert or read-ing a study does not know how to inter-pret [disclosures]. The answer to confl ict of interest is to get rid of it.\" But Michael Rosenblatt, dean of the School of Medicine, cautioned against \"applying a blunt instrument to something that should be done more thoughtfully andsurgically.\" His own collaborations withindustry resulted in the development of Fosamax, the first drug shown to reduce fractures in patients with osteoporosis. \"I'mvery proud of what I did with Fosamax. Ifeel like I've saved lives,\" Rosenblatt said,citing research that 20 percent of elders whosuffer hip fractures die within two years. He added that many antibiotics, vaccines, gene therapies and drugs that cure cancersand manage AIDS \"would not have been developed without the very real interface between academia and industry.\" However, panel moderator Sheldon Krimsky, a professor of urban and envi- ronmental policy and planning in the School of Arts and Sciences, considersconflicts of interest a threat to the acad- emy itself. \"Universities are the rare place in our culture where people don't have toget permission to write or publish, and this privilege should be protected at any cost. It's important to protect the knowledgeprocess,\" he said. Adam C. Urato42 tufts dental medicine fall 2009 PHOTO: BRIAN TIETZouis fiore, d62, is very clear about the inspiration for his gift to fund a new 75-seat amphitheater at the School of Dental Medicine: \"Tufts gave me the opportunity to become a dentist, and without Rachel Fiore, I never would have had the opportu- nity to attend Tufts.\" Rachel's Amphitheater, named for Fiore's mother, will be located on the new 14th fl oor of the dental school, part of an expansion project that is adding ve fl oors atop the building at One Kneeland Street. \"My mother worked so hard her whole life so I could succeed in mine,\" Fiore says. \"The gift recognizes how highly I value Tufts' role in my life.\" Rachel Fiore's story mirrors that of many immigrants who came to the United States in the early 20th century in search of work and a better life. Born RachelValvo in the small town of Naro, Sicily, in 1900, she was only 16 when she leftItaly to take a job at the Bigelow-Sanford Carpet Co. in Thompsonville, Conn.She married at age 20 and had ve children, one of whom died as a toddler. Louis was the youngest, and when he started elementary school, his mother returned to the carpet factory, working from two in the afternoonuntil ten o'clock at night. \"In the morning, she got me out to school, did her baking and laundry, and prepared lunch so it was waiting when I came home at noon. She left dinner prepared for our fam-ily, and after her shift in the factory, she'd walk home and nish whatever needed to be done before retiring for the evening. This washer daily routine,\" Fiore recalls. He says their relationship was built on love and respect. \"When my mother was work-ing,\" he notes, \"she had to trust me to follow the rules. I was supposed to be in before dark, and when the streetlights came on, I alwaysran home.\" Although his mother died when Fiore was just 16, he had already decided to become a dentist, a career Rachel supported. \"WhenI received my Tufts diploma,\" he says, \"my mother was the rst person I thought of.\" Fiore retired from practice in 1984 because of health issues. He and his wife, Jean, raised four children. \"Of course, they never knew my mother,\" he notes, \"but thisgift to Tufts has brought up a lot of memoriesand will help them to understand how muchshe meant to me.\"Rachel's Amphitheater honors the woman who made a Tufts education possible by Deborah BlaggA Devoted Son LLouis Fiore, D62, at his home in Fort Myers, Fla.PROVIDING THE MEANS FOR EXCELLENCE BEYOND BOUNDARIESfall 2009 tufts dental medicine 43 PHOTO: J.D. SLOANE sther wilkins, d49, dg66, has achieved much in her life byseizing opportunities and stay-ing focused on the future. As the donor of a new scholarship to honor her late husband, James B. Gallagher Jr., A47, D49, DG68, she is helping future generations ofbright Tufts dental students advance theirown professional paths. Wilkins was raised by a mother who expected both her daughters to attend col-lege. Her sister became a teacher, but Esther decided to try nursing. \"Not long after my graduation from Lowell High School, mymother drove me to Children's Hospital for an interview,\" she recalls. \"She sat in thecar and waited. That was in 1934, when justdriving to Boston was quite an event.\" Wilkins was turned away from the nursing program because she was too young, but that drive into Boston was a rst step in a remark- able career. After earning a B.S. at SimmonsCollege, she trained as a dental hygienist atthe Forsyth School in Boston. She worked asa hygienist in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., for six years before deciding she wanted to do more in dentistry. She enrolled at TuftsDental School, continuing to work part-time as a hygienist. She graduated as one of nine women in the Class of 1949. Following aninternship at the Eastman Dental Dispensaryin Rochester, N.Y., Wilkins was the founding director of the dental hygiene department at the University of Washington School ofDentistry in Seattle. While there, she wrote Clinical Practice of the Dental Hygienist (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins). Now inits tenth edition, the book is known as \"the bible of dental hygiene.\" Returning to Tufts in 1964, Wilkins completed her postgraduate training in periodontology and has been a clinical pro- fessor at the school since 1966. Although Wilkins and her future hus- band were in the same undergraduatedental school class, they only became close in the mid-1960s, when both were pursu-ing postgraduate work at the school. \"My husband was a shy, gentle man and a won- derful teacher,\" she says of Gallagher, whowas an associate professor at Tufts DentalSchool from 1962 to 1984. \"He had a greatsense of humor, and he cared deeply abouthis students,\" Wilkins says. \"When I meet his former students now, they always smile when I mention his name.\" The Dr. James B. Gallagher Jr. and Dr. Esther M. Wilkins Scholarship Fund will provide annual aid to a third-year studentwho demonstrates academic achievement.\"It's a memorial to my husband and hisdevotion to teaching, but it also refl ects my own understanding of what itis to be a student with nancial needs,\" Wilkins says. \"I worked very hard to get through myown education, and it feels right to make a gift that will lessen the nancial burden on a deserving student who may be strugglingto complete the program.\" Ann Sagalyn, D79, was a student of both Wilkins andGallagher, but the two women have come to know each other better through alumni events.\"Esther Wilkins is an excellent teacher of periodontal therapy,\" says Sagalyn, \"but of course sheis best known as 'the mother of modern dental hygiene'.\" A general dentist with a practice in Avon, Conn., Sagalynsays she sometimes takes her hygienists tohear Wilkins lecture, and they are \"always impressed that I know her.\" Sagalyn, who recently established the Drs. Ann M. Sagalyn and Suzanne Rothenberg Endowed Scholarship Fund, hails from a family of dentists. Her grandparents, Miziaand Zuccio Rothenberg, received theirtraining at Novo Russian Imperial University in Odessa, Russia, and practiced general den- tistry in Boston after coming to the United States in 1921. Suzanne Rothenberg, D41,Sagalyn's aunt, inspired her niece to valuethe \"human side\" of dentistry, especially \"theimportance of getting to know patients andtreating them in the context of their broaderlives,\" Sagalyn says. Sagalyn earned her undergraduate degree in zoology at the University ofWisconsin. After graduating from Tufts, she completed a two-year family practiceresidency at the University of Connecticut.\"The dean's aim was to train general den-tists with specialty-level skills in periodon- tics, oral surgery, endodontics, restorativedentistry and prosthodontics,\" she says. \"Keeping up with all phases of dentistry, in my estimation, is what makes general den-tistry the most dif cult specialty.\" Sagalyn opened her own practice in 1984. She chose her specialty \"because there is always a shortage of competent general den-tists.\" She hopes her scholarship, which willsupport outstanding fourth-year students, will raise the pro le of general dentistry. \"We need more young dentists in this eld, and I hope some of this scholarship money willreach students\u2014especially women\u2014who have an interest in providing patients with quality care and continuity of care. \"This isn't the most glamorous or high- est-paid specialty,\" Sagalyn adds, \"but on a daily basis, the professional and personalrewards are great.\" Ann Sagalyn, D79, left, a former student of Esther Wilkins, D49, DG66, center, have gotten to know each other betterat alumni events.

Manning, DG69, will support postgraduate endodontics at Tufts Dental School. Manning, who died in 2004, practiced endodontics in California for more than two decades and was a part-time clinical instructor at theArthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry at the University of the Paci c. Manning's gift will support the Manning Library, part of the new postgraduate endodontics space at the school, which is undergoing a ve-fl oor expansion. When the ex-pansion project is completed this fall, each postgradu- ate department will have a similar conference room/ library with state-of-the-art technology for seminars andteleconferencing. After growing up in Gardner, Mass., where his father was an ophthalmologist, Manning attended Bates College and earned hisdental degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He completed his internship in the U.S. Army Dental Corps in Germany, rising to the rank of captain. Manning became interested in endodontics while working in Worcester, Mass., with Melvin Goldman, who was instrumental in establishing Tufts' endodontics program. When he nished his postgraduate study at Tufts in 1969, Manningbegan a long career with Burns, Moore and Manning Endodontics in San Mateo, Calif. The practice served a number of celebrity patients,including Bing Crosby, with whom Bruce Manning shared a passion for golf, his brother, Paul Manning, says. \"After Bruce helped him through a dental emergency the night before a television appear- ance, Bing invited him to play at his tournament at Pebble Beach every year,\" Paul Manning says. After he retired in 1992, Manning taught part-time at the Dugoni School of Dentistry, where he is remembered still as a committed teacher who demanded the best fromhis students. In his later years, Manning divided his time between Florida and California, and for a time also owned a home in Scotland, near the Royal Dornoch Golf Club, the second oldest golf course in the world. An avid sportsman, Manning also en- joyed duck hunting and was a member of the Olympic Club in San Francisco and the Shivas Irons Society, a network of golf enthusi- asts in a dozen countries. Manning also placed a high value on education. In addition to Tufts, he included Bates College, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of the Paci c as bene ciaries of his estate. \u2014deborah blaggEstate Gift Establishes Manning Library JULY 1, 2009-JUNE 30, 2010 At the start of a new scal year, we are reminded again of the extraordinary impact annual fund dollars have on our students.
