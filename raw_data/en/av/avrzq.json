PhD Lab Coat Ceremony The [PhD Lab Coat Ceremony](http://icahn.mssm.edu/education/graduate/events/lab-coat) serves as a symbolic introduction into professional training for newly matriculated PhD students in Biomedical Sciences and Neuroscience programs, as well as the Medical Scientist Training Program. During the ceremony, the students will receive their lab coats from distinguished members of the Grad School faculty, and will confirm their commitment to professionalism and excellence as they embark on their research and graduate studies. Seminars and Symposia You can supplement your classroom learning with lectures from experts, explore areas of interest through classes and research, and network with peers and experts from other programs, disciplines, and academic institutions by attending our seminars and symposia. Basic Sciences and Neuroscience Our Departments, Centers and Institutes offer a diverse range of seminars and symposia in the basic sciences and neuroscience, including: [The Computational Genomics Seminar Series](https://mountsinaicgseminarseries.wordpress.com/)sponsored by The Icahn Institute at Mount Sinai [The Department of Regenerative Biology Research and Work-in-Progress Seminar Series](http://drb.mssm.edu/labs/seminars.html) [The Genetics, Big Data, and Medicine Seminar Series,](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics/news/gbm/schedule)co-sponsored by The Icahn Institute and Nature Reviews Genetics [The Immunology Institute Seminar Series](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/immunology/events) [The IPM Seminar Series, Medicine](https://events.mountsinaihealth.org/search/events?past=1&search=IPM+Seminar+Series)sponsored by the Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine [MSNseminars](http://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments/neuroscience/seminars), hosting leading postdoctoral fellows as speakers from Mount Sinai and around the country [The Translational Neuroscience Symposium Series and Events](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/friedman/events)from the Friedman Brain Institute [Oncological Sciences Seminar Series](https://events.mountsinaihealth.org/calendar?event_types%5B%5D=42571) [The Systems Biology Programmatic Meeting at the New York Academy of Medicine](http://www.omics4tb.org/node/80), co-sponsored by NIAID Systems Biology for Infectious Diseases Research Clinical, Translational, Public Health, and Health Leadership We also offer a range of seminars and symposia in clinical and translational medicine, public health, and health leadership: [Graduate Program in Public Health Spotlight Seminar Series](https://events.mountsinaihealth.org/event/graduate_program_in_public_health_spotlight_series) [Infectious Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute for Translational Epidemiology [The Institute for Health Care Delivery Science Seminars](http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/population-health-science-policy/institute-for-health-care-delivery-science/events) [Intellectual Property & Commercialization Speaker Series](http://www.ip.mountsinai.org/ip-commercialization-speaker-series/) Research Days and Retreats Research Days and Retreats are important parts of your graduate school training. They enable you to showcase your research, practice your presentation skills, receive feedback on your projects, and find out about the research work of faculty and the research interests of your peers. - We invite MSTP (MD/PhD) graduate students to submit abstracts and posters and have their work judged by faculty during [Medical Research Day](/education/medical/events/research-day)in April. MD/PhD students can also showcase their work during the MSTP Retreat in September. - Throughout the year, many of our MTAs and Institutes also offer Research Days, often combined with Retreats, such as the [Friedman Brain Institute Neuroscience Retreat](/research/friedman/events/annual-retreat)and the Cancer Biology Annual Retreat. At these events, graduate and dual-degree students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty share their investigatory work with abstracts, posters, and presentations. Many laboratories also host their own retreats. - Public Health students present their research and capstone projects at The Public Health Research Day in June. - Our Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) has a Research Day and poster session in August. Our Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) scholars enjoy their own Research Day in May. Journal Clubs, Workshops and Special Interest Student Groups We provide a multitude of informal forums, educational workshops, special interest groups, and other learning resources to help you hone your skills and/or develop new skills. Some of our many learning resources include: - Academic Grant Resources - Academic Grant Writing Support [Funding Resources for Your Research Ideas](/research/portal/funding) - Journal Clubs are offered by most programs, every multidisciplinary training area (MTA), and many individual labs and laboratory groups. These clubs are many, varied and excellent quality, and are required for many programs. - Language Skills Training, including [Medical Spanish](http://icahn.mssm.edu/about/diversity/cmca/research)and [Medical Mandarin](http://icahn.mssm.edu/about/diversity/cmca/research)classes for MD, MD/PhD, and MPH students [Social Media for Scientists Workshop](http://libcal.mssm.edu/event/2618663), from Levy Library, to help students and postdocs master their online research presence for greater research impact - The [Sinai Biotech Association](https://sinaibiotech.wordpress.com/) - Scientific Writing Workshop - Students for Equal Opportunity in Science (SEOS) - [Biomedical Research Symposium for Underrepresented Scholars](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/diversity/seos-event) [Summer Workshop in Biostatistics and SAS Programming for Clinical Research](http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/population-health-science-policy/center-for-biostatistics/education/biostatistics-summer-program-for-clinical-research) [STAT Chat](http://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments/population-health/research/biostatistics), \"walk-in\" appointments for quick statistical research review and advice - The Bioinformatics Caf\u00e9 (Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution) - Weekly and bi-weekly breakfast and lunch meetings organized by various MTAs and labs "}
