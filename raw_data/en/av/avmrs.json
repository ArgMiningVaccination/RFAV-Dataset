SUBJECT: January 2012 Update of the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) Effective Date: January 1, 2012 Implementati on Date: January 3, 2012 I. GENERAL INFORMATION A. Background : This Recurring Update Notification describes changes to and billing instructions for various payment policies implemented in the January 2012 OPPS update. The January 2012 Integrated Outpatient Code Editor (I/OCE) and OPPS Pricer will reflect the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC), HCPCS Modifier, and Revenue Code additions, changes, and deletions identified in this Change Request (C R). The TPTCCA extends the Outpatient Hold - Harmless provision, effective for dates of service on or after January 1, 2012, through February 29, 2012, to rural hospitals with 100 or fewer beds and to all Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs) and Essential Access Community Hospitals (EACHs) regardless of bed size and reclassification wage indices originally authorized under section 508 of the MMA. This notification includes instructions addressing hold harmless payment. The January 2012 revisions to I/OCE data fi les, instructions, and specifications are provided in CR 7668 , \"January 2012 Integrated Outpatient Code Editor (I/OCE) Specifications Version 13.0.\" B. Policy: 1. New Device Pass -Through Categories Section 1833(t)(6)(B) of the Social Security Act requ ires that, under the OPPS, categories of devices be eligible for transitional pass -through payments for at least 2, but not more than 3 years. Section 1833(t)(6)(B)(ii)(IV) of the Act requires that CMS create additional categories for transitional pass -through payment of new medical devices not described by existing or previously e xisting categories of devices. CMS is establishing one new device pass -through category as of January 1, 2012. The following table provides a listing of new coding and payment information concerning the new device category for transitional pass - through payment. Table 1 - New Device Pass -Through Code HCPCS Effective Date SI APC Short Descriptor Long Descriptor APC for Device Offset from C1886 H any modality (insertable) 0415 a. Device Offset from Payment for C1886 Section 1833(t)(6)(D)(ii) of the Act requires that CMS deduct from pass -through payments for devices an amount that reflects the portion of the APC payment amount that CMS determines is associated with the cost of the device (70 FR 68627 -8). CMS has determined that it is able to identify a portion of the APC payment amount associated with the cost of C1886 (Catheter, extravascular tissue ablation, any modality (insertable)), in APC 0415, Level II, Endoscopy, lower airway. The device offset from payment represents this deduction from pass -through payments for category C1886, when it is billed with a service included in APC 0415. The devic e offset amount for APC 0415, along with the device offsets for other APCs, is available under \"Annual Policy Files\" on the CMS OPPS Web site at http://www.cms.gov/HospitalOutpatientPPS/ . b. Revised Dev ice Offset from Payment for Category C1840 Effective January 1, 2012, device pass -through category C1840 must be billed with procedure code C9732 (Insertion of ocular telescope prosthesis including removal of crystalline lens), (see New Procedure Code section below) to receive pass -through payment. C9732 is assigned to APC 0234, Level IV Anterior Segment Eye Procedures. Therefore, as of January 1, 2012, device C1840 will be used with an APC 0234 service. The new device offset for CY 2012 for APC 0234, i s available under \"Annual Policy Files\" on the CMS OPPS Web site at http://www.cms.gov/HospitalOutpatientPPS/ . 2. New Procedure Code CMS is establishing one new procedure code effective January 1, 2012. The following table provides a listing of the descriptor and payment information for this new code. Table 2 - New Procedure Code HCPCS Effective Date SI APC Short Descriptor Long Descriptor C9732 01-01-12 T 0234 telescope pros Insert ion of ocular telescope prosthesis including removal of crystalline lens a. Billing Instructions for C9732 and C1840 Pass-through category C1840 (Lens, intraocular (telescopic)), is to be billed and paid for as a pass -through device only when provided with C9732 ( Insertion of ocular telescope prosthesis including removal of crystalline lens) beginning on and after the effective date for C9732 of January 1, 2012. These billing instructions supersede prior billing instructions for C1840 provided in the Octob er 2011 Update of the OPPS, Transmittal 2296, CR 7545. 3. Billing for Thermal Anal Lesions by Radiofrequency Energy For CY 2012, the CPT Editorial Panel created new CPT code 0288T (Anoscopy, with delivery of thermal energy to the muscle of the anal cana l (e.g., for fecal incontinence)) to describe the procedure associated with radiofrequency energy creation of thermal anal lesions. Prior to CY 2012, this procedure was described by HCPCS code C9716 (Creations of thermal anal lesions by radiofrequency ene rgy). In Addendum B of the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule, both HCPCS code C9716 and 0288T were assigned to specific APCs. Specifically, HCPCS code C9716 was assigned to APC 0150 (Level IV Anal/Rectal Procedures) and CPT code 0288T was assigned to APC 0148 (Level I Anal/Rectal Procedures). Because HCPCS code C9716 is described by CPT code 0288T, CMS is deleting HCPCS code C9716 on December 31, 2011, since it will be replaced with CPT code 0288T effective January 1, 2012. In addition, CPT code 0288T is bein g reassigned from APC 0148 to APC 0150 effective January 1, 2012. This change will be reflected in the January 2012 OPPS I/OCE and OPPS Pricer. Table 3 below lists the final OPPS status indicator and APC assignment for HCPCS codes C9716 and 0288T. Table 3 - CY 2012 OPPS Status Indicator and APC Assignment for HCPCS Codes C9716 and 0288T HCPCS Code Descriptor CY 2012 SI CY 2012 Radiofrequency energy anu D delivery T 0150 4. Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Payment for CY 2012 Effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2012, cardiac resynchronization therapy involving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (CRT -D) will be recognized as a single, composite service combining implantable cardio verter defibrillator procedures and pacing electrode insertion procedures when performe d on the same date of service. CMS also is implementing claims processing edits that will return to providers incorrectly coded claims on which a pacing electrode inser tion procedure described by CPT code 33225 pacing electrode, cardiac venous system, for left ventricular pacing, at time of insertion of pacing cardioverter -defibrillator or pacemaker pulse generator (including upgrade to dual chamber system) ) is billed without one of the primary CPT codes for insertion of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or pacemaker as specified in the 2012 CPT code book. CMS is adding new section 10.2.2 to Pub 100 -04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 4, to reflect the implementation of this new composite service policy and claims processing edits for CPT code 33225. 5. Billing for Drugs, Biologicals, and Radiopharmaceuticals a. Reporting HCPCS Codes for All Drugs, Biolog icals, and Radiopharmaceuticals Hospitals are strongly encouraged to report charges for all drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals, regardless of whether the items are paid separately or packaged, using the correct HCPCS codes for the items used. It is also of great importance that hospitals billing for these products make certain that the reported units of service of the reported HCPCS codes are consistent with the quantity of a drug, biological, or radiopharmaceutical that was used in the care of the patient. More complete data f rom hospitals on the drugs and biologicals provided during an encounter would help improve payment accuracy for separately payable drugs and biologicals in the future. CMS strongly encourages hospitals to report HCPCS codes for all drugs and biologicals f urnished, if specific codes are available. CMS realizes that this may require hospitals to change longstanding reporting practices. Precise billing of drug and biological HCPCS codes and units, especially in the case of packaged drugs and biologicals for which the hospital receives no separate payment, is critical to the accuracy of the OPPS payment rates for drugs and biologicals each year. CMS notes that it makes packaging determinations for drugs and biologicals annually based on charge information re ported with specific HCPCS codes on claims, so the accuracy of OPPS payment rates for drugs and biologicals improves when hospitals report charges for all items and services that have HCPCS codes under those HCPCS codes, whether or not payment for the item s and services is packaged or not. It is CMS standard ratesetting methodology to rely on hospital cost and charge information as it is reported to CMS by hospitals through the claims data and cost reports. Precise billing and accurate cost reporting by hospitals allow CMS to most accurately estimate the hospital costs for items and services upon which OPPS payments are based. CMS reminds hospitals that under the OPPS, if two or more drugs or biologicals are mixed together to facilitate administration, t he correct HCPCS codes should be reported separately for each product used in the care of the patient. The mixing together of two or more products does not constitute a \"new\" drug as regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the New Drug Ap plication (NDA) process. In these situations, hospitals are reminded that it is not appropriate to bill HCPCS code C9399. HCPCS code C9399 (Unclassified drug or biological) is for new drugs and biologicals that are approved by the FDA on or after January 1 , 2004, for which a HC PCS code has not been assigned. Unless otherwise specified in the long description, HCPCS descriptions refer to the non -compounded, FDA -approved final product. If a product is compounded and a specific HCPCS code does not exist for the compounded product, the hospital should report an appropriate unlist ed code such as J9999 or J3490. b. New CY 2012 HCPCS Codes and Dosage Descriptors for Certain Drugs, Biologicals, and Radiopharmaceuticals For CY 2012, several new HCPCS codes have been created for reporting drugs and biologicals in the hospital outpatient setting, where there have not previously been specific codes available. These new codes are listed in Table 4 below. Table 4 - New CY 2012 HCPCS Codes Effective for Certain Drugs, Bio logicals, and Radiopharmaceuticals CY 2012 HCPCS Code CY 2012 Long Descriptor CY 2012 SI CY 2012 APC A9585 Injection gadobutrol, 0.1 ml N 1 9366 J0257 Injection, proteinase inhibitor (human), K 1415 J7180 human), J7326 Hyaluronan or derivative, gel -one, -articular injection, per dose K 1417 J8561 Everolimus, oral, 0.25 mg K 1418 Q4122 Dermacell, per square centimeter K 1419 c. Other Changes to CY 2012 HCPCS for Certain Drugs, Biologicals, and Radiopharmaceuticals Many HCPCS and CPT codes for drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals have undergone changes in their H CPCS and CPT code descriptors that will be effective in CY 2012. In addition, several temporary HCPCS C -codes have been deleted effective December 31, 2011 , and replaced with permanent HCPCS codes in CY 2012. Hospitals should pay close attention to accur ate billing for units of service consistent with the dosages contained in the long descriptors of the acti ve CY 2012 HCPCS and CPT codes. Table 5 below notes those drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals that have undergone changes in either their HC PCS codes, their long descriptors, or both. Each products CY 2011 HCPCS code and CY 2011 long descriptor are noted in the two left hand columns, with the CY 2012 HCPCS code and long descriptor are noted in th e adjacent right hand columns.

HCPCS code Q2040 was subsequently replaced with HCPCS code J0 588, effective January 1, 2012. ** The short descriptor for HCPCS code J1561 has to \"Gamunex, Gamunex -C, Gammaked\" effect ive January 2012. *** HCPCS code C9273 was replaced with HCPCS code Q2043 effective July 1, 2011. d. Drugs and Biologicals with Payments Based on Average Sales Price (ASP) Effective January 1, 2012 For CY 2012, payment for nonpass -through drugs, biologi cals and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is made at a single rate of ASP + 4 percent, which provides payment for both the acquisition cost and pharmacy overhead costs associated with the drug, biological or therapeutic radiopharmaceutical. In CY 2012, a s ingle payment of ASP + 6 percent for pass -through drugs, biologicals and radiopharmaceuticals is made to provide payment for both the acquisition cost and pharmacy overhead costs of these pass - through items. CMS notes that for the first quarter of CY 2012, payment for drugs and biologicals with pass-through status is not made at the Part B Drug Competitive Acquisition Program (CAP) rate, as the CAP program was postponed beginning January 1, 2009. Should the Part B Drug CAP program be reinstituted sometime during CY 2012, CMS would again use the Part B drug CAP rate for pass -through drugs and biologicals if they are a part of the Part B drug CAP progr am, as required by the statute. In the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, CMS stated that paym ents for drugs and biologicals based on ASPs will be updated on a quarterly basis as later quarter ASP submissions become available. Effective January 1, 2012, payment rates for many drugs and biologicals have changed from the values published in the CY 2 012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period as a result of the new ASP calculations based on sales price submissions from the third quarter of CY 2011. In cases where adjustments to payment rates are necessary, changes to the payment rates will be incorpo rated in the January 2012 release of the OPPS Pricer. CMS is not publishing the updated payment rates in this instruction implementing the January 2012 update of the OPPS. However, the updated payment rates effective January 1, 2012 can be found in the J anuary 2012 update of the OPPS Addendum A and Addendum B on the CMS Web site at http://www.cms.gov/HospitalOutpatientPPS/ . e. Updated Payment Rates for Certain HCPCS Codes Effective October 1, 2011 thro ugh December 31, 2011 The payment rates for several HCPCS codes were incorrect in the October 2011 OPPS Pricer. The corrected payment rates are listed in Table 6 below and have been installed in the January 2012 OPPS Pricer, effective for services furnish ed on October 1, 2011, through implementation of the January 2012 update. Table 6 - Updated payment Rates for Certain HCPCS Codes Effective October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 HCPCS Code Status Indicator APC Short Descriptor Corrected Payment Rate Corrected Minimum Unadjusted of Biologicals When Used As Implantable Devices When billing for biologicals where the HCPCS code d escribes a product that is only surgically implanted or inserted, whether the HCPCS code is identified as having pass -through status or not, hospitals are to report the appropriate HCPCS code for the product. Units should be reported in multiples of the u nits included in the HCPCS descriptor. Providers and hospitals should not bill the units based on the way the implantable biological is packaged, stored, or stocked. The HCPCS short descriptors are limited to 28 characters, including spaces, so short desc riptors do not always capture the complete description of the implantable biological. Therefore, before submitting Medicare claims for biologicals that are used as implantable devices, it is extremely important to review the complete long descriptors for the applicable HCPCS codes. In circumstances where the implanted biological has pass - through status as a device, separate payment for the device is made. In circumstances where the implanted biological does not have pass -through status, the OPPS payment for the implanted biological is packaged into the paymen t for the associated procedure. When billing for biologicals where the HCPCS code describes a product that may either be surgically implanted or inserted or otherwise applied in the care of a patient , hospitals should not separately report the biological HCPCS codes, with the exception of biologicals with pass -through status, when using these items as implantable devices (including as a scaffold or an alternative to human or nonhuman connective tissue or mesh used in a graft) during surgical procedures. Under the OPPS, hospitals are provided a packaged APC payment for surgical procedures that includes the cost of supportive items, including implantable devices without pass -through status. When using biologicals during surgical procedures as implantable devices, hospitals may include the charges for these items in their charge for the procedure, report the charge on an uncoded revenue center line, or report the charge under a device HCPCS code (if one exists) so these costs would appropriately contribute to the future median setting for the associated surgical procedure. Hospitals are reminded that HCPCS codes describing skin substitutes (Q4100 - Q4130) should only be reported when used with one of the CPT codes describing application of a skin substitute (15271 - 15278). These Q codes for skin substitutes should not be billed when used with any other procedure besides the skin substitute application procedures. g. Payment for Therapeutic Radiopharmaceutic als Beginning in CY 2010, nonpass -through separately payable therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals are paid under the OPPS based upon the ASP. If ASP data are unavailable, payment for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals will be provided based on the most recent hospital mean unit cost data. Therefore, for January 1, 2012, the status indicator for separately payable therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is \"K\" to reflect their separately payable status under the OPPS. Similar to payment for other separately payable d rugs and biologicals, the payment rates for nonpass -through separately payable therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals will b e updated on a quarterly basis. Table 7 - Nonpass -Through Separately Payable Therapeutic Radiopharmaceuticals for January 1, 2012 CY 2012 HCPCS Code CY 2012 Long Descriptor Final CY 2012 APC Final CY 2012 SI A9517 Iodine I -131 sodium iodide capsule(s), therapeutic, K iodide Y -90 ibrit umomab treatment dose, up millicuries 1643 K A9545 Iodine I -131 tositumomab, therapeutic, per treatment dose 1645 K A9563 Sodium P -32, therapeutic, per millicurie 1675 K Chromic dose, up to 150 millicuries 1295 K h. Payment Offset for Pass -Through Diagnostic Radiopharm aceuticals Effective for nuclear medicine services furnished on and after April 1, 2009, CMS implemented a payment offset for pass -through diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals under the OPPS. As discussed in the April 2009 OPPS CR 6416 (Transmittal 1702), pas s-through payment for a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical is the difference between the payment for the pass -through product and the payment for the predecessor product that, in the case of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, is packaged into the payment for the nuclear medicine procedure in which the diagnost ic radiopharmaceutical is used. Effective July 1, 2011, the diagnostic radiopharmaceutical reported with HCPCS code A9584 (Iodine i - 123 ioflupane, diagnostic, per study dose, up to 5 millicuries) was grante d pass -through status under the OPPS and assigned status indicator \"G.\" HCPCS code A9584 will continue on pass -through status for CY 2012 and therefore, when HCPCS code A9584 is billed on the same claim with a nuclear medicine procedure, CMS will reduce t he amount of payment for the pass -through diagnostic radiopharmaceutical reported with HCPCS code A9584 by the corresponding nuclear medicine procedures portion of its APC payment associated with \"policy -packaged\" drugs (offset amount) so no duplicate radiopharmaceutical payment is made. The \"policy -packaged\" portions of the CY 2012 APC payments for nuclear medicine procedures may be found on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/HospitalOutpatientPPS/04_passthrough_payment.asp#TopOfPage in the download file labeled 2 012 OPPS Offset Amounts by APC. CY 2012 APCs to which nuclear medicine procedures are assigned and for which CMS expects a diagnostic radiophar maceutical payment offset could be applicable in the case of a pass -through diagnostic radiopharmaceutical are displayed in Table 8 below.

Payment Offset for Pass -Through Con trast Agents Effective for contrast -enhanced procedures furnished on or after January 1, 2010, CMS implemented a payment offset for pass -through contrast agents, for when a contrast -enhanced procedure that is assigned to a procedural APC with a \"policy -packaged\" drug amount greater than $20.00 (that is not an APC containing nuclear medicine procedures) is billed on the same claim with a pass -through contrast agent on the same date of service. As discussed in the January 2010 OPPS CR 6751 (Transmittal 1882 ), CMS will reduce the amount of payment for the contrast agent by the corresponding contrast -enhanced procedures portion of its APC payment associated with \"policy -packaged\" drugs (offset amount) so no duplicate contrast agent payment is made. CY 2012 p rocedural APCs for which CMS expects a contrast agent payment offset could be applicable in the case of a pass -through contrast agent are identified in Table 9 below. Pass -through payment for a contrast agent is the difference between the payment for the pass-through product and the payment for the predecessor product that, in the case of a contrast agent, is packaged into the payment for the contrast -enhanced procedure in which the contrast agent is used. For CY 2012, when a contrast agent with pass -through status is billed with a contrast -enhanced procedure assigned to any procedural APC listed in Table 9 on the same date of service, a specific pass -through payment offset determined by the procedural APC to which the contrast -enhanced procedure is assign ed will be applied to payment for the contrast agent to ensure that duplicate payment is n ot made for the contrast agent. For CY 2012, HCPCS code C9275 (Injection, hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride, 100 mg, per study dose) will continue on pass -through sta tus and will be subject to the payment offset methodology for contrast agents. HCPCS code C9275 is assigned a status indicator of \"G\". Therefore, in CY 2012, CMS will reduce the payment that is attributable to the predecessor contrast agent that is packa ged into payment for the associated contrast enhanced procedure reported on the same claim on the same date as HCPCS code C9275 if the contrast -enhanced procedure is assigned to one of the APCs listed in Table 9 below. The \"policy -packaged\" portions of th e CY 2012 APC payments that are the offset amounts may be found on the CMS Web site at: http://www.cms.gov/HospitalOutpatientPPS/04_passthrough_payment.asp#TopO fPage in the download file labeled 201 2 OPPS Offset Amounts by APC.

Clarificati on of Coding f or Drug Administration Services As noted in CR 7271, Transmittal 2141, in 2011 CMS revised Pub. 100 -04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4, section 230.2, to clarify the correct coding of drug administration services. Drug administ ration services are to be reported with a line -item date of services on the day they are provided. In addition, CMS noted that beginning in CY 2007, hospitals should report only one initial drug administration service, including infusion services, per enco unter for each distinct vascular access site, with other services through the same vascular access site being reported via the sequential, concurrent or additional hour codes. CMS has subsequently become aware of new CPT guidance regarding the reporting of initial drug administration services in the event of a disruption in service; however, Medicare contractors are to continue to follow the guidance given in this manual. 7. Provenge Administration Effective July 1, 2010, the autologous cellular immunoth erapy treatment reported with HCPCS -t, minimum of 50 million autologous cd54+ cells activated with pap -gm-csf, including leukapheresis and all other preparatory procedures, per infusion) was granted pass -through status under OPPS and assigned status indicator \"G.\" Effective July 1, 2011, this product was assigned to HCPCS code Q2043 (Sipuleucel -t, minimum of 50 million autologous cd54+ cells activated with pap -gm-csf, including leukapheresis and all other preparatory procedures, per infusion) with status indicator \"G.\" HCPCS code Q2043 will continue on pass -through status for CY 2012. CMS notes that the HCPCS long descriptor for CY 2012 for HCPCS code Q2043 includes payment for the drug itself, as well as \"all other preparatory proc edures,\" referring to the transportation process of collecting immune cells from a patient during a non -therapeutic leukapheresis procedure, subsequently sending the immune cells to the manufacturing facility, and then transporting the immune cells back to the site of service to be administered to the patient. Payment for Q2043 does not include OPPS payment for drug administration. 8. Billing for Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions in Primary Care to Reduce Alcohol Misuse - National Coverag e Determination (NCD) Effective for claims with dates of service on and after October 14, 2011, CMS will cover annual alcohol screening, and for those who screen positive, up to four, brief, face -to-face behavioral counseling interventions per year for Me dicare beneficiaries, including pregnant women: 1) who misuse alcohol, but whose levels or patterns of alcohol consumption do not meet criteria for alcohol dependence (defined as at least three of the following: tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, impaired con trol, preoccupation with acquisition and/or use, persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to quit, sustains social, occupational, or recreational disability, use continues despite adverse consequences); and 2) who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided; and 3) whose counseling is furnished by qualified primary care physicians or other primary care practitioners in a primary care setting. In outpatient hospital settings, as in any other setting, services covered under this NCD must be provided by a primary care provider. To implement this recent coverage determination, CMS created two new G -codes to report annual alcohol screening and brief, face -to-face behavioral counseling interventions. The long descriptors for both G -codes appe ar in Table 10.

Screening for Depression in Adults - NCD Effective for claims with dates of service on and after October 14, 2011, Medicare covers an nual screening for adults for depression in the primary care setting that have staff -assisted depression care supports in place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow -up. For the purposes of this NCD, a primary care setting is defin ed as one in which there is provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the co ntext of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and hospice are not considered prima ry care settings under this definition. To implement this recent coverage determination, CMS created a new G -code to report the annual depression screening. The long descriptor for the G -code appears in Table 11 .

Billing for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) Screening and High Intensity Behavioral Counseling (HIBC) to Prevent STIs - NCD Effective for claims with dates of service on and after November 8, 2011, CM S will cover screening for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and hepatitis B with the appropriate FDA approved/cleared laboratory tests, used consistent with FDA approved labeling and in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) regulatio ns, when ordered by the primary care provider, and performed by an eligible Medicare provider for these services. Also effective for claims with dates of service on and after November 8, 2011, CMS will cover up to two individual - 20 to 30 minute, face to face counseling sessions annually for Medicare beneficiaries for HIBC to prevent STIs for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs, if referred for this service by a primary care provider and provided by a Medicare eligibl e primary care provider in a primary care setting. For the purposes of this NCD, a primary care setting is defined as the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of persona l health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing facilities, skill ed nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, clinics providing a limited focus of health care services, and hospice are examples of settings not considered primary care settings under this definition. To implement this recent coverage deter mination, CMS created a new G -code to report HIBC to Prevent STIs. The long descriptor for the G -code appears in Table 12 . Table 12 -STIs Screening and HIBC to Prevent STIs CY 2012 HCPCS Code CY 2012 Long Descriptor CY 2012 Status Indicator CY 2012 APC G0445 High intensity behavioral counseling to prevent sexually transmitted infection; face -to-face, individual, includes: education, skills training and guidance on how to change sexual behavior; performed semi -annually, 30 minutes S 0432 HCPCS code G0445 has been assigned to APC 0432 and given a status indicator assignment of \"S.\" Further reporting guidelines on HIBC to Prevent STIs will be provided in a future CR. CMS is deleting screening code G0450 (Screening for sexually transmitted infections, inclu des laboratory tests for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, and Hepatitis B) previously released on the 2012 HCPCS tape, from the OPPS addenda, effective November 8, 2011. This screening service will now be identified using ICD -9 screening and diagnosis codes . Coding and billing instructions will be issued in an upcoming CR. 11. Billing for Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Cardiovascular Disease - NCD Effective for claims with dates of service on and after November 8, 2011, CMS will cover intensive behavio ral therapy for cardiovascular disease (referred to below as a CVD risk reduction visit), which consists of the following three components: 1) encouraging aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease when the benefits outweigh the risks for men age 45 -79 years and women 55 -79 years; 2) screening for high blood pressure in adults age 18 years and older; and 3) intensive behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet for adults with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, advancing age, and other k nown risk factors for cardiovascular and diet -related chronic disease. Effective for claims with dates of service on and after November 8, 2011, CMS covers one face -to-face CVD risk reduction per year for Medicare beneficiaries who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided, and whose counseling is furnished by a qualified primary care physician or other primary care practitioner in a primary care setting. For the purposes of this NCD , a primary care setting is defined as one in whic h there is provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family a nd community. Emergency departments, inpatient hospital settings, ambulatory surgical centers, independent diagnostic testing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and hospices are not considered primary care s etting s under this definition. To implement this recent coverage determination, CMS created a new G -code to report the CVD risk reduction visit. The long descriptor for the G -code appears in Table 13.

Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity - NCD Effective for claims with dates of servi ce on and after November 29, 2011, Medicare beneficiaries with obesity (BMI 30 kg/m2), who are competent and alert at the time that counseling is provided and whose counseling is furnished by a qualified primary care physician or other primary care pract itioner in a primary care setting are eligible for: 1) One face to face visit every week for the first month; 2) One face to face visit every other week for months 2 -6; and 3) One face to face visit every month for months 7 -12. To implement this recent co verage determination, CMS created a new G -code to report counseling for obesity. The long descriptor for the G -code appears in Table 14 . Table 14 - Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity CY 2012 HCPCS Code CY 2012 Long Descriptor CY 2012 Status Indicato r CY 2012 APC G0447 Face -to-face behavioral counseling for obesity, 15 minutes S 0432 HCPCS code G0447 has been assigned to APC 0432 and given a status indicator assignment of \"S.\" Further reporting guidelines on intensive behavioral therapy for obesity will be provided in a future CR. CMS is deleting screening code G0449 (Annual face to face obesity screening, 15 minutes) previously released on the 2012 HCPCS tape, from the OPPS addenda, effective November 29, 2011. This screening service will now be i dentified using ICD -9 screening and diagnosis codes. Coding and billing instructions will be issued in an upcoming CR. 13. Payment Window for Outpatient Services Treated as Inpatient Services CMS is revising its billing instructions to clarify that in situations where there is no Part A coverage for the inpatient stay, there is no inpatient service into which outpatient services (i.e. , services provided to a beneficiary on the date of an inpatient admission or during the 3 calendar days (or 1 calendar d ay for a non -IPPS hospital) prior to the date of an inpatient admission) must be bundled. Therefore services provided to the beneficiary prior to the point of admission (i.e. , the admission order) may be separately billed to Part B as the outpatient servi ces that they were. See Pub. 100 -04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4, section 10.12 and chapter 1, section 50.3.2 for the updated billing guidelines. 14. Partial Hospitalization APCs For CY 2012, CMS is updating the four partial hospitaliz ation program (PHP) per diem payment rates based on the median costs calculated using the most recent claims data for each provider type: two for community mental health centers (CMHCs) (for Level I and Level II PH services based on only CMHC data), and tw o for hospital - based PHPs (for Level I and Level II services based on only hospital -based data). The APCs for the CMHCs are: APC 0172 (Level I Partial Hospitalization (3 services)) and APC 0173 (Level II Partial Hospitalization (4 or more services)). The A PCs for the hospital -based PHPs are: APC 0175 (Level I Partial Hospitalization (3 services)) and APC 0176 (Level Level II Partial Hospita lization (4 or more services)). When a CMHC provides three services of partial hospitalization services and meets all other partial hospitalization payment criteria, the CMHCs would be paid through APC 0172. Similarly, when a hospital - based PHP provides three services of partial hospitalization services and meets all other partial hospitalization payment criteria, the hos pital-based PHP would be paid through APC 0175. When the CMHCs provide four or more services of partial hospitalization services and meet all other partial hospitalization payment criteria, the CMHC would be paid through APC 0173 and the hospital -based PHP providing four or more services would be paid through APC 0176. The tables below provide the updated per diem payment rates: Table 15 - CY 2012 Median Per Diem Costs for CMHC PHP Services Plus Tra nsition APC Group Title Median Per Diem Costs Plus Transit ion 0172 Level I Partial Hospitalization (3 services) for CMHCs $97.64 0173 Level II Partial Hospitalization (4 or more services) for CMHCs $113.83 Table 16 - CY 2012 Median Per Diem Costs for Hospital -Based PHP Services APC Group Title Median Per Di em Costs 0175 Level I Partial Hospitalization (3 services) for hospital -based PHPs $160.74 0176 Level II Partial Hospitalization (4 or more services) for hospital -based PHPs $191.16 15. Molecular Pathology Procedure Test Codes The AMAs CPT Editori al Panel created 101 new molecular pathology procedure test codes for CY 2012. These new codes are in the following CPT code range: 81200 -81299, 81300 -81383, payment purposes under the hospital OPPS these test codes will be assigned to status indicator \"E\" (Not recognized by Medicare for outpatient claims; alternate code for the same item or service may be available) effective January 1, 2012. These new codes will be listed in the January 2012 OPPS Addendum B, which can be downloaded from this CMS Website: https://www.cms.gov/HospitalOutpatientPPS/AU/list.asp#TopOfPage . CMS notes that each of the new molecular pathology procedure test code s represent a test that is currently being utilized and which may be billed to Medicare. When these types of tests are billed to Medicare, CMS understands that existing CPT test codes are \"stacked\" to represent a given test. For example, Laboratory A has a genetic te st that is generally billed to Medicare in the following manner - 83891 (one time) + 83898 (multiple times) + 83904 (multiple times) + 83909 (multiple times) + 83912 (one time) - in order to represent the performance of the entire test. If the new CPT tes t coding structure were active, Laboratory A would bill Medicare the new, single CPT test code that corresponds to the test represented by the \"stacked\" codes in the example above rather than billing each component of the test separately. Effective Januar y 1, 2012, under the hospital OPPS, hospitals are advised to report both the existing CPT \"stacked\" test codes that are required for payment and the new single CPT test code that would be used for payment purposes if the new CPT test codes were active. Referring to the example above, Laboratory A would report the existing stacked set of codes that are required to receive payment [i.e., 83891 (one time) + 83898 (multiple times) + 83904 (multiple times) + 83909 (multiple times) + 83912 (one time)] along with the new, single CPT test code that corresponds to the test represented by the \"stacked\" test codes. 16. Use of Modifiers for Discontinued Services (Modifiers 52, 53, 73, and 74) CMS is revising the guidance related to use of modifiers for discontinued services in Pub. 100 -04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4, section 20.6.4. 17. Changes to OPPS Pricer Logic a. Rural sole community hospitals and essential access community hospitals (EACHs) will continue to receive a 7.1 percent payment increa se for most services in CY 2012. The rural SCH and EACH payment adjustment excludes drugs, biologicals, items and services paid at charges reduced to cost, and items paid under the pass -through payment policy in accordance with section 1833(t)(13)(B) of t he Act, as added by section 411 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) . b. New OPPS payment rates and copayment amounts will be effective January 1, 2012. All copayment amounts will be limited to a maximum of 40 p ercent of the APC payment rate. Copayment amounts for each service cannot exceed the CY 2012 inpatient deductible. c. For hospital outlier payments under OPPS, there will be no change in the multiple threshold of 1.75 for 2012. This threshold of 1.75 is mu ltiplied by the total line -item APC payment to determine eligibility for outlier payments. This factor also is used to determine the outlier payment, which is 50 percent of estimated cost less 1.75 times the APC payment amount. The payment formula is (cost-(APC payment x 1.75))/2. d. There will be no change in the fixed -dollar threshold in CY 2012. The estimated cost of a service must be greater than the APC payment amount plus $2,025. in order to qualify for outlier payments. e. For outliers for Community Mental Health Centers (bill type 76x), there will be no change in the multiple threshold of 3.4 for 2012. This threshold of 3.4 is multiplied by the total line -item APC payment for APC 0173 to determine eligibility for outlier payments. This multiple amo unt is also used to determine the outlier payment, which is 50 percent of estimated costs less 3.4 times the APC payment amount. The payment formula is (co st-(APC 0173 payment x 3.4))/2. f. Effective January 1, 2012, 4 devices are eligible for pass -through payment in the OPPS C1830 (Powered marrow biopsy needle) have an offset amount of $0 because CMS is not able to identify portions of the APC payment amounts associated with the cost of the devices. Category C1840 (Lens, intraocular (implantable)) and C1886 (Catheter, extravascular tissue ablation, any modality (insertable)) have offset amounts included in the Pricer for CY 2012. Pass-through offset amounts are adjusted annually. For outlier purposes, when C1749 is billed with a service included in APC 0143 or APC 0158 it will be associated with specific HCPCS in those APCs for outlier eligibility and payment. g. Effective January 1, 2012, t he OPPS Pricer will apply a reduced update ratio of 0.980 to the payment and copayment for hospitals that fail to meet their hospital outpatient quality data reporting requirements or that fail to meet CMS validation edits. The reduced payment amount will be used to calculate outlier payments. h. Effective January 1, 2012 , there will be 1 diagnostic radiopharmaceutical receiving pass -through payment in the OPPS Pricer logic. For APCs containing nuclear medicine procedures, Pricer will reduce the amount of t he pass -through diagnostic radiopharmaceutical payment by the wage -adjusted offset for the APC with the highest offset amount when the radiopharmaceutical with pass -through appears on a claim with a nuclear procedure. The offset will cease to apply when th e diagnostic radiopharmaceutical expires from pass -through status. The offset amounts for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals are the \"policy -packaged\" portions of the CY 2012 APC payments for nuclear medicine procedures and may be found on the CMS Web site. i. Effective January 1, 2012 , there will be 1 contrast agent receiving pass -through payments in the OPPS Pricer logic. For a specific set of APCs identified elsewhere in this update, Pricer will reduce the amount of the pass -through contrast agent by the wa ge-adjusted offset for the APC with the highest offset amount when the contrast agent with pass -through status appears on a claim on the same date of service with a procedure from the identified list of APCs with procedures using contrast agents. The offset will cease to apply when the contrast agent expires from pass -through status. The offset amounts for contrast agents are the \"policy -packaged\" portions of the CY 2012 APC payments for procedures using contrast agents and may be found on the CMS Web sit e. j. Pricer will update the payment rates for drugs, biologicals, therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, and diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals with pass -through status when those payment rates are based on ASP on a quarterly basis. k. Effective January 1, 2012, CMS is adopting the FY 2012 IPPS post -reclassification wage index values with application of out -commuting adjustment authorized by Section 505 of the MMA to non -IPPS hospitals discussed below. 18. Update the Outpatient Provider Specific File (OPSF) For Jan uary 1, 2012, contractors shall maintain the accuracy of the provider records in the Outpatient Provider Specific File (OPSF) as change s occur in data element values. Update the OPSF for New Core -Based Statistical Area (CBSA) and Wage Indices for Non -IPPS Hospitals Eligible for the Out -Commuting Adjustment Authorized by Section 505 of the MMA This includes updating the CBSA in the provider records, as well as updating the \"special wage index\" value for those providers who qualify for the Section 505 adjus tment as annotated in Table 17. CMS notes that reclassification wage index values under Section 508 of the MMA expired on September 30, 2011. As always, the OPPS applies the IPPS fiscal year 2012 post -reclassification wage index values to all hospitals a nd community mental health centers participating in the OPPS for the 2012 calendar year. Contractors shall do the following to update the OPSF (effective January 1, 2012 ): 1. Update the CBSA value for each provider in Table 17; 2. For non -IPPS providers who q ualify for the 505 adjustment in CY 2012 (Table 17 .); a) Create a new provider record, effective January 1, 2012 and b) Enter a value of \"1\" in the Special Payment Indicator field on the OPSF; and c) Enter the final wage index value (given for the provider in Table 17.) in the Specia l Wage Index field in the OPSF. 3. For non -IPPS providers who received a special wage index in CY 2011, but no longer receive it in CY 2012; a) Create a new provider record, effective January 1, 2012 and b) Enter a blank in the Speci al Payment Indicator field; and c) Enter zeroes i n the special wage index field. NOTE: Although the Section 505 adjustment is static for each qualifying county for 3 years, the special wage index will need to be updated (using the final wage index in Table 17) because the post -reclassification CBSA wage index has changed. NOTE: Payment for Distinct Part Units (DPUs) located in an acute care hospital is based on the wage index for the labor market area where the hospital is located, even if the hospital has a reclassified wage index. If the DPU falls in a CBSA eligible to receive the section 505 out -commuting adjustment, the DPUs final wage index should consist of the geographic wage index plus the approp riate out -commuting adjustment. Table 17 - Wage Ind ex by CBSA for Non -IPPS Hospitals that are Eligible for the Section 505 Out -Commuting Adjustment Provider CBSA Section 505 Out Commuting Adjustment Final Wage Index for Calendar Year 2012 013027 01 YES Provider CBSA Section 505 Out Commuting Adjustment Final Wage Index for Calendar Year 2012 054122 34900 0.7959 19408 1 19 YES 0.7961 Provider CBSA Section 505 Out Commuting Adjustment Final Wage Index for Calendar Year 2012 194082 19 YES 0.8012 194083 19 YES Provider CBSA Section 505 Out Commuting Adjustment Final Wage Index for Calendar Year 2012 234034 19804 0.9086 Provider CBSA Section 505 Out Commuting Adjustment Final Wage Index for Calendar Year 2012 423029 11340 a) Updating the OPSF for Expiration of Transitional Outpatient Payments (TOPs) Section 3121 of the Affordable Care Act extended the hold harmless provision for small rural hospitals with 100 or fewer beds through December 31, 2010 , at 85 percent of the hold harmless amount. Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs) and Essential Access Community Hospitals (EACHs) are no longer limited to those with 100 or fewer beds effec tive January 1, 2010 , and these providers will receive TOPs payments at 85 percent of the hold harmless amount through December 31, 2011. Cancer and children's hospitals are permanently held harmless under section 1833(t)(7)(D)(ii) of the Social Security A ct and continue to receive TOPs payments in CY 2011. NOTE : EACHs are considered SCHs for purpos es of the TOPs adjustment. Section 308 of the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 ( TPTCCA) extends the Outpatient Hold -Harmless provision, effec tive for dates of service on or after January 1, 2012, through February 29, 2012, to rural hospitals with 100 or fewer beds and to all Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs) and Essential Access Community Hospital s (EACHs) regardless of bed size . For CY 2012, contractors shall enter a \"Y\" in the TOPs Indicator field within the Outpatient Provider Specific File (OPSF) for all providers that previously had a \"Y\" in the TOPs Indicator. Additionally, contractors shall enter a \"Y\" in the TOPs Indicator field for all SCHs and EACHs (Provider Type 16, 17, 21, or 22) regardless of the value in the Bed Size field for CY 201 2. Cancer and children's hospitals continue to receive hold harmless TOPs permanently. For CY 2012, cancer hospitals will receive an additional payme nt adjustment that will be provided at cost report settlement. The details of this specific adjustment for cancer hospitals are forthcoming in a separate CR. Unless otherwise instructed , by February 29, 2012, contractors shall create an additional OPSF for all providers listed in the attachment with a March 1, 2012 , effective date that does not contain a \"Y\" in the TOPs Indicator. b) Updating the OPSF for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program (HOP QDRP) Requirements Effective for OPPS serv ices furnished on or after January 1, 2009, Subsection (d) hospitals that have failed to submit timely hospital outpatient quality data as required in Section 1833(t)(17)(A) of the Act will receive payment under the OPPS that reflects a 2 percentage point deduction from the annual OPPS update for failure to meet the HOP QDRP requirements. This reduction will not apply to hospitals not required to submit quality data or hospitals that are not paid under the OPPS. For January 1, 2012, contractors shall main tain the accuracy of the provider records in the OPSF by updating the Hospital Quality Indicator field. CMS will release a Technical Direction Letter that lists Subsection (d) hospitals that are subject to and fail to meet the HOP QDRP requirements. Once this list is released, FIs/MACs will update the OPSF by removing the 1, (that is, ensure that the Hospital Quality Indicator field is blank) for all hospitals identified on the list and will ensure that the OPSF Hospital Quality Indicator field contains 1 for all hospitals that are not on the list. CMS notes that if these hospitals are later determined to have met the HOP QDRP requirements, FIs/MACs shall update the OPSF. For greater detail regarding updating the OPSF for the HOP QDRP requirements, s ee Transmittal 368, CR 6072, issued on August 15, 2008. c) Updating the OPSF for the Outpatient Cost to Charge Ratio (CCR) As stated in Pub. 100 -04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4, section 50.1, contractors must maintain the accuracy of the da ta and update the OPSF as changes occur in data element values, including changes to provider cost -to-charge ratios. The file of OPPS hospital upper limit CCRs and the file of Statewide CCRs are located on the CMS Web site at www.cms..gov/HospitalOutpatientPPS/ under \" Annual Policy Files .\" A spreadsheet listing the Statewide CCRs also can be found in the file containing the preamble tables that appears in the most recent OPPS/ASC final rule. 19. Coverage Determinations The fact that a drug, device, procedure or service is assigned a HCPCS code and a payment rate under the OPPS does not imply coverage by the Medicare program, but indicates only how the product, procedure, or service may be paid if covered by the program. Fiscal Intermediaries (FIs)/Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) determine whether a drug, device, procedure, or other service meets all program requirements for coverage. For example, FIs/MACs determine that it is reasonab le and necessary to treat the beneficiarys condition and whether it is excluded from payment. II.

Medicare Claims Processing Manual Chapter 1 - General Billing Requirements 50.3.2 - Policy and Billing Instructions for Condition Code 44 (Rev.2386, Issued : 01-13-12, Effective: 01 -01-12, Implementation: 01 -03-12) In cases where a hospital or a CAHs UR committee determines that an inpatient admission does not meet the hospitals inpatient criteria, the hospital or CAH may change the beneficiarys status from inpatient to outpatient and submit an outpatient claim (bill type 13x or 85x) for medically neces sary Medicare Part B services that were furnished to the beneficiary, provided all of th e following conditions are met: 1. The change in patient status from inpatient to outpatient is made prior to discharge or release, while the beneficiary is still a pa tient of the hospital; 2. The hospital has not submitted a claim to Medicare for the inpatient admission; 3. The practitioner responsible for the care of the patient and the UR committee concur with the decision ; and 4. The concurrence of the practitio ner responsible for the care of the patient and the UR committee is documented in the patients medical record. While typically the full UR committee makes the decision for the committee that a change in patient status under Condition Code 44 is warranted , in accordance with \u00a7482.30(d)(1) one physician member of the UR committee may make the decision for the committee, provided he or she is a different person from the concurring practitioner who is responsib le for the care of the patient. When the hospita l has determined that it may submit an outpatient claim according to the conditions described above, the entire episode of care should be billed as an outpatient episode of care on a 13x or 85x bill type and outpatient services that were ordered and furnis hed s hould be billed as appropriate. Refer to Pub. 100 -04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual; Chapter 30, Financial Liability Protections; Section 20, Limitation On Liability (LOL) Under \u00a71879 Where Medicare Claims Are Disallowed, for information regardin g financial liability protections. When the hospital submits a 13x or 85x bill for services furnished to a beneficiary whose status was changed from inpatient to outpatient, the hospital is required to report Condition Code 44 on the outpatient claim in o ne of Form Locators 24 -30, or in the ANSI X12N 837 I in Loop 2300, HI segment, with qualifier BG, on the outpatient claim. Additional information may be found in Chapter 25 of this manual, (Completing and Processing the Form CMS -1450 Data Set). Condition C ode 44 is used by CMS and QIOs to track and monitor these occurrences. The reporting of Condition Code 44 on a claim does not affect the amount of hospital outpatient payment that would otherwise be made for a hospital outpatient claim that did not require the reporting Condition Code 44. One of the requirements for the use of Condition Code 44 is concurrence by the practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient with the determination that an inpatient admission does not meet the hospitals ad mission criteria and that the patient should have been registered as an outpatient. This prerequisite for use of Condition Code 44 is consistent with the requirements in the CoP in \u00a7482.30 (d) of the regulations. This paragraph provides that the practition er or practitioners responsible for the care of the patient must be consulted and allowed to present their views before the UR committee or QIO makes its determination that an admission is not medically necessary. It may also be appropriate to include the practitioner who admitted the patient if this is a different person than the practitioner responsib le for the care of the patient. If the conditions for use of Condition Code 44 are not met, the hospital may submit a 12x bill type for covered \"Part B Only \" services that were furnished to the inpatient. Medicare may still make payment for certain Part B services furnished to an inpatient of a hospital when payment cannot be made under Part A because an inpatient admission is determined not to be medically n ecessary. Information about \"Part B Only\" services is located in Pub. 100 -02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 6, section 10. Examples of such services include, but are not limited to, diagnostic x -ray tests, diagnostic laboratory tests, surgical dr essings and splints, prosthetic devices, and certain other services. The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual includes a complete list of the payable \"Part B Only\" services. See Pub. 100 -04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4, section 10.12 for a disc ussion of the billing and payment rules regarding services furnished within the payment window for outpatient services treated as inpatient services. Entries in the medical record cannot be expunged or deleted and must be retained in their original form. Therefore, all orders and all entries related to the inpatient admission must be retained in the record in their original form. If a patients status changes in accordance with the requirements for use of Condition Code 44, the change must be fully documen ted in the medical record, complete with orders and notes that indicate why the change was made, the care that was furnished to the beneficiary, and the participants in making the decision to change the patients status. When Condition Code 44 is appropri ately used, the hospital reports on the outpatient bill the services that were ordered and provided to the patient for the entire patient encounter. However, in accordance with the general Medicare requirements for services furnished to beneficiaries and b illed to Medicare, even in Condition Code 44 situations, hospitals may not report observation services using HCPCS code G0378 (Hospital observation service, per hour) for observation services furnished during a hospital encounter prior to a physician's ord er for observation services. Medicare does not permit retroactive orders or the inference of physician orders. Like all hospital outpatient services, observation services must be ordered by a physician. The clock time begins at the time that observation se rvices are initiated in accor dance with a physicians order. While hospitals may not report observation services under HCPCS code G0378 for the time period during the hospital encounter prior to a physicians order for observation services, in Condition C ode 44 situations, as for all other hospital outpatient encounters, hospitals may include charges on the outpatient claim for the costs of all hospital resources utilized in the care of the patient during the entire encounter. For example, a beneficiary is admitted as an inpatient and receives 12 hours of monitoring and nursing care, at which point the hospital changes the status of the beneficiary from inpatient to outpatient and the physician orders observation services, with all criteria for billing unde r Condition Code 44 being met. On the outpatient claim on an uncoded line with revenue code 0762, the hospital could bill for the 12 hours of monitoring and nursing care that were provided prior to the change in status and the physician order for observati on services, in addition to billing HCPCS code G0378 for the observation services that followed the change in status and physician order for observation services. For other rules related to billing and payment of observation services, see chapter 4, sectio n 290 of this manual, and Pub.100 -02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 6, Section 20.6. Medicare Claims Processing Manual Chapter 4 - Part B Hospital (Including Inpatient Hospital Part B and OPPS) Table of Contents (Rev. 2386,Issued: 01 -13-12) 10.2.2 - Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy 01 -01-12, Implementation: 01 -03-12) Effective for services furnished on or after January 1, 2012, cardiac resynchronization therap y involving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (CRT -D) will be recognized as a single, composite service combining implantable cardioverter defibrillator procedures (described by CPT code repositioning of electrode lead(s) for ngle or dual chamber pacing cardioverter -defibrillator and insertion of pulse generator )) and insertion procedures (described by CPT code 33225 (Insertion of pacing electrode, cardiac venous system, for left ventricular pacing, at time of insertion of pacing cardioverter - defibrillator or pacemaker pulse generator (including upgrade to dual chamber system))) when performed on the same date of service. When these procedures appear on the same claim but with different dates of service, or ap pear on the claim without the other procedure, the standard APC assignment for each servic e will continue to be applied. Medicare will make a single payment for those procedures that qualify for composite service payment, as well as any packaged services furnished on the same date of service. Because CPT codes 33225 and 33249 may be treated as a composite service for payment purposes, CMS is assigning them status indicator \"Q3\" (Codes that may be paid through a composite APC) in Addendum B. Hospitals wil l continue to use the same CPT codes to report CRT -D procedures, and the I/OCE will evaluate every claim received to determine if payment as a composite service is appropriate. Specifically, the I/OCE will determine whether payment will be made through a s ingle, composite payment when the procedures are done on the same date of service, or through the standard APC payment methodology when they are done on different dates of service. CMS is also implementing claims processing edits that will return to provi ders incorrectly coded claims on which a pacing electrode insertion procedure described by CPT code 33225 is billed without one of the following CPT codes for insertion of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or pacemaker: 33206 with transvenous electrode(s); atrial); 33207 (Insertion electrode(s); ventricular); 33208 (Insertion or atrial and ventricular); 33212 (Insertion or replacement only; single chamber, atrial or ventricular); 33213 (Insertion or replacement of pacemaker pulse generator only; dual chamber, atrial or ventricular); 33214 (Upgrade o f implanted pacemaker system, conversion of single chamber system to dual chamber system (includes removal of previously placed pulse generator, testing of existing lead, insertion of new lead, insertion of new pulse generator)); 33216 (Insertion of a cardioverter -defibrillator); 33217 (Insertion electrodes, permanent pacemaker cardioverter - defibrillator); 33221(Insertion of pacemaker pulse generator only; with existing multiple lea ds); 33222 (Revision or relocation of skin pocket for pacemaker); 33230 (Insertion of pacing cardioverter of pacing cardioverter -defibrillator pulse generator only; with exi sting multiple leads) 33233 (Removal of permanent pacemaker pulse generator); 33234 (Removal of transvenous pacemaker electrode(s); single lead or ventricular); 33235 (Removal of transvenous pacemaker system, atria l or ventricular); 33240 (Insertion of single or pacing cardioverter generator); or 33249 (Insertion or repositioning of lead(s) for single or dual chamber pacing cardioverter -defibrillator and insertion of puls e generator). 10.12 - Payment Window for Outpatient Services Treated as Inpatient Services (Rev. 2386, Issued: 01 -13-12, Effective: 01 -01-12, Implementation: 01 -03-12) The policy for the payment window for outpatient services treated as inpatient service s is discussed in section 40.3, of chapter 3 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual. The policy requires payment for certain outpatient services provided to a beneficiary on the date of an inpatient admission or during the 3 calendar days (or 1 calendar day for a non -IPPS hospital) prior to the date of an inpatient admission to be bundled (i.e., included) with the payment for the beneficiarys inpatient admission if those outpatient services are provided by the admitting hospital or an entity that is whol ly owned or wholly operated by the admitting hospital. The policy applies to all diagnostic outpatient services and non -diagnostic (i.e., therapeutic) that are related to the inpatient stay. Ambulance and maintenance renal dialysis services are not subject to the payment window. All diagnostic services provided to a Medicare beneficiary by a hospital (or an entity wholly owned or wholly operated by the hospital) on the date of the beneficiary s inpatient admission or during the 3 calendar days (or, in the case of a non -subsection (d) hospital, 1 calendar day) immediately preceding the date of admission are required to be included on t he bill for the inpatient stay. Outpatient non -diagnostic services that are related to an inpatient admission must be bundle d with the billing for the inpatient stay. An outpatient service is related to the admission if it is clinically associate d with the reason for a patient s inpatient admission. In accordance with section 102 of Pub. L. 111 -192, for services furnished on or after June 25, 2010, all outpatient non-diagnostic services, other than ambulance and maintenance renal dialysis services, provided by the hospital (or an entity wholly owned or wholly operated by the hospita l) on the date of a beneficiary s inpatient adm ission are deemed related to the admission, and thus, must be billed with the inpatient stay. Also, outpatient non -diagnostic services, other than ambulance and maintenance renal dialysis services, provided by the hospital (or an entity wholly owned or wholly operated by the hospital) on the first, second, and third calendar days for a subsection (d) hospital paid under the IPPS (first calendar day for non -subsection (d) hospitals) preceding the date of a beneficiarys inpatient admission are deemed related to the admission, and thus, must be billed with the inpatient stay, unless the hospital attests to specific non -diagnostic services as being unrelated to the hospital claim (that is, the preadmission non -diagnostic services are clinically distinct or inde pendent from the reason for the beneficiarys admission). Outpatient non-diagnostic services provided during the payment window that are unrelated to the admission, and are covered by Part B, may be separately billed to Part B. The June 25, 2010 effective date of section 102 of Pub. L. 111 -192 applies to outpatient services prov ided on or after June 25, 2010. In the event that there is no Part A coverage for the inpatient stay , there is no inpatient service into which outpatient services (i.e., services provided to a beneficiary on the date of an inpatient admission or during the 3 calendar days (or 1 calendar day for a non -IPPS hospital) prior to the date of an inpatient admission ) must be bundled. Therefore , services provided to the beneficiary prior to t he point of admission (i.e. , the admission order) may be separately billed to Part B as the outpatient services that they were. A hospital may attest to specific non -diagnostic services as being unrelated to the hospital claim (that is, the preadmission n on-diagnostic services are clinically distinct or independent from the reason for the beneficiarys admission) by adding a condition code 51 (definition \"51 - Attestation of Unrelated Outpatient Non -diagnostic Services\") to the separately billed outpatient non-diagnostic services claim. Providers may submit outpatient claims with condition code 51 starting April 1, 2011, for outpatient claims that have a date of service on or after June 25, 2010. Outpatient claims with a date of service on or after June 25, 2010, that did not contain condition code 51 received prior to April, 1, 2011, will need to be adjusted by the provider if the y were rejected by FISS or CWF. As stated in section 180.7, \"inpatient -only\" procedures that are provided to a patient in the outpatient setting on the date of the patients inpatient admission or during the 3 calendar days (or 1 calendar day for a non -subsection (d) hospital) preceding the date of the inpatient admission that would otherwise be deemed related to the admission are not paid for by CMS. Providers should bill for these services on a no -pay claim (Type of Bill (TOB) 110). If there are covered services/procedures provided during the same outpatient encounter as the non -covered inpatient -only procedure (see the two except ions listed in section 180.7), providers are then required to sub mit two claims: One claim with covered service(s)/procedure(s) on a TOB 11X (w ith the exception of 110), and, The other claim with the non -covered service(s)/procedure( s) on a TOB 110 (no -pay claim). NOTE: Both the covered and non -covered claim must have a matching Statement Covers Period. 20.6.4 - Use of Modifiers for Discontinued Services (Rev 01 General Modifiers p rovide a way for hospitals to report and be paid for expenses incurred in preparing a patient for a procedure and scheduling a room for performing the procedure where the service is subsequently discontinued. This instruction is applicable to both outpati ent hospital departments and to ambulatory surgical centers. Modifier -73 is used by the facility to indicate that a procedure requiring anesthesia was terminated due to extenuating circumstances or to circumstances that threatened the well being of the p atient after the patient had been prepared for the procedure (including procedural pre - medication when provided), and been taken to the room where the procedure was to be performed, but prior to administration of anesthesia. For purposes of billing for ser vices furnished in the hospital outpatient department, anesthesia is defined to include local, regional block(s), moderate sedation/analgesia (\"conscious sedation\"), deep sedation/analgesia, or general anesthesia. This modifier code was created so that th e costs incurred by the hospital to prepare the patient for the procedure and the resources expended in the procedure room and recovery room (if needed) could be recognized for payment even though t he procedure was discontinued. Modifier -74 is used by th e facility to indicate that a procedure requiring anesthesia was terminated after the induction of anesthesia or after the procedure was started (e.g., incision made, intubation started, scope inserted) due to extenuating circumstances or circumstances tha t threatened the well being of the patient. This modifier may also be used to indicate that a planned surgical or diagnostic procedure was discontinued, partially reduced or cancelled at the physician's discretion after the administration of anesthesia. For purposes of billing for services furnished in the hospital outpatient department, anesthesia is defined to include local, regional block(s), moderate sedation/analgesia (\"conscious sedation\"), deep sedation/analgesia, and general anesthesia. This modif ier code was created so that the costs incurred by the hospital to initiate the procedure (preparation of the patient, procedure room, recovery room) could be recognized for payment even though the procedure was discontinued prior to compl etion. Coincidin g with the addition of the modifiers and -74, modifiers -52 and -53 were revised. Modifier -52 is used to indicate partial reduction , cancellation, or discontinuation of services for which anesthesia is not planned. The modifier provides a means for reporting reduced services without disturbing the identification of the basic service. Modifier -53 is used to indicate discontinuation of physician services and is not approved for use for outpatient hospital services. The elective cancellation of a pro cedure should not be reported. Modifiers -73 and -74 are only used to indicate discontinued procedures for which anesthesia is planned or provided. B. Effect on Payment Procedures that are discontinued after the patient has been prepared for the proced ure and taken to the procedure room but before anesthesia is provided will be paid at 50 percent of the full OPPS payment amount. Modifier -73 is used for these procedures. Procedures that are discontinued , partially reduced or cancelled after the proced ure has been initiated and/or the patient has received anesthesia will be paid at the full OPPS payment amount. Modifier -74 is used for these procedures. Procedures for which anesthesia is not planned that are discontinued , partially reduced or cancelle d after the patient is prepared and taken to the room where the procedure is to be performed will be paid at 50 percent of the full OPPS payment amount. Modifier -52 is used for these procedures. C. Termination Where Multiple Procedures Planned When on e or more of the procedures planned is completed, the completed procedures are reported as usual. The other(s) that were planned, and not started, are not reported. When none of the procedures that were planned are completed, and the patient has been prep ared and taken to the procedure room, the first procedure that was planned, but not completed is reported with modifier -73. If the first procedure has been started (scope inserted, intubation started, incision made, etc.) and/or the patient has received anesthesia, modifier -74 is used. The other procedures are not reported. If the first procedure is terminated prior to the induction of anesthesia and before the patient is wheeled into the procedure room, the procedure should not be reported. The patie nt has to be taken to the room where the procedure is to be performed in order to report "}
