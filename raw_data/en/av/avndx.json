We're more than a little enamoured with Elemental Herbology If you're not familiar with this British skincare range, then you'll want to be, and soon! With a belief in balancing skin with products related to each of the five elements of Traditional Chinese Medicine: wood, fire, earth, metal and water, expect a luxurious (and exclusive) treatment when you check into Shine Spa in Macau. What are we loving about the products? Blending natural ingredients with scientific findings, each product has been carefully created to bring out the best in your skin, no matter what its tendencies. You'll find ingredients such as avocado, macadamia nut, guava and rosemary in the range from Elemental Herbology, not only taking advantage of their restorative benefits, but also adding wonderful fragrances to the collection. What is an Elemental Herbology treatment at Shine Spa like? Each treatment is customised for your unique skin, meaning that you'll have a full consultation with your therapist before getting pampered. For my facial, we discussed my occasional dry patches of skin, and as a result, my therapist chose to use products mostly from the water range that bring the hydration. After a lovely fragrant foot bath, I laid down for a 60-minute facial that included a range of oils, creams, exfoliants and serums, along with a foot massage and gentle head massage - heaven! The therapist made me feel immediately comfortable, and afterwards, my skin was positively glowing, not just that evening, but the following morning too. If you're heading over to Macau, or if you just need a break from Hong Kong, then definitely book in for a treatment from Elemental Herbology at Shine Spa, you'll be in your element for sure.
