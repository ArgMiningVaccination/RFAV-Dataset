This will be a one -year (three trimester s), fully online program, effective Fall 2018. A. Centrality to Institutional Mission Statement and Planning Priorities 1. Program description and alignment with mission The mission of Maryland University of Integrative Health (MUIH) is: A distinctive community of scholars, researchers, practitioners, and advocates, Maryland University of Integrative Health promotes whole person, relationship -centered healthcare. Through discovery and exploration, we deliver progressive educational progr ams, advance innovative clinical models, build mutually beneficial partnerships, and provide opportunities for fulfilling careers. Our vision is: Serving as a leader in the global transformation of health and wellness, we integrate healing traditions and contemporary science, acknowledge the wisdom of the body and nature as a teacher, and focus on the interconnection of mind, body, and spirit. Our work enables people to thrive through the cycles of life. MUIH is the pre -eminent institution in the U.S. for the study of health and wellness. Its programs integrate healing traditions and contemporary science and acknowledge the wisdom of the body and nature as a teacher to educate diverse and erudite health -care professionals for today and tomorrow. In keeping with its mission and vision, MUIH currently offers graduate programs in areas related to natural medicine such as acupuncture, herbal medici ne, health and wellness coaching, nutrition, and yoga therapy. MUIH has been a pioneer and driving force in the national movement toward wellness, disease prevention, and relationship -centered healthcare . As an anchoring academic institution for the emerg ing wellness system in America, MUIH has trained over 2647 wellness professionals and has a current, annual unduplicated headcount enrollment of 1754 graduate students. Graduates not only help frame the MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH PBC in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition 2 healthcare options in the U.S. and abroad, but also a re instrumental in encouraging people to switch to more natural lifestyle choices that improve their overall health and wellness. The proposed PBC in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition offers nutrition and sports and fitness professionals an opportunity to blend foundational knowledge in holistic nutrition with a broader perspective on the role of nutrition in sports and athletic performance . With an emphasis on whole foods, students will examine diets that maximize nutrients and will learn ho w to plan and prepare meals to support both physical and mental athletic performance. As a stand -alone certificate, the three -trimester program can provide a complementary add -on to other MUIH degrees as well as to the student's initial baccalaureate degree . As with all MUIH pr ograms, the emphasis on establishing rapport with the client and developing a \"healing presence\" will be integrated into this program. In keeping with the philosop hy and mission of MUIH, this program stresses the concept of self-care - that health and education must first be applied to oneself before it can be applied to others - at the same time as it supports organizational structures and benefits that encourage such self-care. Consistent with MUIH's mission to deliver innovative solutions for healthier living and career -oriented opportunities for students , the proposed certificate will continue to advance MUIH's leadership in the emerging wellness system. 2. Priority and support of institutional strategic goals The creation of the Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition certificate supports MUIH's strategic go als, values and institutional principles. Since its founding, MUIH has positioned itself as a pioneer and advocate for a more natural and relationship -oriented approach to health and well -being. It is helping to lead the transformation of our healthcare delivery system through behavioral changes in consumer self -care, teaching MUIH graduates to become partners in health by educating, facilitating and coaching. The creation of this program supports goals and o bjectives in the University's strategic plan and 2017 -2018 strategic action plan: Strategic Plan G1.O1: Increase awarenes s, reputation and visibility of the University's academic programs, research initiatives, and clinical offerings . Strategic Plan G1.O4: Leverage and adapt current academic program offerings to reach new audiences . Strategic Plan G4.O4: Create alternative revenue streams . 2017-2018 Strategic Priority 2G: Launch new and revised academic programs for 2018-2020. The proposed certificate program supports MUIH's strategic goal of becoming the preeminent academic institution serving the health and wellness field by addressing an important applied specialized sports -related subject that is experiencing increasing demand ,1 as is the overall field of nutrition education.2 It offers an opportunity for sports professionals to integrate nutrition -based knowledge and interventions into their approaches to 1 Education Advisory Board, \"Demand for Online and Hybrid Programs in the Sports Industry,\" 2012. 2 Journal of American College of Nutrition , 2014, 33(4), 340-346. MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH PBC in Performance and Integrative Nutrition 3 maximizing sports performance. MUIH has created this progr am in keeping with its existing strategies around e vidence-based health behavior modification, with a di stinctive relationship-centered philosophy for maximizing positive behavior change. The proposed certificate expands and complements MUIH's curricular content and diversifies career options for graduates. It will provide additional educational and career opportunities for professionals in a variety of fields, including nutritionists and registered dieticians , personal trainers, strength and condition ing coaches , athletic and sports trainers and coaches, exercise specialists , fitness professionals , and health club managers. The program model, as with all of the disciplines at MUIH, is prevention - and education - oriented, nature -based, community -focused and relationship -centered. It will help to enhance existing programs by offering opportunities for adding on to other degrees , complementing them by providing an additional specialized area of knowledge and practice. B. Adequacy of Curriculum Design a nd Delivery to Related Learning Outcomes The proposed PBC in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition is a three-trimester, five - course (13-credit) online certificate that can be completed in one year. The program is designed for sports performance professionals who work with individuals and/or groups, including nutritionists and registered dieticians as well as personal trainers; strength and condition ing coaches ; athletic and sports trainers and coaches; exercise specialists ; and fitness professionals. It will equip them with the skills to plan diets and prepare meals that maximize nutrients and supp ort athletic performance. 1. Courses and p rogram requirements The curriculum for the certificate program in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition builds and expands on existing courses and draws on faculty expertise. It is designed to establish an understanding of holistic nutrition and its role in sports . Students will also learn to apply that knowledge to practice related to athletic performance. Prospective students for the program will have completed an undergraduate degree in keeping with the requirements for all MUIH programs . In addition to the PBC, the courses may be s hared by other programs at the university as electives or required courses as appropriate . The c ertificate was built predominant ly from new courses , following existing introductory course s in human nutrition and physiology . Full course descriptions are provided in Appendix A. Requirements for the PBC in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition include 1 3 credits taken over one year (three trimesters): MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH PBC in Sports Performance and Nutrition 4 Trimester 1 NUTR 613 Human Nutrition: Macronutrients and Micronutrients 3 credits ISCI 671 Physical Activity and Health 3 credits Trimester 2 NUTR 616 Nutrient Optimization for Physical Performance in Athletes* 3 credits NUTR 615 Nutrient Optimization for Mental Performance in Athletes* 3 credits Trimester 3 NUTR 68 9 Whole Foods Cooking to Support High Performance * 1 credit Total Credits for Pos t-Baccalaureate Certificate 13 credits *New course 2. Educational objectives and s tudent learning outcomes In the PBC in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition, students will examine diets that maximize nutrients and learn how to plan and prepare meals to support athlete performance. Students who complete the certificate will: Demonstrate knowledge of the effect of various nutrients, supplements, antioxidants, hydration and caffeine on athletic performance Debunk myths and apply evidence -based knowl edge into professional life within scope of practice Develop meals that enhance athletic performance through a whole foods diet 3. General education requirements Not applicable. 4. Specialized accreditation or graduate certification requirements Not applicable . 5. Contractual agreement with other institutions MUIH utilizes a t hree-pronged approach to identifying and establishing contractual agreements with other institutions . First, the Provost's office, academic program leadership, Office of Academic Partnerships, and Office of Admissions work collaboratively to develop and maintain articulation agreements and memoranda of understanding with other institutions, organizations, and employers to facilitate pathways to enrollment. Second, t he Director of Academic Partnerships functions on a global level to actively identify and pursue partnerships that could lead to multiple academic placements as well as opportunities for partner ship in research and curriculum . Third, using a more focused approach, each MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH PBC in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition 5 academic department actively fields external solicitations for partnership and works in collaboration with the Office of Academic Partnerships to ensure a streamlined process for formalizing placements . Once placements have been identified and vetted through MUIH's administrative and academic leadership, the placements are properly established via contractual agreements that outline the specifics of the placements. Staffing that s upports these p artnerships includes: Christina Sax, Provost and Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs James Snow, Dean of Academic Affairs Alexandra York, Director of Academic Partnerships Elizabeth Owens, Manager of Experiential Programs Nutrit ion and Integrative Healt h Robert Brooks, Coordinator, Career Services A sample agreement that serves as a template for partnering with other institutions can be found in Appendix B. C. Critical and Compelling Regional or Statewide Need as Identified in the State Plan 1. Demand and need for the program The role of nutrition in sports performance has been well demonstrated through evidence - based research ,3 and the proposed certificate aligns with what the American College of Nutrition identifies as the ninth hottest area of nutrition research for 2020 - nutrition education .4 However, sports nutrition is still a relatively new educational field -- for example, the International Society of Sports Nutrition, \" the only non -profit academic society dedicated to promoting the science and application of evidence -based sports nutrition and supplementation,\" was founded less than 15 years ago5 -- and there are few graduate programs in this area . Other graduate programs entitled \"sports nutrition\" include a 12 -credit online certificate at Simmons College in Massachusetts and three on-site master's degrees: at Marywood University (PA), University of Colorado, and Texas Woma n's Univ ersity.6 These and other related programs , including individual courses or minor concentrations in sports nutrition within a few other university programs , focus on nutrition in the context of exercise science and physiology . MUIH's program is unique . It takes a holistic view of the impact of nutrition , includes physi cal and mental performance in sports , and i ncludes an emphasis on whole foods cooking . 3 \"Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dieticians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine: Nutrition and Athletic Performance,\" Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, March 2016, 116(3), 501 -528. 4 Journal of Amer ican College of Nutrition, 2014, Performance and Integrative Nutrition 6 The combination of increasing interest in nutrition and educational growth focusing on sports performance makes nutrition for sports performance a likely area of demand. MUIH is well prepared to offer and support this important certificate. It already has significant programs and faculty expertise in related areas, including an M.S. program in Nutrition and Integrative Health and a course in Sports Nutrition . Its commitment to the advancement and evolution of knowledge in the field of health and wellness, r elationship -centered healthcare, understanding of complementary and integrative medicine, and collaborative teamwork to support individual and collective health are central to its success . 2. Consistency with the Maryland State Plan for Post -Secondary Education The proposed program will serve the needs of the State of Maryland, consistent with the goals of the 2017-2021 Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education: Student Success with Less Debt .7 The State Plan's second goal is \"Promote and implem ent practices and policies that will ensure student success.\" The proposed certificate's focus on nontraditional students who are working professionals is consistent with Strategy 5, \"Ensure that statutes, regulations, policies, and practices that support students and encourage their success are designed to serve the respective needs of both traditional and non -traditional students.\" The State Plan's third goal is \"Foster innovation in all aspects of Maryland higher education to improve access and student success.\" Strategies under this goal include Strategy 8, \"Include long -term graduate education opportunities when considering a student's career trajectory\" and Strategy 11, \"Encourage a culture of risk -taking and experimentation.\" The proposed certifica te offers an extended path for learning for current professionals and involvement in a new and emerging field. By offering the certificate in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition , MUIH will build on its existing expertise in nutrition and integrati ve health to offer current sports professionals the opportunity to pursue graduate education and to add skills and knowledge in a growing field . This online certificate will also add to the portfolio of programs through which MUIH reaches nontraditional students such as practicing sports professionals through an online platform for which faculty are trained in best practices and online resources are provided to students. These features address Strategy 9, \"Strengthen and sustain development and collaboration in addressing teaching and learning challenges.\" Full discussion of MUIH's online philosophy, training and assessment is in %20Education.pdf . Integrative Nutrition 7 D. Quantifiable a nd Reliable Evidence and Documentation of Market Supply & Demand in the Region and State 1. Market Demand Sports -related education is a growing field, and the Education Advisory Board identifies the Washington DC metropolitan area as the second highest area for employment of graduates with sports -related degrees nationally. In fact, f our of the top eleven metropolitan statistical areas (MSA s) for employment of graduates with sports -related degrees nationally are within MUIH's region : New York -Northern New Jersey -Long Island, NY -NJ-PA; Washington - Arlington -Alexandria, DC -VA-MD-WV; -Camden -Wilmington, PA -NJ-DE-MD; and Baltimore -Towson, M D.8 Interest is reaching beyond generalized Master's programs in sports management and sports studies to more applied specialized fields such as physical education, kinesiology, physiology, and exercise science . Such specialties are experiencing strong stu dent and employer demand.9 Nutrition and nutrition education are also growing. They participate in th e overall growth of health care and social assistance , which the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) see as leading job growth , projecting that sector to \" grow 18 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations, adding about 2.3 million new jobs ... more jobs than any other group of occupations.\"10 Maryland's Department of Labor also predicts exceptional job growth in this area, exceeding 27 percent for the decade 2014-2024.11 Occupations specifically related to sports and nutrition -- dietitians and nutritionists, athletic trainers, fitness trainers and instructors, exercise physiologists, and athletic coaches -- are also projec ted to grow faster than average , both nationally and in the State of Maryland. 12 These professiona ls are the audience for the MUIH certificate. The proposed certificate is being created at an advantageous time. It offers an opportunity not only for new entrants but for existing workers in workplace settings to acquire an additional area of expertise. The online format means that the program can reach those workers throughout Maryland and the nation. 2. Educational and training needs, expected vacancies As noted above, t he U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics has identified a number of occupations related to sports and nutrition as growing faster than average for the period 2016-2026. These include dietitians and nutritionists, athletic trainers, fitness trainers and instructors, exercise physiologists, and athletic coaches.13 8 Education Advis ory Board, Demand for Online and Hybrid Master's Programs in the Sports Industry , Oct, 2012. 9 Ibid. 10 BLS, October 24, 2017, https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healt hcare/home.htm . 11 Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, \"Maryland Long Term Industry Projections - 2014 - 2024 - Workforce Information and Performance,\" Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition 8 Occupation Growth Rate 2016 -2026 Employment Change 2016 -2026 (# jobs) Dietitians and Nutritionists 15%, much faster than average 9,900 Athletic Trainers 23%, much faster than average 6,300 Fitness Trainers and Instructors 10%, faster than average 30,100 Exercise Physiologists 13%, faster than average 2,000 (Athletic) Coaches and Scouts 13%, faster than average 35,700 These occupations are among those for whom the MUIH certificate will be most appropriate. As a result of this expanding job market, sports nutritionists are finding positions in many settings that allow for the combination of physical training and sports with nutrition al concepts. Appropriate workplaces may include colleges and universities , sports organizations , athletic clubs , food corporations , and r ehabilitation centers .14 The certificate will bring additional areas of expertise to these and other positions, adding specialization in nutrition to support athletic performance. At present, other than the few academic programs listed earlier, the primary source for training in sports nutrition is an array of non -academic certificates from organizations such as the American Council on Exercise, American Fitness Professionals and Associates, and the National Academy of Sports Medicine.15 These certificates generally provide basic n utritional information and individualized coaching strategies, but lack the holistic foundation and evidence base of the MUIH certificate. The proposed MUIH certificate has the advantage of offering academic credit and drawing on MUIH's solid reputation in the area of both online learning and nutrition education. 3. Prospective graduates The MUIH program has differentiating factors that will support its competitiveness in this growing market: its grounding in MUIH's solid reputation and philosophy ; cost; distinctive features of the program experience such as the MUIH's hallmark focus on integrative medicine, holistic approach and healing presence ; online presence; the understanding of health coaching and promotion ; and the opportunity to concurrently or sequentially cross - train in other integrative health fields . Given these factors, the growth in specialized areas of sports education, and the burgeoning interest in nutrition, MUIH is projecting solid growth in the program over the first five years. 14 https://www.nutritioned.org/sports -nutritionist.hml . 15 See for example, \"The Integrative Nutrition 9 PROJECTED ENROLLMENTS FOR PROGRAM* Year Trimester New Students Continuing Students Total Students Year 1 Fall 2018 5 5 Spring 2019 5 4 9 Summer 2019 8 8 Year 2 Fall 2019 10 4 14 Spring 2020 10 8 18 Summer 2020 16 16 Year 3 Fall 2020 15 8 23 Spring 2021 15 12 27 Summer 2021 24 24 Year 4 Fall 2021 15 12 27 Spring 2022 15 12 27 Summer 2022 24 24 Year 5 Fall 2022 15 12 27 Spring 2023 15 12 27 Summer 2023 24 24 *Enrollment Assumptions: New students are admitted into the program during the fall and spring trimesters, but not during the summer trimester. Continuing students have an overall average retention rate of 80%, consistent with that of MUIH's existing progra ms. E. Reasonableness of Program Duplication There are no related certificate programs in Maryland. Morgan State University offers a Bachelor's degree in Nutritional Science, and University of Maryland (College Park) offers Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral degrees in Nutrition and Food Science. None of those focus on sports performance or integrative nutrit ion. The proposed certificate might provide a specialized focus that could complement some of those programs and provide an additional credential for some students , but it would not duplicate them. F. Relevance to Historically Black Institutions (HBIs) There are no sports performance and integrative nutrition post-baccalaureate certificate programs in Maryland HBIs . The proposed program will have no potential impact on high - MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH PBC in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition 10 demand programs at the HBIs or on the uniqueness and institutional identities and missions of the HBIs . G. Evidence of Principles of Good Practice if online The proposed program will be offered online. MUIH has successfully offered fully online courses and programs since 2013, as approved by both the Maryland Higher Education Commission and the Middle States Commission on Higher Education . Thus, MUIH is well versed in supporting teaching and learning via online and digitally enhanced modalities , and its principles and practices align with MHEC's Principles of Good Practice for Distance Education . At MUIH, online courses are considered to be those in which 100 percent of the teaching and learning process is conducted at a distance, while blended courses are those in which a significant portion of face - to-face instruction is replaced by online or other means of digitally enhanced teaching and learning . Appendix C provides a full description of how this program and others at MUIH comply with the Principles of Good Practice for Distance Education. H. Adequacy of Faculty Resources A number of potential faculty for this proposed program have already been teaching at MUIH for years in MUIH's Master of Science program in Nutrition and Integrative Health , which has been developed with a highly qualified core team of pr ogram instructors. All courses are taught by faculty with a master's degree or higher with significant experience teaching similar coursework. Guest lecturers and adjunct faculty are subject to the same high standards of education and experience. As with many health professions programs where the curriculum calls for expertise across a broad spectrum of theory and practice, and consistent with the model through which MUIH delivers all its programs, the Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition certificate program will rely on a combination of core salaried faculty and the use of part -time adjunct faculty . Salaried full-time faculty will be strategically placed to anchor the program and provide stability and continuity for students. It is vital that faculty have practical, general experience, as well as specialization in discrete ar eas that will allow for expert instruction, supervision, and guidance . Before beginning their first online or blended course development or teaching assignment, MUIH requires faculty to complete the Best Practices in Online/Blended training focused on online pedagogy/andragogy, the Canvas Learning Management System ( LMS) training, Big Blue Button web conferencing training, and one -on-one consultation tailored to their individualized needs, all provided by the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL). These faculty are also provided the Quality Matters Rubric as a guiding resourc e and access to 24/7 support through the Canvas Help Desk. Faculty developing and teaching online and blended classes also have ongoing opportunities for professional development through various face -to-face and online webinars, workshops, trainings, and c onfere nces. Proposal 2017 MUIH PBC in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition 11 The current MUIH budget already accounts for the needed faculty , including a mix of salaried and adjunct faculty . Criteria for faculty recruitment include : Master' s degree or above in Clinical Nutrition . Qualified to teach graduate courses, and to advise and mentor students . Faculty experience in higher education and, in some cases, a clinical practice for athletes or operating within a sports environment Experience developing and teaching courses related to the field. Demonstrated commitment to continuing education and professional development. Desire to engage in activities for a new program with a strong wellnes s philosophy at its foundation. Research publication and scholarship are preferred but not required . Appendix D contains a list of representative faculty for the program : three of these are current ranked faculty, one is a current academic administrator with additional teaching respon sibilities, and the remaining two will serve as adjunct faculty (based on enrollment -driven needs). I. Adequacy of Library Resources The University provides online support for faculty and students with an enhanced integrated and online library system, and the Library continues to expand to support all modalities of teaching and learning as well as enrollment growth . The Sherman Cohn Library at MUIH has a total collection of over 18,000 titles in health and wellness (13,000 physical holdings and 5,000 electronic) . Electronic resources augment the number of health and wellness materials available. The Library's computerized systems and licensing agreements with vendors permit access to open -access journals and other free Internet resources, as well as selected journal articles from individual subscriptions and from the Library's EBSCO host databases . The Library uses the National Library of Medicine's Docline service for document delivery. When the Library does not own an article, it can be obtained in a timely manner for faculty and students through the Library's use of Docline. In 2016, the University opened a Quiet Study Room associated with Sherman Cohn Library that addressed onsite students' expressed need for a place to work in silence. The Library is located in a single room and fosters an information commons environment. The Library co nducts the MUIH550 Academic Research and Scholarship non -credit course that is required of all students during their first trimester at MUIH; this course is available online to all students. The Sherman Cohn Library at MUIH has and will continue to expand to support all modalities of teaching and learning, as well as mo derate enrollment growth. In FY 2014, the University added online support for faculty and students with a newly purchased and significantly enhanced integrated library system . All online courses contain a direct link to the Sherman Cohn Library at MUIH , prominently positioned in the Canvas online classrooms. MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH PBC in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition 12 J. Adequacy of Facilities, Infrastructure, and Equipment MUIH's 12 -acre campus contains a 32,500 square -foot, two -story building, herbal medicine teaching garden, parking for all students, and ample space for additional buildings to be built in order to accommodate growth. Over 300 people can be accommodated in the curren t building's large event space, which totals 2,750 square feet. The current building serves as the primary home for all of MUIH's programs, and includes: Eight classrooms and a ninth, multipurpose space ; An herbal dispensary; A library; A quiet study room; A Career Center 22 clinical treatment rooms , assigned to the Student Teaching Clinic ; Space for faculty offices ; A faculty kitchen; A student lounge with an adjacent kitchen ; A bookstore/caf\u00e9 that includes seating All classrooms have access t o voice and data communications and WiFi is available throughout the building. Two large, dividable classrooms are equipped with ceiling - mounted data projectors and screens, as well as an integrated sound system. A portable sound system, TV, laptops, and o verhead and LCD projectors are available for use in classrooms as needed. Other space is leased in Howard County as needed, and offices for general administration of the university and faculty will continue to be located at the current campus locations . Since the program will be fully online, this physical space will not be affected except inasmuch as students may wish to use the Library, Career Center, and student spaces, and concurrently enroll in other programs offered on campus. Those enrolled in the program will be served by the current infrastructure including admissions, financial aid, registrar, advising, student success services, disabilities support services, and career services. Students enrolled in online and blended courses hav e online and other remote access to these services, as well as the University -wide Orientation, Library and Program Community Sites. The Student Success Office provides individualized academic and non -academic success support to students who are either s elf-directed or referred by faculty. Such services include writing and scientific tutoring, study skills, academic success strategies and planning , and disabilities support services. An online University Wide Orientation provides an introduction to academi c resources. Each department maintains a Community Site in the Canvas LMS for all students enrolled in its programs. These sites contain learning resources that cut across the program, access to selected online course learning modules, and resources that a ssist students in their study and practice for national licensing exams. MHEC Proposal 2017 MUIH PBC in Sports Performance and Integrative Nutrition 13 K. Adequacy of Financial Resources Table 1: Resources Reallocated funds During the start -up phase of the program, the university will reallocate funds from general operation to support this new program . This reallocation of funds will not have an adverse impact on existing programs since the university operates with a net surplus sufficient to reallocate the necessary funds to the new program. Tuition and Fee Revenue The intake assumptions for years 1 through 5 are 10, 20, 30, 30, and 30 new students respectively . The projected intake is conservative to reflect the lau nch of a new program and a ramp-up in the later years . The projected intake is consistent with the enrollment history for similarly stackable certificate s and related program s. The model also accounts for a modest level of attrition of students prior to completion of their program (overall average retention rate of 80% for all students , consistent with that of MUIH's existing programs ). Table 2: Expenditures New and/or renovated space Not applicable. Other Expenses Other expenses include faculty development, office supplies, data processing and communications, maintenance, marketing, course development costs, and building operating costs not already included in the health promotion program.

Adequacy of provisions for evaluation of program Since its establishment , MUIH has nurtured a culture of assessment and feedback . Expected student learning outcomes are clearly stated at the course and programmatic levels , and these outcomes are well designed to align with the University's m ission and, for this program, with the Certified Health Education Specialist (CHES) examination of the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing (NCHEC) , as well as the standards established by higher education in general. Learning outcomes assessment is multilevel and predominantly utilizes a 360 -degree design. Course outcome s and me asures are consistent with the specific subject matter , and the achievement of outcomes is documented from both the faculty and student perspectives. The academic departments, programs, and curriculum committees, subject matter experts (SMEs), and faculty responsible for designing, delivering, and assessing learning outcomes receive support from a 360 -degree team . This team is led by the Learning Outcomes Assessment Team (LOAT), which serves as an umbrella committee to guide and facilitate academic assessment initiatives . Additional support is provided by the Assistant Provost for Academic Assessment and Accreditation, University Curriculum Committee, Student Affairs , Alumni Affairs, Natural Care Center c linic administration, and the Provost in gathering and interpreting assessment results . The involvement of all of these groups in assessment practices demonstrates that MUIH invests necessary institutional resources and is committed to outcomes assessment. In 2011, MUIH piloted and then adop ted the IDEA Student Rating of Instruction tool as the system students would use to evaluate course s and faculty . IDEA is a nonprofit organization whose mission has been to provide assessment and feedback systems to improve learning in higher education . The IDEA tool meets the needed and desired criteria for a sustainable course evaluation system that was previously identified by the LOAT Committee . Further, the IDEA system is based on 26 years of research and allows the institution to compare faculty performance within similar disciplines and among over 400 other universities . In 2016, MUIH shifted its use of the IDEA tool to the Campus Labs online platfo rm, allowing for use of this too l by students in face -to-face, blended, and online classes alike. Outcomes assessment is ongoing and based on the academic performance of students , as well as communication, collaboration, and leadership qualities and behaviors assessed in other settings . Online and blended courses are included in the university's overarching academic assessment plan.
