Are you feeling inactive, unbalanced, having aches and pains, digestive or skin problems, frequent infections, or have lately drifted away from a healthy lifestyle? Then, it might be time for a detox or Homeopathic drainage. We live in a world full of toxins, the air that we breath, food that we eat, water that we drink is thronged of impurities. Incorrect living habits like indiscriminate use of drugs, coffee, tea, alcohol, tobacco, daily stress all have their toxic effects on the organs and tissues. More toxin accumulation can reduce our body's physiological efficiency. Moreover, today's fast-paced lifestyle also labors the body's normal functions and exhorts the body past its inherent aptitude of detoxification. The action of these toxins can critically deteriorate our immune system and cause vague symptoms. Detoxifying or draining the body is a vital stride in flushing out the toxins naturally through cleansing, to ease the symptoms and to execute its functions appropriately. Homeopathic drainage is a therapeutic means of removal of unwanted by products of the organisms and toxins through the natural excretory organs that is the nose, skin, liver, lungs, pancreas, kidneys, intestines and genitals. Some symptoms of Toxicity: Toxins accumulate into our blood and organs causing stress on the immune system, resulting in symptoms. If you are enduring some of these symptoms then it is time for a detox. - Low energy. - Gas, bloating, frequent constipation or diarrhea. - Irritable bowel syndrome. - Skin irritation. - Allergies, frequent colds, cough, puffy eyes. - Menstrual problems. - Sleep disturbances. - Depression, mental confusion, mood swings. - Viral or parasitic infections. - Unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight. - Organ disease. - Cancer, and many more. Homeopathic approach to Detoxification: The human body is a powerful self-detoxification machine. The majority of detoxification and elimination is carried out by four systems in the body: respiratory, digestive, urinary and dermal. If these systems are not working well, the toxins will accumulate inside the body and cause problems. Homeopathic constitutional approach helps balance organ systems and help the body achieve an optimal detoxification and self-healing ability. Homeopathic remedies are used to stimulate cells to release toxins, stimulate elimination organs, energize organs and help them recover from stress caused by toxins. Homeopathic approach is a safe, natural and effective method in eliminating these toxins that we get exposed to in our daily lives. Homeopathic remedies help the body heal by promoting its own natural defense system. The holistic approach of Homeopathy targets each organ and its supporting system to cleanse and work in harmony. Homeopathic remedies can target specific toxins, groups of toxins or specific organs and aid in tonification, elimination, work as diuretics to help push fluid through the Kidneys. Work as systemic cleansers to aid in cellular elimination, work as stimulants to enhance energy, may also work as anti-inflammatory and reduce tissue swelling. Homeopathic remedies reinforce the body's natural ability to remove toxins and waste byproducts, without harmful side effects and without harsh laxatives. Remedies work by stimulating the body's natural processes of elimination to cleanse itself of poisons, from environmental pollution, substance abuse, poor diet, allergens, pollutants like harmful heavy metals, parasites and can even remove toxins from stress, mental imbalances and chemical changes. Homeopathic remedies will assist in the body's natural cleaning process by stimulating the liver, intestines, kidneys and skin to eliminate toxins from the body. The remedies will improve blood circulation, support healthy weight management, promote healthy energy levels, promote healthy skin, support healthy liver functioning, improve mood, give a sense of well being and above all support healthy immune system resulting into fewer illnesses. The great thing about Homeopathic detox is that it rebuilds and strengthens the immune system and can be incorporated with other regimens without any conflict. The freeing of toxins into the blood stream removes the blockage, enabling the vital force to prepare the body for a return to health. The remedies will further promote healing of damaged systems and restore proper functioning to sluggish or overactive systems, so that the body may be restored to a state of balance and health.
