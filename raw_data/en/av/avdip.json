Additional subject and/or keyword searches: bioterrorism, biological terrorism, biological chemical warfare; chemical warfare agents; hazardous substances. PubMed indexes clinical and preclinical journal articles in medicine, nursing and dentistry, and allied health Provides access to citations and full text articles from the biomedical literature (medicine, nursing, dentistry, veterinary medicine, health care, and the preclinical sciences). PubMed includes MEDLINE (mid 1960s-present), OLDMEDLINE (1950-1965), in-process citations (not yet indexed). Biological Abstracts includes broad coverage in all areas of life sciences research Comprehensive bibliographic database for the life sciences. Areas of coverage include botany, zoology, ecology, microbiology, biomedicine, agriculture, pharmacology, medicine, biochemistry, biophysics, bioengineering and biotechnology. Scopus is an interdisciplinary, bibliographic database that indexes the contents of more than 15,000 journals in the physical sciences, engineering, earth and environmental sciences, life and health sciences, social sciences, psychology, business, and management. Scopus also features cited references and can be searched for articles that cite a specific article. Contains clinical and public information regarding anthrax and other bioterrorism agents. Provides bioterrorism fact sheets, guidelines, notification protocols, news, Frequently Asked Questions, and more. Includes information about CDC roles and national programs. Contains carefully selected links to web resources with authoritative health information, including access to News, General/Overviews, Coping, Prevention/Screening, Specific Conditions/Aspects, and Treatment. Geared specifically toward a consumer health audience. Consumer health reference database from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government agencies and health-related organizations. Includes information on over 700 diseases and conditions, as well as drug information, an illustrated medical encyclopedia and dictionary, interactive patient tutorials, lists of hospitals and physicians, and health news. Produced and updated daily by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). NIAID is the primary Institute at NIH for emerging infectious disease research, including research on agents of bioterrorism. NIAID provides the research needed to understand the pathogenesis of these microbes and the host response to them, and to translate this knowledge into useful interventions and diagnostic tools for an effective response. SIS, a division of the National Library of Medicine is responsible for information resources and services in toxicology, environmental health, chemistry, HIV/AIDS, and specialized topics in minority health. SIS provides access to online databases, responds to queries, produces bibliographies and other publications, and works with other Federal government agencies to provide health information to the world. University of Minnesota -- Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) - The University of Minnesota's CIDRAP's mission is to prevent illness and death from infectious diseases through epidemiologic research and the rapid translation of scientific information into real-world practical applications and solutions. The current focus is in four key areas: public health, preparedness, emerging infectious disease response, agricultural and food biosecurity, and food safety. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center -- Center for Biosecurity - \"The Center for Biosecurity is an independent, nonprofit organization of UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center). Our mission is to strengthen national security by reducing the risks posed by biological attacks, epidemics, and other destabilizing events, and to improve the nation's resilience in the face of such events.\" Saint Louis University School of Public Health -- Institute for Biosecurity - The Institute for Biosecurity (formerly the Center for the Study of Bioterrorism and Emerging Infections) at Saint Louis University School of Public Health was established in 2000 with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Institute carries out bioterrorism and preparedness research and addresses emerging infectious diseases, naturally occurring or introduced by terrorists. The Institute also develops educational material covering management of the consequences of chemical, radiological, and nuclear terrorism. National Academies -Conflict and Security Issues: Policy, Reviews and Evaluations - \"The National Academies conduct research in conflict and security issues that address problems associated with international security, conflict, and arms control. Problem-solving discussions help to develop ideas and strategies that promote new, cooperative approaches to security issues. This research also offers in-depth analysis and recommendations about crucial security problems.\" World Health Organization - Global Alert and Response - The revised International Health Regulations, IHR (2005) provide a global framework to address these needs through a collective approach to the prevention, detection, and timely response to any public health emergency of international concern. Global Alert and Response (GAR) is an integrated global alert and response system for epidemics and other public health emergencies based on strong national public health systems and capacity and an effective international system for coordinated response. World Health Organization - Global Health Atlas - WHO's Communicable Disease Global Atlas is bringing together for analysis and comparison standardized data and statistics for infectious diseases at country, regional, and global levels. World Health Organization - Global Health Observatory (GHO) - \"The Global Health Observatory (GHO) is WHO's portal providing access to data and analyses for monitoring the global health situation. It provides critical data and analyses for key health themes, as well as direct access to the full database.\" Military Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program - The AVIP web site is provided as a public service by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense-Public Affairs and the Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program Agency. Information presented on the AVIP web site is considered public information and may be distributed or copied unless otherwise specified. Access to data and analyses for monitoring the global health situation, including reports and databases of international core health indicators, mortality and disease statistics, and risk facts. The World Health Organization Statistical Information System (WHOSIS) is a guide to statistical information available at WHO, including core health indicators, mortality and health status, and disease statistics. National health statistics organized by topics (aging, births, deaths, etc.) and by state. University of Chicago Campus Resources Emergency Management - The University's Emergency Management website includes the Emergency Management Plan, which outlines steps for responding to and recovering from University-wide emergencies; cAlert, the Emergency Notification System; and more. Environmental Health and Safety - The University of Chicago provides a complete safety program through Safety and Environmental Affairs to alleviate or reduce the severity of exposure to conditions or actions that can cause personal injury or put the University out of compliance with applicable regulations. This goal is accomplished by the identification, analysis, and the development of corrective action plans to alleviate or reduce the severity of risk to students, faculty and staff to injurious conditions or actions. All buildings and laboratories comprising the University of Chicago are inspected on an annual basis to identify and locate infractions of fire, laboratory, radiation safety or general safety concerns. Master of Science in Threat and Response Management - The Master of Science in Threat and Response Management at the University of Chicago's Graham School of General Studies is designed to prepare public health professionals, law enforcement officials, fire and emergency personnel, medical and nursing professionals, and policy makers to respond to and recover from complex incidents regardless of their size or cause.
