Your [essential oil diffuser](https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/home/eco-friendly-essential-oil-diffusers) is like your contact lens case or dehumidifier. You use it on a near-daily basis\u2014but the thought of cleaning it almost never occurs to you. That's a mistake. In a perfect world, you'd be wiping down your diffuser after each use and doing a deep clean once or twice a month, says AnnAlisa Behling, ND, a naturopathic doctor with [Holistic Care Approach](http://holisticcareapproach.com) in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This sort of hyper-vigilance probably isn't for the reason you think, though. While most of the surfaces or appliances in your home quickly turn into breeding grounds for mold, bacteria, and other nasties if not cleaned regularly, that's rarely the case for diffusers. \"I've never heard of this happening,\" says Kathi Keville, of the [American Herb Association](http://ahaherb.com). \"Essential oils are antimicrobial or antifungal in general, so they actually help prevent things like mold from growing.\" Learn how to make a simple, germ-fighting hand sanitizer with essential oils: Science backs this up. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5206475/) looking at diffusers specifically is scarce, but countless studies have shown that many commonly used essential oils\u2014like thyme, clove, rosemary, sandalwood, eucalyptus, and tea tree \u2014are potent germ-fighters. In other words, they actually help keep your diffuser clean. (The one exception where mold might be an issue is if you let water stand in a diffuser for days or weeks after the essential oil has run out, say Behling and Keville.) So...why worry about it then? The answer has little to do with preventing the risk of filling your indoor air with toxins. Instead, it's about helping your diffuser function optimally. Oils\u2014especially highly viscous ones like patchouli or vetiver\u2014leave behind residues that can gum up diffusers so they don't work as well, Keville says. Those leftover residues can also affect the scent\u2014and efficacy\u2014of the next oil you diffuse, Behlinger adds. If you're diffusing lavender to relax, for instance, any leftover aroma from that energizing grapefruit you diffused earlier in the day might make it harder to chill out. Cleaning doesn't have to be a big deal though. After each time you use your diffuser, just use a [microfiber cloth](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EVY2SKG/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rodalesorganiclife-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00EVY2SKG&ascsubtag=%5BASIN%7CB00EVY2SKG%5Bnid%7C131206%5Bvid%7C546871%5Bbrand%7CROL%5Butm%7C) or a Q-tip to wipe away any excess oil or water, Behling recommends. Then once or twice a month, give the equipment a more thorough cleaning by wiping everything down with rubbing alcohol. Or just drop a teaspoon of white vinegar into the diffuser and let it run, Keville says. But maybe do it outside, unless you want your space to stink. "}
