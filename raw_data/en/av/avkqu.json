Natural remedies may also be called complementary medicine or alternative medicine. Some commonly searched natural remedies for MG include: - Magnesium - CBD oil - Acupuncture - Chinese herbal medicine - Elderberry - Frankincense - Homeopathic remedies - Ayurvedic treatment Researchers have proven that certain nutritional supplements and other remedies can help with the symptoms of many other diseases, but not myasthenia gravis. There is no science to support using any complementary therapy to treat MG. Current research There is little research out there about treating MG with natural remedies.

Medical marijuana and CBD oil More people than ever are trying medical marijuana and cannabidiol (CBD) to treat a host of health conditions. CBD is a substance extracted from marijuana that does not produce a high. Research shows that marijuana and CBD help some people with cancer pain and nausea, [multiple sclerosis](https://multiplesclerosis.net), and seizures.5 However, marijuana and its derivatives have shown no benefit to people with MG or any other [autoimmune condition](/related-autoimmune-diseases), according to a statement from the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America. A quick look at social media reveals that some people say it works for them, while others say it has no effect or makes their symptoms worse.5 Be sure to speak with your doctor before trying any complementary medicine or nutritional supplements, no matter how harmless it sounds. MG is notorious for being triggered by a wide variety of medicines, foods, and drinks.4 Other natural options There are still plenty of natural options you can choose to support your health if you have myasthenia gravis, such as:6 - Taking [rest breaks](/rest)during the day - Developing good sleep habits - Eating [nutritious foods](/diet)(but not too much) - Getting as much physical activity as your energy allows [Reducing stress](/stress)with mindfulness training, yoga, or meditation - Spending time with supportive friends and family "}
