We look forward to restoring these to district meetings to in - person functions in 2022.

After so many months of meeting only via Zoom, it was great to collaborate and fellowship physically together in the same room .

SDPhA has been actively engaged in this process . The first interim study committee meeting took place May 26- 27. At the request of the chairman , SDPhA provided testimony from the pha rmacy perspective. Jeremy Daniel, PharmD, BCPS, BCPP , provided committee members with exceptional insight into the clinical facts aro und medical marijuana, it s act ual effectiveness on certain disease states , and how it in teracts with medic ations . SDPhA has not taken a position on this issue, but has worked hard to position pharma cists as the medication e xperts and a trusted resource. Th roughout testimony, there was a repeated call , particularly from law enforcement , that since IM 26 labels marijuan a as medicine, it should be treated as such , and handled through the same distribution cha nnels . We've had Page | 2 President -Dana Darger | President Elect - Kristen Carter | Vice President - Melissa Gorecki | Treasurer - Jessica Strobl | Board Member -- Bernie Hendricks | Board Member - Andy Tonneson | Executive Director -- Amanda Bacon numerous conversations a nd calls with lawmakers and law officers explaining that, to the D rug Enforcement Ag ency (DEA), marijuana remains a Schedule I dr ug. That means the conseque nces to a pharmacist /pharmacy could be devastating . These conversations are ongoing, as is t he interim study , and we will continue to participate in the process . Secretary Kim Malsam -Rysdon has said she anticipates the Department of Health will start issuing certification cards to patients and caregivers by mid-Novembe r. IM 26 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE Initiated Me asure 26 requires the creation of an oversight committee, and South Dakota pharmacists will have a seat at the table. On June 2, Eric Grocott, a past president of SDPh A, was appointed to the 14 -member oversi ght committee b y the executive board of the Legislative Research Council. The committee's role is to review and advise on medical marijuana in South Dakota. DEA TAKE -BACK EVENT | APRIL 24 Please visit https://takebackday.dea.gov/sites/default/files/NTBI20%20Totals.pdf to view full take -back event total s and information. We c ontinue to help spread the wor d about th ese opportuniti es and work to encourage pharmacist participation in these locally -held events. We also continue to work with pharmacists and the BOP to promote the year - round pharmaceutical disposal receptacles located through out the state. If you h ave a story you'd like to share about either to aid in that promotion , please contact our office . PBM REFORM WORKGROUP The Supreme C ourt's unanimous ru ling in the Rutledge case set off a flurry of legislative activity in many states, including South Dakota . While the ruling does not end DIR fees or unfair reimbursement, the Court held that the Employee Retirement Income Securities Act of 1974 (ERISA) does NOT prevent states from regulating the pricing or rates that Pharmacy Benefit Mangers (PBMs) pay pharmacies for dispensing prescriptions to beneficiaries on ERISA plans ( plans that are sponsored by a private employer or union ). In other words, it means state laws that address pricing and rates apply to ERISA plans, which PBMs had claimed were exempt from the state laws. Provisions such as reimbursements to pharmacies, MAC transparency, and the ability to decline to dispe nse prescriptions in the face of negative reimbursements all fall within the state's authority to regulate ERISA plans. Additionally, ERISA plans should be subject to reimbursement floors and prohibitions on retroactive claim reductions. SDPhA has worked diligent ly for many years to educate lawmakers on the comple xities of P BMs. The intricacies of the process are not always easily understood, but in general, ou r lawmakers have always known that when SDPhA come s to talk to them abou t something - it's because there's a great need. Gag clause laws, clawbacks , DIR fees, and the 340B program have all been addressed through legislation in recent legislative sessions . But , as always, the PBMs continue to find workarounds . Now , the Rutledge ruling gives us more backin g to strengthen ou r laws. SDPhA is working together with other stakeholders to establish the best pa th forwa rd to tackling this issue in the 2022 legislative session. Workgroup meetings are already underway, and SDPhA has also met with representatives of the state to gauge their interest and support. I t seems quite ev ident that it will take a concentrated effort from all parties to garner the needed support. We a nticipated t his challenge, and know our pharmaci sts will rise with us to me et it. We look forward to sharing more details on these efforts at the annual meeting in Spearfish. WILKE V. PCMA On a similar note, SDPh A has signed on to participate as Amicus Curiae in PCMA vs. Wilke (8th Cir.). In 2017, the State of North Dakota enacted comprehensive legislation to regulate many practices of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that the State perceived as abusive to p atients and pharmacies . Among other things, North Dakota regulates the disclosure of the fees that PBMs charge pharmacies and the use by PBMs of esoteric accreditation and certification standards that Page | 3 President -Dana Darger | President Elect - Kristen Carter | Vice President - Melissa Gorecki | Treasurer - Jessica Strobl | Board Member -- Bernie Hendricks | Board Member - Andy Tonneson | Executive Director -- Amanda Bacon restr ict pharmacy access. In addition, North Dakota limits arbitrary and costly restrictions in PBM contracts designed to steer patients to PBM -affiliated pharmacies, and it has prohibited copay claw -backs and the use of gag clauses to prevent pharmacists from disclosing drug price information to patients. Before North Dakota's law went into effect, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), the lobbying arm of the PBM industry, sued to prevent the State from enforcing its PBM law. PCMA's lawsuit claimed that two federal laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and Medicare Part D, prevent North Dakota from regulating PBMs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed, invalidating North Dakota's PBM law in its entirety. However, in light of the Rutledge case decision , the Supreme Court issued an order grant ing North Dakota's petition for review, v acated the Eighth Circuit's decision, and sent the case back to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration . According to PCMA, Rutledge is limited to State laws that regulate the rates at which PBMs reim burse pharmacies. PCMA argues that ERISA and Medicare Part D preempt any other State law regulating PBMs. An adverse decision in Wilke could severely limit the States' ability to regulate PBMs . South Dakota, Like Arkansas and North Dakota is in the 8 th circuit, so what happens with these cases sets a precedent for how we move forw ard addressing PBMs in our state. COMMRECIAL AND LEGISLATIVE (C & L) FUND All of th is legis lative work leads u s here - to the very important role the Commer cial and Legislative Fund plays in our ability to move forward with PBM reform, and other legislative priorities. Th e pan demic has given us a very unique opportunity to showcase the vital role pharmacists play in the health and well- being of our communities, and is openi ng key doors for the profession. We work hard daily to position ourselves at the table that allows us access to opportunities as they arise. That is why the C & L Fund is so very important. The C&L Fund is separate from the SDPhA gener al accounts. It is used to support the legislative work we do, and relies nearly exclusively on contributions. Lobbying is an expensive, but necessary function, so the importance of this fund cannot be overstated. It is critical, and assists SDPhA in the p rotection and promotion of the profession during the Legislative Session. Unfortunately, t he C&L fund is reaching a critically low level. As we roll out the new website, and mount a n effort to strengthen our state PBM laws, you will see more focus on sustaining this essential fund . We will highlight the work we do with it, how you can contribute , and frankly, why it's more important now than ever to do so. We need support to continue to ensure our seat at the table in Pierre. You can expect to see reminders in your email and on social media to contribute. You can easily contribute at sdpha.org, or send a check to SDPhA, P.O. Box 518. Pierre, SD 57501. We need to have the financial resources available to fully swing into action on bills and policy that affect pharmacists in South Dakota. During 20 20/2021 , we expended around $1 2,000 to fund lobbying activities. Fund c ontributions again fell well short of the amount needed to continue to support a lobbyist. Simply put, we can't retain our Lobbyist, Bob Riter and his partner Lindsey Riter- Rapp without this support. Thank you to all those who have, and continue to support our efforts! SDPHA WEBSITE REBUILD The final details are nearly complete, and after a lot of work to e stablish a new payment gateway and credit card processor, we are thrilled to share that SDPhA will launch a completely new , updated , and much more user -friendly website ! The new website feature s a completely mobile -responsive and modern design, and a fully upgr aded and intuitive user experience - from convention registration to contacting us and everything in between. The new website will feature a forms library which will play a key role in streamlining conventions and eliminating the use of so much Page | 4 President -Dana Darger | President Elect - Kristen Carter | Vice President - Melissa Gorecki | Treasurer - Jessica Strobl | Board Member -- Bernie Hendricks | Board Member - Andy Tonneson | Executive Director -- Amanda Bacon paper movin g forward. Another key feature is an area we call the Action Center. That's where you'll find all the issues we're working on at the federal and state level. It'll also house the new bill tracker we launched this legislative session, and it will even allow for you to opt in to text alerts about key issues , to let you know when to contact your legislators on an issue of importance to the profession. The Action Center will be a vital piece of our communications on legislative issues, and we are excited for y ou to see it, and put it into action yourself. The launch of the new website will coincide with the opening of convention registration , and we are thrilled a bout both! SCAPP | SDSU APhA - ASP CHAPTER We continue to work closely with SDSU and the student pharmacists , and we are th rilled to welcome a new student liaison to the SDPhA board. Kaylee Ayers will join Katelynn Jackson in that role. The student liaisons have done an amazing job keeping us apprised of activities, and the SDPhA board remains committed to supporting the students in every way possible . We look forward to getting back to in -person activities with the SCAPP members such as convention attendance (free of charge), rooms for convention and Legislative Days, and support for the Back -to-School Picnic, Pharmacy Days, and American Pharmacists Month activities. CORONOVIRUS (COVID -19) Vaccination Distribution / Pandemic Response As millions of Americans receive the COVID -19 vaccine, including more than 361,000 (as of the date of this report ) in South Dakota, pharmacists continue to play a key part in vaccine rollout across the state. Hospital pharmacists have been vital in meeting the initial challenges of vaccine distribution, handling, storage, standing up vaccination clinics, and finally, getting shots in arms. Community retail pharmacists across the state also answered the call to prepare to vaccinate the state's general population. The DOH website has a complete list of Federal Pharmacy Program locations . Distribution to independent and smaller community pharmacies continues to present challenges. S torage, transportation and minimum orders have complicated this process, and we continue to participate in conversations weekly with the South Dakota Department of Health (SD DOH) on opportunities to further engage our pharmacists who are ready, willing, and able to provide vaccinations to those in their communities. Communication We encourage everyone to continue to closely watch your email, the SDPhA Facebook Group page and the SDPhA website for updates and important pandemic and vaccine -related information. Even as the pandemic wanes, communication and offering assistance t o our pharmacists and pharmacies continues to be a top priority for SDPhA . Pharmacies and pharmacists are critical to the well- being of the citizens of South Dakota, not only in dealing with COVID - 19, but also in our residents' ongoing care. The new website will continue to house COVID -19 Resource s. We post \"news\" related information on our Facebook Group page . That includes pertinent updates from CMS, HHS, the FDA, DSS, etc. We continue to send out emails to all as appropriate. We greatly appreciate the ongoing strong and open channels of communication with several state agencies, our cong ressional delegation and the South Dakota Board of Pharmacy on items of concern to pharmacists as well as the public health and safety. Advocacy and Engagement While the initial frenzied pace of the pandemic response has slowed, we continue to engage wi th the BOP, South Dakota Department of Health, and other state partners on behalf of pharmacists where appropriate. Meantime at the federal level, we remain in close communication with our Congressional delegation, and continue to keep apprised of, and engaged where suitable, in the all the rapidly moving parts on Capitol Hill. Advocacy efforts now focus on maintaining the flexibilities extended to pharmacists by the federal government, while continuing to advocate for change that allows pharmacists to prac tice to the full scope of their expertise. This has included not only work on emergency provider status, but on immunizations, testing, payment, compounding and funding programs as well. The National Alliance of Page | 5 President -Dana Darger | President Elect - Kristen Carter | Vice President - Melissa Gorecki | Treasurer - Jessica Strobl | Board Member -- Bernie Hendricks | Board Member - Andy Tonneson | Executive Director -- Amanda Bacon State Pharmacy Associations (NASPA) also con tinues to work on our behalf with many of our national partners on matters of concern and importance to pharmacists. NCPA CONGRESSIONAL PHARMACY FLY -IN | APRIL 19 -21 For the second year in a row, SDPhA participate d in the NCPA fly -in without leaving the office! This year NCPA arrang ed virtual visits between associations, members and congressional delegations. This is a very welcome opportunity to meet with our South Dakota Congressional Delegation to secure support for various federal pieces of legislation affecting pharmacy, as well as bring them up to speed on pharmacy issues here at home. Jessica Strobl, SDPhA Treasurer joined Amanda Bacon in re presenting the association in these conversations. NASPA LEADERSHIP RETREAT | APRIL 19-21 Goin g virtu al does have some adva ntages - typically budget and time constraints would preclude SDPhA f rom participating the in the National Alliance of St ate Pharmacy Associations (NASPA ) leadership retreat for executives and presidents -elect. However, this year the event was held virtually, a llowing Kristen Cart er, SDPhA President -Elect and Amanda Bacon, Executive Director, to part icipate in the two -day event. This was truly a great opportunity f or collaboration among attendees from all the states. It was also a chance for our pres ident s-elect to learn more about the nuts -and-bolts of the day -to-day work in association managem ent, especially as it re lates to financ es in the non -profit sector . We hope some sort of virtual option remains available for this even t in the future. NATIONAL BILLS SDPhA remains engaged in a variety of ways in various national efforts on key topics directly impacting our pharmacists such as: COVID -19 relat ed bills, DIR fee relief, PBM reform, pricing transparency, dispensing requirements, improvements to Medicare, prescription drug misuse and abuse, compounding guidance and provider status.

PHARMACY TECHNICIAN UNIVERSITY (PTU) Technicians - finding them, training them, and keeping them is becoming an even more pressing issue now tha n perhaps maybe ever before. PTU is helping us help our pharmacies answer that call, and our slate of trainings and tools continues to grow. We are pleased to continue to offer low -cost access to thi s online training module , and to further enhance the programs we offer through it. To date SDPhA has enrolled more than 10 6 participants. Not only were w e one of the first Associations in the nation to work with Therapeutic Research Center (TRC) and PTU in this manner, we are now working on a partnership with them that will make us one of four state associations in the nation to provide an enhanced array of services nationwide. Page | 8 President -Dana Darger | President Elect - Kristen Carter | Vice President - Melissa Gorecki | Treasurer - Jessica Strobl | Board Member -- Bernie Hendricks | Board Member - Andy Tonneson | Executive Director -- Amanda Bacon We are also enhancing our partnership with the DIAL Virtual program by working with them to elevate the promotion of the pharmacy technician program they offer in the schools (which uses our PTU platform). Working together with school principals and administrators we hope to identify more students interested in the field, and increase access to the program. During the 2020 -2021 school year, we had 8 student s from various South Dakota High Schools enrolled. We already have 4 on the list for this Fall. We greatly appreciate the pharmacists who have stepped up in communities across the state to work with the DIAL program and these students. This is an exceptional opportunity to introduce the profession into the school systems, and we are grateful for everyone working together who makes it happen. Just a reminder, t he Therapeutic Research Center - PTU 101 module we administer qualifies as a PTCB- Recognized Education/Training Program of the CPhT program , and upon completion, allows participants to sit for the certification exam. In addition to PTU 101, we now offer four additiona l training modules through TRC : PTU Elite: Immunizations PTU Elite: Math Mastery - Community Pharmacy PTU Elite: Compounded Sterile Preparation Technician Program PTU Elite: Soft Skills Program. For more details and enrollment information, contact Amanda Bacon at amanda@sdpha.org or (605) 224- 2338 . HEALTH PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (HPAP) The passage of SB4 in 2021 means change s to some of the requirements for HPAP program administration . We continue to appreciate the open communication with the Board of Pharmacy on what this may mean for the future of the program . Our association continues to support HPAP , and saw no changes in the billing for FY 20201 -2022. A pharmacist may access the program by self- referral, board referral, or referral from another person or agency, employer, coworker or family member. THE SOUTH DAKOTA PH ARMA CIST Communicating with our members quickly and effectively is extremely critical to the success of the Association. The South Dakota Pharmacist continues a quarterly electronic distribution. You can also find it posted with past issues on our websit e. It always offers 1.5 hours of CE, and provides a source of communication for the association on rules, legislative issues and education that affect pharmacy practice. SOCIAL MEDIA / EMAIL BLASTS We continue to work on our social media footprint. This is something we consider vit al to our work of representing the pharmacy profession through advancing patient care, enhancing the public awareness and serving in the best interest of public health and pharmacy. It's also sometimes a challenge with a one -man office . There are a lot of things to tackle in a day, and sometimes the social media posts fall victim to the more urgent i ssues of any given day. That being said, the board is comm itted to th is communication, as we know it's effective - so expect to see more posts from them on our platforms , too. Here's what's important to know about each of our s ocial spaces : Our Facebook and Instagram (Instagram remains a work in progress) are primarily consumer- driven health messages. These posts are intended to give you easy access to c ontent you can in turn share on your social channels to help engage your patients and the general public. The SDPhA Member News and Announcements Facebook Group page is where you will now find industry news, SDPhA event and meeting information, and legisl ative updates as warranted. Page | 9 President -Dana Darger | President Elect - Kristen Carter | Vice President - Melissa Gorecki | Treasurer - Jessica Strobl | Board Member -- Bernie Hendricks | Board Member - Andy Tonneson | Executive Director -- Amanda Bacon LinkedIn gives us an additional forum to gather and share news impacting the pharmacy profession. The page is established. Look for increased messaging there soon. Please like, follow, share and engage with us - that's what makes these tools effective. ASSOCIATION MANAGEMENT ROTATION SDPhA is pleased to welcome Benjamin Ostebee for an AP PE in Association Management late this summer. Osteb ee is scheduled to be gin work with Amanda Bacon and the SDPhA Board of Directors Aug. 2 3, and will conclude her rotation Sept. 24. We are thrilled to work with student pharmacists who want to take a deeper dive into this unique field of management , learning the day -to-day operations, the complexities of running an association, and the many management aspects unique to associations and legislative work. We look forward to the opportunity to work with more students in the future. SDPHA OFFICE UPDATE There hasn 't been the typical moment to ca tch our breath coming o ut of legislative session this year. Continued work regarding the pandemic, national adv ocacy work , the legislative Interim committee, and laying the groundwork for enhanced PBM efforts , as well as no w planning for a live convention in Sept ember - have meant an extremely bu sy start to the \"off-season \" for the SDPhA office .

Section 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions that must be satisfied for human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist or licensed physician to be exempt from three sections of the FD&C Act requiring: 1. Compliance with curre nt good manufacturing practice (section 501(a)(2)(B) (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B) ); 1 For purposes of this MOU, see the definition s of \"inordinate amounts \" and \" distribution of compounded human drug products interstate \" (also referred to as \"distributed interstate\") in Appendix A. 2 As described herein, the State Board of Pharmacy or other appropriate State agency signatory is agreeing to take certain actions as described in Section III below. For example, if a State Board of Pharmacy signs the MOU, the State Board of Pharmacy agrees to take the actions described in Section III below with respect to drugs compounded by pharmacies in that State; in addition, the State Board of Pharmacy a grees that if it receives information about complaints or becomes aware of information about drugs compounded by physicians in the State and distributed interstate, it will forward the information to FDA and the appropriate State regulator of physicians as describ ed in Section III . 2 2. Labeling with adequate directions f or use (section 502(f)(1) (21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1) ); and 3. FDA approval prior to marketing (section 505 (21 U.S.C. 355) ). b. To qualify for the se exemptions, a compounded human drug product must , among other things,3 meet the conditions in section 503A (b)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act , under which the drug product is compounded in a State that: 1. Has entered into an MOU with FDA that addresses the distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded drug products interstate and provides for appropriate investigation by a S tate agency of complaints relating to compounded drug products distributed outside such S tate (section 503A(b)(3)(B)(i)); or 2. Has not entered into an MOU with FDA and the licensed pharmacist, licensed pharmacy, or licensed physician distributes (or causes to be distributed) compounded drug products out of the S tate in which they are compounded in quantities that do not exceed 5 percent of the total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by such pharmacy or physician (s ection 503A(b)(3)(B)( ii)). c. Section 503A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act directs FDA to develop a standard MOU, in consultation with the National As sociation of Boards of Pha rmacy (NABP), for use by the S tates in complying with section 503A(b)(3)(B)(i). This MOU is the standard MOU developed by FDA for this purpose . III. SUBSTANCE OF AGREEMENT a. Investigation of Complaints Relating to Compounded Human Drug Products Distributed Outside the State 1. The [ insert State B oard of Pharmacy or other appropriate S tate agency ] will investigate complaint s of adverse drug experiences and product quality issues4 relating to human drug products compounded at a pharmacy in [insert State] and distributed outside the State . Any investigations will be performed pursuant to the [insert State Board of Pharmacy or other appropriate State agency] 's established investigatory policies and procedures, including those related to prioritizing complaints , provided they are not in conflict with the terms of this MOU . 3 To qualify for the exemptions under section 503A, a compounder must obtain a prescription for an individually identified patient (section 503A(a) of the FD&C Act). This MOU does not alter this condition. 4 For purposes of this MOU, see the definitions of \"adverse drug experience\" and \"product quality issue\" in Appendix A. 3 2. Any investigation s performed by the [ insert S tate Board of P harmacy or other appropriate State agency ] under this MOU will include taking steps to assess (1) whether there is a public health risk associated with the compounded drug product ; and (2) whether any public health risk associated with the product is adequately contained . 3. After the [ insert S tate Board of P harmacy or other appropriate S tate agency ]'s investigation, if the complaint is substantiated, the [ insert State Board of Pharmacy or other appropriate S tate agency ], in accordance with and as permitted by S tate law, will take the action that the [insert S tate Board of P harmacy or other appropriat e State agency ] considers to be appropriate and warranted to ensure that the relevant pharmacy investigates the root cause of the problem that is the subject of the complaint and undertakes sufficient corrective action to address any identified public heal th risk relating to the problem , including the risk that future similar problems may occur . 4. The [insert State B oard of Pharmacy or other appropriate S tate agency ] will maintain records of the complaint about adverse drug experiences or product quality issues relating to human drug products compounded at a pharmacy , the investigation of the complaint, and any response to or action taken as a result of the complaint, beginning when the [ insert State Board of Pharmacy or other appropriate S tate agency ] receives notice of the complaint. The [ insert S tate Board of Pharmacy or other appropriate State agency ] will maintain these records for at least 3 years. The 3 -year period begins on the date of final action on a complaint, or the date of a decision that the complaint requires no action. 5. As soon as possible, but no later than 5 business days after receiving a complaint involving a serious adverse drug experience or serious product quality issue relating to a drug product compounded at a pharmacy and distributed outside the State , the [insert S tate Board of Pharmacy or other appropriate S tate agency ] will, by submission to an Information Sharing Network5 or by e mail to State MOU@fda.hhs.gov , provide FDA with the information described in the Submission and Disclosure of Information section of this MOU (section III.c.1.a.i -iii).6 5 For purposes of this MOU, see the definitions of \"serious adverse drug experience,\" \"serious product quality issue,\" and \"Information Sharing Network\" in Appendix A. 6 The information includes the following: (i) Name and contact information of the complainant, if available; (ii) Name and address of the pharmacy that is the subject of the complaint; and (iii) Description of the complaint, including a description of any compounded human d rug product that is the subject of the complaint . 4 6. After the [insert S tate Board of P harmacy or other appropriate S tate agency ] concludes its investigation of a complaint assessed to involve a serious adverse drug experience or serious product quality issue relating to a drug product compounded at a pharmacy and distributed outside the Sta te, the [insert State B oard of P harmacy or other appropriate State agency ] will share with FDA , as described in the Submission and Disclosure of Information section of this MOU (section III.c.1.a.iv- v),7 the results of the investigation as permitted by State law . 7. If the [insert State Board of P harmacy or other appropriate S tate agency ] receives a complaint involving an adverse drug experience or product quality issue relating to a human drug product compounded by a physician and distributed outside the State, the [inser t State Board of Pharmacy or other appropriate S tate agency ] will notify the appropriate regulator of physicians within the State. T he [insert State Board of P harmacy or other appropri ate S tate agency ] will also notify FDA by submission to an Information Sharing Network or by sendi ng an email to StateMOU@fda.hhs.gov with the information described in the Submission and Disclosure of Information section of this MOU (section III.c.2.a .-c), if available, as soon as possible, but no later than 5 business days, after receiving the complaint. b.

In South Dakota, this is prohibited based on rule, ARSD20:51.13:02, summarized as pharmacies are prohibited to accept u nused medications from patients. A pilot program was implemented with the objective to provide evidence demonstrating the impact provided to patients. Methods This retrospective, chart -reviewed study analyzed patient data from the DRP and a matched cohort from July 1, 2019 to February 28, 2021. Primary objectives were to track the number of prescriptions filled and average wholesale price of each prescription dispensed through the DRP. The secondary outcome was to compare the time for patients to receive prescriptions, from time of prescribing to insurance approval. Results Since implementation, over $2. 4 million in prescription drugs have been donated. Prescriptions have been dispensed to 135 patients, totaling over $1.3 million based on average wholesale price. In comparing the DRP to matched cohort, DRP patients waited on average 13.5 days for insurance approval while matched cohort patients waited on average two days for insurance approval. The results showed DRP patients were able to pick up their prescription on average 14.5 days prior to insurance approval - meaning they were able to start therapy with a new medication over two weeks ahead of ti me. Conclusion 5 The DRP pilot program showed improve d access to medications, decrease d costs for patients, and lessened prescription drug waste. Pharmacists are critical to the success of programs by ensuring the safety and vi ability of donated medications. Additionally, t his program promotes pharmacists optimizing overall medication access and care. Keywords: drug repository, specialty pharmacy , pharmacist, medication access, waste reduction 6 BACKGROUND In the United States, state boards of pharmacy are responsible for establishing rules that dictate how patients can safely and legally access medications. As of 2019, 37 states had laws allowing unused medications to be donated and redispensed to patients through drug repository programs.1, 2 Drug repository programs are driven by patient needs that have been identified by healthcare providers including patient advocates, pharmacists, nurses, and physicians, along with patient desires to give back in order to decrease th e financial burden of medication for others. In January 2020, the American Society of Clinical Oncology issued a position statement on state drug repository programs, outlining their support, in that widespread use of such programs could lower costs for patients and payers and improve access to treatment for people who are unable to afford high -cost cancer drugs \u2014all while reducing the amount of unused medications in the outpatient setting. 1 Redispensing of unused medication may assist patients in need, offering timely and affordable access to medications prescribed while also lessening waste of healthcare dollars on such things as hazardous medication disposal. Drug repository programs can also provide a bridge for those patients awaiting access to medication assistance programs or prior authorizations, allowing them to start therapy immediately. In South Dakota, returning unused medications is prohibited based on the following rule, ARSD20:51.13:02 Return of unused drugs, summarized as pharmacists and pharmacies are prohibited to accept unused drugs or prescribed medications from patients or their proxy. Noticing the need for a drug repository program in South Dakota, especially with several nearby states having functioning programs in place 3, 4, 5, oncology clinic pharmacists and specialty 7 pharmacists within Avera McKennan worked with the South Dakota Board of Pharmacy (SDBOP) to propose the development of a drug repository pilot program at the Avera Specialty Pharmacy (ASP). ASP was originally granted a one -year variance for ARSD20:51.13:02 to allow the pharmacy to accept the return of unused drugs and redispense the drugs under the following stipulations: 1. Only legend drugs in the original, unopened, sealed or tamper -evident container which include s lot number(s) and expiration date(s) are eligible for donation 2. Drugs packaged in single -unit doses may be accepted and dispensed if the outside packaging has been opened however the single unit -dose package is unopened The variance was granted starting July 1, 2019 and extended for an additional year through June 30, 2021. Policies and procedures were created for accepting, storing, dispensing, and documenting donated legend drugs. The creation of patient donation and re ceipt forms helped to ensure transparent communication and adequate documentation of all program transactions. The policies dictated what medications would not be accepted, including controlled substances, drugs with REMS requirements, and drugs with tempe rature sensitive storage requirements. The pilot program initially focused on oncology specialty medications due to the expensive nature of those medications and frequent therapy changes. During the second year of operation, the goal was to increase the s pecialty medication scope through increased awareness and education to employees across the rural Avera footprint, focusing on specialty disease states of rheumatology, infectious disease, and transplant/hepatology, along with greater advertisement to pati ents through flyers, webpage information, and television 8 broadcasts. Working to engage the health system outside of the Sioux Falls region to ensure patients could participate anywhere across the state, the program received a grant from the South Dakota So ciety of Health -System Pharmacists to assist with shipping costs of repository donations and dispensations to and from ASP. METHODS & MATERIALS The objective of this study was to demonstrate the impact this program aims to provide to the community in South Dakota by increasing patient access to medication. Endpoints The primary objective was to track the number of prescriptions filled and the average wholesale price of each pr escription for patients who receive d medication through the drug repository program. Secondary objective s included comparing the amount of time it takes for a patient to start a medication, from time of prescribing to insurance approval, between drug repository dispensations and a matched cohort group, and to identify potential cost to pharmacies that participate in such a program including time spent counseling patients, maintaining inventory, and providing community awareness of the program. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria The study population inclusion criteria for the drug repository program patient group included dispensations from the ASP drug repository; the inclusion criteria for the matched cohort group included dispensations filled outside of ASP drug repository program, a new prescription for the same medication as the drug repository program patient, and the medication being dispensed within a 12 month period around the drug repository program 9 dispensation. The only exclusion criteria was prescriptions filled outside of the study timeframe of July 1, 2019 to February 28, 2021. Study Design This retrospective, chart -reviewed study analyzed patients from the DRP and a matched cohort patient group from July 1 , 2019 to February 28, 2021 to compare the time for patients to receive prescriptions. Electronic medical records, including MOSAIQ, Meditech, EnterpriseRx, and Dromos, were utilized in order to collect the patient information listed: Patient name Prescription n umber Medication prescribed Quantity prescribed Prescription benefit coverage Prescription benefit utilized (for matched cohort patients only) Date prescription written Date prescription filled Date of drug receipt by patient (pickup or mailed date) Date of insurance approval (if applicable) Cost of prescription filled based on AW P (for drug repository patients only) With the secondary endpoint of potential cost to pharmacies, self- reported data was collected regarding time spent: Writing policies, protocols, and creating forms Training staff 10 Counseling patients about utilizing the drug repository program Maintaining donation inventory Developing community outreach and awareness of the program Coordinating and creating internal webpage with all inventory data RESULTS Since implementation of the program through mid-June 2021, 141 prescriptions have been dispensed from t he repository totaling $1,3 97,955.64 based on average wholesale price. The average cost of each prescript ion dispensed amounts to around $10,000. During this time, $2,514,571.54 in medications have been donated to the repository program. Some of the most commonly donated and di spensed medications can be found in Table 1 . Regarding the secondary endpoint of comparing the amount of time it takes for a patient to start a medication, from time of prescribing to insurance approval, between drug repository dispensations and a matched cohort group, 68 dispensations in the drug re pository group were able to be matched to 55 dispensations in the cohort patient group. For the drug repository group, 13 dispensations were excluded as the date of insurance approval was before the written date of the prescription, meaning it was not the first time the patient had received the medication. Of the 55 dispensations reviewed for inclusion criteria, 28 of them had an insurance approval date after the prescription written date, with the average difference in wait time for insurance approval arou nd 13.5 days. For 16 of those 28 dispensations, the patient picked up or was mailed medication from the drug repository program on average 14.5 days prior to their insurance approval - meaning they were able to start therapy with a new 11 medication over two weeks ahead of time. For the additional 27 dispensations included, insurance approval was not necessarily a factor in why they received medication from the repository. It was due to other reasons including a lapse in coverage, a delay in the ability for the patient to obtain their medication or supply, or the prescription being a medication not routinely covered by insurance, meaning it saved the patient an out -of-pocket expense. When comparing to the matched cohort group of patients, of the 55 dispensations , eight of them were excluded as insurance approval was before the written date of the prescription, meaning it was not the first fill by the patient. Forty -seven dispensations met inclusion criteria where the insurance approval was after the prescription written date, with the average difference in wait time for insurance approval around two days. While this time was much shorter than our average wait time for the repository program patients, it means we are identifying those patients who would benefit most from the repository, rather than those patients with less concern over coverage or paying for medication. The additional secondary endpoint was focused on potential program cost. Initially, the time to set up the program including writing policies, protocols, and creating forms, training staff and the creation of an internal inventory webpage amounted to 15 hours of pharmacist time. The overall maintenan ce of the program after two years amounts to one an d a half to two hours of pharmacist time per week. DISCUSSION Strengths 12 The program has been able to demonstrate significant cost savings through repurposing of medication that would have otherwise been destroyed. The strengths of this study were the ability to show the drug repository pilot program can provide medication to patients over two weeks ahead of ti me, while waiting for insurance and/or prior authorization approval, and provided data highlighting the help provided to patients for lapses in coverage and delays in obtaining medications or supplies - a huge part of the mission of the Avera Health organization. Limitations The limitations of this study included a small patient sample for the repository and matched cohort comparison, and with data requiring manual chart review making it challenging to uncover insurance information and coverage dates at times. CONCLUSION Drug repository programs have been shown to improve access to medications, decrease costs for patients, and lessen prescription drug waste. Pharmacists are critical to the success of programs by ensuring the safety and viability of donated medications, along with dispens ing and counseling of patients on their medications. For patients waiting on insurance approval , based on our study results , they were able to receive medication from the repository program on average over 14 days ahead of time. Current time spent maintain ing progra m donations and dispensations amounts to around one and a half to two hours per week. This drug repository pilot program not only helps to assist patients in South Dakota, it promotes pharmacists optimizing overall medication access and care. 13 REFERENCES 1.

Various studies have demonstrated that pharmacists increase vaccination rates against influenza, pneumonia, and herpes zoster. Patients have shown high acceptance of pharmacy -based immunizations, with 97% of vaccinated patients surveyed reporting satisfaction with their experience in the pharmacy. One -third of all influenza vaccines given during the 2013 -2014 flu season w ere provided in a community pharmacy. In addition, studies have demonstrated that pharmacy -based immunizations are more cost -effective than those provided in other settings, including physician offices.1 Community pharmacies have further demonstrate d their value in public health through partnerships with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to deliver COVID -19 testing and vaccinations to optimize supply and equity during the pandemic . Fu rther , HHS has taken steps to ensure that pharmacies and pharmacists are optimized to their fullest capacity through the technician vaccine administration allowances in the PREP Act . 2 Most recently, the CDC and ACIP issued interim clinical consideration s and recommendations for the co -administration of other routine vaccinations with the COVID -19 vaccine to expand vaccination rates further. 3 While the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People goals for 2030 include increasing vaccinat ion rates for the flu vaccine and Tdap during pregnancy, neither of these vaccines are covered within the scope and authority within the PREP Act.4 Our proposed pilot program would address the need for co -administration of vaccines outside of the scope of the PREP act to increase the vaccination rates for other routine vaccines for South Dakotans. Enabling trained and supervised technicians to administer all ACIP recommended vaccines allows the Pharmacist to focus their time and efforts on the clinical evaluation of gaps in care and consultation to improve vaccination rates safely and efficiently. Goals The goals of our program are threefold, first and foremost, to safely improve vaccination rates for all ACIP recommended vaccines for South Dakotans. Se cond, enhance pharmacy workflow and patient experience by offering a seamless experience for patients who wish to receive multiple vaccinations recommended by ACIP and the CDC. And lastly, to improve pharmacy team member satisfaction and engagement through expanded roles and optimization of workflow. Objectives The program will achieve its goals by allowing Certified Immunization Trained Technicians to perform all ACIP recommended vaccines for patients in our 14 South Dakota -based locations. All participa ting technicians will be supervised by an Immunization Trained Pharmacists and will opt into vaccination after receiving the training as outlined in the program details below and demonstrated proficiency. Immunization Trained technicians will only partici pate in the non -clinical portions of the vaccine administration , and vaccines will only be given after the clinical assessment and counseling on potential risks and side effects on all immunization is performed by the Immunization Trained Pharmacist. 2 | P a g e Walgreens South Dakota Technician -Administered Immunization Program Pilot Program Details Employee Selection: South Dakota Licensed and Certified Pharmacy Technicians that have opted into participation, have completed immunization administration training, and have demonstrated proficiency. Training: Select Certified Pharmacy Te chnicians will complete training as outlined below: Activity Description APhA Pharmacy -Based Immunization Administration by Pharmacy Technicians Training Program Self-Study Learning -2 hours self -study with assessment Live Training Seminar -4 hours Learning objectives of both sessions5 Adult & Child CPR for Healthcare Providers [Cardio Partners only ] OR Adult, Child , and Infant First Aid/CPR/AED Online Blended Online and Live training OR Online training OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Training (BBP) Online Training in LTMP Final Assessment -Complete d Annually Immunization Administration Training Overview and acknowledgment of vaccine preparation and administration procedures for all immunizations Training & Authorization Form Training with the pharmacy manager to demonstrate mastery of administration Documentation of training activities will be maintained by employee in file #17 in the pharmacy and the Walgreens Learning and T alent Management Portal (LTMP.) Description of Immunization Pharmacy Technician Functions: 1. Enter the Vaccine into the Immunization Selection Tool and Intercom Plus 2. Technician chooses the appropriate vaccine administration record ( VAR ); flu, non -flu, offsite clinic 3. Gather immunizati on, emergency supplies , and prepare the vaccine. Sharps Container, Emergency Supply Kit, gloves, alcohol pads, bandages , and cotton balls Reconstitute vaccine if applicable and prepare the appropriate dose for administration 3 | P a g e Walgreens South Dakota Technician -Administered Immunization Program Pilot 4. Administer Vaccine: Inside the immunization area/consultation room , to area technician will question and confirm with the patient: i. Full Name ii. Date of Birth iii. Vaccination Complete immunization using good hand hygiene and appropriate immunization techni que. Complete the chart in Section F Instruct the patient to remain in the area for approximately 15 minutes for observation to monitor the patient for post -immunization adverse reactions 5. Pharmacist and Technician will complete post -immunization requiremen ts. Technician will clearly print name and Pharmacist clearly print and sign Section F of the VAR Technician will scan the VAR into the patient profile in Intercom Plus The Pharmacist will be responsible for the clinical assessment and counseling on the vaccination , including po tential risks and side effects on all immunizations. Procedures for Ensuring Public Health and Safety Immunization -trained Pharmacy Technicians will only participate in the non -clinical functions of vaccine administration . The Pharmacist will be responsib le for the clinical assessment and counseling on the vaccination , including potential risks and side effects on all immunizations. 1. Clinical Review Upon entry of the vaccination into Intercom Plus , the Immunization Trained Pharmacist will perform the clinical review to assess the appropriateness of therapy, review the statewide immunization registry, screen for contraindications /precautions, and perform vaccine verification. I f a contraindication or precaution is present, the patient's primary healthcare provider will be consulted , or a referral to care will be advised. 2. Consultation Before vaccine administration, the patient will be counseled regarding the potential risks, side effects of all immunizations and a discussion about potential gaps in care to include recommendations for other vaccinations. The VIS will be provided and reviewed before administration with the patient or the patient's parent/legal guardian. 3. Informed Consent The Pharmacist will screen patients for receipt of the vaccine ba sed up on ACIP Guidelines. N o qualified patient shall receive a Vaccine who fails to meet the stated criteria, has a medical contraindication to the vaccine, an allergy to 4 | P a g e Walgreens South Dakota Technician -Administered Immunization Program Pilot components of the vaccine, or severe prior reaction to a Vaccine. Each Pharmacist will inform the Vaccine recipient of the potential benefits and risks of the vaccine. This disclosure must be documented by the execution of informed consent by each qualified individual/patient (or the qualified individual/patient's parent or legal guardian in the event the qualified individual/patient is less than eighteen (18) years of age) receiving a Vaccine . 4. Vaccines All vaccines indicated in our South Dakota Standing Order Protocol a re recommended and follow current published CDC and ACIP recommendation gu ideline s and recommended schedules and COVID -19 vaccines as recommended and approved by ACIP. 5. Post Administration Following administration of a Vaccine, a Pharmacy Provider will recommend qualified individuals/patients remain under observation for at lea st fifteen (15) minutes, following state and local regulations, to monitor for adverse events. A Pharmacy Provider will instruct the qualified individual/patient to report any adverse events to the Pharmacy Provider after receiving the vaccine. 6. Waste Di sposal. Sharps and syringes will be disposed of in an approved impenetrable sharps container using universal precautions. All full sharps containers must be disposed of according to state regulations. 7. Patient Record. Each vaccine will be documented in I ntercom Plus and an electronic record of each patient for five (5) years or required Law. Such record shall include: the name, address, and date of birth of the patient; the date of administration and site of injections; the name, dose, manufacturer's lot number, and expiration date of the vaccine; name and address of the patient's primary health care provider (\"PCP\"), as identified by the patient; the name of the Pharmacist administering the immunization; a record of any consultation or other professional information provided to the patient; and the name and date of the Vaccine Information Sheet provided to the patient. A personal immunization record card will be given to each qualified individual/patient with a record of the date of vaccination and the nam e/location/telephone number of the administering pharmacy. 8. Adverse Reaction Reporting. All adverse reactions to the vaccine shall be submitted to the FDA and the CDC via the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (\"VAERS\") form with a copy of each such report provided to the qualified individual/patient's primary care physician. 9. Emergency Treatment Procedures In an anaphylactic reaction, the Pharmacist will follow the Walgreens Standard Operating Procedures and Emergency Procedures outlined in ou r South Dakota Standing Order Protocol. 5 | P a g e Walgreens South Dakota Technician -Administered Immunization Program Pilot 10. Workplace Safety All immunization Trained employees complete training on bloodborne pathogens and needlestick prevention annually. Additionally , all employees will r eview the Walgreens Immunization Safety playbook that provides the latest information on safety guidelines and best practices for infection control. Current safety measures include CDC immunization guidance, patient screening tools , temperature checks, facemasks and shields, hand -hygiene and cleaning proced ures , and patient safety guidelines. 11. State Registry Reporting. All vaccines will be reported to the South Dakota Department of Health 's Vaccine Registry as required by state law . Rule Variance Request Walgreens is requesting that the South Dakota Board of Pharmacy provide a one-year variance to 20:51:28:02.01, 20:51:29:20 , and 20:51:29:21(6) to allow Certified Immunization -Trained Pharmacy Technicians under the supervision of an Immunization Trained Pharmacist to administer all ACIP recommended vaccines , including COVID -19 vaccines. Pharmacies play an integral role in the vaccination of the public that was further heightened by the COVID -19 pandemic. Properly trained and supervised Pharmacy Technicians are well suited to assist pharmacists and pharmac ies with the non -clinical portions of vaccine administration, allowing pharmacists more time to identify gaps in care, counsel patients , and improve patient outcomes. Additional Supporting Information Idaho was the first adopter of this concept in 2016 -17; since then , Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Nevada, Rhode Island, Utah , and Washington have taken steps to allow this activity with several additional states discussion . Between August 1, 2019 , and April 20, 2020, technicians have provided an estimated 27, 000 immunizations at Walgreens pharmacies in Idaho and 19,000 immunizations in Rhode Island. The Idaho Board of Pharmacy estimated that Pharmacy Technicians gave 25,000 vaccines in the first year after adopting the rule with no adverse event or errors rep orted to the Board of Pharmacy6. Internal surveys have provided positive feedback on Technician s administered immunizations by pharmacists, technicians , and patients. The ability to delegate this administrative task to trained technicians allows for increased pharmacist capacity for engaging in additional clinical and patient care services. Technician Immunization Program Feedback and Benefits7: Pharmacists in the study felt that their immunizing technicians were properly trained to administer immunizations, capable of giving immunizations, and empowered by their new role w ithin the pharmacy. Findings also included a pharmacist -perceived increase in vaccination rates and recommendation for other technicians to be trained to administer immunizations. Pharmacists' opinions revealed that working with newly trained immunizin g pharmacy technicians has not only positively affected the morale of their team, but can help to increase the number of vaccinations given by the pharmacy. There was no risk to pharmacist employment position as the Pharmacist must complete clinical revi ew prior to technician administration to confirm vaccine eligibility and is responsible to confirm correct product and dosage is being provide by Technician. 6 | P a g e Walgreens South Dakota Technician -Administered Immunization Program Pilot Providing technician the ability to complete the non -clinical task of immunization administratio n provides the pharmacist additional capacity to practice at the top of their licensure to engage patients in additional activities such as medication therapy management services, adherence monitoring, prescriptive authority, etc. The American Pharmacist Association (APhA) House of Delegates , representing over 60,000 pharmacists nationwide supports this concept. Most recently a policy was introduced and adopted as a policy statement regarding Pharmacy Technicians Role in Immunization A dministration at the 2020 Annual Meeting.8 1. APhA urges state boards of pharmacy and state legislative bodies to authorize immunization administration by qualified pharmacy technicians as a technical function that may be delegated by immunizing pharmacists. 2. APhA supports the development of standardized training in immunization administration and continuing education opportunities for immunizing pharmacy technicians. 3. APhA supports pharmacists individual discretion in delegating immunization administration to qualified pharmacy technicians with the requisite education, training, and experience. 4. APhA supports voluntary participation by pharmacy technicians in the training and provision of immunization administration 5. APhA supports the role of pharmacists as the healthcare professional providing clinical patient assessment, decision making, and patient counseling for all immunizations administered by a pharmacy technician.

Paramount and centric to all rules, including pharmacy technician roles and responsibilities, is patient safety. Increasing the scope of pharmacy technician practice to include administrative and supportive tasks for pharmacist -provided patient care services will allow pharmacists to more effectively and efficiently provide for patients' medication -related needs.2 1Gaither CA, et al.

This bypass requires the pharmacist to perform the product check manually Pharmacists have the option to Reject a prescription processed through this workflow and either a) send it back to Production for re- processing or b) pull the bag and perform the product check manually The primary products excluded from this workflow are: Schedule 2 (C2) products, immunizations, compounded medications and pro ducts too large/cumbersome to image (bowel prep, diapers, enemas, etc.) We monitor for products that the majority of stores end up bypassing the majority of time to evaluate if products should be e xcluded. Any product could be excluded by NDC, if needed. Example of excluded product is Nitrolycerin tablets due to special packaging and lack of ability to image the tablets Records Images captured during the workflow process (and ultimately verified by the pharmacist) are stored for 2 years If an image is captured and the Pharmacist chooses to verify it the 'old way' (see: bullet 2 above) we do not store the image. This is because we want to maintain a clear trail of what the pharmacist saw and used to verify the prescription. These are accessible centrally and from the Rx Image Retrieval Tool at the store Virtual Verification does not change our existing credentialing process or records keeping process\u00a92020 CVS Health and/or one of its affiliates.

This workflow delivers multiple benefits to quality and safety to our pharmacies, including: In workflow benefits: Bagging Safety Scans: In an effort to advance our quality assurance processes, additional safety scans have been added. If a technician fails to perform allsafety scans during bagging, the pharmacist is required to perform manual verification. Image Review : Images enable pharmacists to easily review all loose pills in Visual Verification Tray and information on each dispensed product (e.g., expiration date, lot #). Out of workflow benefits: Patient Inquiry Resolution: Easy to confirm quantity dispensed with a simple image retrieval tool search (e.g., 30 vs 90, 1 box vs 3 boxes).

Springmeds lnc. operates a website Springmeds.com that displays prices for all its products. Patients go on to the Springmeds.com website and place their order for either a prescription medication or an OTC product. These orders are filled by one of two pharmacies. Currently Healthwarehouse in Florence, Kentucky fills most of the orders. The other pharmacy is HRX Pharmacy in Holladay,Utah. Healthwarehouse is licensed or authorized to ship to all fifty U.S. states. HRX pharmacy is only licensed in 20 states. lf an order comes in for a prescription product on Springmeds.com, Healthwarehouse will contact the patient's doctor or their pharmacy then fill and shlp the order. The dispensing pharmacy will then provide Springmeds.com with a tracking number. Springmeds.com will bill the patient and send the patient their tracking number. lf the patient orders an OTC product we will send some of those orders to HRX to ship out, bui most will be shipped from Healthwarehouse. We are planning on opening a pharmacy in Sioux Falls that will provide service for Springmeds.com. The website www.springmeds.com is a separate business from the Sioux Falls pharmacy. We are looking to open the pharmacy in September 2021. We would hire a pharmacist and a technician and have them work an eight hour shift, 9-5 Monday to Friday. The Sioux Falls pharmacy would manage the orders placed on the Springmeds.com website. They would confirm the order with the patient and acquire the prescription. This would be done by contacting the patient's doctor for a new prescription or the patient's pharmacy for a prescription transfer. Alternatively, the patient could mail in their original prescription or if appropriate we would refer them to a telemedicine provider. Once a valid prescription is received, Sioux Falls Pharmacy would defer the prescription. The dispensing pharmacy would be selected based upon if that pharmacy is licensed in the patient's state and the level of service the pharmacy is able to provide for that order. The prescription would then be transferred to that pharmacy with detailed order instructions. The dispensing pharmacy would send notification to Springmeds.com that the order has been shipped along with the tracking number. $pruSmedg.aafi would then bill the order and send a confirmation email to the patient informing them that their order has been shipped and provide them with that tracking number. The Sioux Falls pharmacy would over time get licensed in all states and dispense all medications from Sioux Falls "}
