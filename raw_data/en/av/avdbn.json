Men and their Health - Most men lead stressful lives but are much less careful about looking after their health than women. - For instance, men have fewer health checks and visit their GP less often and when they do go for treatment it is often because they have been persuaded to! - Consequently, by the time they seek medical help, their condition may have become serious. - Alcohol and substance abuse are five times higher in men than women and men are four times more likely to die from liver cancer. - However, deaths from testicular cancer, for example, could be largely avoided by regular self-examination and early treatment. - \"Men tend to put off seeking any medical treatment until their condition can no longer be ignored\" It's just a flesh wound! - For men, it's not just physical health that suffers - their mental and emotional health are also at risk. - Many men find it hard to express their discomfort or attend to early indications that they are unwell - so it is not surprising when a crisis develops. - This may be physical illness (like a heart attack) or emotional breakdown, mid-life crisis or worse. - 75% of all suicides in the UK are male, with the rate for young men currently rising alarmingly. - And young men are falling prey to what were previously considered to be female anxieties connected to their image, as evidenced by the rising rate of male anorexia. Men and Sexual Health - It is estimated that 1 in 10 men over the age of 21 suffers from impotence or erectile dysfunction. - Whilst men increasingly turn to homeopathy for their sexual health problems, most men suffer in silence. - Homeopathy offers almost 200 remedies for erectile dysfunction, which are best selected by experienced homeopaths. - Prostate problems may also be helped by homeopathy. Mind and Body - Research confirms the importance of mind-body connections in disease. - American studies have shown that those who suffer frequent bouts of depression are 40% more likely to develop heart disease - the main premature killer of men in the UK. - The impact of diet and exercise on our health is now generally recognised. - But equally important is the link between mind and body. - Conventional medicine has tended to separate the two artificially and to treat the body as a complex machine. - On a daily basis, however, most of us experience the mind-body connection. - Blushing, for instance, is a common physical expression of our emotional state. What is homeopathy? - Homeopathy is a holistic system of medicine, based on an understanding of the interconnection between mind and body. - By taking a full case history, homeopaths treat the whole person, including the disease. - Instead of attacking symptoms with strong drugs, homeopathy uses gentle medicine which works by stimulating and strengthening the immune system. - In this way, it helps the body's natural tendency to heal itself. Homeopathic medicine is prescribed in very low dilution after a special matching process, which takes into account individual symptoms and characteristics. - Unlike conventional medicines, homeopathic remedies are non-toxic and are not addictive. Homeopathy can be safely used alongside other forms of medical treatment. Homeopathy and Mental health - Hundreds of thousands of people with moderate depression or anxiety have been unnecessarily prescribed powerful anti-depressants. - The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and NICE say GPs are prescribing too many pills for those who do not have a serious medical condition and they advise people to seek other treatment such as therapy or more daily exercise. - Anxiety, fear of failure, headaches associated with stress and high blood pressure, are frequently treated with homeopathy. - The pressure of work, mid-life crises and other issues affect men's health in various ways. - Men facing the challenges of ageing, retirement and finding new identities for themselves, find a particularly appropriate therapy in homeopathy, which addresses them on mental, emotional and physical levels at once. - When combined with the benefits of good nutrition, exercise and relaxation, homeopathy can provide optimum support for such patients. Homeopathy for Men - Homeopathy successfully treats all kinds of people with all kinds of conditions. - It can help with the problems that many men experience - skin disorders, respiratory, circulatory and digestive conditions, IBS, migraine, stress and anxiety, impotence, prostate problems and infertility. When to visit a Homeopath - Men tend to put off seeking any medical treatment until their condition can no longer be ignored. - Whilst homeopathy can help in serious cases, it is obviously better to seek treatment before getting to this stage. - This means recognising that minor symptoms are early warning signs, indicating a need for attention. - Many patients arrange a "}
