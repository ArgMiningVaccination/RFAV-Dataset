Self help is the umbrella term given to a fairly large genre of self-guided instructional materials, particularly those centering around improving one's personal [life](/wiki/Life). Self-help books, courses, and groups cover a vast amount of territory, including [psychology](/wiki/Psychology), motivation, [sex education](/wiki/Sex_education), [fad diets](/wiki/Fad_diet), law, and family issues.

[[note 1]](#cite_note-2) Many self-help systems derive in fact from very dubious principles drawn more from pop [spiritualism](/wiki/Spiritualism) than from [science](/wiki/Science). It has been suggested that the name is misleading because, as George Carlin put it, \"If you're looking for self-help, why would you read a book written by somebody else?\" Although the self-help movement has parallels in ancient philosophy and religious practice, [[note 2]](#cite_note-3) the modern form was born in the 19th and early-20th centuries with books like Samuel Smiles' [Self-Help (1865)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Help_(book)) and Dale Carnegie's [How To Win Friends and Influence People (1936)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People). Today, it is especially popular in the [United States](/wiki/United_States),[ [citation needed](/wiki/Help:References)] due to that that virtue is rewarded](/wiki/Just_world_fallacy). If one's [society](/wiki/Society) or [culture](/wiki/Culture) is very unequal, and one's place in it largely depends on accidents (like who one's parents are, particularly in terms of [class](/wiki/Social_class) and [race](/wiki/Ethnicity)), then that would be [too horrible to contemplate](/wiki/Argument_from_adverse_consequences), so it must be wrong! Self-help books have, through time and by design, consistently stood against social change by blaming the [individual](/wiki/Person), rather than (for example) institutionalized [racism](/wiki/Racism) or [sexism](/wiki/Sexism), for not having enough [will](/wiki/Will) to advance in society. [[2]](#cite_note-petrzela-4) [[note 3]](#cite_note-5) This was exemplified in 2018 by Tony Robbins' [public shaming of a sexual-abuse survivor](/wiki/Blaming_the_victim) and of the [#MeToo movement](/wiki/MeToo) in general. [[2]](#cite_note-petrzela-4) Instructional materials for other subjects \u2014 particularly the sort that might also be taught in school [[note 4]](#cite_note-6) \u2014 might reasonably be considered \"self-help\" as well, [[note 5]](#cite_note-7) though the term is not always used in those cases. Any self-help system or theory will work just as well as any other \u2014 for a time. (The [placebo effect](/wiki/Placebo_effect) may play a role here.) But given the nature of [human nature](/wiki/Human_nature), somehow each system needs continual [reinforcement](/wiki/Communal_reinforcement) (\"Buy the next book!\" \u2014 \"Come to our next [church](/wiki/Church) service!\" \u2014 \"Take the next course!\") \u2014 or else the \"seeker\" moves on to the next self-help fad. Either outcome further fuels the vast and burgeoning self-help industry and its market. All self-help systems peddle two different notions: - People have the potential to be, have, or do anything they want. - People should always be living at their full potential. In other words, you are always supposed to be a [god](/wiki/Egotheism), and if you're not, you suck.

We are a people accustomed to simplicity and success and unprepared for tragedy, suddenly thrust into mammoth responsibilities in a complex world and a tragic time. In the face of hard and unexpecteed facts we can rise to a new maturity, or we can turn instead to those who pat us on the head and say it isn't so at all, like the Reverend Doctor Norman Vincent Peale. \u2014William Lee Miller [[8]](#cite_note-miller-16):24 [2.0](#cite_ref-petrzela_4-0) [2.1](#cite_ref-petrzela_4-1) [Self-help gurus like Tony Robbins have often stood in the way of social change](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/self-help-gurus-like-tony-robbins-have-often-stood-in-the-way-of-social-change/2018/04/13/15340974-3e70-11e8-8d53-eba0ed2371cc_story.html)by Natalia Mehlman Petrzela & Christine B.
