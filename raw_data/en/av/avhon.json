The topics addressed in this issue are the signs, symptoms, and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A discussion of pain management and complementary therapies is included.

Lately the pain has been much worse. She has tried all the usual remedies without success. How can her pain be better man- aged? What kinds of providers, traditional and com- plementary, treat IBS? ANSWER Irritablebowelsyndrome(IBS),alsoknownasspastic colon, is a collection of signs and symptoms like ab- dominal pain, bloating, distension, incomplete stool emptying, and alteration of bowel habit without a known cause (1,2). It is a diagnosis made after other conditionshavebeenruledout.Thesyndromeisclas- sified by dominant symptoms. If diarrhea is domi- nant,itisdiagnosedasIBS-D;ifconstipationisdom- inant,itisdiagnosedasIBS-C;ifalteredstoolpattern or pain is dominant, it is diagnosed as IBS-A; and if Sanjoy Banerjee, MD, is a Pain Management Fellow, Department of AnesthesiologyandPainMedicine,UniversityofCaliforniaatDavisMed- ical Center, Sacramento, California, USA.

Ellison Ambulatory Care Center, 4860 Y Street, Suite 3020, Sacra- mento, CA 95817, USA (E-mail: sanjoy.banerjee@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu).it occurs after an infection it is diagnosed as IBS-PI (postinfectious IBS) (3). The prevalence of IBS has been found to be 14% of the US population(4). IBSisa chronicillness that does not progress. It causes chronic pain, tiredness, absenteeism from work, altered relationships with others, depression, anxiety, and reduction in quality of life (5). It is commonly found with other diseases such as esophageal reflux, genitourinary disorders, depression, anxiety, headache, back pain, chronic fa- tigue syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, prior abdominal surgeries, and fibromyalgia (6). Thecauseofthediseaseisnotknown.Itisthought that in normal functioning, the many layers of mus- cles that line the intestinal wall work ina coordinated manner to push food through from the stomach to the rectum. This mechanism is called peristalsis. In some individuals, this mechanism becomes uncoor- dinated and food is pushed through too fast, caus- ingbloatinganddiarrhea.Inothers,themovementis sloweddown,causingconstipation,pain,andincom- plete evacuation of stool. There is also thought to be a defect in the brain-gut nervous system causing dys- function (7). Manyreasonsforthisconditiontooccurhavebeen considered. There is a 6-fold chance of IBS occur- ring after a gastrointestinal infection (8). IBS occurs more often in people who are younger aged and 271 J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by Dr. Yvette Colon on 09/27/11 For personal use only. 272 S. Banerjee female. Also, fever with infection, anxiety, and depression have been correlated with IBS. Recentstudies have also looked at biopsy specimens from IBS patients, noting that inflammation and immune problems are part of the disease, indicating an ab-normality in the body's immune reaction to infection (9).Somestudiesandtheoriessupportthepossibility of a bacterial infection that is yet undiscovered. There is no test for IBS. Many other stomach conditions have signs and symptoms that overlap with IBS. The diagnosis of IBS is made by excluding other known diseases. There are a number of formu- lationstohelpruleoutotherconditionssuchasceliacdisease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, lactose intolerance, and gastrointestinal infections. It is importanttolookoutforwarningsymptomsthatcanindicate other more severe diseases, such as blood in stools, weight loss, low blood count, and night time pain (10). There are many traditional and complementary approachestotreatmentofIBS.Theyincludethefol- lowing. Food Many patients find that some foods cause a flare-upof symptoms. Lactose intolerance and IBS have sim- ilar symptoms and a trial of lactose-free diet is rec- ommended (11). One study found a fructose- andfructan-free diet reduced symptoms in patients with IBSandfructose-absorptionproblems(12).Broador generalizedtestingforparticularfoodintolerancehasbeenunsuccessfulanddietchangeshavebeenrecom- mended to individuals on a case-by-case basis (13). There is no proof that people with IBS suffer fromdigestion problems or lack of nutrients (14). Fiber Water-soluble fiber products, e.g., psyllium, guar gum, wheat dextrin, which are marketed as bulk- forming fiber laxatives, work as symptom controlin patients who have constipation as a major issue (15). For psyllium, doses of 10 to 30 grams per day have been found to be effective. In patients withdiarrhea-dominant symptoms, this fiber may make symptoms worse. Insoluble fiber has not found to be helpful (16). Medications Inpatientswithconstipationasamajorsymptom,os-motic laxatives and stool softeners have been found to be helpful. The most studied has been polyethy- lene glycol (PEG) (17). A medication called lubipro-stone is approved by the US Food and Drug Admin-istration for treatment of IBS with chronic consti- pation symptom dominant. This medication causesincreased mucous secretions in the gut, softening stools, easing their passage, and promoting sponta- neous bowel movements (18). In diarrhea-dominant patients, antidiarrheal such as loperamide have been helpful. Anti- spasmodic drugs have been useful in some patients.The antispasmodic medications act in two primary ways. At the nerve endings, medications such as at- ropine block the nerves to gut-reducing spasms and at the gut muscle, mebeverine and alverine citrate cause relaxation and reduced spasms. A Cochranemeta-analysis concluded that six patients needed to be treated for one patient to benefit (19). Neuromodulation agents (medications affecting nervoussystem)suchastricyclicantidepressantsand serotonin agonists have also been used to provide re- lief in patients with IBS. Tegaserod (Zelnorm) is aserotoninagonist(increasestheamountofserotonin) thatwasusedtotreatconstipation-dominantIBS,but was discontinued in the United States in 2007 as aresult of adverse side effects (20). Selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors(SSRIs)suchasProzachavebeen found to be helpful in well-designed studies (21).Serotonin antagonists, which block or inhibit action at serotonin receptors, such as alosetron hydrochlo- ride (Lotronex), have not been found to be useful in severe diarrhea-dominant cases. Because of the med- ication's side effects, only a select group of patientscan benefit from it and doctors prescribing it must be enrolled in a special program. It is not approved foruseinmen(22).Additionally,tricyclicantidepres-sants (e.g., Elavil) are used in the treatment of IBS and are most helpful with diarrhea-dominant symp- toms. A meta-analysis found three people needed tobe treated for one to get benefit (23). Rifaximin (Xi- faxan),anantibioticthatstaysinthegutandhasmin- imal body effects, has been used effectively to treattraveler's diarrhea. It has also shown to be effective in reducing diarrhea, bloating, and flatulence in IBS patients, thus providing more evidence for bacterialcause of IBS (24). Herbal Remedies Peppermintoilcapsuleshavebeenshowntobeeffec-tive in adults and children with IBS symptoms (25). There is good evidence for its use and also its safety profile. Iberogast, a multiherb extract, was found to besuperiortoplacebo(inertmedication)inreducing pain from IBS and IBS symptoms after 4 weeks oftreatment(26).Inareviewoftheuseofprobioticsfor IBSsymptoms, Bifidobacteria infantis hasbeenshown to be useful (27).

Patient Education and Self-Advocacy 273 Psychotherapy/Hypnotherapy/Acupuncture Cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation strategies, and hypnotherapy have been found to be helpful in controlling the symptoms of IBS; it gives patientstools to cope with their illness, changes behavior that increases symptoms, and improves general men- tal well-being (28). Acupuncture has been used insome patients successfully to treat IBS symptoms, but a recent review of the studies found that defini- tive proof was lacking (29). There are some centersthatrecommendyogaandhypnotherapyforsymptom control (30). A primary care physician may treat a person with IBS or may refer the patient to a gastroenterologist, amedicaldoctorwhospecializesinthediagnosisandtreatmentofdiseasesofthedigestivesystem.Anatur- opathic doctor may also provide care; naturopathic philosophy favors a holistic approach. Social work-ers, psychologists, and hypnotherapists can provide psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, support groupcounseling, andhypnotherapyforpatients andcaregivers;acupuncturistsandyogapractitionersalso can provide services for people affected by IBS. CONCLUSION Our understanding of IBS is still developing and as it grows, we expect to see new therapies being pro-posedinthefuture.Asthecausesareunknown,treat- ment for IBS focuses on symptom control, disease management,andimprovingfunctionalityinaffectedpatients.
