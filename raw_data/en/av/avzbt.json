It just would have made things so much easier if they had been listed in order, I spend so much time hunting down Herbs; especially ones that I'm not familiar with..It's just an unnecessary time-consuming task.. But other than that, I love the Book, and would suggest it to anyone who is interested in Herbal Medicine & Herbal Tea's..
