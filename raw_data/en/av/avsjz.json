HRSA is chargedwith ensuring access to quality health carethrough a network of community-based healthcenters, maternal and child health programs, andcommunity HIV/AIDS programs through theStates and Territories. In addition, HRSA'smission includes supporting individuals pursuingcareers in medicine, nursing, and many otherhealth disciplines. HRSA fulfills these responsi-bilities by collecting and analyzing timely, topicalinformation that identifies health priorities andtrends that can be addressed through programinterventions and capacity building. HRSA is pleased to present Women's Health USA 2007 , the sixth edition of the Women's Health USA data book. To reflect the ever- changing, increasingly diverse population and itscharacteristics, Women's Health USA selectively highlights emerging issues and trends in women'shealth. Data and information on autoimmunediseases, gynecological and reproductive disor-ders, and digestive disorders are a few of the newtopics included in this edition.

In some instances, it was not possible to provide data for all races due to the size of thesample population. A cell size of fewer than 20was deemed too small to produce reliable results. The data book was developed by HRSA to provide readers with an easy-to-use collection ofcurrent and historical data on some of the mostpressing health challenges facing women, theirfamilies, and their communities. Women's Health USA 2007 is intended to be a concise reference for policymakers and programmanagers at the Federal, State, and local levels toidentify and clarify issues affecting the health ofwomen. In these pages, readers will find a profileof women's health from a variety of data sources.The data book brings together the latest availableinformation from various agencies within theFederal government, including the U.S. Depart-ment of Health and Human Services, U.S.Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department ofLabor, and U.S. Department of Justice. Non-Federal data sources were used when no Federalsource was available. Every attempt has beenmade to use data collected in the past 5 years. Itis important to note that the incidence dataincluded is generally not age-adjusted to the 2000population standard of the United States. Thisaffects the comparability of data from year to year,and the interpretation of differences acrossvarious groups, especially those of different racesand ethnicities. Without age adjustment, it is difficult to know how much of the difference inincidence rates between groups can be attributedto differences in the groups' age distributions.Also, presentation of racial and ethnic data mayappear differently on some pages as a result of thedesign and limitations of the original data source.

The growingdiversity of the U.S. population is reflected in theracial and ethnic distribution of women across agegroups. Black and Hispanic women accountedfor 9 and 6.5 percent of the female populationaged 65 and older, respectively, but theyrepresented 15.3 and 20.9 percent of femalesunder 15 years of age. Non-Hispanic Whitesaccounted for nearly 81 percent of women aged65 years and older, but only 58.6 percent of thoseunder 15 years of age. In addition to race and ethnicity, income and education are important factors that contribute towomen's health and access to health care. Regard-less of family structure, women are more likelythan men to live in poverty. Poverty rates werehighest among women who were heads of theirhouseholds (25.9 percent). Poverty rates were alsohigher among Black and Hispanic women (24.2and 21.7 percent, respectively), who were alsomore likely to be heads of households than theirnon-Hispanic White and Asian counterparts. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2006 INTRODUCTION 7 America's growing diversity underscores the importance of examining and addressing racialand ethnic disparities in health status and the useof health care services. In 2005, 62.3 percent ofnon-Hispanic White women reported themselvesto be in excellent or very good health, comparedto only 53.6 percent of Hispanic women and51.6 percent of non-Hispanic Black women. Minority women are disproportionately affected by a number of diseases and healthconditions, including HIV/AIDS, sexuallytransmitted infections, diabetes, and overweightand obesity. For instance, in 2005, non-HispanicBlack and Hispanic women accounted for morethan three-fourths of women living withHIV/AIDS (64.1 and 15.1 percent, respectively).One-third of non-Hispanic White women hadever been tested for the Human Immunodefi-ciency Virus (HIV), compared to 52.5 percent ofnon-Hispanic Black women and 47.3 percent ofHispanic women. Diabetes is a chronic condition and a leading cause of death and disability in the United States,and is especially prevalent among non-HispanicBlack women. Among non-Hispanic Blackwomen, diabetes occurred at a rate of 106.8 per1,000 women, compared to 69.1 per 1,000 non-Hispanic White women. Hypertension, or highblood pressure, was also more prevalent amongnon-Hispanic Black women than women of other races. This disease occurred at a rate of353.8 per 1,000 non-Hispanic Black women,compared to 264.5 per 1,000 non-HispanicWhite women and 200.2 per 1,000 Hispanicwomen. Overweight and obesity are occurring at an increasing rate among Americans of all ages andboth sexes. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measureof the ratio of height to weight, and is often usedto determine whether a person's weight is withina healthy range. A BMI of 25-29.9 is consideredoverweight, and a BMI of 30 or greater is consid-ered obese. In 2003-04, 61.4 percent of womenwere overweight were highestamong non-Hispanic Black (79.9 percent) andHispanic women (68.4 percent). Some conditions, such as arthritis and heart disease, disproportionately affect non-HispanicWhite women. For instance, in 2005, the rate ofarthritis among non-Hispanic White women was282.1 per 1,000 women, compared to 243.3 per1,000 non-Hispanic Black women and 144.2 per1,000 Hispanic women. Other conditions are more closely linked to family income than to race and ethnicity. Ratesof asthma decline as income increases and womenwith higher incomes are more likely to effectivelymanage their asthma. Among women withincomes below the Federal poverty level (FPL), more than one-third had an asthma-relatedemergency room visit in the past year, comparedto 19.2 percent of women with family incomes of300 percent or more of the FPL. Mental health is another important aspect of women's overall health. A range of mental healthproblems, including depression, anxiety, phobias,and post-traumatic stress disorder, disproportion-ately affect women. Unlike many other healthconcerns, younger women are more likely thanolder women to suffer from serious psychologicalstress and major depressive episodes. Physical disabilities are more prevalent among women as well. Disability can be defined asimpairment of the ability to perform commonactivities like walking up stairs, sitting or standingfor 2 hours or more, grasping small objects, orcarrying items like groceries. Therefore, the terms\"activity limitations\" and \"disabilities\" are usedinterchangeably throughout this book. Overall,15.1 percent of women and 12.5 percent of menreported having activity limitations. Men, however, bear a disproportionate burden of some health conditions, such as HIV/AIDS,diabetes and heart disease. In 2005, for instance,adolescent and adult males accounted for almost73 percent of those living with HIV/AIDS,though a smaller proportion of men had everINTRODUCTION WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2007 8 been tested for HIV than women (33 versus 38 percent, respectively). Certain health risks, such as overweight and injury, occurred more commonly among menthan women. In 2003-04, 69.6 percent of menwere overweight or obese, compared to 61.5percent of women. Among men, 30.2 percent ofemergency department visits were injury related,while only 21.8 percent of women's visits weredue to injury. In addition, men were less likelythan women to seek preventive care (375 versus535 million physician office visits), and weremore likely to lack health insurance (22.5 versus18.8 percent uninsured, respectively). Many diseases and health conditions, such as those mentioned above, can be avoided orminimized through good nutrition, regularphysical activity and preventive health care. In2004, 18.6 percent of women's visits to physicianswere for preventive care, including prenatal care,preventive screenings, and immunizations.Overall, 60.5 percent of older women reportedreceiving a flu shot in 2005; however, thispercentage ranges from 38.9 percent among non-Hispanic Black women to 63.8 percent ofnon-Hispanic White women. In addition topreventive health care, preventive dental care isalso important to prevent dental caries and gumdisease. In 2003-04, 71.2 percent of women whohad health insurance with a dental componentsaw a dentist in the past year, compared to 58.6 percent of women with health insurance butno dental component, and 38.6 percent ofwomen with no insurance at all. There are many ways women (and men) can promote health and help prevent disease anddisability. Thirty minutes of physical activity onmost days of the week may reduce the risk ofchronic disease; women who reported participat-ing in any physical activity had an average of 194minutes of moderate exercise each week in 2005,although only 50 percent of women reported atleast 10 minutes of moderate activity. Healthy eating habits can also be a major contributor to long-term health and preventionof chronic disease. In 1999-2004, however, morethan half of all adult women had diets thatincluded more than the recommended amount ofsaturated fat and sodium and less than therecommended amount of folate. Overall,63.5 percent of women exceeded the maximumdaily intake of saturated fat, and 70 percentexceeded the maximum amount of sodium. While some behaviors have a positive effect on health, a number of others, such as smoking andalcohol and illicit drug use, can have a negativeeffect. In 2005, 22.5 percent of women smoked.However, 44.8 percent of female smokers tried toquit at some point in the past year. During thesame year, 45.9 percent of women reported anyalcohol use in the past month, but relatively few women (15.2 percent) reported binge drinking(five or more drinks on the same occasion) andeven fewer (3.1 percent) reported heavy alcoholuse (binge drinking on 5 days or more in the pastmonth). Cigarette, alcohol, and illicit drug use is partic- ularly harmful during pregnancy. While use ofillicit drugs is reported by only 3.9 percent of allpregnant women, it is more common among 15-to 17-year-olds who are pregnant \u2014 12.3 percentof them reported drug use in the past month. Theuse of tobacco during pregnancy has declinedsteadily since 1989. In 2004-05, 16.6 percent ofpregnant women aged 15-44 reported smokingduring pregnancy. This rate was highest amongnon-Hispanic White women (21.5 percent) andlowest among Hispanic women (7.2 percent). Women's Health USA 2007 can be an important tool for emphasizing the importanceof preventive care, counseling, and education, andfor illustrating disparities in the health status ofwomen from all age groups and racial and ethnicbackgrounds. Health problems can only beremedied if they are recognized. This data bookprovides information on a range of indicators thatcan help us track the health behaviors, risk factors,and health care utilization practices of womenthroughout the United States.WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2006 INTRODUCTION 9 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2007 10 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS Population characteristics describe the diverse social, demographic, and economic features of theNation's population. There were over 146 millionwomen and girls in the United States in 2005,representing slightly more than half of thepopulation. Comparison of data by factors such as sex, age, and race and ethnicity can be used to tailor thedevelopment and evaluation of programs andpolicies serving women. The following section presents data on popula- tion characteristics that affect women's physical,social, and emotional health. Some of thesecharacteristics include the age and racial andethnic distribution of the population, householdcomposition, education, income, occupation,and participation in Federal programs. U.S. Female Population,* by Age, 2005 Source I.1: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community SurveyU.S. Population, by Age and Sex, in Thousands,* 2005 Source I.1: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey *Non-institutionalized population not living in group housing. **The break in the scale represents the gap between 35,000 and 1 30,000. 45-54 Years 14.6%65 Years and Older 13.5% Under Years 45-54 Years 35-44 Years 25-34 Years 15-24 Years Under 15 Years TotalWOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2007 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS 11 U.S. POPULATION In 2005, the total U.S. population was over 288 million, with females comprising 51 percentof that total. Females younger than age 35 yearsaccounted for 46.3 percent of the female popula-tion, those aged 35-64 years accounted for40.1 percent, and females age 65 years and olderaccounted for 13.5 percent. The distribution by sex was fairly even across younger age groups; however, women accountedfor a greater percentage of the older populationthan men. Of those in the 65 and older agegroup, 57.3 percent were women.POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2007 12 U.S. FEMALE POPULATION BY RACE/ETHNICITY The growing diversity of the U.S. population is reflected by the racial and ethnic distribution ofwomen across age groups. The younger femalepopulation (under 15 years) is significantly morediverse than the older female population. In2005, 58.6 percent of females under 15 yearswere non-Hispanic White, while 20.9 percent ofthat group were Hispanic. Among women aged65 years and older, in contrast, 80.9 percent werenon-Hispanic White and only 6.5 percent wereHispanic. The distribution of the Black popula-tion was more consistent across age groups,ranging from 15.3 percent of females under15 years to 9.0 percent of women aged 65 yearsand older. Evidence indicates that race and ethnicity correlate with health disparities within the U.S.population. Coupled with the increasing diversityof the U.S. population, these health disparitiesmake culturally-appropriate, community-drivenprograms critical to improving the health of theentire U.S. population. 1 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of Minority Health.

Just over 12 percent ofwomen over age 18 were the heads of theirhouseholds, meaning that they have children orother family members, but no spouse, living withthem in a house that they own or rent. Womenwho are heads of households include singlemothers, single women with a parent or other close relative in their house, and women withother household compositions. The remainingwomen lived alone (15.4 percent), with parentsor other relatives (12.4 percent), or with non-relatives (7.0 percent). Women in households with no spouse present are more likely than women in married couplefamilies to have incomes below the poverty level(see \"Women and Poverty\" on the next page). In2005, Black women were most likely to be single heads of households (28.5 percent) while Asianwomen were least likely (7.0 percent). Hispanicwomen and women of other races were also morelikely than non-Hispanic White and Asianwomen to be heads of households (16.7 and17.1 percent, respectively).

With regard to race and ethnicity, non-Hispanic White women were the least likely toexperience poverty (9.3 percent), while Blackwomen were the most likely (24.2 percent).Women in families\u2014a group of at least two people related by birth, marriage, or adoptionand residing together\u2014experience higher rates ofpoverty than men in families (9.6 versus6.3 percent). Men in families with no spousepresent were considerably less likely to be in afamily that lived below the poverty level thanwomen in families with no spouse present(11.3 versus 25.9 percent). 1 The Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is poor. If a family's total income is less than that family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered to be poor. Examples of 2005 poverty levels were $9,973 for an individual, $12,755 for a family of two, $15,577 for a family of three, and $19,971 for a family of four. These levels differ from the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) used to determine eligibility for Federal programs.

Although thenumber of degrees earned by men has alsoincreased, the rate of growth among women hasbeen much faster; therefore, the proportion ofdegrees earned by women has risen dramatically.In 1969-70, men earned a majority of every typeof postsecondary degree, while in 2003-04,women earned more than half of all associate's,bachelor's, and master's degrees and earned almost half of all first professional and doctoraldegrees. The most significant increase has beenin the proportion of first professional degreeearners who are women, which jumped from5.3 percent in 1969-70 to 49.2 percent in2003-04. In 2003-04, the total number ofwomen earning their first professional degree(40,872) was 22 times greater than in 1969-70(1,841). Although sex disparities in education have almost disappeared, there is still a disparityamong instructional staff in degree-grantinginstitutions. In fall 2003, only 39.4 percent of instructional staff were women. Among female instructors, a significant racial and ethnic disparity exists as well: 80.1 percentof all female instructional staff were non-Hispanic White. This disparity is even morepronounced among higher-level staff, such asprofessors, where non-Hispanic White womencomposed 87.3 percent of full-time female staff,compared to 4.9 percent for non-Hispanic Blackwomen and 2.4 percent for Hispanic women.

Some professions,such as medicine and dentistry, have historicallybeen dominated by males, while others, such asnursing, have been predominantly female. Over the past several decades, these gaps havenarrowed, and in some cases reversed. In1980-81, 47.4 percent of pharmacy studentswere women, while in the fall of 2005, womenrepresented more than 64 percent of pharmacystudents. Even in fields where men are still the majority, the representation of female studentshas grown. In 1980-81, only 26.5 percent ofmedical students were women compared tonearly one-half (48.8 percent) of students in thefall of 2005. Similar gains have been made in thefields of osteopathic medicine and dentistry,where the most recent data indicate that 49.6 and43.8 percent of students, respectively, werewomen compared to only 19.7 and 17.0 percentin 1980-81. During the 2005-06 academic year, female students represented a growing majority ingraduate schools of public health (70.6 percent).Similarly, the most recent data for social workprograms indicate that 85.7 percent of enrolledstudents were female. Nursing, at both theundergraduate and graduate levels, also continuesto be dominated by women, although theproportion of students who are female is slowlydeclining. In the 1980-81 academic year,94.3 percent of nursing students were female,while in the fall of 2005, females represented90.7 percent of graduate students in nursingprograms. Women also represent a majority ofstudents studying optometry therapy (90.8 data not shown).Comparative data for these programs are notavailable for the 1980-81 academic year.

Females aged 16 and older madeup 46.3 percent of the total workforce in 2006.Among working females, 75.3 percent workedfull-time compared to 89.4 percent of males. 1 The representation of females in the labor force varies greatly by occupational sector. In 2005,women composed 63 percent of sales and officeworkers, but only 3.6 percent of construction, extraction, maintenance, and repair workers.Other positions which were more commonlyheld by women than men include service jobs(56.6 percent) and management, professional,and related jobs (50.7 percent). Women were theminority in production, transportation, andmaterial moving (23.1 percent); farming, fishing,and forestry (20.4 percent); and in the military(14.6 percent). Earnings by women and men also vary greatly. Women represent a majority of earners makingless than $25,000 per year. Of earners making lessthan $2,500 per year, 58.5 percent were womenin 2005; however, women represented only 20.2 percent of earners making $100,000 ormore per year. The difference between women'sand men's earnings is larger among older thanyounger workers. For instance, women aged45-54 made 75 cents for every dollar earned bymales, while women aged 16-24 earned 93 centsfor every dollar earned by males of the same age. 2 1 U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Labor Statistics Data. http://data.bls.gov.

Foodsecurity and hunger are measured in the NationalHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES) through a series of questions includ-ing whether the respondent worried that foodwould run out before there would be money tobuy more; whether the respondent or his/herfamily could not afford to eat balanced meals;whether the respondent or his/her family cut thesize of meals or skipped meals because there wasnot enough money for food; and whether therespondent or his/her family ever went for awhole day without eating because there was notenough food. For many of these questions,respondents were asked how often thesesituations arose. Cases with occasional or episodicfood insecurity and/or hunger were morefrequently reported than those with chronicsituations; however, any degree of food insecurityplaces the members of a household at greaternutritional risk due to insufficient access tonutritionally adequate and safe foods. In 2003-04, over 17 percent of women were not fully food secure, and this varied noticeablyby race and ethnicity. Among women, non-Hispanic Whites were most likely to be fully foodsecure (88.4 percent), while Hispanics were leastlikely (60.5 percent). Hispanic women also had the highest rate of food insecurity without hunger(18.9 percent). Non-Hispanic Black and Hispan-ic women had similarly high rates of beingmarginally food secure (11.8 and 11.3 percent)and food insecure with hunger (10.4 and9.4 percent, respectively). While nearly 83 percent of women are fully food secure, only 61.5 percent of women withfamily incomes below the Federal poverty level (FPL) and 71.0 percent of women with incomesof 100-199 percent of the FPL were fully foodsecure in 2003-04. Comparatively, nearly99 percent of women with family incomes of400 percent or more of the FPL were fully foodsecure (data not shown).

The FederalFood Stamp Program helps low-income individ-uals purchase food. In 2005, nearly 12.5 millionadults participated in the Food Stamp Program;of these, almost 8.5 million (68 percent) werewomen. Of these women, nearly 4 million(almost half) were in the 18-35 age group.Female-headed households with children make up nearly one-third of households that rely onfood stamps, and represent nearly 60 percent offood stamp households with children (data notshown). The Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) also plays animportant role in serving women and families byproviding supplementary nutrition duringpregnancy, the postpartum period, and whilebreastfeeding. Most WIC participants are infantsand children (75 percent); however, the program also serves nearly 2 million pregnant women andmothers, representing 25 percent of WIC partic-ipants. During the years 1992-2005, the numberof women participating in WIC increased by60 percent, to rise. 3,994 3,9768,473 1,4623,071 1,875 1,408 639Adult Recipients of Food Stamps, by Age and Sex, 2005 Source I. 8: U.S. Department of A griculture, Food Stamp Quality Control SampleWomen Participating in WIC,* Selected Years, 1992-2005 Source I.9: U.S. Department of A griculture, WIC Pro gram Participation DataNumber in Thousands Number of WomenFemale Male 1,000,0001,200,0001,400,0001,600,0001,800,0002,000,000 20052004 2002 2000 1998 1996 1994 19921,226,1151,499,2181,647,3381,734,0331,748,7921,812,7861,931,6511,966,249 1,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000 60 Years and Older 36-59 Years 18-35 Years Total * Participants are classified as women, infants, or children based on nutritional-risk status; data reported include all pregnant women and mothers regardless of age.WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2007 22 HEALTH STATUS Analysis of women's health status enables health professionals and policy makers to determine theimpact of past and current health interventionsand the need for new programs. T rends in healthstatus help to identify new issues as they emerge. In the following section, health status indica- tors related to morbidity, mortality, healthbehaviors, and maternal health are presented.New topics include gynecological and reproduc-tive disorders, sleep disorders, autoimmunediseases, and maternal morbidity. The data aredisplayed by sex, age, and race and ethnicity,where feasible. Many of the conditions discussed,such as cancer, heart disease, hypertension, andstroke, have an important genetic component.Although the full impact of genetic risk factorson such conditions is still being studied, it is vitalfor women to be aware of their family history sothat their risk for developing such conditions canbe properly assessed.

The life expectancy at birthfor White females was 80.8 years; for Blackfemales, the life expectancy at birth was76.3 years. The differential between male andfemale life expectancy was greater among Blacksthan Whites; Black males could expect to live69.5 years, 6.8 years fewer than Black females,while the difference between White males andfemales was 5.1 years. The lower life expectancyamong Blacks may be partly accounted for byhigher infant mortality rates. Life expectancy has steadily increased since 1970 for males and females in both racial groups.Between 1970 and 2004, White males' lifeexpectancy increased from 68.0 to 75.7 years(11.3 percent), females' lifeexpectancy increased 75.6 80.8 years(6.9 percent). Black life expectancyincreased from 60.0 to 69.5 years (15.8 percent)during the same period, while Black females' lifeexpectancy increased from 68.3 to 76.3 years(11.7 percent).

To reduce the risk of chronic disease,the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2005 recommends engaging in at least 30 minutes ofmoderate-intensity physical activity on most daysof the week for adults. To prevent weight gainover time, the Guidelines recommend about60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physicalactivity on most days while not exceeding caloricintake requirements. 1 In 2005, only 50.9 percent of women reported engaging in at least 10 minutes of moderateleisure-time physical activity per week, and 32.0 percent reported at least 10 minutes ofvigorous activity. Among those reporting anyphysical activity in the last week, men were morelikely to engage in at least 10 minutes of vigorousactivity (41.8 percent) and, overall, participatedin physical activity for a greater average numberof minutes than women. While men reported anaverage of 235 minutes of moderate or vigorousphysical activity per week, women reportedspending an average of 194 and 179 minutes,respectively. The percentage of women reporting at least 10 minutes of physical activity in the past weekvaried with age. Younger women were much more likely to participate in both moderate andvigorous activity than older women. For instance,more than 50 percent of women under the age of65 participated in at least 10 minutes of moderatephysical activity, compared to only 36 percent ofwomen 75 years and older. The difference isgreater when comparing vigorous physicalactivity: 40.1 percent of women 18-44 versus 8.9percent of women 75 years and older report atleast 10 minutes of vigorous activity. 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; U.S. Department of Agriculture.

For mostpeople, this means eating a daily assortment offruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meatsand beans, and low-fat or fat-free milk products,while limiting added sugar, sodium, saturatedand trans fats, and cholesterol.1 Some fats, mostly those that come from sources of polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fattyacids, such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils, are animportant part of a healthy diet. However, highintake of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol may increase the risk of coronary heart disease.Most Americans should consume fewer than10 percent of calories from saturated fats, less than 300 mg/day of cholesterol, and keep trans fatty acid consumption to a minimum. In2003-04, 63.5 percent of women exceeded therecommended maximum daily intake ofsaturated fat\u2014most commonly non-HispanicWhite women and non-Hispanic Black women(65.9 and 64.4 percent, respectively). Salt, orsodium chloride, also plays an important role inheart health, as high salt intake can contribute tohigh blood pressure. Almost 70 percent ofwomen exceed the recommended intake of lessthan 2,300 mg/day of sodium (about 1 teaspoonof salt). Folate is an important part of a healthy diet, especially among women of childbearing age,since it can help reduce the risk of neural tube defects early in pregnancy. The Healthy People2010 objective for red blood cell (RBC) folateconcentration is 220 ng/mL. Non-pregnantwomen aged 15-44 have met this goal, butaverage RBC folate levels fell from 260 ng/mL in2001-02 to 235 ng/mL in 2003-04, represent-ing a decrease of almost 10 percent. The largestdecline was among non-Hispanic White women(16 percent), but rates among non-HispanicBlack and Mexican American women alsodropped. 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Cigarette smoke contains toxic ingredientsthat prevent red blood cells from carrying a fullload of oxygen, impairs genes that control thegrowth of cells, and binds to the airways ofsmokers. This contributes to numerous chronicillnesses, including several types of cancers,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),cardiovascular disease, reduced bone density andfertility, and premature death. 1 In 2005, over 60 million people in the United States aged 12 and older smoked cigarettes withinthe past month. Smoking was less commonamong females aged 12 and older (22.5 percent)than among males of the same age group (27.4 percent). The rate has declined over thepast several decades among both sexes. In 1985,the rate among males was 43.4, percent while therate among females was 34.5 percent. Quitting smoking has major and immediate health benefits, including reducing the risk ofdiseases caused by smoking and improving overallhealth. 1In 2005, over 42 percent of smokers reported trying to quit at least once in the pastyear. Females were more likely than males to tryto quit smoking (44.8 versus 40.7 percent).Among both males and females, non-HispanicBlacks were the most likely to attempt to quit(48.4 and 49.6 percent, respectively).Smoking during pregnancy can have a negative impact on the health of infants and children byincreasing the risk of complications duringpregnancy, premature delivery, and low birthweight\u2014a leading cause of infant mortality. 1 According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 16.6 percent of pregnant womenaged 15-44 smoked in 2004-05; however, thisvaried by race and ethnicity. Non-HispanicWhite women (21.5 percent) were more likely tosmoke during pregnancy than women of otherraces. Hispanic women were least likely to smokeduring pregnancy (7.2 percent), while 15 percentof non-Hispanic Black women did so. 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Although there is some debateover the health benefits of small amounts ofalcohol consumed regularly, the negative healtheffects of excessive alcohol use and abuse are well-established. Short-term effects can includeincreased risk of motor vehicle injuries, falls,domestic violence, and child abuse. Long-termeffects can include pancreatitis, high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, various cancers, andpsychological disorders including dependency. Overall, males are more likely to drink alcohol than females with past-month alcohol use reportedby 58.1 percent of males and 45.9 percent offemales aged 12 years and older. This is true acrossall age groups with the exception of 12- to 17-year-olds; in that group, 17.2 percent of females and15.9 percent of males reported past-month use.Males are also more likely than females to engagein binge drinking, which is defined as drinking fiveor more drinks on the same occasion at least oncein the past month (30.5 versus 15.2 percent), andheavy drinking, which is defined as five or moredrinks on the same occasion at least five times in the past month (10.3 versus 3.1 percent). Alcohol use during pregnancy can be a special concern for women of childbearing age. Drinkingalcohol during pregnancy can contribute to FetalAlcohol Syndrome (FAS), low birth weight ininfants, and developmental delays. In 2004-05,12.1 percent of pregnant women reporteddrinking alcohol in the past month. This was mostcommon in the 15-17 and 26-44 year age groups(13.9 and 13.5 percent, respectively) and leastcommon among those in the 18-25 year agegroup (9.7 percent; data not shown).

Illicit drugsinclude marijuana/hashish, cocaine, inhalants,hallucinogens, crack, and prescription-typepsychotherapeutic drugs used for non-medicalpurposes. In 2005, nearly 12.7 million womenaged 18 years and older reported using an illicitdrug within the past year; this represents11.2 percent of women. The past-year illicit druguse rate was significantly higher among women aged 18-25 years than among women 26 years andolder (30.1 versus 8.1 percent). Among adolescentfemales aged 12-17 years, 20.0 percent reportedusing illicit drugs in the past year. In 2005, marijuana was the most commonly used illicit drug among females in each age group,followed by the non-medical use of prescription-type psychotherapeutic drugs. Use of bothcategories of drugs was highest among femalesaged 18-25 (23.2 and 14.0 percent, respectively). Methamphetamine is a stimulant with a high potential for abuse, and use can result in decreasedappetite, increased respiration and blood pressure,rapid heart rate, irregular heartbeat, andhyperthermia. Long-term effects can includeparanoia, anorexia, delusions, and hallucinations. 1 While limited data exist on adult methampheta-mine use, the Monitoring the Future Survey hastracked use among students since 1999. In 2006, 1.8 percent of 8th and 10th graders and2.5 percent of 12th graders reported usingmethamphetamine in the past year (data notshown). 2 According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health's 2004-05 estimates, 3.9 percent ofpregnant women reported using illicit drugs inthe past month. Among pregnant 15- to 17-year-olds, 12.3 percent, or 1 in 8, reported past monthillicit drug use. Women 18 and older were lesslikely to report illicit drug use during pregnancy:the rate was 7.0 percent among 18- to 25-year-olds, and 1.6 percent among those aged 26-44years (data not shown). 1 National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse.

AIDS isdiagnosed when HIV has weakened the immunesystem enough that the body has a difficult timefighting infections. 1In 2005, there were an estimated 10,774 new AIDS cases among adoles-cent and adult females, compared to 29,766 newcases among males of the same age groups. Menhave been disproportionately affected by AIDS,but the rate among women is increasing at a fasterpace; since 2001, new AIDS cases have increasedby 7.2 percent among females compared to a6.7 percent increase among males.In 2005, females accounted for 27.1 percent of all adolescents and adults living with HIV/AIDS 2 and 21.5 percent of enrollees in the AIDS DrugAssistance Program (ADAP), a Federal programproviding medications for treatment of HIVdisease to those who do not have adequate healthinsurance or other financial resources. Most areenrolled in ADAP only while they await accept-ance into an insurance program such asMedicaid. 3ADAP is funded through Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act as amended bythe Ryan White HIV/AIDS T reatment Modern-ization Act of 2006 (Ryan White Program). InDecember 2006, the Act was reauthorized for3 years to provide funding for a range of pro-grams serving people with HIV/AIDS.HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects minori- ties: in 2005, 64.1 percent of adolescent and adultfemales living with HIV/AIDS were non-Hispanic Black. In 2004, HIV/AIDS was theleading cause of death among non-Hispanic Blackwomen aged 25-34. 4 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HIV/AIDS Basic Information.

In 2005, almost 14 percent ofthe U.S. population reported having at least onecondition that limited their ability to performone or more of these common activities. Womenwere more likely to report being limited in theiractivities than men (15.1 versus 12.5 percent). Among women with at least one activity limita- tion, the conditions that caused specific activitylimitations varied by age. Activity limitationscaused by heart problems were most commonamong women over 75 years (18.7 percent), andleast common among women under 45 years(4.6 percent).

Other types of arthritisinclude rheumatoid arthritis, lupus arthritis,gout, and fibromyalgia.In 2005, over 21 percent of adults in the United States reported that they had ever been diagnosedwith arthritis. Arthritis was more common inwomen than men (25.5 versus 17.4 percent), andrates of arthritis increased dramatically with agefor both sexes. Fewer than 10 percent of womenin the 18-44 year age group had been diagnosedwith arthritis, compared to 52.7 percent amongwomen aged 65-74 years, and almost 60 percentof women 75 years and older.In 2005, the rate of arthritis among women varied by race and ethnicity. It was most commonamong non-Hispanic White women (282.1 per1,000 women), followed by non-Hispanic Blackwomen (243.3 per 1,000). The lowest rates ofarthritis were among Asian and Hispanic women(124.4 and 144.2 per 1,000, respectively). 1 Arthritis Foundation. The facts about arthritis. 2004. http://www.arthritis.org.

This disorder may be aggravated byallergens, tobacco smoke and other irritants,exercise, and infections of the respiratory tract.However, by taking certain precautions, personswith asthma may be able to effectively managethis disorder and participate in daily activities.In 2005, women had higher rates of asthma than men (91.9 per 1,000 women versus 51.1 per1,000 men); this was true in every racial andethnic group. Among women, non-HispanicBlack women had the highest asthma rate (108.4per 1,000 women), followed by non-HispanicWhite women (93.8 per 1,000); Asian womenhad the lowest asthma rate (55.6 per 1,000). A visit to the emergency room due to asthma can be an indication that the asthma is noteffectively controlled. In 2005, asthmatic women with lower family incomes were more likely thanwomen with higher family incomes to have anemergency room visit due to asthma.

The common threadamong these diseases is that the body's ownimmune system attacks itself. For largelyunknown reasons, about 75 percent of autoim-mune diseases occur in women, most frequentlyin women of childbearing age. The most common autoimmune diseases include thyroid disease and systemic lupuserythematosus. Hashimoto's disease, or hypothy-roiditis, is a disease in which the immune systemdestroys the thyroid, and it occurs in 10 womenfor every one man. Graves' disease, in whichexcessive amounts of thyroid hormone areproduced, is another thyroid disease that occursmore frequently in women than men. Lupus is an inflammation of the connective tissues that can affect multiple organ systems; itoccurs in nine women for every one man. Inaddition to lupus, connective tissue diseasesinclude rheumatoid arthritis, a disorder in whichthe membranes around joints become inflamed;Sjogren's Syndrome, in which patients slowly losethe ability to secrete saliva and tears; and sclero-derma, which activates immune cells to producescar tissue in the skin, internal organs and smallblood vessels.Multiple sclerosis, twice as common in women as in men, is a disease of the central nervoussystem characterized by numbness, weakness,tingling or paralysis of the limbs, impaired vision,and/or lack of coordination. Myasthenia Gravisalso results in gradual muscle weakness.Antiphospholipid syndrome occurs whenantibodies attack body tissues and organs andresults in the formation of blood clots in arteriesor veins. Autoimmune thrombocytopenicpurpura is characterized by the failure of blood toclot as it should. Autoimmune hepatitis andprimary biliary cirrhosis both cause the liver tobecome inflamed which can lead to cirrhosis, orscarring, of the liver and liver failure. Autoimmune diseases are poorly understood and little comprehensive data exist. However, theLUMINA study has provided new data about therelationship between ethnicity and outcomesamong patients with lupus. The study found thatBlack and Hispanic lupus patients have moreactive disease and more organ system involve-ment than White patients. Data also showed thatBlack patients may accrue more renal damagethan White patients and more skin damage thaneither Hispanic or White patients. 1 1 Alarcon, GS, K Brooks, J Reveille, JR Lisse.

Diabetes isbecoming increasingly common among childrenand young adults. The two main types of diabetesare Type 1 (insulin dependent) and Type 2 (non-insulin dependent). Type 1 diabetes is usuallydiagnosed in children and young adults, and iscommonly referred to as \"juvenile diabetes.\"Type 2 diabetes is more common; it is oftendiagnosed among adults but is becoming increas-ingly common among children. Risk factors forType 2 diabetes include obesity, physical inactiv- ity, and a family history of the disease. In 2005, women and men reported similar rates of having ever been told they had diabetes,though women under the age of 45 were slightlymore likely than men of the same age group. Therate of diabetes increased with age for both sexes;however, older men were more likely to havediabetes than their female counterparts. The rateof diabetes among women under the age of 45was 25.1 per 1,000 women, compared to22.9 per 1,000 men of the same age. The ratesamong women and men 75 years and older were146.4 and 170.1 per 1,000, respectively.Non-Hispanic Black women were more likely than women of other racial and ethnic groups tohave diabetes: the rate of diabetes among thisgroup was 106.8 per 1,000 in 2005, compared toa rate of 77.1 per 1,000 Hispanic women, 71.6per 1,000 American Indian/Alaska Natives andwomen of multiple races, and 69.1 per 1,000non-Hispanic White women. Asian women hadthe lowest rate of diabetes (49.7 per 1,000). Mostwomen with diabetes of all racial and ethnicgroups do not take insulin, which may indicatethat they have Type 2 diabetes.

Lung and bronchuscancer is the leading cause of cancer death amongfemales, accounting for 26 percent of cancerdeaths, followed by breast cancer, which isresponsible for 15 percent of deaths. Colon andrectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and ovariancancer are also significant causes of cancer deathsamong females. Due to the varying survival rates for different types of cancer, the most commoncauses of cancer death are not always the mostcommon types of cancer. For instance, althoughlung and bronchus cancers cause the greatestnumber of deaths, breast cancer is the mostcommon type of cancer among women. Othertypes of cancer that are common among femalesbut are not among the top 10 causes of cancerdeaths include melanoma, thyroid cancer, and cancer of the kidney and renal pelvis. In addition,other types of cancer, such as some skin cancers,are common but may not lead to death. There are noticeable differences between the sexes in top causes of cancer mortality.

Because ofdifferences in the occurrence of sex-specificcancers, several of the top 10 causes of cancerdeaths among males do not rank as high amongfemales, including cancers of the bladderand esophagus. Sex-specific cancers among females have varying survival rates. Breast cancer has thehighest 5-year survival rate, with 89.1 percent of females diagnosed with cancer living for at least5 years after diagnosis. This high survival rateexplains why breast cancer is the most commontype of cancer among women but not the leadingcause of cancer death. Uterine cancer also has ahigh survival rate (83.0 percent), followed bycervical cancer (71.3 percent). The lowest survivalrate for sex-specific cancers among females occurswith ovarian cancer at a rate of 44.9 percent. For each of the sex-specific cancers shown, survivalrates are higher for White females than Blackfemales. The two leading causes of death due tonon-sex-specific cancers among females are lungand bronchus cancer and colon and rectumcancer, with a 5-year survival rate of 17.7 percentand 64.1 percent respectively (data not shown).

Thesedisorders include vulvodynia\u2014unexplainedchronic discomfort or pain of the vulva\u2014andchronic pelvic pain, which is a consistent andsevere pain occurring mostly in the lowerabdomen for at least 6 months. While the causesof vulvodynia are unknown, recent evidencesuggests that it may occur in up to 16 percent ofwomen, usually beginning before age 25, and thatHispanic women are at greater risk for thisdisorder. 1Chronic pelvic pain may be sympto- matic of an infection or indicate a problem withone of the organs in the pelvic area. 2 Reproductive disorders may affect a woman's ability to get pregnant. Examples of thesedisorders include polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), endometriosis, and uterine fibroids.PCOS occurs when immature follicles in theovaries form together to create a large cyst,preventing mature eggs from being released. Inmost cases, the failure of the follicles to release theeggs results in a woman's inability to becomepregnant. An estimated 5-10 percent of womenin the United States are affected by PCOS.Endometriosis, in which tissue resembling that ofthe uterine lining grows outside of the uterus, isestimated to affect nearly 5.5 million women in North America. Uterine fibroids are non-cancer-ous tumors that grow underneath the lining,between the muscles, or on the outside of theuterus. A hysterectomy \u2014 abdominal surgery toremove the uterus \u2014 is one option to treat certainconditions including chronic pelvic pain, uterinefibroids, PCOS, and endometriosis whensymptoms are severe. 2 In 2004, 8.1 percent of women aged 20-54 years had endometriosis and 15.6 percent haduterine fibroids, but the prevalence of bothdisorders varied with age. Of women aged 20-54 years, endometriosis was most common amongthe 35- to 44-year-old age group (12.4 percent),while uterine fibroids were most common among45- to 54-year-olds (27.6 percent).

This can occurthrough education, engineering and design ofsafety products, enactment and enforcement ofpolicies and laws, economic incentives, andimprovements in emergency care. Some examplesinclude the design, oversight, and use of car safetyseats and seatbelts, workplace regulations regard-ing safety practices, vouchers for items such assmoke alarms, and tax incentives for fitting homepools with fences.There were over 41 million injury-related emergency department (ED) visits in 2004.Among females of all ages, nearly 33 percent of allED visits were injury-related, compared to43 percent of all ED visits by males. Thisrepresents an annual rate of 13.3 injury-relatedvisits per 100 females compared to 15.4 visits per100 males (data not shown). Among females, thehighest rate of injury-related ED visits occurredamong those aged 75 years and older; however,due to the age distribution of the population,they represented only 9.3 percent of all femaleinjury-related ED visits.Unintentional and intentional injuries represented a higher proportion of ED visits formen than women in 2004.

Heart disease describes anydisorder that prevents the heart from functioningnormally. The most common type of heartdisease is coronary heart disease, in which thearteries of the heart slowly narrow, reducingblood flow to the heart muscle. Risk factorsinclude obesity, lack of physical activity, smoking,high cholesterol, hypertension, and old age.While the most common symptom of a heartattack is chest pain or discomfort, women aremore likely than men to experience othersymptoms, such as shortness of breath, nauseaand vomiting, and back or jaw pain. 1Stroke is a type of heart disease that affects blood flow. Warning signs are sudden and caninclude facial, arm or leg numbness, especially onone side of the body; severe headache; troublewalking; dizziness; a loss of balance or coordina-tion; or trouble seeing in one or both eyes. 1 In 2005, adult women under 45 years had a higher rate of heart disease than men of the sameage (50.9 versus 35.2 per 1,000 adults, respec-tively). However, men had a slightly higheroverall rate of heart disease than women. Heartdisease rates among both sexes increased with age. In 2004, women were less likely than men to undergo an operation on the cardiovascularsystem, (202.0 per 10,000 women and 277.7 per10,000 men). For example, the rate of coronary artery bypass procedures was 8.3 per 10,000 women and 21.1 per 10,000 men. 2 In 2005, the highest rate of heart disease was among non-Hispanic White women (128.7 per1,000), followed by non-Hispanic Black women(107.1 per 1,000); Asian women had the lowestrate (51.1 per 1,000). Although non-HispanicWhite women experience the highest rates ofheart disease, deaths from heart disease arehighest among non-Hispanic Black women. 1 American Heart Association.

Itis defined as a systolic pressure (duringheartbeats) of 140 or higher, and/or a diastolicpressure (between heartbeats) of 90 or higher. In2005, women had higher overall rates ofhypertension than men (265.9 versus 249.9 per1,000 population); however, these rates varied byrace and ethnicity. For instance, non-HispanicBlack and Hispanic women had higher rates of hypertension than their male counterparts, whilenon-Hispanic White and Asian women had ratessimilar to men.

Of these deaths, nearly halfwere attributable to heart disease and malignantneoplasms (cancer), responsible for 330,513 and267,058 deaths, respectively. The next twoleading causes of death were cerebrovasculardiseases (stroke), which accounted for 7.5 percentof deaths, followed by chronic lower respiratorydisease, which accounted for 5.2 percent. Heart disease was the leading cause of death for women in almost every racial and ethnic group;the exception was Asian/Pacific Islander females,for whom the leading cause of death was cancer.One of the most noticeable differences in leadingcauses of death by race and ethnicity is thatchronic lower respiratory disease was the fourthleading cause of death among non-HispanicWhite females while it was the seventh leadingcause of death among other racial and ethnicgroups. Similarly, diabetes mellitus was the eighthleading cause of death among non-HispanicWhite females, while it was the fourth amongother racial and ethnic groups. Among Hispanicfemales, death in the perinatal period was theninth leading cause of death, and hypertensionwas the tenth leading cause among Asian/PacificIslander females. Also noteworthy is that NativeAmerican/Alaska Native females experienced a higher proportion of deaths due to unintentionalinjury (8.5 percent) and liver disease (4.2 percent) than females of other racial and ethnic groups.

Regular dental care is particularlyimportant for women because there is someevidence of an association between periodontaldisease and certain birth outcomes, such asincreased risk of preterm birth and low birthweight. 1To prevent caries (cavities) and periodontal (gum) disease, the American DentalAssociation recommends maintaining a healthydiet with plenty of water, and limiting eating anddrinking between meals. 2 Other important preventive measures include daily brushing andflossing, regular dental cleanings to remove plaque, and checkups to examine for caries orother potential problems. 3 In 2003-04, women were less likely than men to have untreated dental caries (23.9 versus30.5 percent). Among women, non-HispanicBlack and Hispanic women were most likely tohave untreated caries. Sealants \u2014 a hard, clearsubstance applied to the surfaces of teeth \u2014 mayhelp to prevent caries, but only 21.2 percent ofwomen had sealants.

Among adults interviewed in2001-03, 23.0 percent of women had experi-enced any anxiety disorder in the past year,compared to 13.8 percent of men. Post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD) is a type of mentaldisorder that can occur in those who have experi-enced or witnessed life-threatening events such asnatural disasters, serious accidents, terrorist incidents, acts of war, or violent personal assaultssuch as rape. 1While PTSD was previously thought of as primarily affecting male warveterans, it is now understood that the disorderaffects both sexes and is actually more prevalent infemales (5.2 versus 1.8 percent). Other commonmental disorders include social phobia, general-ized anxiety disorder, and major depressivedisorder, all of which are more common amongwomen than men.Among women, mental disorders are most common among those aged 18-25 years. Seriouspsychological distress occurs among almost23 percent of women in this age group, comparedto nearly 16 percent of women aged 26-49 yearsand 9.0 percent of women aged 50 years andolder. Major depressive disorder displays a similarpattern, occurring most frequently among thosewomen 18-25 years (12.9 percent), compared to26- to 49-year-olds and those aged 50 years andolder (10.5 and 6.6 percent, respectively).WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2007 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 47 Although most people who suffer from mental illness do not commit suicide, mental illness is amajor risk factor. Women attempt suicide threetimes as often than men, but men are much morelikely to die of suicide injury than women. 2In 2004, the female suicide death rate among thoseaged 15 years and older was 5.7 per 100,000females, compared to a rate of 22.4 per 100,000males. Although mental disorders affect womenin younger age groups more often than womenin older age groups, women aged 45-54 yearshave the highest suicide death rate among females (8.6 per 100,000). Among males, the highestsuicide death rate occurs in the 65-84 age group(27.2 per 100,000). There are also disparities in suicide rates among racial and ethnic groups. Among females aged15 years and older, American Indian/AlaskaNatives have the highest suicide rate (8.0 per100,000 females), followed by non-HispanicWhites (6.8 per 100,000). Non-Hispanic Blackfemales have the lowest suicide rates among allracial and ethnic groups (2.3 per 100,000), closely followed by Hispanic females (2.5 per100,000). 1 American Psychiatric Association.

By2020, an estimated 1 in 2 Americans over age50 will be at risk for osteoporosis and low bonemass. Each year more than 1.5 million peoplesuffer a bone fracture related to osteoporosis, withthe most common breaks in the wrist, spine andhip. Fractures can have devastating consequences.For example, hip fractures are associated with anincreased risk of mortality, and nearly 1 in 5 hipfracture patients ends up in a nursing home within a year. Direct care for osteoporoticfractures costs $18 billion yearly. 1 In 2003-04, women aged 18 years and older were more likely than men to report having beentold by a health professional that they haveosteoporosis (10.0 versus 1.7 percent, respec-tively.) In addition, 72.4 percent of women withosteoporosis received treatment, compared to52.1 percent of men. The rate of osteoporosisamong women varied significantly with age.While only 5.3 percent aged 18-64 years hadosteoporosis in 2003-04, 33.8 percent of womenaged 75-84 years and 32.9 percent of those aged85 years and older reported having osteoporosis. Osteoporosis may be prevented and treated by getting the recommended amounts of calcium,vitamin D, and regular weight-bearing physical activity (i.e. walking), and by taking prescriptionmedication when appropriate. Bone density testsare recommended for women over 65 years andfor any man or woman who suffers a fracture afterage 50. T reatment of osteoporosis has beenshown to reduce the risk of subsequent fracturesby 30-65 percent. 1Despite these findings, national data in 2005 indicate that only20.1 percent of female Medicare beneficiariesaged 67 years and older who had a fracturereceived either a bone mineral density test or aprescription to treat osteoporosis. 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Overweight isdefined as a BMI of 25.0-29.9, and obese or more; a BMI of 18.5-24.9 is considered normal weight while a BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight. Since 1960, rates of overweight and obesity among men and women have increased dramati-cally. In 1960-62, 24.5 percent of women wereoverweight and 15.7 percent were obese,compared to 27.4 and 34.0 percent, respectively,in 2001-04. This marks an 11.8 percent increasein female overweight and a 116.6 percent increasein female obesity over the past 4 decades. Mensaw a smaller increase in rates of overweight(4.4 percent), but a larger increase in rates ofobesity (182.2 percent). However, men are more likely to be overweight than women, while the reverse is true for obesity. Rates of overweight and obesity among women vary by race and ethnicity. In 2003-04, Hispanicwomen (32.1 percent) were more likely thannon-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Blackwomen to be overweight (28.4 and 26.9 percent,respectively). Non-Hispanic Black women weremost likely to be obese (53.0 percent), while non-Hispanic White women were least likely to beobese (30.3 percent). 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.

Rates are highest among adolescents andyoung adults, and non-Hispanic Blacks andAmerican Indian/Alaska Natives. In 2005, therewere 1,729 cases of chlamydia and 590 cases ofgonorrhea per 100,000 non-Hispanic Blackfemales, compared to 237 and 43 cases, respec-tively, per 100,000 non-Hispanic White females.American Indian/Alaska Native females also havehigh rates of STIs with 1,778 and 170 cases ofchlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively, per 100,000 females. Although these STIs are treatable with antibi- otics, they can have serious health consequences.Active infections can increase the odds ofcontracting another STI, such as HIV, anduntreated STIs can lead to pelvic inflammatorydisease, infertility, and adverse pregnancyoutcomes. Another STI, genital human papillomavirus (HPV), has been estimated to affect at least50 percent of the sexually active population. Thefirst study to examine the prevalence of HPV inthe United States was recently released, based ondata from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Overall, 26.8 percent offemales aged 14-59 years were found to haveHPV, with the highest rates occurring among the20- to 24-year-old age group (44.8 percent).There are many different types of HPV, andsome, which are referred to as \"high-risk,\" cancause cancer. In 2006, the Food and DrugAdministration approved a vaccine that protectswomen from four strains of HPV that can be thesource of cervical cancer, precancerous lesions,and genital warts. 1 1 FDA News.

In the same poll,39 percent of women reported getting a goodnight's sleep every night or almost every night,while another 32 percent report getting a goodnight's sleep a few nights a week. Pregnant andpostpartum women were more likely thanwomen overall to report rarely or never getting agood night's sleep (30 and 42 percent versus 15 percent, respectively). Women who reportedhaving a good night's sleep only a few nights amonth or less are significantly more likely thanthose who reported a good night's sleep everynight or almost every night to experience certaineffects of sleep deprivation, including daytimesleepiness at least a few days a week (43 versus7 percent) and driving drowsy at least once amonth (39 versus 18 percent). Overall, about two-thirds of women reported experiencing a sleep problem at least a few nightsa week within the past month, with 46 percent reporting that this occurred every night or almostevery night. The most common sleep problemwas waking up feeling unrefreshed, which wasreported to occur at least a few nights a week byhalf of all women. Almost half of women(49 percent) reported being awake a lot duringthe night at least a few nights a week, 37 percentreported difficulty falling asleep a few nights aweek, and just over one-third of women reportedwaking up too early and not being able to fallback asleep.

In1993, the rate of violent victimization amongmales was 59.8 per 1,000 population and the rateamong females was 40.7 per 1,000. Those rateshad dropped to 25.5 and 17.1 per 1,000, respec- tively, in 2005. This follows the downward trendin violent crime victimization rates over the pastdecade. Females are more likely than males to be victims of rape and sexual assault, while males aremore likely to be victims of robbery and assault. For all types of violent crime, women are more likely than men to know the offender. Among allrape and sexual assault cases in 2005, 73 percentof women were attacked by someone that theyknew, either an intimate partner (28 percent), other relative (7 percent), or friend/acquaintance(38 percent). Another 26 percent were attackedby a stranger, while the victim/offender relation-ship in the remaining cases was not determined.Similarly, female victims of 50 percent of rob-beries, 62 percent of aggravated assaults, and66 percent of simple assaults knew their assailant. 1 These estimates are based on household and individual surveys that are intended to capture all incidents regardless of whether or not they were reported to law enforcement.

The number of infantHIV/AIDS cases in 2005 was only one-third thenumber reported in 1994. A major factor in thisdecline is the increasing use of prophylaxis before,during, and after pregnancy to reduce perinataltransmission of the virus. In 1994, the U.S. PublicHealth Service began to recommend prophylaxisfor all HIV-positive pregnant women; since 1995,HIV counseling and voluntary testing have beenrecommended for all pregnant women. In 2004,the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new and updated materials to furtherpromote universal prenatal HIV testing. It isexpected that the perinatal transmission rate willcontinue to decline with increased use of aggres-sive interventions and obstetric procedures, suchas elective cesarean section. Although there is a significant racial/ethnic disparity in HIV/AIDS among women, andconsequently among infants born to HIV-infected women, the decline over the past decadeoccurred among each racial and ethnic group.The number of cases of HIV/AIDS among non-Hispanic Black infants declined 65.6 percent,from 215 cases in 1994 to 74 cases in 2005. The decline among Hispanic infants was less marked(40.6 percent), from 32 cases in 1994 to 19 casesin 2005. The most extreme decline in the numberof cases was among non-Hispanic White infants(81.8 percent) from 77 cases in 1994 to 14 casesin 2005. Women can become infected with HIV in a variety of ways. Among infants with HIV/AIDSin 2005, 19 were born to mothers who acquiredtheir HIV through injection drug use, 35 wereborn to mothers who contracted HIV from sexwith an infected partner, and 46 were born tomothers whose risk factor was not specified. 50100150200250300350400 20052004200320022001200019991998199719961995199474 3519 46Reported Cases of HIV/AIDS* in Infants Born to HIV-infected Mothers, by Perinatal Transmission Categories, 2005 Source II.5: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV/AIDS Surveillance ReportReported Cases of HIV/AIDS* in Infants Born to HIV- infected Mothers, by Infant Race/Ethnicity, 1994-2005 Source II.5: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report Number of Infants Number of Infants1974111 *Includes children with a diagnosis of HIV infection (not AIDS), a diagnosis of AIDS following a prior diagnosis of HIV infection, or concurrent diagnoses of HIV infection and AIDS, in 25 States with confidential name-based HIV reporting. **Includes two Asian/Pacific Islanders and one American Indian/Alaska Native.*Includes children with a diagnosis of HIV infection (not AIDS), a diagnosis of AIDS following a prior diagnosis of HIV infection, or concurrent diagnoses of HIV infection and AIDS, in 25 States with confidential name-based HIV reporting. **Men who have sex with men and women.14Non-Hispanic White Hispanic Non-Hispanic BlackTotal** 10 20 30 40 50Risk Factor Not SpecifiedSex with HIV-Infected PersonInjection Drug UseSex with Injection Drug UserSex with MSM/W**HEALTH STATUS - MATERNAL HEALTH WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2007 54 WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY Weight gain during pregnancy is an important factor in pregnancy outcome. Inadequate weightgain has been associated with increased risk ofintrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), pretermbirth, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality.Excessive weight gain can also have a negativeimpact on pregnancy outcome, includingelevated risk of a large-for-gestational-age infant,cesarean delivery, and long-term maternal weightretention. In 1990, the Institute of Medicine(IOM) developed a set of recommendations formaternal weight gain based on the pre-pregnancyBody Mass Index (BMI) of the mother. Theguidelines advise that those with a BMI of lessthan 19.8 gain 28 to 40 pounds, those with aBMI of 19.8-26.0 gain 25 to 35 pounds, andthose with a BMI of 26.1-29.0 gain 15 to 25pounds. There are currently no recom-mendations for women who have a BMI of 29.1or greater. The IOM convened a workshop in2006 to assess the impact of pregnancy weight onmaternal and child health, and a report from thatworkshop was released in February 2007. Data from the National Vital Statistics System show that 13.0 percent of women gained fewerthan 16 pounds during pregnancy in 2004; thiswas most common among non-Hispanic Blackwomen (19.0 percent). Another 20.0 percent ofall pregnant women gained more than 40 pounds, which was most common amongnon-Hispanic White women (22.2 percent).These data suggest that approximately one-thirdof women had weight gain outside therecommended guidelines; however, this does not account for pre-pregnancy BMI or gestationalage. Analyses of other national data sets suggestthat approximately two-thirds of women experi-ence weight gain outside of the IOM guidelines.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2007 HEALTH STATUS - MATERNAL HEALTH 55 MATERNAL MORBIDITY AND RISK FACTORS INPREGNANCY Maternal morbidity refers to diseases or conditions that arise during pregnancy. Since1989 (the year these data became available frombirth certificates), diabetes and hypertension havebeen the most commonly reported conditions.Both chronic and gestational (developing onlyduring pregnancy) diabetes may pose health risksto the mother and infant. Babies born to motherswith diabetes can have birth defects. These babiesmay also be premature or stillborn, or very largeat birth. 1In 2004, diabetes during pregnancy occurred at a rate of 35.8 per 1,000 live births.There was little variation among racial and ethnicgroups. Hypertension during pregnancy can be either chronic in nature or limited to the duration ofthe pregnancy. Severe hypertension duringpregnancy can result in preeclampsia, fetalgrowth restriction, premature birth, placentalabruption, and stillbirth. 2Chronic hypertension was present in 9.6 of every 1,000 live births in2004, and was noticeably more prevalent amongnon-Hispanic Black women than non-HispanicWhite and Hispanic women. The rate ofpregnancy-associated hypertension was evenhigher, occurring in 37.9 of every 1,000 livebirths. Rates were comparable between non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black women, but were lower among Hispanic women. Other illnesses or risk factors during pregnancy can include eclampsia, which involves seizures(usually preceded by a diagnosis of preeclampsia),hydramnios and oligohydramnios, which are toomuch and too little amniotic fluid, respectively,and incompetent cervix, which can result inpreterm birth. All of these conditions are moreprevalent among non-Hispanic Black women than non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women. 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Diabetes and pregnancy FAQs.

In 2004, repair of a current obstet-ric laceration and cesarean section were the twomost common obstetrical procedures amongwomen aged 15-44 years, according to hospitaldischarge data (occurring during 99.4 and98.7 hospital stays per 10,000 women, respec-tively). Other common procedures were artificialrupture of membranes, also known as \"breakingthe waters\" (75.2 per 10,000), episiotomy, whichis a surgical cut to the perineum to enlarge thevaginal opening (53.3 per 10,000), and medical induction of labor (45.9 per 10,000). The rate ofinduction of labor was twice the 1990 rate, whilethe cesarean section rate increased 41 percentafter a recent low in 1996. Complications of labor and delivery can include moderate or heavy meconium, which occurswhen the baby expels its first stool before beingborn; breech presentation or malpresentation,which occurs when the baby is in an abnormalposition that may interfere with labor; tocolysis,which is the delaying of labor to avoid pretermbirth; and precipitous labor, which is labor thattakes less than 3 hours from beginning to end.Among childbearing women through age 54,moderate/heavy meconium is most common, occurring at a rate of 48.3 per 1,000 live births,followed by breech/malpresentation (41.6 per1,000), tocolysis (19.8 per 1,000), and precipitouslabor (19.2 per 1,000). There is some racial andethnic disparity in the occurrence of these compli-cations. Moderate/heavy meconium is mostcommon among births to non-Hispanic Blackwomen and breech/malpresentation occurs mostfrequently in births to non-Hispanic Whitewomen.

The numberof births rose most noticeably among Hispanicwomen, followed by Asian/Pacific Islanderwomen. Births also rose slightly among AmericanIndian/Alaska Native and non-Hispanic Blackwomen, while they declined slightly among non-Hispanic White women. The birth rate of 14.0live births per 1,000 population was the same asthe rate reported in 2004. Among non-HispanicWhite, non-Hispanic Black, and Asian/PacificIslander populations, birth rates declined, while they rose slightly among the Hispanic andAmerican Indian/Alaska Native populations. With regard to age, overall birth rates were highest among those aged 25-29 years (115.6 per1,000), followed by those aged 20-24 years(102.2 per 1,000). The birth rate for non-Hispanic Whites was highest in the 25-29 agegroup (109.3 per 1,000), while the rates for non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and AmericanIndian/Alaska Natives were highest in the 20-24age group (126.7, 169.6, and 109.0 per 1,000,respectively). The birth rate among Asian/PacificIslanders was highest among 30- to 34-year-olds (115.1 per 1,000). Overall, 36.8 percent of births were to unmarried mothers. This percentage was thehighest among non-Hispanic Black mothers(69.5 percent of all births), followed by AmericanIndian/Alaska Native mothers (63.3 percent).The lowest percentage of births to unmarriedmothers was among the Asian/Pacific Islandergroup (16.2 percent). *Data HispanicAsian/ Mothers, by Race/Ethnicity, 2005* Source II.23: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Vital Statistics SystemLive Births per 1,000 Women, by Age and Race/Ethnicity, 2005* Source II.23: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, National Vital Statistics System Total Percent of Births15-19 Years 40.4 26.0 60.9 16.2HEALTH MATERNAL HEALTH WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2007 58 BREASTFEEDING Breastmilk benefits the health, growth, immunity, and development of infants. Motherswho breastfeed may have a decreased risk ofbreast and ovarian cancers. 1 In 2005, 72.9 percent of infants were reported to have ever been breastfed. Non-Hispanic Blackinfants were the least likely to ever be breastfed(55.4 percent), while Asian/Pacific Islanders werethe most likely (81.4 percent), followed byHispanics (79.0 percent). Infants born toyounger mothers, mothers with lowereducational attainment, mothers with low familyincome, and mothers receiving WIC program benefits were also less likely to be breastfed. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants be exclusively breast-fed\u2014without supplemental solids or liquids\u2014forthe first 6 months of life, based on evidence ofreduced risk of upper respiratory and othercommon infections. However, only 13.9 percentof infants were exclusively breastfed at 6 monthsin 2005, and only 39.1 percent of infants werefed any breastmilk at 6 months. Younger mothers were less likely to breastfeed than mothers in older age categories. In 2005,50.0 percent of infants with mothers under age 20 were ever breastfed, compared to 68.4 percentof infants born to mothers aged 20-29 years, and77.7 percent of infants born to mothers aged30 years and older. The percentage of infants whowere breastfed at 6 and 12 months also increasedwith maternal age. 1 Ip S, Chung M, Raman G, Chew P, Magula N, DeVine D, Trikalinos T, Lau J.

According tothe U.S. Census Bureau, the older population isexpected to grow to 72 million by 2030,representing approximately 20 percent of thepopulation, due to the aging of the baby boomgeneration. In 2005, older women composed6.9 percent of the total population while mencomposed 5.2 percent. Older women representeda larger proportion of the elderly population thanmen within every age group.Employment plays a significant role in the lives of many older Americans. In 2006, more than2.3 million women aged 65 years or older wereworking, accounting for 11.4 percent of womenin this age group. While elderly men are morelikely than women to be employed, since 1994the percentage of employed older adults hasincreased faster among women than men (datanot shown). In 2006, 23.5 percent of 65- to 69-year-old women were employed, compared to17.3 percent in 1994, an increase of almost39 percent. Among women aged 70-74,12.7 percent were employed in 2006, an increaseof 53.0 percent since 1994. Likewise, the percentage of women aged 75 and older whoworked rose 26.5 percent from 1994 to 2006 (3.4to 4.3 percent, respectively). According to a report by the U.S. Census Bureau, those who choose to retire cite a varietyof reasons, including being required to do so,poor health, wanting to do other things, andwanting to spend time with family.

The numberof areas defined as metropolitan changesfrequently as the population grows and peoplemove. Residents of non-metropolitan areas tendto be older, complete fewer years of education,have public insurance or no health insurance, andlive farther from health care resources than theirmetropolitan counterparts.Women in metropolitan areas also tend to have higher household incomes. In 2004, 12.1 percentof women in metropolitan areas reported familyincomes of less than 100 percent of the Federalpoverty level (FPL), compared to 14.7 percent ofwomen in non-metropolitan areas. For womenwith family incomes of 100-199 percent of theFPL, the rates were 17.8 and 23.6 percent,respectively. Women in metropolitan areas weremore likely than women in non-metropolitan areas to report incomes of 400 percent or more of the FPL (39.5 versus 28.5 percent, respectively). Women in non-metropolitan areas generally have access to fewer health care resources. Inaddition, they are also less likely to report beingin good health. In 2004, 56.7 percent of womenin metropolitan areas reported being in excellentor very good health, compared to 51.7 percent ofwomen in non-metropolitan areas.

For women who have poor health status,disabilities, poverty, lack of insurance, and limitedaccess to a range of health services, preventivetreatment and rehabilitation can be critical inpreventing disease and improving quality of life. The following section presents data on women's health services utilization, including data oninsurance coverage, usual source of care, satisfac-tion with care, use of medication, and use ofvarious services, such as preventive care, HIVtesting, and mental health services. The contri-bution of HRSA to women's health across thecountry is highlighted, as well. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2007 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 63 USUAL SOURCE OF CARE Women who have a usual source of care (a place they usually go when they are sick) are more likelyto receive preventive care, 1to have access to care (as indicated by use of a physician or emergencydepartment, or not delaying seeking care whenneeded), 2to receive continuous care, and to have lower rates of hospitalization and lower healthcare costs. 3In 2005, almost 90 percent of women reported having a usual source of care. Women ofall racial and ethnic groups were more likely thanmen to have a usual source of care. Amongwomen, non-Hispanic Whites were most likelyto report a usual source of care (91.8 percent),followed by non-Hispanic Blacks (89.9 percent); Hispanic women were least likely to report ausual source of care (78.5 percent). In 2005, 86.9 percent of women reported an office-based source of care (such as a physician'soffice), while fewer than 1 percent reported anemergency department was their usual source ofcare. This varied by family income level. Womenwith family incomes under 100 percent of theFederal poverty level (FPL) were more likely toreport that hospital outpatient departments(1.5 percent) and emergency departments(1.9 percent) were the places they usually gowhen sick, and were more likely to have no usualsource of care (17.1 percent) than those with higher income levels. Only 0.2 percent of womenwhose family incomes were at 300 percent ormore of FPL named emergency departments asthe place they usually go when sick, and only6.1 percent had no usual source of care. 1 Ettner SL.

In 2005, 44.4 millionnon-elderly individuals in the United States,representing 17.2 percent of that population,were uninsured. 1The percentage of people who are uninsured varies considerably across anumber of categories, including age, sex,race/ethnicity, income, and education. In 2005, among adults aged 18 and older, younger persons were most likely to lack healthinsurance, and men were more likely thanwomen to be uninsured in every age group. The largest percentage of uninsured persons occurredamong 18- to 24-year-old males (32.6 percent),which was significantly higher than the percent-age for women of the same age group (26.0 percent). The lowest rate of uninsurancewas among adults aged 65 and older, most ofwhom are eligible for Medicare coverage. Thenext lowest rates of uninsured occurred amongwomen and men aged 45-64 (13.3 and 14.0percent); however, the gender disparity was lesspronounced than in the younger age groups. Among women aged 18-64 in 2005, 71.8 percent had private insurance, 14.6 percent had publicinsurance, and 17.8 percent were uninsured. This distribution varied by race and ethnicity: non-Hispanic White females had the highest rate ofprivate insurance coverage (79.0 percent), followedby Asian/Pacific Islander women (72.9 percent).Non-Hispanic Black females had the highest rate ofpublic insurance (24.0 percent), and Hispanicfemales had the highest rate of being uninsured(36.9 percent), followed closely by AmericanIndian/Alaska Native women (33.4 percent).[Respondents were able to report more than one typeof coverage.] 1 This statistic does not include adults aged 65 and older because that is the age when people become eligible for Medicare coverage based on age.

Medicare has four components: Part Acovers hospital, skilled nursing, home health, andhospice care; Part B covers physician services,outpatient services, and durable medicalequipment; Part C is a managed care programnow known as \"Medicare Advantage;\" andPart D, added in 2006, covers prescription drugs.In 2005, 56 percent of Medicare's 42.5 million enrollees, were female. A majority of Medicareenrollees were aged 65 and older; the elderlyrepresented 87 percent of female and 81 percentof male enrollees. Of the 43 million enrollees eligible for the Medicare Part D prescription drug program in2006, 55.8 percent were female. Of those whoenrolled in stand-alone prescription drug plans,6.6 million (61 percent) were female. Mostwomen enrolled in Part D are in the 75- to 89-year-old age group with 2.85 million enrollees,followed by the 65- to 74-year-old age group with 2.76 million. Medicaid is jointly funded by the Federal and State governments and provides coverage forlow-income people and people with disabilities.In 2004, Medicaid covered 58 million individu-als including children; the aged, blind, anddisabled; and adults who are eligible for cashassistance programs.

Indicators used to monitor women's health care in managed care plans include the timeliness ofprenatal care, receipt of postpartum checkupsafter delivery, screening for chlamydia, screeningfor cervical cancer, and receipt of mammograms.In 2005, the rate of perinatal services and chlamy-dia screening increased, while the rate of cervicalcancer screening among women in commercial plans rose after a decrease during 2004. Perinatal services\u2014prenatal care and postpar- tum checkups\u2014appear to be more accessible incommercial (private) plans than in public-sectorplans financed by Medicaid. The same is true ofcervical cancer screening, which is receivedat least once every 3 years by nearly 82 percent ofcommercially-insured women and 65 percent ofwomen covered by Medicaid. Chlamydia screening is the one screening service that is more common among Medicaid-enrolled women than those with private coverage:52.4 percent of Medicaid-enrolled women aged 21-25 had a chlamydia screen in the previousyear, compared to 35.2 percent of commercially-insured women. In 2005, the rate of mammograms for women aged 52-69 was approximately the same forwomen with private coverage and those coveredthrough Medicare. However, Medicaid-enrolledwomen were considerably less likely to receive a mammogram at least once every 2 years.

In 2005, fewer females were satisfied with how well their doctors communicated (81.0 percent),compared to males (84.3 percent). However, thisvaried across age groups. Younger men andwomen were least likely to be satisfied, and women were less satisfied than men in every agegroup, except those 75 and older. Among 18- to44-year-olds, 77.1 percent of women and80.4 percent of men were satisfied, while 88.0percent of women and 87.6 percent of men aged75 and older reported satisfaction with how welldoctors communicate. Non-Hispanic Whitewomen (83.0 percent) were also more likely thannon-Hispanic Black or Hispanic women (76.8and 76.7 percent, respectively) to be satisfied(data not shown).

However, males' averageexpenditures exceeded females' for hospital inpatient services ($16,007 compared to $12,292) and hospital outpatient services, while females'expenditures exceeded males' in the categories ofhome health services, office-based medicalservices, and prescription drugs. While the gendergap in health care expenditures has narrowedsomewhat since 1998, overall per capita healthcare expenditures have increased substantiallyamong both men and women. Males' expenseshave gone up by 67 percent over this period whilefemales' have increased by 53 percent.

In 2004, females of all agesmade 535 million physician office visits. Of thesevisits, 18.6 percent were for preventive care,including prenatal care, screenings, and insuranceexaminations. 1 Routine Pap smears, which detect the early signs of cervical cancer, are recommended within3 years of initiation of sexual activity, or by age21. In 2004, 5.3 percent of all physician visitsmade by women aged 18 or older included a Papsmear. This rate was higher among the youngerage groups, and occurred in 9.9 percent of office visits made by women aged 18-24 years compared to only 5.2 percent of visits by womenaged 45-64 and 1.2 percent of visits made bywomen aged 65 years and older. Among women 40 and older, 3.9 percent of all office visits included a mammogram, which isrecommended every 1-2 years to screen for breastcancer among this age group. The proportion ofoffice visits including a mammogram was highestamong the younger age groups: 5.6 and 5.7percent of visits, respectively, among women aged40-49 years and 50-59 years, compared to1.7 percent among women 75 years and older. Vaccination is another important preventive measure. Vaccination for influenza is generallyrecommended for young children, older adults, and adults with chronic health conditions. In2005, 60.5 percent of women aged 65 and olderreported receiving a flu vaccine in the past year.Pneumonia vaccine is also recommended forolder adults and people with certain healthconditions. In 2005, almost 60 percent of womenaged 65 and older reported ever receiving thevaccine. Non-Hispanic White women were mostlikely to have ever received the pneumoniavaccine (63.2 percent), compared to 28.5 percentof Hispanic and 35.4 percent of Asian women. 1 Hing E, Cherry DK, Woodwell DA.

Testing for HIV,the virus that causes AIDS, is essential so thatinfected individuals can seek appropriate care.HIV testing requires only a simple blood or saliva test, and it is often offered through confidential or anonymous sources. It isrecommended that people who meet any of the following criteria be tested for HIV: have injecteddrugs or steroids, or shared drug use equipment(such as needles) with others; have hadunprotected sex with men who have sex with men, anonymous partners, or multiple partners;have exchanged sex for drugs or money; havebeen diagnosed with hepatitis, tuberculosis, or asexually transmitted infection; received a bloodtransfusion between 1978 and 1985; or have hadunprotected sex with anyone who meets any ofthe previous criteria. 1 In 2005, just over 35 percent of adults in the United States had ever been tested for HIV.Overall, women were more likely than men tohave been tested (37.7 versus 32.7 percent).Women were more likely to have been tested atyounger ages, while men were more likely to havebeen tested at older ages. This difference may be due in part to Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) guidelines that recommendHIV testing for pregnant women. In 2006, newCDC guidelines were released that recommendall health care providers include HIV testing aspart of their patients' routine health care. Amongwomen, in 2005, non-Hispanic Blacks had thehighest testing rate (52.5 percent), followed byHispanics (47.3 percent). Non-Hispanic Whitewomen had the lowest rate (33.5 percent). 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National HIV Testing Resources.

The percentof visits with one or more drugs prescribed orprovided was similar for males and females(64.6 and 64.0 percent). Among females,36.0 percent of visits did not involve prescribingor providing any drugs, 25.3 percent of visitsinvolved the prescription or provision of onedrug, and 14.4 percent of visits involved twodrugs. 1 The prescription or provision of medications among females varies by age and drug type. In2004, the rate of cardiovascular/renal and painrelief drugs prescribed or provided at physicianoffice visits generally increased with age, whilerespiratory tract drugs decreased with age.Prescription or provision of nervous systemdrugs, including mental health medications suchas antidepressants, during physician visits weremost common among women 45-64 years(27.7 per 100 visits). The highest rate of drugprescription or provision was 65.7 per 100 visits,which was for cardiovascular/renal drugs amongwomen 75 years and older. Among females under15 years, the lowest rate of drug prescription orprovision (0.9 per 100 visits) was for cardiovas- cular/renal drugs, and the highest rate was forrespiratory tract drugs (31.3 per 100 visits). 1 Hing E, Cherry DK, Woodwell DA.

In 2006, the gender distribution of organdonors was nearly even (6,993 males and 6,589females), though most of the organs donated byliving people were from women (58.5 percent).Since 1988, there have been 391,233 transplants. The need for donated organs greatly exceeds their availability, so waiting lists for organs aregrowing. As of February 16, 2007, there were94,692 people awaiting a life-saving organtransplant. Females were 41.9 percent of thosepatients, but made up only 37.3 percent of thosewho received a transplant in 2006. 1Among women waiting for an organ transplant,46.5 percent were White, 29.6 percent were Black, and 16.1 percent were Hispanic. The kidney wasin highest demand, with 29,437 females awaitingthis organ as of February 16, 2007. The number of organs donated remained roughly static from 1990-2003. In 2003, thedonation community began to work togetherthrough the Organ Donation BreakthroughCollaborative and other grassroots efforts toincrease donation. In 2004, donations increasedby an unprecedented 12 percent over the previousyear, and in 2005 they increased by another12 percent; in 2005-06, the number droppedslightly but was still well above 2002 levels. Oneof the challenges of organ donation is obtainingconsent from the donor family or legal surrogate.Consent rates may vary due to religious percep- tions, poor communication between health careproviders and grieving families, perceivedinequities in the allocation system, and lack ofknowledge of the wishes of the deceased. 2 The Organ Procurement and T ransplantation Network and the Scientific Registry of T ransplantRecipients are managed by HRSA's HealthcareSystems Bureau (HSB). Other HSB programsinclude: the National Marrow Donor Program,the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank, theNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,and the Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protec-tion Act Program. 1 2006 Data are from January 1-November 30, 2006. 2 2003 OPTN/SRTR Annual Report: Transplant Data 1992- 2002.

HRSA's Office of Women's Health (OWH) coordinates many efforts that address women's health across their lifespan.A key project of OWH is the Bright Futures forWomen's Health and Wellness (BFWHW) initia-tive, which provides materials for young women(adolescents) and adult women on topics such asphysical activity and healthy eating, emotionalwellness, and maternal wellness. These and otherconsumer-friendly resources, including databooks and research reports, can be found on theOWH Web site (www.hrsa.gov/womenshealth). The HRSA Web site (www.hrsa.gov) provides information about each of HRSA's bureaus andoffices, several of which administer programs thatdirectly affect women's health and access to healthcare. For example, Maternal and Child Health Bureaus (MCHB) administers the MCH Block Grant, a Federal-State partnership to improve thehealth of all mothers and children. MCHB alsoworks to end violence and bullying in schoolsthrough the Stop Bullying Now! Campaignonline at www .stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov. HRSA programs facilitate partnerships to advance women's health. The Bureau of HealthProfessions regularly assesses the health work- force, conducting numerous studies of capacityand diversity in health professions in whichwomen predominate, such as nursing. The Office of Rural Health Policy has partnered with OWH to adapt BFWHW Physical Activity and HealthyEating materials for young women (adolescents)and adult women in rural communities. The HIV/AIDS Bureau addresses the needs of women living with HIV/AIDS through all of its programs,especially Part D (formerly Title IV) of the RyanWhite Program, which targets services to women,infants, children, youth, and their families. The Healthcare Systems Bureau oversees a variety of programs that affect access to lifesaving proceduresfor women, including the Organ Procurement andT ransplantation Network, described on page 74,as well as the 340B Drug Pricing Program, andHill-Burton Free and Reduced Cost Health Care. The Bureau of Primary Health Care manages the Health Center Program, which funds a nationalnetwork of more than 1,000 health center granteesat over 3,800 comprehensive, primary health careservice delivery sites comprised of communityhealth centers, migrant health centers, health carefor the homeless health centers, and public housingprimary care health centers. These health centersdeliver preventive and primary care services topatients regardless of their ability to pay; chargesfor health care services are set according to income.Almost 40 percent of the patients treated at health centers have no insurance coverage and others haveinadequate coverage. In 2001, President Bush announced a Health Centers Initiative to increase access to health carein 1,200 communities through new or expandedhealth center sites. Since then, HRSA has awarded900 grants to create new health center sites orexpand operations at existing centers, and thenumber of patients has risen from 10.3 million in2001 to an estimated 14.8 million in 2006. Finally, HRSA's Health Disparities Collabora- tives (HDCs) were developed to transformprimary health care practices to improve qualityand eliminate health disparities. The HDCs havefocused on diabetes, asthma, depression, cardio-vascular disease, cancer screening/planned care,finance/redesign, prevention, diabetes prevention,perinatal/patient safety, and oral health. Over85 percent of health centers have participated inthe HDCs as of April 2007.
