As we enter the most dry, cold, and windy time of year, it is helpful to help support our immune function by giving our digestion a kickstart. We are what we eat, and the cleanse offers us insight into our food cravings, eating habits, and overall health. This is especially important after the holidays where many of us overindulge and begin to feel sluggish and slow and winter colds and flu can take hold. Create a warm, cozy feeling to sustain you for the remainder of the winter so when spring arrives your set to enjoy all the spring has to offer. You'll also gain tools, community, and support for helping you live a lighter, brighter life inside and out.

Tuesday through Thursday, all three meals will consist of kitchari, which is a rice and lentil dish cooked with a specific blend of spices. Don't worry, this is easier than it sounds.
