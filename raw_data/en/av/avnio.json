Not only does meditation in kids lead to better sleep, less anxiety, better self-esteem, increased focus, and decreased stress it ALSO gives them life skills they can use throughout adulthood. Benefits - Better Sleep - Less Anxiety - Better Self Esteem - Increased Focus - Decreased Stress A few tips for getting started with meditation. 1. Remember, it is something you or your kids must practice being good at. A general rule is kids have 1 minute of attention span per year old they are- for example a 6-year-old should have a 6-minute attention span for meditating. This doesn't mean you can only do 6 minutes, it means you may have to remind them to come back to the practice. 2. consistency is key, the more you practice, the better it will go. 3. Try different techniques because different kids like different things- just like most things in life. If these techniques do not work, or do not work as well as you would like them to, get your child's nervous system checked by a pediatric chiropractor to help their body relax out of fight or flight.
