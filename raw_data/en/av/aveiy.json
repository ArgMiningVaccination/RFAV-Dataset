LEMLEY & MARK P. MCKENNA ABSTRACT New technologies disrupt existing industries. They always have, and they probably always will. Incumbents don't like their industries to be disrupted. And they often rely on intellectual property, unfair competition, or related legal doctrines as tools to prevent disruptive entry. What that means is that many of the cases in these areas are really about whether competition from new players can force incumbents to change their business models, generally to the advantage of particular players and the detriment of others. These cases are, in an important sense, all unfair competition cases; they are about the ways in which the law permits new entrants to compete with incumbents.

As a result, courts react quite differently to disruptive technology or business models in different cases. Our goal in this Article is to address the broader question of when competition by market disruption is \"unfair.\" In our view, courts are often overly receptive to market disruption arguments. Courts should intervene to prevent market disruption only when they have very good reasons\u2014reasons connected to the fundamental policy concerns of the legal systems called upon to prevent the disruption. To achieve that goal, we must know what the legitimate ends of the asserted law are. Sometimes the legal doctrine used to prevent market disruption is one\u2014like unjust enrichment, interference with economic advantage, or unfair competition\u2014that doesn't have a clear animating principle. We think those doctrines should be disfavored, and courts should employ them only when they are tied to some independent metric for deciding whether the defendant's \u00a9 2020 Mark A.

They always have, and they probably always will. The printing press put quite a few monks out of the manuscript hand-lettering business.1 Railroads displaced much (though by no means all) of the barge and shipping industry. Long-haul trucks in turn displaced railroads, and now self-driving trucks threaten to displace the drivers of those trucks. The Internet and smart phones disrupted any number of industries, from camera makers and travel agents to watchmakers and keychain-flashlight sellers. Solar panels are democratizing the production of electric power, much to the chagrin of electric utilities. The sharing economy is disrupting many service industries, from taxis to hotels. And new technologies like 3-D printing, robotics, and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") may soon displace workers in a variety of industries, including law. Incumbents don't like innovations disrupting their industries. As Niccolo Machiavelli wrote: [I]t ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may well do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.2 Incumbents frequently want to stop, or at least limit, the use of new technologies.3 And they often reach for intellectual property (\"IP\"), unfair competition, or related legal doctrines as tools to do so. The purported justification for stopping or limiting the use of new technologies follows a familiar pattern: incumbents claim that the new entrants undermine fundamental values of the existing industry and make the world worse off.4 If the new 1For a fascinating discussion of how the printing press disrupted writing and the scientific process, see Jeremiah Dittmar & Skipper Seabold, Gutenberg's Moving Type Propelled Europe Towards the Scientific Revolution , LSE BUS.

Lemley, Is the Sky Falling on the Content Industries? , 9 J. TELECOMM . & HIGH TECH. L. 125 (2011) (chronicling the continuous reinvention of the music business as the player piano, the gramophone, radio, home taping, and Internet piracy developed; of the motion picture business as television, the VCR, and DVRs developed; and of publishing when books first seemed threatened by the photocopier); Barry Ritholtz, Opinion, Uber Is Blamed for the Mistakes of New York's Leaders , BLOOMBERG (Aug. 6, 2018, 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 75 technology is allowed to proliferate, incumbents often argue, no one will ever make music (or movies, or any other creative or inventive output) again. Those claims are almost always wrong. The process of what political economist Joseph Schumpeter called \"creative destruction\"5 is responsible for many of the most significant advances in the history of capitalism.6 But even if the world usually benefits from disruptive new technologies, incumbents rarely do.7 New technologies frequently shake up the market, and the winners of the resulting competition tend to be new companies, not old ones. At the least, the old ones must spend time and money rearranging their affairs to account for the new technological reality. Given this dynamic, many IP, unfair competition, and related cases are really about whether competition from new players can force incumbents to change their business models. These cases are, in an important sense, all unfair competition cases; they are about the ways in which the law permits new entrants to compete with incumbents.8 Unfortunately, we lack any comprehensive way of thinking about legal claims as a response to market disruption. As a result, courts react quite differently to disruptive technology or business models in different cases. As one example, consider IP cases brought against new technologies. Sometimes courts find that the disruptive technology infringes existing IP rights. New technology might fit within the legal definition of a prior invention, appropriately construed.9 Sometimes the technology itself doesn't infringe any prior invention but enables third parties to more easily infringe IP rights and is deemed illegal for that reason.10 One notable example in the copyright context involves digital media 11:31 AM), https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-08-06/uber-is-blamed-for- the-mistakes-of-new-york-s-leaders (chronicling efforts to rebuff ride-hailing services disrupting the medallion-limited taxis in New York City by introducing, of all things, a fixed number of permitted Uber and Lyft vehicles). 5JOSEPH A. SCHUMPETER , CAPITALISM , SOCIALISM AND DEMOCRACY 81-86 (Harper & Row 1975) (1942) (defining creative destruction as the \"process of industrial mutation . . . that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within , incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one\" (footnote omitted)). 6See, e.g., id. at 83 (describing effects of creative destruction on farming, iron, steel, power production, and transportation industries). 7See, e.g., Reihan Salam, Taxi-Driver Suicides Are a Warning , THE ATLANTIC (June 5, 2018), https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/06/taxi-driver-suicides-are-a-warn ing/561926/ (reporting on taxi drivers committing suicide as Uber, Lyft, and other services threaten their livelihoods). 8Cf. Sara K. Stadler, Copyright as Trade Regulation , 155 U. PA. L. REV. 899, 927-42 (2007) (discussing law of unfair competition in copyright context). 9E.g., Laser Alignment, Inc. v. Woodruff & Sons, Inc., 491 F.2d 866, 869-70, 873-74 (7th Cir. 1974) (holding that contractors using a laser level for laying sewer pipe had infringed upon a patented method for using a collimated beam of light for laying sewer pipe). 10See, e.g., Dawson Chem. Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U.S. 176, 200, 202, 223 (1980) (interpreting 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271 as codifying common law compromise to enable \"patentees to exercise control over nonstaple articles used in their inventions,\" but not over staple articles, 76 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 technology, much of which courts held illegal because early uses frequently infringed copyrights.11 In other cases, courts reject attempts to use IP or other rights to prevent market disruption, either by interpreting legal rights in ways that render the new technology noninfringing or by using doctrinal release valves like fair use.12 Other areas of law reflect similarly mixed feelings about market disruption. Business tort claims like unjust enrichment and unfair competition\u2014and even nominally procompetitive laws like antitrust\u2014are often asserted by companies with a vested interest in restricting a competitor's new technology.13 New entrants bring antitrust and unfair competition cases against incumbents that try to prevent competition, but incumbents upset by market disruption also bring such cases against entrants. Whether antitrust or unfair competition laws encourage or inhibit market disruption depends critically on what kinds of competition courts deem \"unfair.\" Our goal in this Article is to address the broader question of when competition by market disruption is \"unfair\" in a way the law should forbid. Sometimes the legal doctrine invoked to prevent market disruption is one\u2014like unjust enrichment, interference with economic advantage, or unfair competition\u2014that doesn't have a clear animating principle (at least anymore). Other doctrines, like antitrust and IP, have clearer purposes. Perhaps ironically, courts have found ways in the former types of cases to anchor claims\u2014often by tying them to some independent metric for deciding whether the defendant's conduct is unfair or and applying this rule to find no patent misuse where the holder of a patent for a weed-killing process brought suit against manufacturers of a chemical used therein that had no other known use). But see Husky Injection Molding Sys. Ltd. v. R & D Tool & Eng'g Co., 291 F.3d 780, 782-83, 789 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (holding that maker of unpatented molds and carrier plates with no other use than serving as replacements in a patented apparatus had not contributorily infringed). 11See, e.g., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 919 (2005) (holding that \"one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties\"). Full disclosure: one of us (Lemley) represented Grokster in that case. But cf. Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 445, 456 (1984) (\"Sony's sale of [the Betamax] to the general public does not constitute contributory infringement of respondent's copyrights\" because it is \"capable of substantial noninfringing uses,\" such as copying Mr. Roger's Neighborhood for later viewing). 12See, e.g., Sony Corp ., 464 U.S. at 456 (refusing to find Sony secondarily liable for its sales of Betamax because it was capable of substantial noninfringing uses, including private time-shifting, which was fair use); Cartoon Network LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F.3d 121, 123 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that cable company's remote storage DVR system did not violate reproduction or public-performance rights of copyright owner). 13See infra Sections I.B, II.A (describing different types of business tort claims incumbents bring to insulate themselves from competition and how courts evaluate those claims). 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 77 unjust. But IP law has lagged behind, rarely even recognizing that cases of alleged infringement are often really challenges to market disruption. We argue that courts should evaluate legal challenges to market disruption by testing the fit between the goals of the statute and its use in a particular case. We suggest a test that helps separate legitimate IP claims from cases of pure market disruption. Drawn from the antitrust-injury doctrine,14 our test would treat market disruption as relevant to an IP case only if the disruption is traceable to the act of infringement itself. If the plaintiff would suffer the same injury from a noninfringing market intervention, that injury cannot be evidence of IP infringement.15 Requiring a unique, causal connection between the infringing nature of the defendant's work and the disruption of the market will allow us to separate cases in which infringement interferes with the purposes of the law from those in which the incumbent just uses IP as a tool to protect its market. It will, in other words, give us a metric by which to decide when disruption is unfair. 14An antitrust injury is one that harms not merely the competitor but also the competitive process. See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489 (1977) (\"Plaintiffs must prove antitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.\"); Rambus Inc. v. FTC, 522 F.3d 456, 464 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (\"Even an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another does not, without more, state a claim under the federal antitrust laws.\" (quoting Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 225 (1993))). In Rambus, for example, a technology company participated in a standard-setting process while failing to disclose its IP interests in technologies that became the basis for a standard; this nondisclosure likely violated the organization's rules and enabled Rambus to later charge higher prices than it could have charged but for the deception. Rambus, 522 F.3d at 463-64. Yet the court held as it did because the facts showed that in the world that would have existed but for Rambus's deception, [the standard-setting organization] would have standardized the very same technologies, Rambus's alleged deception cannot be said to have had an effect on competition in violation of the antitrust laws; [thus, the organization's] loss of an opportunity to seek favorable licensing terms is not as such an antitrust harm. Id. at 466-67. We are skeptical that the court was right about its assessment of the facts in Rambus. See 1 HERBERT HOVENKAMP ET AL ., IP AND ANTITRUST : AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES APPLIED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW \u00a7 35.05 (3d ed. 2018) (criticizing analysis in Rambus). But the principle that only harm to competition and not merely disadvantage to a particular competitor is actionable is a sound one. 15Professors Christina Bohannan and Herbert Hovenkamp have made a similar proposal, albeit for different reasons. See CHRISTINA BOHANNAN & HERBERT HOVENKAMP , CREATION WITHOUT RESTRAINT , at xiv (2012) (suggesting improving IP regimes through a judge-made IP injury requirement); Christina Bohannan & Herbert Hovenkamp, IP and Antitrust: Reformation and Harm , 51 B.C. L. REV. 905, 980 (2010) (\"In IP law, provable harm should relate to the incentive to innovate, just as in antitrust provable harm relates to the incentive to compete.\"); Paul R. Gugliuzza, IP Injury and the Institutions of Patent Law , 98 IOWA L. REV. 747, 748-50 (2013) (reviewing B OHANNAN & HOVENKAMP , supra). 78 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 That metric will be hard to apply in practice,16 particularly in cases in which resolution hinges on whether the relevant legal rights should be defined in a way that considers the defendant's conduct infringing. But focusing courts' attention on the connection between the disruption and fundamental policy concerns is better than not having a guiding principle at all. In Part I we discuss the various ways IP and other tort cases are really about market disruption and the efforts of incumbents to prevent competition. In Part II we discuss how different legal doctrines have responded to those claims, while IP law has lagged behind. Finally, in Part III we offer some ideas for how to assess when disruption is unfair and what to do if it is. I. MARKET DISRUPTION A. Legal Regulation of Market Disruption 1. Price and Entry Regulation Incumbents often use regulation to insulate themselves from competition. A long literature discusses the history of incumbents warping regulations originally intended to check their power into tools for protecting themselves against disruptive entry.17 Sometimes that protection has been explicit. The government prevented companies from entering the telephone business for most of the twentieth century on the ground that, because telephony was a network 16We discuss some applications infra Section III.B (describing how IP injury doctrine might have been applied to lawsuits against Grokster, Google's use of Java for Android, and third-party use of Facebook data). 17See generally ROBERT A. LEONE, WHO PROFITS: WINNERS, LOSERS, AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION 4 (1986) (explaining and illustrating nonmarket business strategies, including by recounting one regulatory waiver that created $5 billion of value for a single firm); CHARLES E. LINDBLOM, POLITICS AND MARKETS: THE WORLD'S POLITICAL ECONOMIC SYSTEMS 170-88 (1977) (characterizing political and economic systems as symbiotic and yet also in opposition, with businesspeople opportunistically seeking to lobby politicians and regulators to extract rents); G. RICHARD SHELL, MAKE THE RULES OR YOUR RIVALS WILL (2004) (collecting examples of businesses successfully using regulatory processes and legal actions to cut down their competition and entrench their own market positions); David P. Baron, Strategy Beyond Markets: A Step Back and a Look Forward , in STRATEGY BEYOND MARKETS 1 (John M. de Figueiredo et al. eds., 2016) (summarizing state of literature on \"nonmarket\" business strategy that uses politics and policy for competitive advantage and applying the literature's lessons to understand contemporary cases like Uber). 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 79 good,18 the market would operate most efficiently with a regulated monopoly.19 Many states still treat electric power20 and natural gas21 the same way. And various professional-licensing groups control entry into their fields.22 Once the government controls entry, it generally also needs to control price. Ostensibly that's to prevent the monopoly from gouging its consumers, since the government has mandated that the monopoly face no competition. But over time those price controls can easily become floors rather than ceilings, discouraging the incumbents from investing in cost-saving technology or from passing any savings from such investment on to customers.23 Regulations in those industries and others prevented entry by innovative challengers for years. Telephone technology improved by leaps and bounds once 18See CARL SHAPIRO & HAL R.

REV. 392, 406-12 (1966) (showing that rate-regulated firms lack incentives to reduce costs). 80 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 competitors could challenge AT&T's monopoly.24 The story for electric power is a bit more mixed, but allowing competitive electricity providers has spurred at least some innovation in the supply of electric power.25 Disruptive entrants in the sharing or gig economies pose a variety of new challenges to entrenched industries. Cities and states that regulate hotels and taxis as quasi-public franchises resisted (and still resist!) the idea of opening those markets to competition by the likes of Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb.26 Some countries still ban those services.27 But as those once-closed markets have opened to competition, the resulting disruption has generally benefited consumers.28 Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb present challenges for the larger economy and the legal system,29 and they affect existing businesses and third parties in somewhat surprising ways. But whatever the implications of those changes, it's hard to argue we would be better off returning to a regulated-taxi monopoly or forbidding owners from renting their homes. The same turns out to be true of 24See Rosemary Batt & Owen Darbishire, Deregulation and Restructuring in Telecommunications Services in the United States and Germany , in LABOR, BUSINESS, AND CHANGE IN GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES 17, 18 (Kirsten S. Wever ed., 2001) (citing, in the United States, \"significant cost reductions in equipment and long-distance service; dramatic improvements in response time, quality, and speed of transmission; and diversity of product offerings\" following proliferation of low-cost competitors to AT&T). 25See Borenstein & Bushnell, supra note 20, at 437 (describing mixed results).

Should You Pay a Fee to Ride? , N.Y. TIMES, Dec. 26, 2017, at A1 (summarizing studies showing that Uber increases congestion and discussing cities' responses). 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 81 other regulations that controlled entry and prices in markets ranging from optometry to title insurance to dentistry to civil engineering and even to law.30 Many of the entry-preventing regulations seemed like a good idea when they were implemented. They served social goals. AT&T's monopoly stopped the development of incompatible telephone networks that couldn't communicate with each other.31 Power company monopolies were thought necessary to spur investment in a wide electric grid.32 And taxi regulations theoretically served public safety by preventing unscrupulous people from robbing customers\u2014and unscrupulous customers from robbing cabbies.33 But in each case they also reduced consumer choice, reduced the incentive to invest in quality, and prevented full price competition.34 Worse, they discouraged innovations that would have (and eventually did) make those technologies cheaper and better. If it wasn't possible to reap the benefits of entry and price regulations without incurring those costs, we would have a difficult policy dilemma. But experience has shown that there were ways to achieve those goals (interoperable standards in telephony, for instance) that didn't require the elimination of competition. We 30See, e.g., N.C. State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs v. FTC, 574 U.S. 494, 502-15 (2015) (examining legality of state regulatory board for dentistry whose members are practicing dentists); FTC v. Ticor Title Ins.

Joskow & Richard Schmalensee, Incentive Regulation for Electric Utilities , 4 YALE J. REG. 1, 3-5 (1986) (recounting traditional rationale for monopoly regulation). 33See GRAHAM RUSSELL GAO HODGES, TAXI!: A SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE NEW YORK CITY CABDRIVER 130-35 (2007) (describing incremental increases in regulation to combat crime, discrimination, and other issues in New York City). 34For telephony, see Nicholas Economides, Katja Seim & V. Brian Viard, Quantifying the Benefits of Entry into Local Phone Service , 39 RAND J. ECON. 699, 725 (2008) (finding welfare gains from firm differentiation and choice, though not from retail price). For taxis and Uber, theory strongly suggests that Uber's entry would reduce cost, as foregone compliance costs and increased supply should act to reduce cost and price. But cf. Vsevolod Salnikov et al., OpenStreetCab: Exploiting Taxi Mobility Patterns in New York City to Reduce Commuter Costs 2 (Mar. 10, 2015) (unpublished manuscript), https://arxiv.org /abs/1503.03021 [https://perma.cc/MR68-95P4] (suggesting that Uber may only be cheaper in NYC for trips that would otherwise cost more than thirty-five dollars per cab).

In evaluating entry regulation, society needs to consider the harm it does by preventing disruptive innovation. 2. Costs and Behavior Regulation Regulation doesn't need to forbid entry\u2014or even to focus on entry\u2014in order to discourage it. Many regulations that govern how companies operate, even if well intentioned, raise the cost of participating in the market. And that cost falls disproportionately on small entrants rather than large incumbents. A requirement that Internet companies detect and block certain types of content, for instance, might require the development and training of a complex AI system at a cost of over $100 million.35 Google can afford to make that investment, but a mom-and-pop startup can't. Other regulations require cars to be sold through a network of independent dealers\u2014no problem if you're an established car company that already has such a network, but not so great if you want to get into the car market.36 As with more overt entry regulations like bans or licensing, these regulations are often set up with the best of intentions and can serve legitimate purposes. We want to keep bad stuff off the Internet, for instance. And car dealerships were designed to ensure that customers had a ready source of parts and service nearby. But many of these regulations outlive their usefulness, as the car dealership rule did once independent repair shops became common. And by imposing costs on new entrants that incumbents have already paid, they raise the cost of entry and therefore discourage disruptive innovation. As with regulations that directly control entry, we need to weigh the costs of behavioral regulation alongside its benefits. But unlike entry bans, which are rarely good for society, behavioral regulation on entrants and incumbents can 35See Cedric Manara, Protecting What We Love About the Internet: Our Efforts to Stop Online Piracy , KEYWORD (Nov. 7, 2018), https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives /public-policy/protecting-what-we-love-about-internet-our-efforts-stop-online-piracy/ [https://perma.cc/5TSK-RYVW] (explaining how much Google pays for its advanced AI technology system).

In Massachusetts, Tesla prevailed in a state court suit enjoining a similar law, and Tesla has filed a federal suit challenging a Michigan prohibition. See Ryan Felton, Tesla Fights Back as Michigan Goes to New Lengths to Shut Company Out , THE GUARDIAN (Oct. 9, 2016, 6:00 AM), https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/tesla-michigan-ban-detroit-lawsuit [https://perma.cc/TLK3-H9CN] (describing legal actions taken by Tesla to fight back against states' prohibitions on Tesla sales); see also Complaint for Declaratory & Injunctive Relief at 19-22, Tesla Motors, Inc. v.

Sept. 22, 2016), ECF No. 1 (asserting grounds for relief under Due Process, Equal Protection, and Dormant Commerce Clause principles). 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 83 sometimes do good. The challenge is assessing which behavioral regulations serve a legitimate health and safety or market-enhancing purpose and which ones just raise rivals' costs and entrench incumbents. We shouldn't ban Lyft from running a ride-sharing service in order to protect taxi incumbents, for example, but it makes sense to impose some licensing and insurance requirements on Lyft drivers to protect passengers and to make sure they comply with antidiscrimination laws.37 We also should consider the impact of ride- sharing services on overall driving and consider ways to encourage more widespread use of public transportation to combat climate change. By contrast, it makes little sense to ban Tesla from selling cars (or Diageo from selling alcohol) in a state because it wants to do so in a store it owns rather than through a multitier franchise system.38 B. Litigation as Entry Regulation Regulation is not the only way incumbent businesses make it hard for entrants to disrupt their markets. Business litigation is also often about market disruption. Plaintiffs often bring business tort claims for interference with prospective economic advantage, unjust enrichment, unfair competition, or antitrust when the injury they are complaining of is not actually injury to competition but injury from competition. Taxi companies, for instance, have sued Uber and Lyft on the theory that their disruptive market entry was itself anticompetitive.39 These suits are at base about feared market disruption. So, too, are many IP suits. As we will see, these antidisruption claims don't always succeed. But when they don't, it's often because some\u2014but not all\u2014legal doctrines have recognized the use of tort law as a means to eliminate competition and have built safeguards against it. 1. Antitrust and Business Torts Antitrust. Antitrust law is designed to protect competition, preventing both collusion among erstwhile competitors and efforts to monopolize a market.40 So 37Nick Grossman envisions increasingly modest entry licenses and increasingly robust, data-driven supervision and penalties during operations. See Nick Grossman, White Paper: Regulation, the Internet Way , DATA-SMART CITY SOLUTIONS (Apr. 8, 2015), https://datasmart. ash.harvard.edu/news/article/white-paper-regulation-the-internet-way-660 [https://perma.cc /38KV-P54L] (\"The big idea at the core of information-era regulation that data is a new regulatory tool, one that can replace permission-based systems (licensing, permitting, etc.).\"). 38Tenn. Wine & Spirits Retailers Ass'n v. Thomas, 139 S. Ct. 2449, 2476 (2019) (invalidating strict regulations on sellers of alcohol in Tennessee). 39See, e.g., Malden Transp., Inc. v. Uber Techs., Inc., 321 F. Supp. 3d 174, 180 (D. Mass. 2018). 40See United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392, 397 (1927) (\"[T]he Sherman [Antitrust Act] and the judicial decisions interpreting it are based upon the assumption that the public interest is best protected . . . by the maintenance of competition.\"). Competition suffers when former competitors agree not to compete. See id. It also suffers when a dominant firm acts to impair a rival or exclude it from the market. See Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 605 n.32 (1985) (defining exclusionary behavior and 84 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 it seems like a tool that will encourage rather than impede market disruption. It should be, and often it is. Challengers can and do use antitrust to break open markets, expose cartels, block mergers that concentrate the industry, and challenge anticompetitive sales and licensing practices. But incumbents have also used antitrust as a tool to target new entrants. Sometimes the complaint is that the entrant is too efficient and the existing market participants can't compete. That was the complaint that mom-and-pop grocery stores lodged against fancy new supermarket chains from the late 1940s to the 1960s, for instance.41 It was the challenge small banks brought against national banking chains.42 It is why taxi companies brought antitrust claims against Uber and Lyft,43 despite the fact that the taxi franchises, not the entrants, are the ones restricting competition. It is what motivates some, though not all, claims of \"predatory pricing\"\u2014an allegation that the defendant is charging customers too little.44 It was used to justify Apple's collusion with book its negative effects). Sherman Act \u00a7 1 bars agreements that unreasonably restrain trade, while \u00a7 2 bars single- or multi-firm conduct that seeks to gain or preserve monopoly power other than by competition on the merits. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-2 (2018). 41E.g., United States v. Von's Grocery Co., 384 U.S. 270, 281 (1966) (White, J., concurring) (agreeing to enjoin merger between two grocery chains where their combined share would have been 8.9% of revenue\u2014just greater than the largest chain's 8%); United States v.

ORG. 651, 652-54 (2019). 42E.g., United States v. Phila. Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 325-26, 330-31 (1963) (citing concerns that the number of independent banks had decreased by 714 to reach 13,460 and enjoining merger between two of Philadelphia's largest banks). 43See, e.g., Transp. 3d Uber Techs., Inc., 312 F. Supp. 3d 209, 214 (D. Mass. 2018). 44The Supreme Court has repeatedly declared that \"predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful.\" Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 226 (1993) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 589 (1986)). In Brooke Group , the Court reasoned that a cigarette seller allegedly pricing its generics below even its own costs in order to force a rival to stop selling generics could not have had a reasonable prospect of recouping its profits and so did not commit predatory pricing under the Robinson-Patman Act. Id. at 233-38; Matsushita Elec. Indus., 475 U.S. at 589 (\"[T]he success of such schemes is inherently uncertain: the short-run loss is definite . . . .\"). No court since has found a defendant guilty of predatory pricing under the Robinson-Patman Act or the Sherman Act. See Aaron S. Edlin, Essay, Stopping Above- Cost Predatory Pricing , 111 Y ALE L.J. 941, 941-42 (2002). In recent years, however, economists and lawyers have argued that welfare-reducing predatory pricing might actually be attempted frequently and even succeed\u2014not least because a monopolizing firm could price below a rival's costs but above its own, drive the rival from the market, and then raise its prices to the monopoly price. See, e.g., id. at 942; Christopher R. Leslie, Predatory Pricing and Recoupment , 113 C OLUM. L. REV. 1695, 1741-44 (2013). For example, an airline facing 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 85 publishers to prevent Amazon from disrupting the publishing industry by lowering prices, for instance.45 And it was the complaint makers of once- separate goods like car radios and spellcheck software made as new cars and word processing programs integrated those features into their products.46 True, those don't fit the classic picture of big incumbents squashing little challengers. It is often the challengers in these cases that end up taking over the market; the antitrust plaintiffs may be the \"small dealers and worthy men\" of a bygone era.47 But those successful new entrants that take over markets are doing so by competing vigorously on the merits\u2014something we want in a market economy. That's not to say that there aren't reasons to be concerned about some structural shifts in the economy towards greater concentration, or that we don't want policies to support local businesses. But giving individual companies the ability a new entrant on one route might decide to undercut the entrant's prices in order to dissuade entry across all of its routes. Cf. United States v. AMR Corp., 335 F.3d 1109, 1111 (10th Cir. 2003) (affirming grant of summary judgment in favor of American Airlines where government alleged airline priced fares on some routes below cost only to charge supracompetitive prices on other routes). And others have sought to expand the law of predatory pricing by eliminating the recoupment requirement altogether. See Lina M. Khan, Amazon's Antitrust Paradox , 126 Y ALE L.J. 710, 756-68 (2017) (detailing limitations of modern recoupment analysis). 45The Second Circuit correctly held Apple and the publishers' collusion illegal despite the argument that antitrust law should encourage efforts to prevent market disruption. United States v. Apple, Inc., 791 F.3d 290, 298 (2d Cir. 2015) (\"[T]he dissent's theory\u2014that the presence of a competitor [like Amazon] justifies a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy\u2014 endorses a concept of marketplace vigilantism that is wholly foreign to the antitrust laws.\").

It will increase concentration by preventing or controlling disruptive startups.48 Unfair Competition . Most states have statutes or common law provisions forbidding unfair competition.49 The Federal Trade Commission also has the power to address unfair competition under Section 5 of the FTC Act.50 But those provisions are often quite vague about what exactly unfair competition is. The California statute, for instance, defines it as \"any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.\"51 Fraud is already illegal, of course, and making \"unlawful\" acts unlawful seems a tad redundant.52 But what exactly is \"unfair\"? The statute doesn't say. And in the absence of a definition of what competition is \"unfair,\" these laws are at particular risk of being used to prevent not unfairness but competition itself. That was true in MacCausland v. Uber Technologies, Inc. ,53 for instance, in which taxi drivers upset that Uber was competing with them sought (unsuccessfully) to have that competition declared unfair.54 Something similar happened with the traditional doctrine of unfair competition in trademark law, which gave parties claims against certain conduct that did not involve use of another's trademark but put tight limits on the sorts of things viewed as unfair competition.55 Over time, those limits went away, leaving an overly broad concept of unfairness that lacked limiting principles.56 Tortious Interference .

By their literal terms, the act of competing with an incumbent for an existing or potential future customer would be unlawful. Even more than the tort of unfair competition, the tort of interference with economic advantage runs the risk of making market disruption unlawful.57 Unjust Enrichment . Unjust enrichment, properly understood, is a remedy for some independently wrongful conduct, not a cause of action in its own right.58 As a remedy, it has value. It allows courts to require disgorgement of profits or tangible things held unjustly, but it only does so if the defendant holds those things in violation of some substantive legal doctrine.59 Nonetheless, some courts have found liability for unjust enrichment as a tort in its own right.60 The problem with treating unjust enrichment as a tort is similar to the problems with unfair competition and tortious interference: it unmoors the claim from any 57Shyam Balganesh suggests that copyright law acts like the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage, giving plaintiffs control over market competition. See Shyamkrishna Balganesh, Copyright as Market Prospect , 166 U. PA. L. REV. 443, 443 (2018). While we agree that there are parallels between the two, we think Balganesh is too willing to accept the idea of control over market prospects in both doctrines. 58See Joel Eichengrun, Remedying the Remedy of Accounting , 60 IND.

The result has been a mess. Plaintiffs use the act to prevent competitors from coming to their web site at all or from collecting information from that site\u2014 even public information not subject to an IP claim.66 Courts have issued conflicting interpretations of the statute\u2014not just a circuit split but fundamental disagreements even within the same court.67 A recent study of CFAA litigation found that the act was primarily used not to target computer hacking, but to target competitors using a company's website in ways it didn't like.68 Noncompetition Agreements . A final category of business tort that is often used to prevent innovative competition is not really a tort at all but (at least nominally) a breach of contract claim. Employers frequently require that their employees promise not to work for a competitor or start a competing business. Estimates are that eighteen percent of the U.S. workforce is bound not to take a competing job when they leave.69 That includes not only inventive or management employees with possible access to trade secrets and business strategies but also line workers at fast food restaurants and bakeries.70 Employees are generally given no choice but to agree to these noncompetes.71 And while the risk of losing trade secrets may justify some restrictions on a particular employee's work for a competitor, noncompete agreements aren't limited to those circumstances.72 They provide an effective way for incumbents 66See, e.g., Facebook, Inc. v.

IP as Market Regulator Perhaps the most significant legal tool used to regulate disruptive entry is one not normally thought of as a business tort law at all: IP law. As with antitrust, this might seem ironic. After all, IP law is supposed to encourage innovation. But like other legal doctrines, IP can be and often is used not to promote innovation but to prevent disruptive innovation. Copyright Law. The potential of IP to protect markets from disruption is most evident in copyright law. From the late 1990s through the Supreme Court's 2005 decision in Grokster,73 music copyright owners brought a series of cases against technologies that enabled digital filesharing.74 According to the labels, those technologies posed a mortal threat to the music industry. The story is a familiar one.75 Time and time again, content owners have insisted that, if some new technology was allowed to proliferate, no one would ever create new music, movies, portraits, or whatever content was at issue.76 The threats in the first decades of the twentieth century were the player piano and the gramophone. John Philip Sousa wrote an article, The Menace of Mechanical Music,77 in which he argued that those infernal devices were a \"threat to his livelihood, to the entire body politic, and to 'musical taste' itself . . strip . soulful live performances.\"78 Sousa articulated an argument that is going to sound familiar to anyone in the copyright industry: Do they not realize that if the accredited composers, who have come into vogue by reason of merit and labor, are refused a just reward for their efforts, a condition is almost sure to arise where all incentive to further creative work is lacking, and compositions will no longer flow from their pens . . . ? What, then, of the playing and talking machines?79 In other words, without some way for musicians to continue to get paid as they had been paid before (by selling sheet music), no one would write music. 73Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v.

Singing will no longer be a fine accomplishment; vocal exercises, so important a factor in the curriculum of physical culture, will be out of vogue! Then what of the national throat? Will it not weaken? What of the national chest? Will it not shrink?82 Later, it was the photocopier that threatened books and other print content.83 Next, the VCR promised to destroy the movie and television industries. As Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America, told Congress, \"[T]he VCR [was] to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone.\"84 DVRs were accused of being an even bigger threat to the advertising-supported TV model, because they would enable easy commercial skipping.85 Digital audio tapes were such a threat to radio that the music industry persuaded Congress to create a compulsory licensing scheme that effectively scuttled DAT technology.86 Then it was MP3 80See id. at 281. 81See id. 82Id. 83Melville Nimmer, the leading copyright scholar, wrote with respect to the photocopier that \"the day may not be far off when no one need purchase books.\" Copying v.

Digital music spelled doom for CD sales even as illegal music sites were shut down. iTunes replaced CD sales, changing how people bought music, away from albums and toward singles, and also reinvigorating back catalogs. More recently, streaming services have dramatically affected purchasing of recorded music; people now buy music services rather than music itself.94 That doesn't mean artists don't get paid, but it certainly changes which intermediaries get paid and how much. That same phenomenon holds across a variety of copyright contexts. Netflix didn't kill the at-home movie market, but it certainly disrupted Blockbuster's rental model. More recently, Netflix and Amazon have disrupted the vertically integrated structure that has tied video content and distribution together, delivering content directly to consumers without it being bundled with Internet service. Content owners get paid\u2014and in many cases significantly more\u2014but existing intermediaries might not. Not surprisingly, parties with strong interests in existing arrangements have often invoked copyright law to protect against the effects of new technologies or business models. They do this because it works. As Mike Carrier has shown, copyright enforcement against disruptive innovation can create a \"wasteland\" of innovation in that space.95 Take, for example, American Broadcasting Cos. v. Aereo, Inc .96 Once upon a time, consumers placed antennas on their own houses to receive local broadcast content without payment. When Congress became concerned that cable companies might cut broadcasters out, it required the cable companies to carry the broadcast channels and to pay for their content.97 That resolution looked like a win for both parties\u2014it provided a high-quality distribution pathway for television, and cable companies would both pay broadcasters for the privilege 93Id. at 485. 94See, e.g., Jon Caramanica, New Kind of Pop Star Took Over in 2018 , N.Y.

Aereo sold a service that allowed its subscribers to watch television programs over the Internet on a delay of just a few seconds from the time the programs were broadcast over the air.99 When a subscriber wanted to watch a show that was currently airing, she would \"visit[] Aereo's website and select[], from a list of the local programming, the show [s]he wished to see,\" at which point \"one of Aereo's servers select[ed] an antenna, which it dedicate[ed] to the use of that subscriber (and that subscriber alone) for the duration of the selected show.\"100 To convey the signal to the subscriber, [a] transcoder translate[d] the signals received into data that c[ould] be transmitted over the Internet. . . . [R]ather than directly send the data to the subscriber, a server save[d] the data in a subscriber-specific folder on Aereo's hard drive. In other words, Aereo's system create[d] a subscriber-specific copy\u2014that is, . seconds of programming ha[d] been saved, Aereo's server beg[an] to stream the saved copy of the show to the subscriber over the Internet. . . . The streaming continue[d], a mere few seconds behind the over-the-air broadcast, until the subscriber ha[d] received the entire show.101 Subscribers were able to watch the streamed broadcast on any Internet- connected device and from any location.102 Streaming continued, on delay of a few seconds, until the subscriber received the entire show, after which the subscriber-specific copy was not retained.103 Importantly (at least under copyright law as it existed when Aereo was created), every stream was from a dedicated copy; if multiple subscribers wanted to watch the same show, then Aereo used two separate antennas to save two distinct copies and stream the shows through two separate transmissions, each from the subscriber's personal copy.104 The system was one-to-one, not one-to-many. ABC and other television content owners sued Aereo, alleging that the retransmissions of over-the-air broadcasts via the individual antennas were public performances of the broadcasts because they \"communicate[d] [the broadcasts] by any device or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they [were] sent.\"105 98The original promise to consumers was that because they paid for cable they would get content without commercials, though that proved to be illusory. 99Aereo, 573 U.S. at 436-37. 100Id. at 436.

It was about the fact that Aereo's model\u2014actually allowing people to use the content owners' own free broadcasts\u2014threatened the economic models of the very cable companies that Congress feared a generation ago would disrupt the broadcast companies' models. Other copyright cases seek to prop up existing business models by using copyright in one work to preserve market dominance in a related market not protected by the copyrighted work. Many of these cases involve interoperability between components. In Sega Enterprises LTD v. Accolade, Inc.107 and Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp. ,108 for example, the plaintiffs sought to use claims of copyright (and in Sega trademark as well) over interface components to prevent competitors from making compatible devices\u2014either video games that played on the Sega game console or compatible consoles that could play games designed for the Sony PlayStation.109 The goal of those claims was not to protect the copyrighted work itself but to use the copyright in an interface component to keep control over other, more important parts of the work not protected by copyright. While the Ninth Circuit rejected those efforts, the Federal Circuit unfortunately allowed a similar overreach in Oracle America, Inc. v. Google Inc. ,110 ironically while purporting to apply Ninth Circuit law.111 Other IP Doctrines. Patent and trademark law can also be used to target disruptive entry. Qualcomm, for instance, has aggressively asserted its portfolio of standard-essential patents and ignored its obligations to license those patents on reasonable terms in an effort to keep control over wireless telephone standards.112 Qualcomm is abusing patent rights to try to obtain market control that a proper understanding of those rights wouldn't provide.113 Pharmaceutical companies sometimes use \"product lifecycle management\" to extend the effective life of their patents, either by building a fence of weak follow-on 106Perhaps ironically, digital antenna technology has improved sufficiently in recent years that consumers are increasingly able to receive that high-quality signal the (semi) old- fashioned way. 107977 F.2d 1510 Cir. 1992).

The point of trademark law is to prevent consumer confusion. We have argued elsewhere that confusion must be about something that matters.115 Attracting a consumer's attention by deceit can sometimes, if rarely, be the sort of confusion that matters. But the doctrine doesn't expressly require materiality, and a number of courts have found initial interest confusion in ordinary advertising designed merely to attract attention rather than to confuse.116 That misunderstands the purpose of the confusion requirement in trademark law. As the Sixth Circuit explained in Groeneveld Transport Efficiency, Inc. v. Lubecore International, Inc.117 when properly rejecting the doctrine: [W]hat appears to concern Groeneveld is not so much initial-interest confusion , but initial interest, period. Groeneveld, in other words, simply does not want its customers to become interested in Lubecore as a potential competitor and possibly switch over. We cannot ascribe any other interpretation to Groeneveld's rather startling claim that evidence of diverted sales and declining revenues, which are the normal signs of a 114For discussion of these efforts, see Michael A.

But Groeneveld cannot get any help from trade-dress law in suppressing lawful competition.118 Other trademark and design patent cases are filed against producers of spare parts, independent repair service providers, and resellers of genuine trademarked parts.119 The goal of these cases is to protect the IP owner's market against competition\u2014in many cases competition from the IP owner's own goods. And trademark owners also sue competitors who run ads on Internet search engines targeted to customers who search for their products. The goals of those suits are generally not to prevent confusion itself but instead to prevent competitors from attracting the customer's attention to a competing product.120 II. THE LAW'S RESPONSE TO MARKET DISRUPTION CLAIMS In this Part, we consider the various ways courts evaluate market disruption lawsuits. As we will see, business tort doctrines have largely evolved to be skeptical of those claims, while IP's treatment of market disruption has been much more uneven. A. Business Torts and Market Disruption Unfair Competition. As we noted in Part I, unfair competition doesn't have a standard definition of what is unfair, allowing plaintiffs to treat the very act of competition as unfair in many cases. Some courts have sought to address this problem by tying unfair competition to specific substantive standards. In California, for instance, an unfair competition claim brought by a competitor rather than a consumer must meet the substantive standards of antitrust law.121 118Id. at 519. 119See, e.g., Leah Chan Grinvald & Ofer Tur-Sinai, Intellectual Property Law and the Right to Repair , 88 FORDHAM L. REV. 63, 67 (2019) (discussing this). 120See Stacey L. Dogan & Mark A. Lemley, Trademarks and Consumer Search Costs on the Internet , 41 HOUS. L. REV. 777, 780 (2004) (discussing these suits and noting that \"courts have increasingly shifted the focus of infringement analysis away from consumer confusion and toward a more generalized inquiry into whether a challenged use diverts attention away from the trademark holder\"); Eric Goldman, Deregulating Relevancy in Internet Trademark Law, 54 EMORY L.J. 507, 562-65 (2005) (providing examples of cases addressing \"diversion\" when the customer's attention is attracted to a competing product). 121See Cel-Tech Commc'ns, Inc. v. L.A. Cellular Tel. Co., 973 P.2d 527, 544 (Cal. 1999) (\"When a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a direct competitor's 'unfair' act or practice invokes section 17200, the word 'unfair' in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.\"). But cf. Portney v. CIBA Vision Corp., 593 (C.D. Cal. BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 That leaves open some tricky definitional issues. And it may mean that, at least for competitor plaintiffs, the \"unfair\" prong of California's unfair competition law has no more independent force than the \"unlawful\" or \"fraudulent\" prongs.122 But it is at least an effort to find substantive standards to define what is unfair and, therefore, to reduce the risk that the law will be turned against disruptive technologies that aim to compete on the merits. Tortious Interference . A similar problem bedevils tortious interference doctrine. Competition often interferes with a competitor's actual or prospective business advantage. The law itself doesn't explain when that competition qualifies as tortious. Fortunately, courts have often recognized this problem. As with unfair competition, courts in tortious interference cases generally require that the interfering conduct be \"wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.\"123 As with antitrust, courts have sometimes created a zone of injury doctrine, requiring that the plaintiff show that it was an intended beneficiary of the substantive duty the defendant breached.124 Courts also create a privilege of fair competition that the tort cannot abridge.125 And they provide procedural protections by requiring the court to determine the wrongful conduct and scope of privilege as a matter of law, rather than giving the issue to the jury.126 By contrast, interference with existing contracts is easier to prove than is interference with the mere prospect of a contract: \"[A] broader range of privilege to interfere is recognized when the relationship or economic advantage interfered with is only prospective.\"127 This makes sense\u2014breach of contract is counterclaims under California's Unfair Competition Law to proceed despite dismissing defendant's antitrust counterclaims). 122Seen another way, courts have suggested the \"fraudulent\" or \"unlawful\" prongs may have broader content, but that Cel-Tech's test for unfairness at least covers a set of antitrust- like \"anticompetitive practices,\" including those that were at issue in the case. See Davis v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 697, 707 (Ct. App. 2009) (summarizing the \"split of authority on this question among the Courts of Appeal [in California]\"). 123Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., 902 P.2d 740, 751 (Cal. 1995) (holding that plaintiff must prove that defendant \"not only knowingly interfered with the plaintiff's expectancy, but engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself\"). 124See Speakers of Sport, Inc. v. ProServ, Inc., 178 F.3d 862, 867-68 (7th Cir. 1999). 125PMC, Inc. v. Saban Entm't, Inc., 52 Cal. Rptr. 2d 877, 891 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"Plaintiff's cause of action for interference with prospective economic advantage is defeated by the competition privilege.\"), disapproved on other grounds in Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 63 P.3d 937, 954 n.11 (Cal. 2003). Of course, that simply begs the question we discussed in the last subsection: What competition is \"fair\"? 126See JUDICIAL COUNCIL CAL., CACI No. 2202: Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Relations\u2014Essential Factual Elements , in JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL JURY INSTRUCTIONS 1212 (2017), https://www.justia.com/documents/trials-litigation-caci.pdf [https://perma.cc/MQ2G-DRM8] (\"Whether the conduct alleged qualifies as wrongful if proven or falls within the privilege of fair competition is resolved by the court as a matter of law.\"). 127Pac.

After all, that third party is free to enter into a contract with you or not, and until they do I should be free to try to get their business instead. Unjust Enrichment . Unjust enrichment (when conceived of as a tort rather than as a remedy) has a similar problem: How do we know when enrichment is \"unjust\"? Here, too, courts sometimes reduce the risk of this free-ranging tort being used to block disruptive market entry by tying the \"unjustness\" of the enrichment to some preexisting category of legal wrong. In University of Colorado Foundation, Inc. v. American Cyanamid Co. ,128 for instance, the court insisted that unjust enrichment based on theft of a patentable idea could be actionable as a state tort only if the state court applied federal standards for patent inventorship.129 By so doing, it grounded the unjust enrichment in a substantive legal wrong, albeit one that didn't specifically provide for a disgorgement remedy. We think this is a positive trend, one that courts and scholars should encourage.130 But the more unjust enrichment is tied to independent substantive notions of wrongdoing, the more it looks like a remedy for that independent wrong rather than a freestanding cause of action. Antitrust. The issue with antitrust is different. While the doctrines just discussed lack a normative core, that's not true of antitrust. Antitrust is designed to protect competition. The problem is that antitrust plaintiffs often conflate that with protection of individual competitors, even if the thing those competitors want protection from is really robust competition. Antitrust has effectively confronted these claims, developing tools131 designed to make sure that antitrust 128196 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1999). 129Id. at 1372 (holding that upon remand, the lower court must \"apply federal patent law principles to determine whether [plaintiffs] were inventors of the technology\"). Upon remand, the district court found that the defendants committed fraud, a separate independent tort. Univ. of Colo. Found., Inc. v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 105 F. Supp. 2d 1164, 1183 (D. Colo. 2000). The fraud damages were lower than the unjust enrichment award, but both awards were based on the same wrongful conduct and were eventually upheld on a subsequent appeal. Univ. of Colo. Found., Inc. v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 342 F.3d 1298, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2003). 130The Third Restatement goes some way toward setting standards for identifying wrongful acts as a basis for unjust enrichment, for instance. See generally RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF RESTITUTION & UNJUST ENRICHMENT \u00a7 42 (A M. LAW INST. 2011). 131Among the tools courts use to identify such conduct are presumptions informed by economic analysis. In \u00a7 1 analysis, courts may find conduct illegal per se when \"the practice facially appears to be one that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output,\" such as price-fixing. Broad. Music, Inc. v. Colum. Broad. Sys., Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1979). They may conduct a \"quick look\" analysis when there is a \"close family resemblance between the suspect practice and another practice that already stands convicted in the court of consumer welfare.\" Polygram Holding, Inc. v. FTC, 416 F.3d 29, 37 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (noting that there is a presumption of illegality with this \"close family resemblance\"); see also Cal. Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 770 (1999) (\"In each of these cases, which have formed the basis for what has come to be called abbreviated or 'quick-look' analysis 100 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 claims protect competition, not competitors.132 In particular, antitrust standing doctrines attempt to prevent plaintiffs from using antitrust as a competitive weapon by requiring that the injury the plaintiff suffers flows from the anticompetitive nature of defendant's conduct rather than from vigorous competition. We discuss those tools\u2014and particularly the antitrust injury doctrine\u2014in more detail later in this Part and in Part III.133 Noncompetition Agreements . As we discussed in Part I, companies often use noncompete agreements to make it harder for employees to start new companies that might compete with them and for existing companies to lure talent in a competitive market. States have been inconsistent in their treatment of noncompetes. A minority of states, most notably California, ban them altogether.134 Most states impose some time and scope limitations on noncompetes but otherwise enforce them.135 The economic evidence is quite strong that noncompetes restrict innovation and economic growth.136 Indeed, the under the rule of reason, an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets.\"). Finally, they may conduct a full-blown \"rule of reason\" analysis, which is far more defendant-friendly. See Matthew G. Sipe, The Sherman Act and Avoiding Void-for-Vagueness , 45 FLA. ST. U. L. REV. 709, 724 (2018) (noting that \"rule of reason\" analysis makes it harder than per se analysis to hold defendants liable); Maurice E. Stucke, Does the Rule of Reason Violate the Rule of Law? , 42 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. 1375, 1423 (2009) (\"The empirical evidence reflects that most rule-of-reason claims never reach juries; rather, most are decided on motions to dismiss or summary judgment, and most (and in some surveys nearly all) antitrust plaintiffs lose.\"). 132See Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 458 (1993) (\"The law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself.\"). 133See infra notes 229-75 and accompanying text. 134Regarding California, see C AL. BUS. & PROF.

Other states that ban noncompetes include Alabama, Louisiana, Montana, and North Dakota. See 1 PETER S. MENELL, MARK A. LEMLEY & ROBERT P. MERGES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE NEW TECHNOLOGICAL AGE 121 (2017 ed.).

Courts haven't yet been as successful in reining in use of the CFAA. While some courts, including the Ninth Circuit in 2019, have cut back on the breathtaking scope of the law,141 it's still a mess, and parties still predominantly use the CFAA to target competitors and departing employees, not hackers.142 As one of us put it recently, the CFAA \"attempts to define computer hacking, but has made a hash of it. One attempt at legislative reform, and numerous court interpretations, haven't been able to fix it in over thirty years. As such, we're stuck with a law we can't really understand.\"143 B. IP and Market Disruption As we have just seen, courts in most business tort cases have developed rules to police the use of those laws to prevent disruption. The record in IP cases, by contrast, is decidedly more mixed. Sometimes courts reject market disruption arguments, either because they see the value of the new technology or business model or because the harm claimed by the plaintiff seems remote. In other cases, courts are more receptive to claims of disruption\u2014in the sense that they openly credit those arguments in doctrinal contexts in which they are directly relevant, or in the sense that those arguments indirectly shape the ways courts define the parties' rights and obligations. To some extent, this shouldn't be a surprise, since IP law intends to prevent some forms of disruption. But the inconsistency goes beyond that, because courts often act without thinking about how their IP decisions influence market competition. 1. Anti-Disruption Impulses in IP IP rights can prevent market disruption in several ways. First, courts are sometimes persuaded to define legal rights in ways that are skewed by impulses about effects of new technologies on the particular parties to the case. Those legal definitions are often justified in free-riding and unfair competition terms, and sometimes they reflect courts' negative reactions to parties' attempts to 139See New Details About the FTC Workshop on Noncompetes , FAIR COMPETITION L.

And even when the conduct falls far enough outside defined legal rights that courts cannot identify any clear violation, they sometimes recognize ill- defined penumbral claims relying on broad concepts of misappropriation or unfair competition. There is perhaps no better example of a court's redefinition of legal rights to capture disruptive technology than Aereo, the case concerning the company that made tiny broadcast antennas. According to the plaintiffs, Aereo's system was effectively a cable system, but Aereo was not paying any of the fees cable systems pay to broadcasters to carry their content.144 The Court agreed, concluding that \"Aereo's activities [were] substantially similar to those of the CATV companies that Congress amended the Act to reach.\"145 Aereo, not just its subscribers, \"perform[ed]\" the works \"publicly\" because it \"[sold] a service that allow[ed] subscribers to watch television programs, many of which are copyrighted, almost as they are being broadcast. In providing this service, Aereo use[d] its own equipment, housed in a centralized warehouse, of its users' programming' of each over-the-air station it carrie[d].\"147 No matter that Aereo used equipment (antennas) that \"emulate[d] equipment a viewer could use at home\"\u2014that was, according to the Court, also true of the equipment used by cable companies, which the Court considered in Fortnightly148 and Teleprompter ,149 cases to which Congress responded in the 1976 Act.150 What about the fact that, unlike cable systems, which transmit constantly without selection by the viewer, \"Aereo's system remains inert until a subscriber 144Of course, the content owners didn't really want Aereo to be considered a cable system, because then Aereo would have been able to rebroadcast by paying the statutory license fees, and that still would have upset the market.

But for the Aereo majority, that was a distinction without a difference. The Aereo majority couldn't see why this \"single difference, invisible to subscriber and broadcaster alike, could transform a system that is for all practical purposes a traditional cable system into 'a copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card.'\"154 In other words, it didn't matter that Aereo designed its system to be technically distinct from cable systems in at least two significant ways\u2014by making it one-to-one (using different antennas to create unique copies for individual subscribers rather than grabbing the signal with one antenna and retransmitting it to all subscribers), and by capturing and retransmitting signals to subscribers only if or when those subscribers affirmatively selected a specific program.155 These technological differences \"concern[ed] the behind-the-scenes way in which Aereo deliver[ed] television programming to its viewers' screens. They d[id] not render Aereo's commercial objective any different from that of cable companies. Nor d[id] they significantly alter the viewing experience of Aereo's subscribers.\"156 Notably, the Court was openly hostile toward Aereo's evident intent to design its system to comply with existing precedent. During oral argument at the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts asked Aereo's lawyer directly whether there was any explanation for Aereo's use of 10,000 dime-sized antennas, other than \"to get around the copyright laws.\"157 When Aereo's lawyer demurred, suggesting 151Id. 152That was a critical difference for the dissent. See id. at 457 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"Aereo does not 'perform' for the sole and simple reason that it does not make the choice of content.\").

Oct. 1, 2013) (\"ABC has failed to demonstrate likelihood of success on its direct copying cause of action because the evidentiary record indicates, and the Court finds, that the consumer makes the copy.

That antenna also transmits broadcasts by communicating them such that \"images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they [we]re sent.\" Id. at 441 (quoting 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101). 156Id. at 446. 157Transcript of Oral Argument, supra note 144, at 31 (Roberts, C.J.)

But his question is, is there any reason you did it other than not to violate the copyright laws?\"158 The sense that, in the end, Aereo's system was really just a Rube Goldberg device designed to formally comply with previous cases while operating functionally as a cable system pervades the Court's opinion\u2014and perhaps explains the majority's failure to grapple with the potential implications of its holding. This kind of analogizing along functional lines is hardly foreign to copyright, and it isn't always done to find infringement.159 But, ironically, the majority in Aereo rejected the legal reasoning of Cartoon Network ,160 which analogized the remote DVR to the VCR in finding the remote DVR noninfringing. The Aereo majority specifically rejected the Second Circuit's emphasis on volitional conduct.161 Ultimately, Aereo complied with existing law but did so in a way that disrupted established markets. So the Court simply changed the law. Something similar could be said about Grokster.162 In that case, the defendant carefully conformed its behavior to the rules of secondary liability set forth in Sony and various circuit court decisions, which prevented the facilitation of direct infringement by a centralized music streaming site but distinguished companies that simply provided software that was capable of substantial noninfringing uses.163 Grokster did just what the Ninth Circuit said it could do in Napster164\u2014provide software that was capable of substantial noninfringing uses.165 But Grokster did so while still facilitating quite a lot of direct your antenna up and then do it?

Just as in Aereo,166 the lower courts found Grokster's conduct lawful because it complied with the rules in force at the time,167 but the Supreme Court ultimately created a new legal doctrine to reach that conduct and applied that new doctrine to find Grokster liable .168 It did so because, as in Aereo, the defendant had found a way to comply with the law while disrupting the plaintiff's market. At the same time, the Court nominally limited its new legal rule to the specific facts of Grokster itself. While it identified a number of factors that supported its finding of intentional inducement, the Court was careful to note that none of those facts standing alone (except perhaps naming the company in a way that was reminiscent of Napster) would give rise to liability. 2. Accommodating Disruption To be sure, courts in IP cases sometimes reject market disruption arguments. The Supreme Court, for example, was unmoved by market disruption arguments in Fortnightly , a case from the beginning of the cable television era involving cable retransmissions of over-the-air television broadcasts.169 According to the broadcasters, those retransmissions violated their public performance rights.170 The Court rejected that claim, holding that retransmission was not infringing because it was more like passive \"view[ing]\" of the television broadcasts than active \"perform[ance]\" of the works.171 That was true, the Court held in Teleprompter , even when viewers received retransmissions of distant signals that were not normally available in their areas.172 Notably, the Court in 166WNET, Thirteen v. Aereo, Inc., 712 F.3d 676, 680 (2d Cir. 2013), rev'd sub nom. Am. Broad. Cos. v. Aereo, Inc., 573 U.S. 431 (2014). 167Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v.

REV. 195, 207-08 (2002) (characterizing Fortnightly and Teleprompter as \"rather strained\" and best understood \"in the context of [the Court's] perception that the broadcast industry was endeavoring to kill off a new rival, cable\"). 172Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS, 415 U.S. 394, 408-10 (1974) (\"By importing signals that could not normally be received with current technology in the community it serves, a CATV system does not, for copyright purposes, alter the function it performs for its subscribers.\"), superseded by statute , Copyright Act of 1976, Pub.

No. 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541, as recognized in Aereo , 573 U.S. 431. 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 107 Teleprompter concluded that broadcasters and content owners would not be harmed by retransmissions of distant signals because they could adjust their advertising rates (or change their business models) to account for the broader audiences made possible by the retransmissions.173 Similarly, the Court in Sony rejected the motion picture industry's attempt to hold Sony secondarily liable for the infringing activities of users of its Betamax videotape recorder.174 Acknowledging copyright's history of adaptation to technological change, the Court emphasized its \"consistent deference to Congress when major technological innovations alter the market for copyrighted materials.\"175 It then borrowed from patent law's staple-article-of-commerce doctrine to set a high bar for holding the producer of the technological means of infringement liable when that producer is not in a position to control the use of copyrighted works by others: \"The sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.\"176 The Betamax had such substantial noninfringing uses because many copyright owners did not object to private copying of their works and because, the Court held, private \"time-shifting\" was fair use.177 The result in Sony was particularly notable because the industry was trying to shut down videotape recorders in favor of a different technology\u2014the videodisc player\u2014that couldn't record content.178 The case literally was about who got to determine the shape of the market. And though the Court did not address that background struggle directly, it rejected another form of market disruption argument, crediting the district court's distinction between \"adjustments in marketing strategy,\" which might have been necessary once the Betamax was on the market, and market harm, which the copyright owners could not establish.179 Presciently, the Court even accepted the district court's conclusion that time- 173Id. at 411-13 (suggesting broadcasters \"whose reception ranges have been extended\" will \"merely have a different and larger viewer market\"); see also Fortnightly , 392 U.S. at 403 (Fortas, J., dissenting) (rejecting majority's impulse to protect new technology and sarcastically noting that \"it [was] darkly predicted that the imposition of full liability upon all CATV operations could result in the demise of this new, important instrument of mass communications; or in its becoming a tool of the powerful networks which hold a substantial number of copyrights on materials used in the television industry\"). 174Sony Corp. of Am. v.

RS-DVR customers may then receive playback of those programs through their home television sets, using only a remote control and a standard cable box equipped with the RS-DVR software.184 After describing the technical operation of Cablevision's system in significant detail, the court concluded that the temporary buffer data it created were not fixed \"for a period of more than transitory duration,\" and the system therefore did not create copies of the copyrighted works.185 It then held that the legally relevant conduct was the subscribers' ordering the system to produce a copy of a specific program, not Cablevision's conduct in designing, housing, and maintaining a system designed only to produce that copy.186 Like the Supreme Court did in Fortnightly and Teleprompter , the Second Circuit emphasized active conduct in relation to particular copies and interpreted the plaintiff's legal rights narrowly in the face of arguments that the new technology fundamentally disrupted their exploitation of the broadcast programs.187 The Ninth Circuit came to a similar conclusion in the DISH Autohop litigation, rejecting claims that DISH's \"Hopper\" DVR undermined copyright owners' business models by allowing viewers to skip commercials.188 180Id. at 453. 181Far from destroying the industry, the VCR ultimately drove more than $30 billion in new sales for Hollywood.

Of course, the movie industry did successfully scuttle the first such DVR technology. See Newmark v. Turner Broad. Network, 226 F. Supp. 2d 1215, 1223-24 (C.D. Cal. 2002). The case against SONICblue, the maker of the RePlayTV, settled without an opinion when the company was driven into bankruptcy. See Paramount Pictures Corp. v. RePlayTV, 298 F.

Full disclosure: one of us (Lemley) represented DISH in this litigation. 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 109 These cases don't mean that market disruptors have nothing to fear from IP. As we have seen, many cases go the other way.189 Sometimes they go the other way for good reason, because the disruptors do threaten the goals of IP law. The Grokster Court may or may not have been right to target Grokster for obeying then-existing law, but it was reasonable to worry about the mass infringement Grokster was facilitating. Furthermore, even when courts reject market disruption arguments, it's often after the issue has been litigated extensively, creating uncertainty, cost, and delay for the disruptors. Congress has at times responded to those judicial resolutions by imposing compulsory licensing schemes\u2014allowing proliferation of the technology but demanding an administratively determined payment to the IP owners. That is the story of the mechanical license,190 which Congress crafted after the Court refused to enjoin player pianos in White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co .191 It's also the story of the compulsory license for cable retransmissions built into the Copyright Act of 1976 in response to Fortnightly and Teleprompter .192 These responses regulate market disruption, but importantly, they do so deliberately, as a matter of copyright policy. And they regulate it by imposing costs and conditions on disruptive entry rather than prohibiting it entirely. That makes disruption harder, but it does not stop it altogether, allowing clearly superior business models to grow despite their legal disadvantage. Streaming music, for instance, is now the dominant form of music delivery despite a copyright compulsory license regime implemented in 2005 in an effort to protect radio from online streaming competition.193 Notably, however, those regulatory compromises happen only if the court allows the disruptive entrant. If the court shuts down the technology, there is no compromise. 189See supra Section II.B.1 (discussing Aero and Grokster rationales). 190See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 115 (2018) (\"[E]xclusive rights provided by clauses (1) and (3) of section 106, to make and to distribute phonorecords of such works, are subject to compulsory licensing under the conditions specified by this section.\"). 191209 U.S. 1, 18 (1908). 19217 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 (exempting certain secondary transmissions, including cable retransmissions, from copyright infringement); id. \u00a7 1201(k) (requiring copy control devices for videotape recorders and prohibiting circumvention of those controls). 193Id. \u00a7 114(d) (providing interactive transmissions require a negotiated license from sound recording copyright owner). Congress responded in 2018 by passing the Music Modernization Act, which further raised the compulsory license fee for streaming. See Musical Works Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-264, \u00a7 103, 132 Stat. 3676, 3723-26 (2018) (amending \u00a7 114(g) of the Copyright Act, which covers proceeds and corresponding rates from licensing of transmissions). But streaming is so well established that the goal of that Act seems to be simply to extract more money from companies like Spotify rather than to discourage streaming altogether. 110 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 3. Where Does This Leave Us? As our discussion in the previous Sections indicated, courts seem to lack a comprehensive way of thinking about the use of IP claims to prevent disruption. Sometimes they block disruptive technologies; sometimes they accommodate them. One reason for the variance is that market disruption plays a very different role depending on the case. Sometimes market disruption is expressly entangled with doctrine. For example, courts deciding copyright fair use cases must consider the effect of the defendant's use on the plaintiff's market.194 Trademark courts consider whether the plaintiff and defendant are actual or likely competitors when deciding whether consumers are likely to be confused.195 Lost-profit damages in patent cases may be calculated not only to account for lost sales, but also for the ways the defendant's conduct altered the market for the patented invention.196 These cases openly engage with the effects of the defendant's conduct because market disruption is relevant to the doctrinal rules. In other cases, market disruption arguments shape results indirectly. Courts, for example, are sometimes persuaded to define legal rights in ways that are skewed by impulses about effects of new technologies on the parties to the case. Those legal definitions are often justified in \"free riding\" and \"unfair competition\" terms.197 Some of negative 19417 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(4) (\"In determining whether the use made of a work in a particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include . . . the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\"); Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 591 (1994) (reasoning that because \"[a] parody and the original usually serve different market functions,\" the parody entailed a fair use); Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 566 (1985) (calling the potential effect on the market for the original \"undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use\"); Sony Corp . of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 450-51 (1984) (\"But a use that has no demonstrable effect upon the potential market for, or the value of, the copyrighted work need not be prohibited in order to protect the author's incentive to create. The prohibition of such noncommercial uses would merely inhibit access to ideas without any countervailing benefit.\"). 195See, e.g., AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir. 1979) (setting out eight factors for evaluating trademark infringement, including \"proximity of the goods,\" \"marketing channels used,\" and \"likelihood of expansion of the product lines\"); Hancock v. Am. Steel & Wire Co., 203 F.2d 737, 741-42 (C.C.P.A. 1953) (holding that the mark \"Tornado\" infringed upon \"Cyclone,\" where both were used for wire fencing and Tornado had \"entered the field considerably later\" and spent less than one one-hundredth as much on advertising). 196For example, patentees can recover lost profits due to price erosion if the presence of the infringing products lowered the price for the patented goods. We also allow for lost convoyed sales of unpatented goods. See, e.g., King Instrument Corp. v. Perego, 72 F.3d 855, 856 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (upholding patentee's right to recover damages for an infringer's interference with the patentee's market in unpatented goods). 197Cf. A. Lemley & Mark P.

Because those attempts strike courts as evasive or somehow abusive, they redefine legal rights to capture the conduct.198 And even when the conduct falls far enough outside defined legal rights that they cannot identify any clear violation, courts sometimes recognize ill-defined penumbral claims relying on broad concepts of misappropriation or unfair competition. C. Evaluating Challenges to Disruption How should courts assess incumbents' legal challenges to disruptive innovation? We begin from the premise that the market generally is better than courts at determining which industry structure will have greater social value. That doesn't mean courts should never intervene to prevent development or deployment of new technology, but it does mean that they should regard that intervention as extraordinary and requiring justification in the purpose of the law being employed. That's an important starting point in dealing with claims against disruptive innovation because these claims are profoundly antimarket and anti-innovation. They ask courts to circumvent market outcomes in order to protect the parties who benefit from the status quo. In our view, courts are often overly receptive to market disruption arguments because they have the opposite inclination\u2014they tend to be concerned about upsetting the status quo and affecting the settled expectations of market players, particularly when presented with arguments that some new technology will radically alter the industry. Market disruption arguments may be particularly powerful in the IP context because claims that the disruption will fundamentally affect innovative or creative output sound like they are connected to the central purposes of IP. Caution counsels against change (which, ironically, implies intervention). But long experience demonstrates that arguments about the costs of disruptive new technologies to innovation and creativity are nearly always wrong, or at least overstated.199 The VCR didn't kill the movie industry, and streaming is almost certainly not going to kill the music industry.200 Further, as Macchiavelli traditional trademark grounds. As a result, courts must be particularly vigilant to avoid finding confusion in unlikely circumstances because of the pull of free-riding concerns.\"). 198See Am. Broad. Cos. v. Aereo, Inc., 573 U.S. 431, 444 (2014) (minimizing Cartoon Network's emphasis on volitional conduct by stating \"this sole technological difference between Aereo and traditional cable companies does not make a critical difference here\"); Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 934-35 (2005) (distinguishing Sony by stating it is not required to \"ignore evidence of intent\"). 199See, e.g., Lemley, supra note 4, at 129-30 (exemplifying overreactions concerning impact of new technologies on existing industries by discussing VCRs and audio cassettes, among others). 200See id. at 129 (\"In fact, it turns out that through the 1980s and 1990s it was the very VCR and its successor, the DVD player, which were going to destroy the broadcast and movie 112 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 taught, disruptive technologies are often undervalued until people gain experience with them.201 If courts shut down a potentially disruptive technology before its potential becomes apparent, we may literally never know what we are missing.202 As Macchiavelli also noted, incumbents have more power in the political process than new entrants.203 So there is a political economy reason for courts to err on the side of disruptive entrants rather than incumbents: if a court wrongly favors an entrant, incumbents have the power to reverse that decision in Congress. But the reverse is unlikely to be true. A decision that shuts down a politically weaker party in favor of a stronger incumbent won't be overturned by Congress. As a result, judicial errors favoring entrants are more likely to be corrected than judicial errors favoring incumbents.204 That doesn't mean disruptive technologies or business models won't significantly affect particular incumbents. Digital music technology might have significant social value and even grow the pie with respect to music generally while at the same time shuttering thousands of Virgin Records stores.205 Uber may improve life significantly for consumers but make taxi drivers significantly worse off. Nor does it mean that disruption can't have other, potentially negative social consequences. Our argument is that we should deal with those concerns with other social policy instruments rather than letting incumbents misuse IP claims to protect themselves from innovation. Whether it is IP or some other legal tool that the incumbent invokes, courts should demand a fit between the use of that tool and the fundamental policy concerns of the legal systems called upon to prevent the disruption. To evaluate that fit, we must know what the legitimate ends of the asserted law are. Sometimes the legal doctrine used to prevent market disruption is one\u2014 like unjust enrichment, interference with economic advantage, or unfair competition\u2014that doesn't have a clear animating principle. We think those doctrines should be disfavored, and courts should employ them only when they are tied to some independent metric for deciding whether the defendant's industries, that kept them alive, generating $30 billion in revenues by 2002 for the industries.\"). 201MACHIAVELLI , supra note 2, at 52. 202See Carrier, supra note 95, at 950-58 (discussing costs associated with ignoring innovation and overemphasizing harms of potential infringement, which include a chilling effect on innovation, lost venture capital, and lost markets); Mark A. Lemley & R. Anthony Reese, Reducing Digital Copyright Infringement Without Restricting Innovation , 56 STAN. L. REV. 1345, 1389 (2004) (noting new technologies are \"much more vulnerable to legal challenge\" in part \"because their ultimate value may not yet be clear\" and in part because it will prevent \"disruption of settled expectations that rooting out an existing technology would\"). 203MACHIAVELLI , supra note 2, at 52. 204We're grateful to Mike Meurer for this point. 205See, e.g., Alana Semuels, Virgin Megastore to Shut Doors , L.A. TIMES, Dec. 27, 2007, at C3 (\"Sales of compact discs were down 23% last week from the same period in 2006, Billboard reported, as people continue to turn to the Internet for music.\"). 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 113 conduct is unfair or unjust. Other doctrines, like antitrust and IP, have clearer purposes. There, we can evaluate legal challenges to market disruption by testing the fit between the goals of the doctrine and its use in a particular case.206 Patent and copyright law are intended to promote innovation and creativity. As a result, different kinds of disruption arguments matter in cases involving patent and copyright claims than in those involving antitrust and unjust enrichment claims. Where IP is at stake, courts should focus on whether the disruption will do too much to undermine private incentives to invest in new creation. Making that determination requires some assumptions about the incentive effects of IP rights generally, and we acknowledge the uncertainty of those assumptions. But unless we think IP rights have no relation to incentives, we need to be sensitive to the fact that some risk of uncompensated disruption could hurt innovation. At the same time, courts should not presume that private losses necessarily implicate broader policy concerns, and as a result, they should be wary of conflating the fact of disruption with the violation of a legal right. Absent legal constraint, a new technology or market entrant will often force incumbents to change their business models or fail in the marketplace. That's how markets work in a dynamic economy. That risk doesn't mean that no one invests or that market actors should be able to expect courts to protect them against having to adapt. Quite the contrary: the prospect of disrupting an inefficient industry often induces innovation by start-ups. Courts therefore need to differentiate cases in which disruption would actually interfere with the purposes of IP law from those involving simple harm to the plaintiff that does not interfere with incentives. In Part III, we offer some ideas about how to implement these principles in the law. III. WHEN IS DISRUPTION UNFAIR? Unfair competition shouldn't be redundant. The law of business torts, including IP, needs a metric to distinguish complaints that are really about competition per se from those that are really about conduct that is unfair independently of its competitive aspect. Right now, court responses to market disruption arguments seem to be ad hoc, particularly in IP cases. At the same time, not all disruption is socially valuable. Just as regulation sometimes serves valuable purposes, IP and other legal doctrines are sometimes preventing unproductive efforts to capture value the law has properly assigned to plaintiffs. Some would put Grokster and Aereo in this category\u2014efforts to take advantage of loopholes in copyright law to capture market share from 206See supra Section I.B.1 (discussing when various antirust and business tort claims align with their statutory purposes). We recognize that new technologies often raise legal questions beyond those on which we have focused. Some disruptive technologies, for example, thrive in the market because of the way they enable data collection, and those technologies can raise serious privacy concerns. We do not suggest that those concerns do not justify judicial or regulatory response, only that any such response should likewise be justified in terms of the goals of the legal regime invoked. 114 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 incumbents. Others would point out that limits on copyright and other doctrines are not \"loopholes\" but serve important purposes and that, as we have seen, the world benefited quite a bit from turning back prior efforts by copyright owners to control media technology.207 In this Part, we suggest two ways to distinguish those cases.208 First, market harm standing alone should not be the basis for a cause of action. Legal doctrines need some independent substance besides the fact of competitive injury. Second, even if a doctrine has a normative core, we need a test that measures whether the plaintiff's interest in enforcing the law aligns with society's interest in having that law. We suggest adoption of \"IP injury\" and \"business tort injury\" doctrines that parallel the existing \"antitrust injury doctrine.\" A. Doctrines Without Substance One of us has previously suggested a framework for IP liability that requires both technical similarity and market harm.209 Fromer and Lemley worried about cases that find liability based on similarity without harm.210 Many IP laws permit plaintiffs to sue for technical acts of infringement even though the plaintiff has suffered no real injury.211 The problems of patent and copyright trolls both stem from the lack of an explicit market harm requirement.212 So, too, do some of the most worrisome lawsuits from a free speech standpoint, such as copyright, trademark, and right of publicity lawsuits against parodies, satires, and criticism.213 207For a thoughtful effort to parse this distinction, see Dan L. Burk, Perverse Innovation , 58 WM. & MARY L. REV. 1, 6-15 (2016). 208There is another, broader challenge to disruption, increasingly in vogue, that opposes change simply because it is change. If you think Lyft is a bad idea because you liked things the way they were, you might like legal efforts to stifle disruption precisely because they discourage innovation. We don't address that line of thought in this Article. 209See Jeanne C. Fromer & Mark A. Lemley, The Audience in Intellectual Property Infringement , 112 M ICH. L. REV. 1251, 1251 (2014). 210See id. at 1262-67. 211For instance, patent \"[e]xperts are likely to find infringement when two items are technically similar, whether or not consumers would view them as market substitutes.\" Id. at 1254. However, a \"use that does not interfere with the plaintiff's market in some way generally does no relevant harm.\" Id. at 1255; see also id. at 1262-67 (explaining how merely technical infringement might be found in the patent context). 212See, e.g., Jeanne C. Fromer, Should the Law Care Why Intellectual Property Rights Have Been Asserted? , 53 HOUS. L. REV. 549, 556-57 (2015) (arguing that assertions of patent rights and copyrights not motivated by protecting the holder's market against infringing substitutes create problems for the rights regimes and should warrant closer scrutiny); Fromer & Lemley, supra note 209, at 1291-92 (\"[P]roof of market harm should require both evidence that consumers actually find the goods to be substitutes and a conclusion that those customers' beliefs are reasonable and therefore something the law wants to credit.\"). 213For parodies, see, for example, Mattel, Inc. v. Walking Mountain Productions , 353 F.3d 792, 796, 812 (9th Cir. 2003) (affirming summary judgment that artist's depiction of \"Barbie 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 115 But we should worry as much or more about those cases that find the opposite, rooting liability in market harm in the absence of sufficient technical similarity. Business torts (including IP regimes) run the risk of treating market disruption itself as illegal unless they are cabined with a substantive requirement of wrongful behavior that is more than just the fact of market disruption itself. In IP regimes, that independent substantive element is most commonly some sort of technical similarity analysis. In most IP cases, courts don't explicitly treat market substitution as actionable itself. But they have a strong tendency to define the violations in ways that are obviously dominated by (we would say skewed by) impulses about \"free riding\" or \"unfair competition\" that are divorced from the underlying theories of the causes of action. And this tendency to ignore the core doctrine is compounded in cases that expand the substantive boundaries of the law to reach defendants who disrupt the plaintiff's market without doing anything the law traditionally would have viewed as infringing. Resisting the urge to treat market harm, standing alone, as the violation of a legal right means that courts should reject torts or doctrines that treat injury to the plaintiff as sufficient to create a cause of action. This is an issue that has divided courts considering both unfair competition and unjust enrichment. Unjust enrichment, properly understood, is a remedy, not a cause of action. It allows courts to require disgorgement of profits or tangible things held unjustly, but\u2014as a remedy\u2014only if the defendant holds those things in violation of some legal rule.214 The same is true of the torts of unfair competition and interference Enchiladas\" and other works were lawful parodies), and Campbell v.

Publ'g Inc., 971 F.2d 302, 307 (9th Cir. 1992) (\"Much useful social and commercial discourse would be all but impossible if speakers were under threat of an infringement lawsuit every time they made reference to a person, company or product by using its trademark.\"); Stacey L.

This is different from the question of whether plaintiffs who have shown violation of a legal right have standing to obtain restitution even though they cannot 116 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 with economic advantage. These are properly torts in their own right. But without standards for defining unfairness, courts are free to define any conduct they like as \"unfair,\" whether or not it is independently illegal or deceptive. These freestanding torts can swallow other areas of law by creating liability even for acts that would not have violated substantive law. To avoid this, states like California require unfair competition to be tied to some independent standard of illegal or tortious conduct, such as antitrust.215 They have done the same with intentional interference with economic advantage.216 And some courts are careful to treat unjust enrichment as a remedy, not as an independent cause of action.217 We endorse those limits and suggest they should be adopted uniformly. The risk is not simply that these freestanding torts will supplant other, better- defined causes of action. They may create bad substantive law because to some plaintiffs (and some judges), the very act of competition can seem unfair. Antitrust spent decades weeding out cases brought by competitors whose complaint was that they were out-competed on the merits218 or whose products were rendered irrelevant as companies integrated different products together.219 Those who lost out in the marketplace often had an appealing emotional case to a jury that didn't want to deprive plaintiffs of their livelihood, even though it was competition itself\u2014not unfair competition\u2014that hurt them. From an economic perspective, competition is a good thing. But our human instinct often tells us that competition itself is unfair competition. Courts need tools to resist that instinct. There is a similar problem in IP cases. As we have observed elsewhere, courts and juries have a very strong anti-free-riding impulse.220 Even in the absence of show injury that would give rise to a damages claim.

As Wendy Gordon puts it, \"[a] culture could not exist if all free riding were prohibited within it.\"223 When we expand the universe of things that are off limits from borrowing someone's car or their axe to \"borrowing\" their ideas, their words, or even talking about them, we put shackles not only on commerce but on intellectual discourse. IP law is supposed to be carefully calibrated to do this only when we conclude it is necessary. Allowing it to be supplemented with an amorphous unjust enrichment or unfair competition doctrine lets courts and juries give free rein to that impulse. (2005) (arguing similarly).

When they don't, the risk is that those doctrines will be used to prevent not unfair competition but competition itself. B. An IP Injury Doctrine While the risk of falling back on an unarticulated instinct against disruptive competition is greatest when the law provides little or no doctrinal guidance limiting the scope of the right, the strength of the anti-free-riding impulse means that even laws with a normative core can be expanded or distorted to prevent legitimate competition. Copyright fair use cases, for instance, ask whether the plaintiff would suffer market harm if the defendant's use became widespread, but they don't generally require that the market harm flow from the act of infringement itself.229 Similarly, courts do not require that the market harm affect a plaintiff's current market, allowing instead a showing of merely hypothetical harm to an unrelated market that a plaintiff may never exploit.230 And indeed courts have sometimes been willing to find market harm based solely on the fact that the plaintiff could have collected a royalty for a use that would otherwise be fair.231 A particularly 228Mowry v.

This has been especially true in copyright cases. In Grokster, the defendant carefully conformed its behavior to the rules of secondary liability set forth in Sony and (\"Since DK's use of BGA's images falls within a transformative market, BGA does not suffer market harm due to the loss of license fees.\"). 232Oracle Am., Inc. v.

But upon rehearing that holding was effectively reversed with the en banc Fifth Circuit considering that, while the model codes themselves were copyrightable works, the enacted laws were facts, and the model code organization could not enforce its copyrights against an entity republishing those facts. See Veeck v. S. Bldg. Code Cong. Int'l, Inc., 293 F.3d 791, 802 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (\"When those codes are enacted into law, however, they become to that extent 'the law' of the governmental entities and may be reproduced or distributed as 'the law' of those jurisdictions.\"). 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 121 various circuit court decisions.234 And in Aereo, the defendant followed existing precedent defining public performance and distinguishing remote control by users from centralized operation of a broadcast system.235 In both cases, the lower courts held the defendants' conduct lawful because it complied with the rules in force at the time.236 And in both cases the Supreme Court blithely created a new legal doctrine to reach that conduct and applied that doctrine retroactively to find the defendants liable.237 Whatever one thinks of the substantive results of those cases, the idea that we will just redefine what constitutes infringement after the fact to outlaw conduct that was legal when entered into is troubling.238 Trademark cases have also sometimes focused on market harm to the exclusion of the substantive requirement of consumer confusion. Courts in merchandising cases have found for plaintiffs simply because the defendants used the plaintiffs' marks to adorn goods, such as T-shirts, without distinguishing between confusing and nonconfusing uses that might have caused the same harm.239 And courts have been willing to presume harm to a brand even from uses in markets there is no indication the plaintiff would ever enter.240 234Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v.

And the doctrines open the door to abusive claims like those made in Oracle, Star Athletica,241 and Smack Apparel .242 For the past four decades, antitrust law has fought similar abuses by carefully limiting who has standing to bring antitrust cases. The \"antitrust injury\" doctrine requires that a plaintiff show at the outset that they suffered \"injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.\"243 The doctrine is designed to prevent precisely the sort of unfair disruption claims we discuss in this Article: suits by plaintiffs who lost in the marketplace because of competition on the merits, not because of its absence.244 A plaintiff driven out of the market by a more efficient competitor, for instance, has suffered market harm but hasn't suffered the kind of harm about which antitrust law cares. To the contrary, antitrust law is supposed to encourage rather than punish such competition.245 The antitrust injury doctrine is effective in weeding out many suits by disgruntled competitors upset by competition rather than its absence.246 The doctrine isn't perfect; it can be abused by antitrust might seek to sell scarves with its \"Vera\" mark in the future); Precision Tune Inc. v.

See Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. Int'l Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 138 (1968). This is part of antitrust's effort to undermine anticompetitive agreements by sowing discord among co- conspirators.

Extending the antitrust injury doctrine to unfair competition and other tort claims based on allegedly anticompetitive conduct would help screen out claims of unfair competition or unjust enrichment that are in truth merely claims of \"unfair\" disruption. Indeed, some courts have already taken that step.248 We applaud that move and think the principle needs to be recognized more generally in business tort cases. We also need a similar doctrine for IP cases. We argued for an \"IP injury\" doctrine modeled on the antitrust injury requirement in the trademark context back in 2010.249 Christina Bohannan and Herb Hovenkamp have suggested adopting such an IP injury doctrine more broadly.250 As they explain it: acquired other firms in order to achieve monopoly power at the manufacturing level of a product market, dealers or distributors terminated in the aftermath do not have standing to assert claims . . . for monopolization such a] dealer's injury was caused by the manufacturer's decision to terminate their relationship, something the manufacturer could have just as well done without having monopoly power.\"); Norris v.

Indeed, if an act of infringement does no harm to the rights owner but benefits either the infringer or its customers and does not affect anyone else, then that act is a pure Pareto improvement\u2014an economic ideal that is true of very few involuntary transactions.252 As they note elsewhere, The challenge for legal policy is to determine when the IP holder has not suffered any cognizable harm. This analysis requires a re-examination of IP externalities, or spillovers, where IP should follow the antitrust lead in permitting the market to correct for them, intervening only where the inability to recover for an external benefit has a material impact on ex ante incentives to innovate.253 We think this is a good idea, but fully operationalizing it is hard because it requires a court to identify what constitutes cognizable IP harm. As one of us has argued before, that harm is often circular: I have suffered an injury if the law gives me a right to collect money from your use, and often I have a right to collect money from your use if we view that use as injuring me.254 There are of IP harm in infringement actions that would borrow from the 'antitrust injury' doctrine and antitrust's strict, common law-driven requirements that the right kind of harm and damages be proven.\"); see also Gugliuzza, supra note 15, at 750-53 (discussing IP injury proposal). 251Bohannan & Hovenkamp, supra note 15, at 905. 252Id. at 253Christina Bohannan & Herbert Hovenkamp, IP and & at 56 (making similar point); Thomas F.

The Federal Circuit affirmed on other grounds and did not reach the question. SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., 403 F.3d 1331, 1346-47 (Fed. Cir. 2005). 254See A. Lemley, Should a Licensing Market Require Licensing? , 70 LAW & CONTEMP. PROBS., Spring 2007, at 185, 190 (\"Whether a use is fair depends on whether the copyright owner loses anything from the use, but under Texaco, whether the copyright owner loses anything from the use depends on whether the use is deemed fair; only if it is not a fair use would there be licensing revenue to lose.\"); see also Am. Geophysical Union v. Texaco, Inc., 60 F.3d 913, 930-31 (2d Cir. 1994) (holding that scientific journals could prevail on copyright infringement claims because Texaco, already paying some institutional licensing fees but unwilling to pay individual licensing fees (hence in court), might have been willing to pay licensing fees); id. at 937 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (pointing out circularity of majority's reasoning). A similar circularity infects reasonable royalties in patent law because they are calculated based on what the parties would agree to, but what the parties would agree to is 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 125 ways to break that circularity,255 but the notion of harm from IP infringement is a notoriously malleable one.256 We propose one specific implementation of the IP injury idea that will target claims of unfair disruption. If a plaintiff claims market harm, either in proving infringement of an IP right (such as by showing that the parties compete in trademark law or using market effect to defeat a copyright fair use defense) or in assessing damages, courts should ask the following question: Would the plaintiff suffer the same injury from a market intervention that is not infringing? If so, the injury the plaintiff suffers is attributable to the defendant's competition generally and does not flow specifically from infringement.257 For example, if Grokster could lawfully have provided software that people use to download copyrighted files had it done so under a different name,258 the fact that it chose the name in order to induce infringement, even if unlawful, hasn't caused the copyright owner's injury. The injury would come from the legality of the determined by what a court would award if they didn't agree. See Mark A. Lemley & Carl Shapiro, Patent Holdup and Royalty Stacking , 85 TEX. L. REV. 1991, 2021 (2007). Indeed, the circularity propagates and creates additional problems as patent licensers decide whether to forge licensing agreements while anticipating that courts may use these market-achieved agreements as benchmarks for remediation in future cases. Id. at 2021-22. Accordingly, licensing terms are not actually a good measure of damages because they are distorted by the courts' remedial standards. An ironic corollary is that licensing terms are actually less reliable as a proxy for harm than they would be if the licensing-based damages standard did not exist. If courts persist in using this inaccurate measure, patent owners will respond by reducing the number of licenses they grant.

Professor Wendy Gordon has proposed a similar inquiry under the guise of proximate cause: if an injury would have happened whether or not the defendant's conduct was infringing, the infringement isn't the proximate cause of that injury. See generally Wendy J. Gordon, Proximate Cause and Computer Code: Copyright Basics Impugning the Oracle Result, 100 B.U. L. REV. (forthcoming Mar. 2020) (on file with the Boston University Law Review). 258The choice of the name \"Grokster\" to capitalize on \"Napster\" was one of the primary pieces of evidence the Court used to find an intent to induce infringement. Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 925 (2005). Although the Court suggested it wanted its opinion to be read narrowly, to cover only the particular confluence of circumstances in that case, that is certainly not the only possible reading of the opinion. 126 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 software itself.259 Similarly, if Google could lawfully reimplement Java's application programming interfaces (\"APIs\") in its Android operating system without using the same names as Java's APIs, any injury to Oracle must be limited to market harm caused by the use of those names, not the use of the APIs themselves or the value of Android as a whole. There are some good examples of what we have in mind here. One was in the Second Circuit's rejection of the Authors Guild's claim against Google for its operation of the Google Books project. As the court described that project: [A]cting without permission of rights holders, Google has made digital copies of tens of millions of books, including Plaintiffs', that were submitted to it for that purpose by major libraries. Google has scanned the digital copies and established a publicly available search function. An Internet user can use this function to search without charge to determine whether the book contains a specified word or term and also see \"snippets\" of text containing the searched-for terms. In addition, Google has allowed the participating libraries to download and retain digital copies of the books they submit, under agreements which commit the libraries not to use their digital copies in violation of the copyright laws.260 The Second Circuit found this reproduction and (usually partial) public display of the copyrighted works to be fair use. According to the court, the scanning was transformative because it had a transformative purpose, even if it didn't transform the works themselves.261 Quoting its previous decision in Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust ,262 the court said \"that the creation of a full- text searchable database is a quintessentially transformative use . . . [as] the result of a word search is different in purpose, character, expression, meaning, and message from the page (and the book) from which it is drawn.\"263 Provision of the search function and of \"snippets\" of the scanned books were also transformative because \"[s]nippet view add[ed] important value to the basic transformative search function, which tells only whether and how often the searched term appears in the book.\"264 The snippet view was also unlikely to harm the authors because the snippets in most cases wouldn't satisfy demand for complete books.265 Importantly for our proposal, the court found that even the snippets that would satisfy demand for the complete books didn't affect the market in a relevant way because the 259That might or might not be true. Two concurring opinions, each signed by three justices, in fact disagreed on whether the provision of that software was lawful. Id. at 942 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (rejecting Court's finding that provision of software was unlawful); id. at 948 (Breyer, J., concurring) (arguing opposite). 260Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 207 2015). , 804 F.3d at 217 (omission and alteration in original) (quoting HathiTrust , 755 F.3d at 97). 264Id. 265Id. at 218. 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 127 loss associated with substitution of the snippet would also \"generally occur in relation to interests that are not protected by the copyright.\"266 For example, the court noted, \"[a] snippet's capacity to satisfy a searcher's need for access to a copyrighted book will at times be because the snippet conveys a historical fact that the searcher needs to ascertain,\" and obviously historical facts are not subject to copyright.267 In other words, the court didn't conclude that the snippets wouldn't have any substitutionary effect; it concluded that any substitutionary effect wasn't necessarily attributable to acts of infringement. Google also took steps to protect copyright owners in those cases in which the snippets might serve as substitutes because they presented copyrighted content. Specifically, Google \"disable[d] snippet view entirely for types of books for which a single snippet is likely to satisfy the searcher's present need for the book, such as dictionaries, cookbooks, and books of short poems.\"268 While many of our examples involve copyright incumbents trying to restrict technology, the IP injury doctrine we propose isn't a \"pro-Internet company\" doctrine. It can also be used to limit claims by incumbent technology platforms against start-ups that threaten their business model. Indeed, we see that as its primary virtue: it doesn't protect technology companies per se but anyone who challenges the power of incumbents\u2014including incumbent technology companies. A possible example is Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc. ,269 where Facebook asserted copyright in user-posted content on its site as a means of stopping a company from enabling willing users to take their Facebook data to a third-party site and integrate it with other social media platforms.270 Facebook's IP claim is weak, and it seems clearly designed not to protect its incentives to create (much less its users' incentives) but to protect its business model against disruptive competition. Facebook ultimately shut down the site using other tort claims, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.271 An IP injury doctrine will help differentiate cases in which the injury was actually caused by infringement from those in which the claimant has invoked IP as a tool to serve other ends. There are elements of such a doctrine in disparate parts of the law already. For example, patent law requires a plaintiff that wants to recover lost profits to show that the defendant didn't have noninfringing 266Id. 8, at *1 (\"Facebook complained that Defendants employed Facebook's proprietary data without its permission by inducing Facebook users to provide their login information and then using that information to 'scrape' Facebook's proprietary material.\"). 271Facebook based its CFAA claim on the company accessing Facebook to download data. See Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., 844 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir. 2016). The Ninth Circuit has since reversed course on the CFAA issue at least. See HiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp., 938 F.3d 985, 999-1004 (9th Cir. 2019). 128 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 alternatives available.272 And the availability of noninfringing alternatives may also be relevant to calculation of reasonable royalties, though the law is less clear on that issue.273 A patentee who wants an injunction might\u2014or might not\u2014have to show that customers wanted the patented feature specifically in order to show irreparable harm from infringement.274 And a patentee who wants to use its 272Grain Processing Corp. v.

REV. 655, 664-65 (2009) (discussing failure of patent remedies to appropriately differentiate the value defendant obtained through its efforts from those obtained through infringement). 274In the Apple-Samsung saga, the Federal Circuit at first demanded that Apple show that consumers would not purchase defendant's product without the infringing feature in order to establish irreparable harm and warrant preliminary injunction. See Apple Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co. ( Apple II), 695 . . show that the infringing feature drives consumer demand for the accused product.\" (emphasis added)); Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co.

Later, the Federal Circuit appeared to soften this \"causal nexus\" requirement, acknowledging that a plaintiff could still show irreparable harm warranting a permanent injunction even if other features also drove consumer demand. See Apple Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co. ( Apple IV), 809 F.3d 633, 640 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (\"The purpose of the causal nexus requirement is to establish the link between the infringement and the harm, to ensure that there is 'some connection' between the harm alleged and the infringing acts . . . regardless of whether the injunction is sought for an entire product or is narrowly limited to particular features.\" (emphasis added)); Apple Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co. ( Apple III), 735 F.3d 1352, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that plaintiffs seeking permanent injunctions do not need to \"show that a patented feature is the exclusive reason for consumer demand, [but rather] must show some connection between the patented feature and demand for [defendant's] products\"). A recent case cited to these apparently differing Apple standards with seemingly equal approval and yet required a seemingly lower bar than any of them. See Macom Tech. Sols. 2020] UNFAIR DISRUPTION 129 success in the marketplace as evidence to show its invention was nonobvious must show some sort of nexus between the invention and that market demand.275 We suggest generalizing those cases into an IP injury doctrine. A general requirement that the plaintiff's injury be traceable to infringement, not merely to the act of competition or disruption itself, will help courts weed out cases not motivated by IP infringement but by market disruption. C. Paying Off the Incumbents? We have offered reasons to worry about IP and tort suits that are really efforts to prevent market disruption, and we have identified one tool for controlling those suits.276 But that tool is imperfect, and even with it, sometimes IP and tort suits against market disruptors will be successful. Maybe the entrant engaged in disruption in a way that really did constitute some independent legal wrong. Maybe courts didn't listen to us, and their intuition against free riding proved too strong to ignore. Or maybe, in rare cases, the incumbents had legitimate settled expectations to some form of market exclusivity that were necessary to induce them to invest in the first place. We explicitly offer such exclusivity to pharmaceutical and biotechnology patent owners, for instance.277 And some might worry about the distributional consequences of disruptive innovation.278 Holdings, Inc. v. Infineon Techs. AG, 881 F.3d 1323, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that the district court did not clearly err in finding a \"causal nexus\" between infringed patent and resulting sales of product even where the product \"might have [contained] non-infringing design-arounds\" of the allegedly infringing features). 275See, e.g., Diamond Rubber Co. v. Consol. Rubber Tire Co., 220 U.S. 428, 441 (1911) (noting approvingly that a tire was \"commercially successful\" when upholding patent as a nonobvious improvement over prior art); Alco Standard Corp. v. Tenn. Auth., 808 F.2d 1490, 1501 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (\"This is one of those cases where evidence of secondary considerations[, especially commercial success,] 'may . . . establish that an invention appearing to have been obvious in light of the prior art was not.'\" (quoting Stratoflex, Inc. v. Dreyfuss, Federal Circuit: A Case Study in Specialized Courts , 64 N.Y.U. L. REV. 1, 9-10 (1989) (discussing use of commercial success in the Federal Circuit's nonobviousness inquiry, and collecting cases); Robert P. Merges, Commercial Success and Patent Standards: Economic Perspectives on Innovation , 76 CALIF. L. REV. 803, 820, 826-27 (1988) (discussing history of courts' favor, disfavor, and favor once again for commercial success as a factor in the nonobviousness inquiry, and collecting cases). 276See supra notes 106-43 and accompanying text. 277Hatch-Waxman Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355-360 (2018) (detailing process of filing application for FDA drug approval and bringing enforcement actions against those who infringe on a drug maker's market exclusivity). 278See, e.g., Lemley, supra note 92, at 471-81 (discussing disruption likely to be associated with technologies like 3-D printing and how society might respond). We're not generally too concerned about those distributional consequences in the context of the lawsuits we consider here. Incumbents, not the public at large, are likely to bear the burden. Most of them are large, well-funded legacy companies, and if they can't make it in a new competition\u2014well, that's the way a market economy works. But even if you believe incumbents deserve special consideration in some circumstances (say, taxi drivers whose market has been disrupted by 130 BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 100:71 Still, even in these cases, there is room for courts to adhere to and improve the doctrine to reduce abuse of IP rights. That's because even when the law does protect incumbents against disruptive innovation, rightly or wrongly, the way it does so is critically important. While the normal remedy in IP cases has traditionally been an injunction, injunctive relief is often a bad idea when it's directed against a disruptive innovation. Granting an injunction means that society loses the value of the disruptive technology. So, even if that innovation disrupts the plaintiff's market in a way that causes it injury for which the law should compensate, the plaintiff's remedy should sometimes be compensation, not control.279 Importantly, a sufficiently punitive damages award280 or an order requiring disgorgement of the defendant's profits could have the same practical effect as an injunction, effectively stopping the socially desirable disruption.281 Even if we want to compensate incumbents because their market is disrupted, their remedy should be limited to the reasonable, expectation-backed investment harm they suffered. That means no injunction and no punitive monetary awards. ride-sharing), compensating them for innovative disruption is preferable to depriving the world of the benefits of that disruption. 279See Mark A. Lemley & Philip J. Weiser, Should Property or Liability Rules Govern Information , 85 TEX. L. REV. 783, 784 (2007) (\"[W]here injunctions cannot be well tailored to the scope of the property right at issue but necessarily restrain the use of property not owned by the plaintiff, those consequences can overwhelm the benefits of property rules in enforcing legal rights.\"); Jacob Victor, Beyond Fair Use (2019) (working paper) (on file with authors). 280Recent cases have seen minimum statutory damages in the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars in cases like Viacom International Inc. v.

A variety of legal doctrines allow plaintiffs to sue for market disruption, either by making it a part of the cause of action or, more indirectly, by having the outcome influenced by the perception of free riding. We think those legal doctrines need some discipline, tying claims of market disruption to the actual purposes of the laws. Unfair competition is too often viewed as redundant. It shouldn't be. "}
