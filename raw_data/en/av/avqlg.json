Chinese herbal medicine, using non-pharmaceutical ingredients, can be traced back over 5,000 years and is one of humankind's oldest healthcare systems. The practice continues to be a natural, holistic system of primary health care for patients of every cultural and social background. A holistic approach means we focus as much on the prevention of your ailment - using what are called \"adaptogens\" to strengthen your body's ability to heal and regulate itself - as we do on the process of curing it. Since illnesses present themselves differently for each person, we tailor treatments to each patient's specific condition. Most of the 450 ingredients commonly used in Chinese Herbal Medicine are plant- or mineral-based. Ginger, garlic, and cinnamon are some of the most familiar, as are chrysanthemums and peony flowers, as well as medicinal mushrooms. Chinese herbal medicines are prescribed either singularly (just one ingredient) or as formulas, which use a variety of herbs that manifest positive effects when combined. Occasionally, animal substances are incorporated, so check with your practitioner if you want to avoid using any animal-based products.
