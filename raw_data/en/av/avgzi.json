There is a sense of wholeness; that everything is put back together again. But why do spinal adjustments lead people to feel greater well-being? First, let's talk about how allopathic medicine works. Allopathic medicine is the technical name for the type of medicine practiced by MDs. One of its core theories is that the body is very unlikely to get better on its own without the intervention of medication. After the doctor makes the diagnosis, medication or medical apparatuses are used to fix the symptoms. In contrast, chiropractic medicine starts with the idea that the body can naturally fight off diseases. However, there are many things in our lives that weaken our defensive systems. This is why many chiropractors also recommend lifestyle changes in addition to chiropractic care. Chiropractors theorize that a major portion of our natural defense systems lie in the proper function of our nervous systems. When the spinal bones are aligned, the nervous system can function optimally. Since the nervous system is responsible for nearly every function of our bodies, it stands to reason that by making the nerve pathways function fully, health can be improved. The pressures of daily life as well as injuries cause compression of the nerves and mess up our biomechanics. Biomechanics is a fancy term for how well your body can move. If you've ever had a crick in your neck you know how it feels when your biomechanics are compromised. Chiropractic also theorizes that these misalignments and nerve compressions can cause problems in our organs and bodily functions, much like how a short circuit in a house can cause problems all over. The goal of the chiropractor is to realign the spine and joints so that biomechanics and nervous function are restored. Once that is done, additional measures are taken to reduce toxicity in the lifestyle of the patient. The combination of these forces helps the body to better resist disease naturally and bring about greater well-being. It's a defensive form of medicine compared to allopathic medicine's offensive strike.
