But do you know that Ayurvedic practitioners believe your oral health is a window to your digestive health and psycho-emotional balance? Anything that comes across your senses has to be trusted by your oral cavity first. Whether you hear, smell, touch, or look at something, you don't trust it unless it comes in contact with your oral cavity. For example, if you see a delicious food item, you'll automatically try to smell it, pick it up to see how it feels in your hands, and shake to see if you can hear something. However, the doubt whether you should consume will remain until you put it in your mouth. If it tastes bitter, you'll immediately spit it out and your trust in that item will be lost.

Colonoscopy is a procedure used to detect these changes or abnormalities in the large intestine (colon) and rectum. It is a preventive diagnostic technique done to diagnose and treat diseases of the rectum and colon. The procedure depends on the preparation of the person who is undergoing it. Before the colonoscopy, the patient needs to prepare thoroughly by cleansing their colon and assuring that it does not have any sort of fecal material that is coating or sticking onto the surface of the colon.

This leads to an imbalance between Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Through this podcast, Athreya Herbs aims to provide a balance between the Dosha energies in the winter season by suggesting winter health solutions and remedies. The Vedic sages of Ayurveda were keen observers who noticed every small change that happened in their surroundings and reasoned why the change was taking place. They determined the outcome of this change on the human body & vegetation and contemplated the best ways to balance themselves. They documented all this information in the classical texts of Ayurveda called 'Ritucharya'. Ritu means Seasons and Charya means Habits that enhance your adaptability to a specific season.

While traveling is a thrilling experience, it disrupts your daily routine and often pulls you across time zones.

This change of time and environment aggravates the Vata dosha which governs movement and leaves your body vulnerable to dehydration, sleep challenges, dryness, bad digestion, restless thoughts, spaciness, and jet lag. Athreya Herbs offers a number of natural, Ayurvedic remedies to help you enjoy the journey and avoid any discomfort caused while traveling. [Listen Here](https://www.athreyaherbs.com/pages/travel-podcast) The core principle of Ayurvedic healing states that any changes in the environment will have an impact on our bodies, minds, and emotions. The fall season is a period of transition, and we must support our bodies' need to stay in tune with nature's intelligence. Ayurveda gives great importance to seasonal changes because it is the science that is built on circadian rhythms. [Listen "}
