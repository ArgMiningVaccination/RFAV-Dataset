[ KHN: Gov. Newsom Wanted California To Cut Ties With Walgreens. Then Federal Law Got In The Way. ](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/gov-newsom-wanted-california-to-cut-ties-with-walgreens-then-federal-law-got-in-the-way/) Gov. Gavin Newsom declared last month that California was \"done\" doing business with Walgreens after the pharmacy chain said it would not distribute an abortion pill in 21 states where Republicans threatened legal action. Since then, KHN has learned that the Democratic governor must compromise on his hard-line tweet. California is legally bound to continue doing business with Walgreens through the state's massive Medicaid program, health law experts said. And according to a public records request, the state paid Walgreens $1.5 billion last year.

Record enrollment over the last two years brought more consumers into the market. At the same time, many insurers began offering smaller networks of doctors and hospitals, partly to be price-competitive. That combination left some patients scrambling to find an available in-network physician or medical facility. That can be a challenge, especially when enrollees must rely on inaccurate provider lists from their insurance company.

The new law, signed by Gov. Brad Little, would create a crime called \"abortion trafficking,\" carrying a penalty of two to five years in jail for anyone who helps a person under 18 get an abortion or obtain abortion pills without permission from a parent or guardian. (Chen, 4/5) [ AP: Idaho Governor Signs 'Abortion Trafficking' Bill Into Law ](https://apnews.com/article/idaho-abortion-minors-criminalization-b8fb4b6feb9b520d63f75432a1219588) The law is the first of its kind in the U.S. and creates a new crime of \" abortion trafficking,\" barring adults from obtaining abortion pills for a minor or \"recruiting, harboring or transporting the pregnant minor\" without the consent of the minor's parent or guardian. Anyone convicted of breaking the law will face two to five years in prison and could also be sued by the minor's parent or guardian. Parents who raped their child will not be able to sue, though the criminal penalties for anyone who helped the minor obtain an abortion will remain in effect.

Idaho's attorney general Ra\u00fal Labrador issued a legal opinion last week that said state law prohibits medical providers from referring a patient across state lines to undergo an abortion, or from prescribing abortion pills for a patient to pick up across state lines.

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed a bill Wednesday that protects providers of abortions from related prosecution, professional disciplinary action or extradition attempts by out-of-state interests. A companion abortion-rights bill signed in March guarantees access to reproductive health care in response to a string of anti-abortion ordinances by cities and counties in eastern New Mexico where opposition to abortion access runs deep.

Bill Lee's desk for his approval. The Senate passed the bill on a 26-1 vote, with several of the chamber's Democratic lawmakers voting \"present\" rather than picking a side. (Kruesi, 4/5) [ The Washington Post: Air Pollution May Raise Risk Of Dementia, Analysis Shows ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/05/air-pollution-dementia-health-effects/) It has long been known that inhaling these microscopic particles \u2014 also known as PM 2.5, particles less than 2.5 microns in width \u2014 can cause serious health issues. (In comparison, the width of a single human hair is 50 to 100 microns.) But \"their relationship to the brain and dementia is a relatively recent thing,\" said lead study author Marc Weisskopf, Cecil K. and Philip Drinker Professor of environmental epidemiology and physiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"Dementia is a massive problem worldwide. If we can reduce exposure to these particles, we can reduce the burden of dementia.\" (Cimons, 4/5) [ AP: EPA Tightens Mercury Emissions Limits At Coal Power Plants ](https://apnews.com/article/mercury-coal-epa-power-plant-health-9fc882da610ff750a91b7ac50ca33bd6) The Environmental Protection Agency is tightening rules that limit emissions of mercury and other harmful pollutants from coal-fired power plants, updating standards imposed more than a decade ago. The rules proposed Wednesday would lower emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.

As recently as last April, in fact, the CEO of one of the last major companies still clinging to the toxic substance argued for it to remain legal. Acceptable alternatives \"do not exist,\" Olin Corp. CEO Scott Sutton told regulators. In a dramatic turnaround, Olin said on Tuesday that it would support a federal ban on the deadly mineral.

But the scientists also said that it remained unclear how the pandemic began. The study, published in the journal Nature, focused on swabs taken from surfaces in early 2020 at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large market where many of the earliest known Covid patients had worked or shopped. The Chinese scientists had posted an early version of their genetic analysis of those samples in February 2022, but at the time downplayed the possibility of animal infections at the market. (Mueller, 4/5) [ CIDRAP: With New Nature Study, Scientists Continue To Debate SARS-CoV-2 Origins ](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/new-nature-study-scientists-continue-debate-sars-cov-2-origins) Chinese researchers who isolated three live SARS-CoV-2 viruses and viral DNA from environmental samples at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China, say the findings don't definitively show that the pandemic spilled over into humans from animals, according to a study published today in Nature. ... On the Zenodo preprint server, the group posted its own analysis of the sequences, which it said support\u2014but don't definitively prove\u2014that the virus likely jumped from animals (eg, raccoon dog) to people at the market.

The White House hasn't gotten around to actually getting it up and running. The office was intended to be a permanent solution for the ongoing need for the White House to hire \"czars\" to handle public health threats like Ebola, AIDS, and Covid-19. But Biden hasn't nominated anyone to lead it, just a month before a crucial turning point in the administration's pandemic response.

Despite an uptick in suicides amid the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, historically times of combat are not solely accountable for surges in self-harm among troops, according to the study slated for the May issue of Psychiatry Research.

A DoD inspector general report released Monday found inconsistencies with how the military health system handles screening, tracking and treating brain injury, often because the existing process is cumbersome. It concluded that DoD is \"unable to accurate identify, treat and track\" incidents of brain injury across the forces.

Nine of 27 children in the Italian study had no sign of cancer six weeks after the treatment, although two later relapsed and died. The treatment \u2014 called CAR-T cell therapy \u2014 is already used to help the immune system fight leukemia and other cancers in the blood. This is the first time researchers have achieved such encouraging results in solid tumors, experts in the field said, and raises hopes that it can be used against other kinds of cancers.

But there's a hitch. Some of these drugs, as well as therapies in development for other conditions, are administered through lumbar punctures, which aren't a routine part of doctors' daily practices. They may involve infusions of a gene packaged inside the shell of a virus, which can lead to potential immune complications and can require close monitoring of patients. Some drugs need to be stored in special conditions, which can take complicated planning and coordination that few doctors have experienced.
