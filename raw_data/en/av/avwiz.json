However, it's just as important to protect our feline friends\u2014especially since there is no approved treatment for them once they're infected. Dogs are natural hosts for heartworms\u2014that means the worms can grow into adults, mate and bear offspring inside a dog. Disease in cats is very different. Within these atypical hosts, heartworms generally don't reach the adult stage. Nonetheless, the immature worms can cause severe respiratory disease in our feline friends. The American Heartworm Society now recommends that cats start receiving heartworm preventative every month year round by the time they're 8 weeks old. So, be proactive. Protect your cat's heart and lungs by asking your veterinarian about safe feline heartworm preventatives. Back pain can come from a variety of sources, but don't overlook your feet. Specifically, your shoes. Your footwear choices may be the soul of your problem, so to speak. Two New York City-based podiatrists, speaking in Everyday Health, offered tips for how to choose shoes to help ease the pain. They agreed shoes should feel comfortable and not pinch any part of your foot. No matter how good they look, don't buy shoes that are too tight, too loose or unsupportive. Start with the heel. A heel that's the same height as or lower than the toe affects the way your leg and pelvis move which, in turn, affects your spine and lower back. The ideal heel range is between 1 and 2 inches. Most men's shoes have the heel and toe on the same level, which might help explain why men have less back pain than women. How well the heel absorbs shock is also key. Some people strike the ground harder than others with their heel, sending a shock up their legs and toward their back. Cork heels can help, as can rubber heels or wedge-style shoes. Sandals and flip-flops don't provide much support because their soles are too thin to absorb this shock. Most of them also lower your heel below your toes, creating a negative heel. The same goes for loafers and ballerina-type shoes with a very flat sole, which can rotate your pelvis and worsen back pain. Visiting a podiatrist is a good start when it comes to problems with your feet. Those needing help selecting shoes should consider speaking to a pedorthist [peh-DOR-thist], someone trained on fitting therapeutic footwear and orthotic devices. Following these simple guidelines can be a step in the right direction in easing back pain. Dangers to our pets sometimes come in very small packages. A case in point is the foxtail, otherwise known as a grass seed awn. These barbed seed heads often top grass stalks during the spring and summer. The shape of the spiny seed is the biggest problem\u2014it can only move forward through tissues and never back again. And these sticky objects can burrow into any part of the body, from tender paws to the face or genital areas\u2014even into the nose and down to the lungs. Signs of penetrating foxtails depend on where they first landed. So, examine your furry friend after being outside, especially checking paws, ears, the nose and genital areas. And if your pet shows any signs out of the blue\u2014like swelling, pawing at the ears, head shaking or breathing issues\u2014check with your veterinarian right away. Allergy season, as we all know, is nothing to sneeze at. That congested, wheezy feeling can make like miserable. And for people with respiratory problems, including the millions of Americans with asthma, high pollen counts can be downright dangerous. And sniffle season is getting worse. A recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Scientists found global warming is increasing the duration of pollen seasons and making them more severe. Warmer air, along with higher levels of carbon dioxide, have walloped North American allergy sufferers. Scientists say the warming planet has moved up the start of pollen season by 20 days since 1990. Additionally, there is 21% more pollen in the air. And researchers say the trend is accelerating. The effects, the study says, are most pronounced in Texas, the Midwest and the Southeast. Cooler, northern climes fare a little better, including New England and the Great Lakes states. The study examined readings from 60 pollen monitoring stations across the United States. Using satellite imagery, investigators were able to discount the possibility that land use changes or anomalies in tree growth have thrown off pollen counts at these locations. Allergies have a significant impact on society. Previous studies have shown those annoying and sometimes dangerous physical effects can cause students to perform poorly at the peak of pollen season. Emergency room visits increase, as do medical expenses that cost the nation billions of dollars. Scientists believe allergy season might make us more susceptible to respiratory viruses. You might have heard of one in particular: the novel coronavirus. If you've decided not to take your pooch to a groomer, the bathing is all up to you. But what if your cuddly canine launches into a fearful frenzy at the sight of soap and water? Fortunately, there are lots of tips for easing bath time tensions. First, if you're using a bathtub, make sure it's comfy and not slippery for your pooch. Staying calm will reassure your buddy, too. If your dog doesn't like the sound of running water, add some water to the tub before gently lifting him in. You might start by lathering his back end first, then use a cup instead of the faucet or sprayer to rinse him off. Distraction can work, too, so be generous with treats. Some folks even smear a little peanut butter on the tub to keep their pooch occupied. You might even find that once your dog gets used to it, bath time can be a great bonding experience. It's a common refrain in the gym. No pain, no gain. Beneficial exercise isn't always going to be a walk in the park \u2014 at least not for the millions of Americans who have peripheral artery disease. This is a disease that involves a narrowing of the arteries, which restricts blood flow to the limbs. As a result, people with the condition often experience what is known as ischemic leg pain if they walk too fast. The pain can be intense, with muscle cramping in the calves, thighs or hips. Peripheral artery disease is caused by a build-up of fat in the arteries. Risk factors include diabetes, smoking and aging. In rare cases, much younger people are susceptible. The problem is that doctors have long recommended vigorous walks to combat the loss of mobility caused by the illness. But what if people simply slowed down to the point that they don't suffer pain? Might they still benefit? A recent study by University of Florida researchers looked at that idea. About 300 participants in this investigation were separated into three groups \u2014 fast walkers, slow walkers and a no-walk group. All except the last group were asked to walk 50 minutes a day, five days a week. Findings indicated that pain appeared to be a necessary experience for a walk to do any good. In fact, those who strolled at a more leisurely, pain-free pace showed no greater improvement in mobility than a control group who didn't walk at all. The study didn't identify why pain is necessary. A future investigation will analyze biopsy samples to look into biological changes in the skeletal muscles of participants. The bottom line: Beneficial exercise isn't always a cake walk. Listen to the whisper of a breeze through a forest, or the gentle burbling of a stream over a rocky bed. Pay attention to the birds as they greet each new day with throaty, joyful calls. These sounds from nature not only help calm our busy lives; new research finds they also can confer profound health and well-being benefits. Researchers in Canada reviewed two dozen studies that examined the benefits of natural sounds. Participants overwhelmingly reported less stress, improved mood and health, such as lower pain levels, after listening to recordings of nature sounds. Water sounds helped the most with health, while bird sounds alleviated stress and annoyance. The researchers noted humans are hardwired to listen for signals of danger and security. An environment of natural sounds feels safe. It allows us to let our guard down, reducing stress and encouraging mental recuperation. One study they reviewed found people who spent just two hours each week outside in nature \u2014 including parks, woodlands and beaches \u2014 reported greater well-being than people who spent less time outdoors. Another study, involving more than 8 million people from seven countries, showed people living near green spaces tended to live longer than those living in more urban environments. The absence of natural sounds has been shown to lead to heightened vigilance and induce a more alert, aroused state. For this reason, the researchers recommend that urban planners include more water features and other natural elements in parks to help restore a sense of calmness for city dwellers. Do yourself a favor and make time to take in the music of nature. It's the soundtrack of a healthy life. With all the equine vaccines available these days, how do you know which are best for your horse? Core vaccines are those designated as medically necessary by veterinary authorities, such as the American Association of Equine Practitioners. This designation is based on how widespread a disease is, how dangerous it can be for horses and whether it can affect people, too. A rabies vaccine is core because the disease can be transmitted to people and is almost always fatal in mammals. Tetanus vaccine protects horses from life-threatening infections that can develop in deep skin wounds. Other core vaccines protect against serious mosquito-borne viral diseases: Eastern and Western equine encephalitis and West Nile virus. Beyond these, ask your veterinarian which other vaccines might be recommended to keep your horse in top form. These days, it's not unusual for cats to live into their late teens or later. But some of these seniors develop an Alzheimer-type disease called feline cognitive disorder, or FCD. It's easy to mistake FCD for behavioral issues. Some cats cry, wander aimlessly or get lost in their own homes. Others forget their fastidious litter box habits. Feline personalities can even take a 180-degree turn. We can't stop our cat's brains from aging, but we can offer them mental boosts throughout life. First, make time for play every day\u2014even if it's just tossing a wad of paper or waving a ribbon in the air. Adding perches near windows is entertaining, too. And check out some of the cat toys that dole out treats. The bottom line? Minding our cats' mental acuity as much as their physical fitness can pay dividends during their golden years. When it comes to improving the quality of your sleep, Barry Manilow might be a better friend than Twisted Sister. For those who are not children of the '80s, the latter musical act was a heavy metal band. Barry Manilow, however, needs no introduction. A study out of Taiwan has found adults ages 60 and up slept better when they listened to music 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime. But not just any music. Calmer, less-rhythmic music appeared to be most beneficial. The findings appear to mirror previous investigations that showed people in all age groups improved their sleep when they tune out at night with some good vibrations. As we age, researchers note, our sleep patterns deteriorate. And that can impact your good health. Scientists say that ideally, older adults require seven to nine hours of shut-eye. In the current study, nearly 300 people were separted into two groups, one that listened to music at bedtime and another that didn't. During the trial, participants also were asked to rank how well they were sleeping on a scale from 0 to 21. Researchers say calming music with a tempo between 60 and 80 beats with a smooth melody appeared to work best at getting people to nod off. They suggested it might have something to do with slowing the heart rate and breathing, along with lowering blood pressure. A similar study in 2008 among young people indicated the same biological mechanisms were at play. The scientists in that study found classical music improved sleep patterns. So, if you're having a hard time getting to sleep, some soothing strains might substitute for a pharmaceutical sleeping aid. Think elevator music, carrying you off "}
