In the aftermath of these tragic events, we, as a Nation, have demonstrated firm resolve in protecting ourcritical infrastructures and key assets from further terrorist exploitation. In this effort, government at alllevels, the private sector, and concerned citizens across the country have begun an important partnershipand commitment to action. To address the threat posed by those who wish to harm the United States, critical infrastructure owners and operators are assessing their vulnerabilities and increasing their investment in security. State andmunicipal governments across the country continue to take important steps to identify and assure the protection of key assets and services within their jurisdictions. Federal departments and agencies areworking closely with industry to take stock of key assets and facilitate protective actions, while improvingthe timely exchange of important security-related information. The Office of Homeland Security isworking closely with key public- and private-sector entities to implement the Homeland Security Advisory System across all levels of government and the critical sectors. Finally, I commend the Members of Congress for working diligently to pass comprehensive legislation that will unify our national critical infrastructure and key asset protection efforts in the new Department of Homeland Security. Much work remains, however, to insure that we sustain these initial efforts over the long term. This National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets represents the first milestone in the road ahead. Consistent with the National Strategy for Homeland Security ,this document identifies a clear set of goals and objectives and outlines the guiding principles that will underpin our efforts to secure the infrastructures and assets vital to our public health and safety, national security, governance, economy, andpublic confidence. It provides a unifying structure, defines roles and responsibilities, and identifies majorinitiatives that will drive our near-term protection priorities. Most importantly, it establishes a foundationfor building and fostering a cooperative environment in which government, industry, and private citizens can work together to protect our critical infrastructures and key assets. the white house washingtonThe National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets is the product of many months of consultation across a broad range of public- and private-sector stakeholders.It includes extensive input from the federal departments and agencies, state and municipal government,private-sector infrastructure owners and operators, the scientific and technology community, professionalassociations, research institutes, and concerned citizens across the country. This document is a trulynational strategy. As we work to implement this Strategy ,it is important to remember that protection of our critical infrastructures and key assets is a shared responsibility. Accordingly, the success of our protective effortswill require close cooperation between government and the private sector at all levels. Each of us has an extremely important role to play in protecting the infrastructures and assets that are the basis for ourdaily lives and that represent important components of our national power and prestige. The terrorist enemy that we face is highly determined, patient, and adaptive. In confronting this threat, protecting our critical infrastructures and key assets represents an enormous challenge. We must remain united in our resolve, tenacious in our approach, and harmonious in our actions to overcome this challenge and secure the foundations of our Nation and way of life. v Executive Summary .............................................................................................................. ......vii Introduction................................................................................................................... ...............1 The Case for Action ............................................................................................................ .........5 National Policy and Guiding Principles .....................................................................................11 Organizing and Partnering for Critical Infrastructure and Key Asset Protection ......................15Cross-Sector Security Priorities............................................................................................... ...21 Planning and Resource Allocation........................................................................................22 Information Sharing and Indications and Warnings ............................................................25Personnel Surety, Building Human Capital, and Awareness ................................................28 Technology and Research & Development ..........................................................................31 Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis .....................................................................................33 Securing Critical Infrastructures.............................................................................................. ...35 Agriculture and Food........................................................................................................... .36 Water .......................................................................................................................... ..........39 Public Health.................................................................................................................. ......41 Emergency Services ............................................................................................................. .43 Defense Industrial Base ........................................................................................................ 45 Telecommunications ............................................................................................................. 47 Energy......................................................................................................................... ..........50 Transportation................................................................................................................. ......54 Banking and Finance ............................................................................................................ 63 Chemical Industry and Hazardous Materials .......................................................................65Postal and Shipping ............................................................................................................ ..67 Protecting Key Assets .......................................................................................................... .......71 National Monuments and Icons ...........................................................................................72 Nuclear Power Plants........................................................................................................... .74 Dams........................................................................................................................... ..........76 Government Facilities.......................................................................................................... .77 Commercial Key Assets ........................................................................................................78 Conclusion..................................................................................................................... .............81 Acronyms....................................................................................................................... .............83vi This document defines the road ahead for a core mission area identified in the President's National Strategy for Homeland Security \u2014reducing the Nation's vulnerability to acts of terrorism by protecting our crit-ical infrastructures and key assets from physical attack. This document, the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets ,the Strategy ,identifies a clear set of national goals and objectives and outlines the guiding principles that willunderpin our efforts to secure the infrastructures andassets vital to our national security, governance, publichealth and safety, economy, and public confidence. ThisStrategy also provides a unifying organization and identifies specific initiatives to drive our near-termnational protection priorities and inform the resourceallocation process. Most importantly, it establishes afoundation for building and fostering the cooperativeenvironment in which government, industry, andprivate citizens can carry out their respective protectionresponsibilities more effectively and efficiently. This Strategy recognizes the many important steps that public and private entities across the country havetaken in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks toimprove the security of their critical facilities, systems,and functions. Building upon these efforts, this docu-ment provides direction to the federal departments andagencies that have a role in critical infrastructure andkey asset protection. It also suggests steps that stateand local governments, private sector entities, andconcerned citizens across America can take to enhanceour collective infrastructure and asset security. In thislight, this Strategy belongs and applies to the Nation as a whole, not just to the federal government or itsconstituent departments and agencies. A New Mission The September 11 attacks demonstrated our national-level physical vulnerability to the threat posed by aformidable enemy-focused, mass destruction terrorism.The events of that day also validated how determined,patient, and sophisticated\u2014in both planning andexecution\u2014our terrorist enemies have become. Thebasic nature of our free society greatly enables terroristoperations and tactics, while, at the same time, hindersour ability to predict, prevent, or mitigate the effects ofterrorist acts. Given these realities, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive national approach to physical protection. Defining the End State: Strategic Objectives The strategic objectives that underpin our national critical infrastructure and key asset protection effort include: Identifying and assuring the protection of those infrastructures and assets that we deem most criticalin terms of national-level public health and safety,governance, economic and national security, andpublic confidence consequences; Providing timely warning and assuring the protec- tion of those infrastructures and assets that face aspecific, imminent threat; and Assuring the protection of other infrastructures and assets that may become terrorist targets over time bypursuing specific initiatives and enabling a collabo-rative environment in which federal, state, and localgovernments and the private sector can betterprotect the infrastructures and assets they control. Homeland Security and Infrastructure Protection: A Shared Responsibility Protecting America's critical infrastructures and key assets calls for a transition to a new national coopera-tive paradigm. The basic tenets of homeland security are fundamentally different from the historically definedtenets of national security. Traditionally, national security has been recognized largely as the responsibility of the federal government. National security is under- pinned by the collective efforts of the military, foreignpolicy establishment, and intelligence community in the defense of our airspace and national borders,as well as operations overseas to protect our national interests. Homeland security ,particularly in the context of critical infrastructure and key asset protection, is a sharedresponsibility that cannot be accomplished by the federal government alone. It requires coordinatedaction on the part of federal, state, and local govern-ments; the private sector; and concerned citizens acrossthe country. 1 vii To build and implement a robust strategy to protect our critical infrastructures and key assets from furtherterrorist exploitation, we must understand the motiva-tions of our enemies as well as their preferred tacticsand targets. We must complement this understandingwith a comprehensive assessment of the infrastructuresand assets to be protected, their vulnerabilities, and thechallenges associated with eliminating or mitigatingthose vulnerabilities\u2014a task that will require theconcerted efforts of our entire Nation. The Importance of Critical Infrastructures America's critical infrastructure sectors provide the foundation for our national security, governance,economic vitality, and way of life. Furthermore, theircontinued reliability, robustness, and resiliency create asense of confidence and form an important part of ournational identity and purpose. Critical infrastructuresframe our daily lives and enable us to enjoy one of thehighest overall standards of living in the world. The facilities, systems, and functions that comprise our critical infrastructures are highly sophisticated andcomplex. They include human assets and physical andcyber systems that work together in processes that are highly interdependent. They also consist of key nodesthat, in turn, are essential to the operation of the critical infrastructures in which they function. The Importance of Key Assets Key assets and high profile events are individual targets whose attack\u2014in the worst-case scenarios\u2014couldresult in not only large-scale human casualties and property destruction, but also profound damage to ournational prestige, morale, and confidence. Individually, key assets like nuclear power plants and dams may not be vital to the continuity of critical serv-ices at the national level. However, a successful strikeagainst such targets may result in a significant loss oflife and property in addition to long-term, adversepublic health and safety consequences. Other key assetsare symbolically equated with traditional Americanvalues and institutions or U.S. political and economicpower. Our national icons, monuments, and historicalattractions preserve history, honor achievements, andrepresent the natural grandeur of our country. They celebrate our American ideals and way of life andpresent attractive targets for terrorists, particularly whencoupled with high profile events and celebratory activi-ties that bring together significant numbers of people.Understanding the Threat Characteristics of Terrorism The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon underscore the determination of ourterrorist enemies. Terrorists are relentless and patient,as evidenced by their persistent targeting of the WorldTrade Center towers over the years. Terrorists are also opportunistic and flexible. They learn from experienceand modify their tactics and targets to exploit perceivedvulnerabilities and avoid observed strengths. As secu-rity increases around more predictable targets, they shift their focus to less protected assets. Enhancingcountermeasures for any one terrorist tactic or target,therefore, makes it more likely that terrorists will favor another. The Nature of Possible Attacks Terrorists' pursuit of their long-term strategic objec- tives includes attacks on critical infrastructures and keyassets. Terrorists target critical infrastructures toachieve three general types of effects: Direct infrastructure effects: Cascading disruption or arrest of the functions of critical infrastructures orkey assets through direct attacks on a critical node,system, or function. Indirect infrastructure effects: Cascading disruption and financial consequences for government, society,and economy through public- and private-sectorreactions to an attack. Exploitation of infrastructure: Exploitation of elements of a particular infrastructure to disrupt ordestroy another target. This Strategy reaffirms our longstanding national policy regarding critical infrastructure and key assetprotection. It also delineates a set of guiding principlesthat will underpin our domestic protection strategy. Statement of National Policy As a Nation we remain committed to protecting our critical infrastructures and key assets from acts ofterrorism that would: Impair the federal government's ability to perform essential national and homeland security missionsand ensure the general public's health and safety; Undermine state and local government capacities to maintain order and to deliver minimum essentialpublic services; viii Damage the private sector's capability to ensure the orderly functioning of the economy and the deliveryof essential services; and Undermine the public's morale and confidence in our national economic and political institutions. We must work collaboratively to employ the tools necessary to implement such protection. Guiding Principles Eight guiding principles underpin this Strategy : Assure public safety, public confidence, and services; Establish responsibility and accountability; Encourage and facilitate partnering among all levels of government and between government and industry; Encourage market solutions wherever possible and compensate for market failure with focused government intervention; Facilitate meaningful information sharing; Foster international cooperation; Develop technologies and expertise to combat terrorist threats; and Safeguard privacy and constitutional freedoms. Implementing this Strategy requires a unifying organi- zation, a clear purpose, a common understanding of roles and responsibilities, accountability, and a set of well-understood coordinating processes. A solid organizational scheme sets the stage for effectiveengagement and interaction between the public andprivate sectors at all levels. Without it, the tasks ofcoordinating and integrating domestic protectionpolicy, planning, resource allocation, performancemeasurement, and enabling initiatives across federal,state, and local governments and the private sector arevirtually impossible to accomplish. Our strategy foraction must provide the foundation these entities canuse to achieve common objectives, applying their corecapabilities, expertise, and experience as necessary to meet the threat at hand. Federal Government Responsibilities The federal government has the capacity to organize, convene, and coordinate broadly across governmentaljurisdictions and the private sector. It has the responsi- bility to develop coherent national policies, strategies,and programs for implementation. In the context ofhomeland security, the federal government will coordi-nate the complementary efforts and capabilities ofgovernment and private institutions to raise our level of protection over the long term as appropriate for eachof our critical infrastructures and key assets. Every terrorist event has a potential national impact. The federal government will, therefore, take the lead to ensure that the three principal objectives detailed in the Introduction of this Strategy are met. This leadership role involves: Taking stock of our most critical facilities, systems, and functions and monitoring their preparednessacross economic sectors and governmental jurisdictions; Assuring that federal, state, local, and private entities work together to protect critical facilities,systems, and functions that face an imminent threatand/or whose loss could have significant nationalconsequences; Providing and coordinating national-level threat information, assessments, and warnings that aretimely, actionable, and relevant to state, local, andprivate sector partners; Creating and implementing comprehensive, multi-tiered protection policies and programs; Exploring potential options for enablers and incentives to encourage stakeholders to devise solutions to their unique protection impediments; Developing cross-sector and cross-jurisdictional protection standards, guidelines, criteria, and protocols; Facilitating the sharing of critical infrastructure and key asset protection best practices and processes andvulnerability assessment methodologies; Conducting demonstration projects and pilot programs; Seeding the development and transfer of advanced technologies while taking advantage of private-sector expertise and competencies; Promoting national-level critical infrastructure and key asset protection education and awareness; and Improving the federal government's ability to work with state and local responders and service providers. ixFederal Lead Departments and Agencies The National Strategy for Homeland Security provides a sector-based organizational scheme for protecting critical infrastructure and key assets. It identifies thefederal lead departments and agencies responsible forcoordinating protection activities and developing andmaintaining collaborative relationships with their stateand local government and industry counterparts in thecritical sectors. In addition to securing federally owned and operated infrastructures and assets, the role of the federal leaddepartments and agencies is to assist state and localgovernments and private-sector partners in their efforts to: Organize and conduct protection and continuity of government and operations planning, and elevateawareness and understanding of threats and vulnerabilities to their critical facilities, systems,and functions; Identify and promote effective sector-specific protection practices and methodologies; and Expand voluntary security-related information sharing among private entities within the sector, aswell as between government and private entities. Department of Homeland Security The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will provide overall cross-sector coordination in this neworganizational scheme, serving as the primary liaisonand facilitator for cooperation among federal agencies,state and local governments, and the private sector. Asthe cross-sector coordinator, DHS will also be respon-sible for the detailed refinement and implementationof the core elements of this Strategy . Other Federal Departments and Agencies Besides the designated federal lead departments and agencies, the federal government will rely on theunique expertise of other departments and agencies toenhance the physical protection dimension of home-land security. Additionally, overall sector initiatives willoften include an international component or require-ment, require the development of a coordinatedrelationship with other governments or agencies, and entail information sharing with foreign governments.Accordingly, the Department of State (DoS) will support the development and implementation of sectorprotection initiatives by laying the groundwork forbilateral and multilateral infrastructure protectiveagreements with our international allies.State and Local Government Responsibilities The 50 states, 4 territories, and 87,000 local jurisdic- tions that comprise this Nation have an important andunique role to play in the protection of our criticalinfrastructures and key assets. State and local govern-ments, like the federal government, should identify andsecure the critical infrastructures and key assets theyown and operate within their jurisdictions. States should also engender coordination of protective and emergency response activities and resource supportamong local jurisdictions and regions in close collabo-ration with designated federal lead departments andagencies. States should further facilitate coordinatedplanning and preparedness for critical infrastructureand key asset protection, applying unified criteria fordetermining criticality, prioritizing protection invest-ments, and exercising preparedness within theirjurisdictions. States should also act as conduits forrequests for federal assistance when the threat at hand exceeds the capabilities of local jurisdictions andprivate entities within those jurisdictions. Finally,states should facilitate the exchange of relevant securityinformation and threat alerts down to the local level. State and local governments look to the federal government for coordination, support, and resourceswhen national requirements exceed local capabilities.Protecting critical infrastructures and key assets will require a close and extensive cooperation among all three levels of government. DHS, in particular, isdesigned to provide a single point of coordination withstate and local governments for homeland securityissues, including the critical infrastructure and key assetprotection mission area. Other federal lead depart-ments and agencies and law enforcement organizationswill provide support as needed and appropriate forspecific critical infrastructure and key asset protection requirements. Private Sector Responsibilities The lion's share of our critical infrastructures and key assets are owned and operated by the private sector.Customarily, private sector firms prudently engage inrisk management planning and invest in security as a necessary function of business operations and customerconfidence. Moreover, in the present threat environ-ment, the private sector generally remains the first lineof defense for its own facilities. Consequently, private-sector owners and operators should reassess and adjusttheir planning, assurance, and investment programs tobetter accommodate the increased risk presented bydeliberate acts of violence. Since the events of x September 11, many businesses have increased their threshold investments and undertaken enhancementsin security in an effort to meet the demands of the new threat environment. For most enterprises, the level of investment in security reflects implicit risk-versus-consequence tradeoffs, which are based on: (1) what is known about the riskenvironment; and (2) what is economically justifiableand sustainable in a competitive marketplace or in anenvironment of limited government resources. Giventhe dynamic nature of the terrorist threat and theseverity of the consequences associated with manypotential attack scenarios, the private sector naturallylooks to the government for better information to helpmake its crucial security investment decisions. Similarly, the private sector looks to the government for assistance when the threat at hand exceeds anenterprise's capability to protect itself beyond a reason-able level of additional investment. In this light, thefederal government will collaborate with the privatesector (and state and local governments) to assure theprotection of nationally critical infrastructures andassets; provide timely warning and assure the protec-tion of infrastructures and assets that face a specific,imminent threat; and promote an environment inwhich the private sector can better carry out its specificprotection responsibilities. Near-term Roadmap: Cross-Sector Security Priorities The issues and security initiatives outlined in the Cross-Sector Security Priorities chapter of this document represent important, near-term national priorities. They are focused on impediments to physical protec-tion that significantly impact multiple sectors of ourgovernment, society, and economy. Potential solutionsto the problems identified\u2014such as informationsharing and threat indications and warning\u2014are high-leverage areas that, when realized, will enhance theNation's collective ability to protect critical infrastruc- tures and key assets across the board. Accordingly,DHS and designated federal lead departments andagencies will prepare detailed implementation plans tosupport the activities outlined in this chapter. This Strategy identifies major cross-sector initiatives in five areas: Planning and Resource Allocation: This Strategy identifies eight major initiatives in this area. Create collaborative mechanisms for government- industry critical infrastructure and key assetprotection planning; Identify key protection priorities and develop appropriate supporting mechanisms for these priorities; Foster increased sharing of risk-management expertise between the public and private sectors; Identify options for incentives for private organizations that proactively implement enhanced security measures; Coordinate and consolidate federal and state protection plans; Establish a task force to review legal impediments to reconstitution and recovery in the aftermath of an attack against a critical infrastructure or key asset; Develop an integrated critical infrastructure and key asset geospatial database; and Conduct critical infrastructure protection planning with our international partners. Information Sharing and Indications and Warnings: This Strategy identifies six major initiatives in this area. Define protection-related information sharing requirements and establish effective, efficient information sharing processes; Implement the statutory authorities and powers of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to protect security and proprietary information regarded assensitive by the private sector; Promote the development and operation of critical sector Information Sharing Analysis Centers; Improve processes for domestic threat data collection, analysis, and dissemination to state and local government and private industry; Support the development of interoperable secure communications systems for state and local govern-ments and designated private sector entities; and Complete implementation of the Homeland Security Advisory System. Personnel Surety, Building Human Capital, and Awareness: This Strategy identifies six major initiatives in this area. Coordinate the development of national standards for personnel surety; Develop a certification program for background- screening companies; xi Explore establishment of a certification regime or model security training program for private security officers; Identify requirements and develop programs to protect critical personnel; Facilitate the sharing of public- and private-sector protection expertise; and Develop and implement a national awareness program for critical infrastructure and keyasset protection. Technology and Research & Development: This Strategy identifies four major initiatives in this area. Coordinate public- and private-sector security research and development activities; Coordinate interoperability standards to ensure compatibility of communications systems; Explore methods to authenticate and verify personnel identity; and Improve technical surveillance, monitoring and detection capabilities. Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis: This Strategy identifies seven major initiatives in this area. Enable the integration of modeling, simulation, and analysis into national infrastructure and assetprotection planning and decision support activities; Develop economic models of near- and long-term effects of terrorist attacks; Develop critical node/chokepoint and interdependency analysis capabilities; Model interdependencies across sectors with respect to conflicts between sector alert and warning procedures and actions; Conduct integrated risk modeling of cyber and physical threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences;and Develop models to improve information integration. Unique Protection Areas In addition to the cross-sector themes addressed in this Strategy ,the individual critical infrastructure sectorsand special categories of key assets have unique issues that require action. These considerations and associatedenabling initiatives are discussed in the last two chapters of this Strategy : Securing Critical Infrastructures: This Strategy identifies major protection initiatives for the following criticalinfrastructure sectors: Agriculture and Food Water Public Health Emergency Services Defense Industrial Base Telecommunications Energy Transportation Banking and Finance Chemicals and Hazardous Materials Postal and Shipping Protecting Key Assets: This Strategy identifies major protection initiatives for the following key asset categories: National Monuments and Icons Nuclear Power Plants Dams Government FacilitiesC ommercial Key Assets ________ 1 The National Strategy for Homeland Security defines \"State\" to mean \"any state of the United States, the District ofColumbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, AmericanSamoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the trust territory of the Pacific Islands.\" TheStrategy defines \"local government\" as \"any county, city, village, town, district, or other political subdivision of anystate, any Native American tribe or authorized tribal organi-zation, or Alaska native village or organization, and includes any rural community or unincorporated town or village orany other public entity for which and application for assistance is made by a state or political subdivision thereof.\" xii On July 16, 2002, President Bush issued the National Strategy for Homeland Security ,an overarching strategy for mobilizing and organizing our Nation to secure theU.S.homeland from terrorist attacks. It communicates a comprehensive approach \"based on the principles ofshared responsibility and partnership with Congress,state and local governments, the private sector, and theAmerican people\"\u2014a truly natio naleffort, not merely a federal one. The National Strategy for Homeland Security defines \"homeland security\" and identifies a strategic framework based on three national objectives. In orderof priority, these are: (1) preventing terrorist attackswithin the United States, (2) reducing America'svulnerability to terrorism, and (3) minimizing thedamage and recovering from attacks that do occur. To attain these objectives, the National Strategy for Homeland Security aligns our homeland security efforts into six critical mission areas: intelligence and warning,border and transportation security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infrastructures and keyassets, defending against catastrophic terrorism, andemergency preparedness and response. This document, the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets ,the Strategy , 1takes the next step to facilitate the strategic planning process for a core mission area identified in 1 \"The United States will forge an unprecedented level of cooperation throughout all levels of government, with private industry and institutions, and with the American people to protect our critical infrastructure and key assets from terrorist attack.\" -The National Strategy for Homeland Security Intelligence and Warning Border and Transportation SecurityDomestic Counter-terrorismProtecting Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets Defending against Catastrophic TerrorismEmergency Preparedness and Responsethe National Strategy for Homeland Security \u2014reducing the Nation's vulnerability by protecting our criticalinfrastructures and key assets from physical attack. Itidentifies a clear set of national goals and objectivesand outlines the guiding principles that will underpinour efforts to secure the infrastructures and assets vitalto our national security, governance, public health andsafety, economy, and public confidence. It also providesa unifying organizational structure and identifiesspecific initiatives to drive our near-term nationalprotection priorities and inform the resource allocationprocess. Most importantly, it provides a foundation forbuilding and fostering the cooperative environment inwhich government, industry, and private citizens cancarry out their respective protection responsibilities more effectively and efficiently. This Strategy recognizes the many important steps that public and private entities across the country have taken in response to the World Trade Center andPentagon attacks on September 11, 2001, to improve the security of their critical facilities, systems, andfunctions. Building on these efforts, this Strategy provides direction to the federal departments andagencies that have a role in critical infrastructure andkey asset protection. It also suggests steps that stateand local governments, private sector entities, andconcerned citizens across America can take to enhance our collective infrastructure and asset security.Accordingly, this Strategy belongs and applies to the Nation as a whole, not just to the federal government or its constituent departments and agencies. This Strategy complements the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace ,which focuses on the identification, assessment, and protection of interconnected informa-tion systems and networks. The Physical and Cyber Strategies share common underlying policy objectives and principles. Together, they form the road ahead forone of our core homeland security mission areas. The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centerand the Pentagon demonstrated our national-levelphysical vulnerability to the threat posed by a formi-dable enemy\u2014focused, mass destruction terrorism.The events of that day also validated how determined,patient, and sophisticated\u2014in both planning andexecution\u2014our terrorist enemies have become.Ironically, the basic nature of our free society greatly enables terrorist operations and tactics, while, at thesame time, it hinders our ability to predict, prevent,or mitigate the effects of terrorist acts. Given these realities, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive national approach to physical protection. Protecting America's critical infrastructures and key assets represents an enormous challenge. Our Nation'scritical infrastructures and key assets are a highlycomplex, heterogeneous, and interdependent mix offacilities, systems, and functions that are vulnerable to awide variety of threats. Their sheer numbers, pervasive-ness, and interconnected nature create an almostinfinite array of high-payoff targets for terroristexploitation. Given the immense size and scope of thepotential target set, we cannot assume that we will beable to protect completely all things at all times againstall conceivable threats. As we develop protective measures for one particular type of target, our terroristenemies will likely focus on another. To be effective,our national protection strategy must be based on athorough understanding of these complexities as webuild and implement a focused plan for action. : To frame the initial focus of our national protection effort, we must acknowledge that the assets, systems,and functions that comprise our infrastructure sectorsare not uniformly \"critical\" in nature, particularly in anational or major regional context. The first objective of this Strategy is to identify and assure the protection of those assets, systems, and functions that we deem most \"critical\" in terms ofnational-level public health and safety, governance,economic and national security, and public confidence.We must develop a comprehensive, prioritized assessment of facilities, systems, and functions ofnational-level criticality and monitor their prepared-ness across infrastructure sectors. The federalgovernment will work closely with state and localgovernments and the private sector to establish auniform methodology for determining national-levelcriticality. This methodology will enable a focus onhigh-priority activities and the development of consistent approaches to counter the terrorist threat. The second major objective is to assure the protection of infrastructures and assets that face a specific,imminent threat. Federal, state, and local governmentsand private-sector partners must collaborate closely todevelop thorough assessment and alert processes andsystems to ensure that threatened assets receive timelyadvance warnings. These entities must further cooperate to provide focused protection against theanticipated threat. 2 Finally, as we act to secure our most critical infrastructures and assets, we must remain cognizantthat criticality varies as a function of time, risk, andmarket changes. Acting to better secure our highestpriority facilities, systems, and functions, we shouldexpect our terrorist enemies to shift their destructivefocus to targets they consider less protected and morelikely to yield desired shock effects. Hence, the third objective of this Strategy is to pursue collaborative measures and initiatives to assure the protection ofother potential targets that may become attractive overtime. The focus will be to foster an environment inwhich key public- and private-sector stakeholders canbetter protect the infrastructures and assets theycontrol according to their specific responsibilities,competencies, and capabilities. The last three chapters of this Strategy detail the cross-sector and sector-specific priority solution paths we will pursue to achieve the fullest measure of national protection possible across all categories of critical infrastructures and key assets. : Protecting America's critical infrastructures and key assets calls for a transition to an important newnational cooperative paradigm. The basic tenets ofhomeland security are fundamentally different from the historically defined tenets of national security. Historically, securing the United States entailed theprojection of force outside of our borders. Weprotected ourselves by \"keeping our neighborhood safe\"in the global, geopolitical sense. The capability andresponsibility to carry out this mission rested largely with the federal government. The emergence of international terrorism within our borders has moved the front line of domestic securityto Main Street, U.S.A. Faced with the realities of theSeptember 11 attacks, the mission of protecting our homeland now entails \"keeping our neighborhood safe\"in the most literal sense. Safeguarding our Nationagainst the terrorist threat depends on our ability tomarshal and project appropriate resources inward.Respect for the open, pluralistic nature of our society;the individual rights and liberties of our citizenry; andour federalist system of government define the framework within which security can be implemented. Acting alone, the federal government lacks the comprehensive set of tools and competencies requiredto deliver the most effective protection and response for most homeland security threats. Therefore, tocombat the threat terrorism poses for our critical infrastructures and key assets, we must draw upon theresources and capabilities of those who stand on the new front lines\u2014our local communities and privatesector entities that comprise our national critical infrastructure sectors. Forging this unprecedented level of cooperation will require dramatic changes in the institutional mindsets honed and shaped by Cold War-era regimes. Successin this effort must be built and sustained over time.This Strategy provides a starting point for defining how this national-level cooperation can best be achieved. In the context of a new national cooperative paradigm, this Strategy further serves as an important vehicle for educating the public and achieving realistic expecta-tions on the emergent terrorist threat and the rolesgovernment and industry must play in defendingagainst it. Public understanding and acceptance of thisStrategy is essential. The American public's resilience and support will be sustainable in the aftermath offuture terrorist attacks only if expectations are clearlydefined, attainable, and fulfilled. This Strategy is comprehensive in scope and focused in detail. The following chapters lay out a roadmap toidentify specific priority actions to be taken to assuremore comprehensive protection of our critical infrastructures and key assets. The Case for Action This chapter discusses the role critical infrastruc- tures and key assets play as a foundation of ourNation's economic security, governance, national defense, public health and safety, and public confidence. It describes in greater detail the charac-teristics of terrorism and the challenges we must 3\"Homeland security is a concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur.\" -The National Strategy for Homeland Securityaddress to protect the Nation's critical infrastructures and key assets against this threat. National Policy and Guiding Principles This chapter describes the overarching national policy and guiding principles that underpin thisStrategy and our collective approach to action. Organizing and Partnering for Critical Infrastructure and Key Asset Protection This chapter provides an organizational structure for our national-level critical infrastructure and keyasset protection effort. It also clarifies key public-and private-sector roles and responsibilities andprovides a collaborative framework for cross-sectorand cross-jurisdictional infrastructure and asset protection. Cross-Sector Security Priorities This chapter addresses important cross-sector issues, impediments to action, and the steps necessary to address them. It describes actions tofoster cooperation, lower costs, and provide leverageacross key issue areas for maximum effect. Inconcert, these initiatives form the frameworkthrough which we will align the resources of thefederal budget to the critical infrastructure and key asset protection mission.Securing Critical Infrastructures This chapter outlines protection priorities for the critical infrastructure sectors identified in the National Strategy for Homeland Security .The overviews provided are designed to highlight pressing issues in need of concerted attention at the individualsector level. Each federal lead department and agencywill develop plans and programs to implement orfacilitate these priority sector initiatives. Protecting Key Assets This chapter describes protection considerations for unique facilities, such as dams, nuclear power plants,and national monuments and icons whose attack, in aworst-case scenario, could present significant healthand safety and/or public confidence consequences. Conclusion This chapter summarizes the next steps required to assure comprehensive protection of our criticalinfrastructures and key assets. ________ 1 The primary focus of this Strategy is the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets. The protectivestrategy for information technology and network assets forspecific sectors is discussed in detail in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace .Accordingly, the protection of the Information Technology component of the Information andTelecommunications sector is not discussed in this document. 4 Developing an effective strategy for critical infrastructure and key asset protection requires a clearunderstanding of the threats we face and the potentialconsequences they entail. The September 11 attackswere a wake-up call. Before these devastating events,we, as Americans, considered ourselves relativelyimmune to a massive physical attack on our homeland.Our victory in the Cold War left us with few signifi- cant conventional military threats, and the world of terrorism seemed more the concern of troubled regionslike the Middle East than Middle America. As aNation, we were generally unfamiliar with the motiva- tions of terrorists and the deep hatred behind theiragendas. Furthermore, we underestimated the depthand scope of their capabilities and did not fully appre-ciate the extent to which they would go to carry outtheir destructive acts. The September 11 attackschanged these misconceptions.Al-Qaeda terrorists exploited key elements of our own transportation infrastructure as weapons. Their targetswere key assets symbolic of our national prestige andmilitary and economic power. The effects of the attackscascaded throughout our society, economy, and govern- ment. As a Nation, we became suddenly and painfullyaware of the extent of our domestic vulnerability\u2014more so than at any time since the Second World War. To protect our critical infrastructures and key assets from further terrorist exploitation, we must understandthe intent and objectives of terrorism as well as thetactics and techniques its agents could employ againstvarious types of targets. We must complement thisunderstanding with a comprehensive assessment of theassets to be protected, their vulnerabilities, and thechallenges associated with eliminating or mitigatingthose vulnerabilities\u2014a task that will require theconcerted efforts of our entire Nation. 5 The Importance of Critical Infrastructures America's critical infrastructure sectors provide the goods and services that contribute to a strong nationaldefense and thriving economy. Moreover, theircontinued reliability, robustness, and resiliency create a sense of confidence and form an important part ofour national identity and strategic purpose. They alsoframe our way of life and enable Americans to enjoyone of the highest overall standards of living of anycountry in the world. When we flip a switch, we expect light. When we pick up a phone, we expect a dial tone. When we turn a tap,we expect drinkable water. Electricity, clean water, andtelecommunications are only a few of the critical infra-structure services that we tend to take for granted. Theyhave become so basic in our daily lives that we noticethem only when, for some reason, service is disrupted.When disruption does occur, we expect reasonable explanations and speedy restoration of service. The National Strategy for Homeland Security categorizes our critical infrastructures into the following sectors:Together these industries provide: Production and Delivery of Essential Goods and Services Critical infrastructure sectors such as agriculture, food, and water, along with public health and emergency services, provide the essential goods andservices that Americans depend on to survive. Energy, transportation, banking and financial services, chemical manufacturing, postal services,and shipping sustain the Nation's economy andmake possible and available a continuous array ofgoods and services. Interconnectedness and Operability Information and telecommunications infrastructures connect and increasingly control the operations ofother critical infrastructures. Public Safety and Security Our government institutions guarantee our national security, freedom, and governance, as well as servicesthat make up the Nation's public safety net. The facilities, systems, and functions that comprise our critical infrastructures are highly sophisticated andcomplex. They consist of human capital and physicaland cyber systems that work together in processes thatare highly interdependent. They each encompass aseries of key nodes that are, in turn, essential to theoperation of the critical infrastructures in which theyfunction. To complicate matters further, our most critical infrastructures typically interconnect and,therefore, depend on the continued availability andoperation of other dynamic systems and functions. For example, e-commerce depends on electricity as well as information and communications. Assuringelectric service requires operational transportation anddistribution systems to guarantee the delivery of fuelnecessary to generate power. Such interdependencies 6 Agriculture Food Water Public Health Emergency ServicesGovernmentDefense Industrial BaseInformation and TelecommunicationsEnergyTran sportation Banking and FinanceChemical Industry and Hazardous MaterialsPostal and ShippingCritical infrastructures are \"systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\" - USA Patriot Acthave developed over time and are the product of innovative operational processes that have fueledunprecedented efficiency and productivity. Given thedynamic nature of these interdependent infrastructuresand the extent to which our daily lives rely on them,a successful terrorist attack to disrupt or destroy themcould have tremendous impact beyond the immediatetarget and continue to reverberate long after the immediate damage is done. The Importance of Key Assets Key assets represent individual targets whose destruc- tion could cause large-scale injury, death, or destructionof property, and/or profoundly damage our nationalprestige, and confidence. Such assets and activitiesalone may not be vital to the continuity of critical services on a national scale, but an attack on any one ofthem could produce, in the worst case, significant lossof life and/or public health and safety consequences.This category includes such facilities as nuclear powerplants, dams, and hazardous materials storage facilities. Other key assets are symbolically equated with traditional American values and institutions or U.S.political and economic power. Our national symbols,icons, monuments, and historical attractions preservehistory, honor achievements, and represent the naturalgrandeur of our country. They also celebrate ourAmerican ideals and way of life\u2014a key target ofterrorist attacks. Successful terrorist strikes against suchassets could profoundly impact national public confi-dence. Monuments and icons, furthermore, tend to begathering places for large numbers of people, particu-larly during high-profile celebratory events\u2014a factorthat adds to their attractiveness as targets. Ownership of key assets varies. The private sector owns and operates dams and nuclear power plants as well asmost of this Nation's large buildings holding importantcommercial and/or symbolic value and/or housing largenumbers of people. The protection of national monu-ments and icons often entails overlapping state, local,and federal jurisdictions. Some are managed and oper-ated by private foundations. These realities complicateour protective efforts. Characteristics of Terrorism The September 11 attacks offered undeniable proof that our critical infrastructures and key assets representhigh-value targets for terrorism. The attacks under-scored the determination and patience of our terroristenemies. The highly coordinated nature of the strikesdemonstrated a previously unanticipated level of sophistication in terms of planning and execution.Through these attacks, Al-Qaeda terrorists also showeda dogged resolve in pursuit of their objectives. Whentheir first attempt to topple the World Trade Centertowers failed in 1993, they persisted by planning andexecuting a second attack eight years later that provedto be more successful than even they expected. Our terrorist enemies have proven themselves to be opportunistic and flexible. As illustrated by the twoseparate World Trade Center attacks, they learn fromexperience and modify their tactics accordingly. Theyalso adapt their methods in order to exploit newlyobserved or perceived vulnerabilities. As securityincreases around more predictable targets, they willlikely seek more accessible and less protected facilitiesand events. Enhancing countermeasures against anyone terrorist tactic, therefore, makes it more likely thatterrorists will favor another. Terrorists are inventive and resourceful in terms of target selection, as well as in the selection and use ofspecific instruments of violence and intimidation. Theyexploit vulnerabilities wherever they exist, with anymeans at their disposal, at times and locations of theirchoosing. Terrorists are attempting to acquire a broadrange of weapons, from high-yield conventional explosives and firearms to weapons of mass destruc-tion. Oftentimes the nature of the target will dictatethe weapon of choice. Other times the availability of aparticular type of weapon, such as a nuclear or biological device, will determine target selection.The matching of means to ends is limited only by thecreativity and resources of the terrorists; the onlyconstant is their desire to inflict maximum destruction,injury, and shock in pursuit of their strategic objectives. Terrorism is with us for the foreseeable future. Following the September 11 attacks, President Bush stated that the war on terrorism would be a long-termeffort. While the tools and tactics of terrorists maychange, their fundamental determination remains thesame. Those with enmity toward the U.S. and its interests consider terrorism an effective weapon to useagainst us, and they will continue to employ suchtactics until we can prove that it is not. The Nature of Possible Attacks The terrorist endgame includes a complex mix of political, economic, and psychological objectives. Toachieve their objectives, terrorists may choose to targetcritical infrastructures and key assets as low-risk meansto generate mass casualties, shock, and panic. 7Terrorists target critical infrastructure and key assets to achieve effects that fall into three general categories: Direct infrastructure effects: Cascading disruption or arrest of the functions of critical infrastructures orkey assets through direct attacks on a critical node,system, or function. The immediate damage to facilities and disruption of services that resulted from the attack on theWorld Trade Center towers, which housed critical assets of the financial services sector, are examples ofdirect infrastructure effects. Indirect infrastructure effects: Cascading disruption and financial consequences for government, society,and economy through public- and private-sectorreactions to an attack. Public disengagement from air travel and other facets of the economy as a result of the September11 attacks exemplifies this effect. Mitigating thepotential consequences from these types of attackswill require careful assessment of policy and regula-tory responses, understanding the psychology oftheir impacts, and appropriately weighing the costsand benefits of specific actions in response to small-scale attacks. Exploitation of infrastructure: Exploitation of elements of a particular infrastructure to disrupt ordestroy another target. On September 11, terrorists exploited elements of the aviation infrastructure to attack the World TradeCenter and the Pentagon, which represented seatsof U.S. economic and military power. Determiningthe potential cascading and cross-sector conse-quences of this type of attack is extremely difficult. The New Fr ont Lines Our technologically sophisticated society and institutions present a wide array of potential targets for terrorist exploitation. Our critical infrastructureindustries change rapidly to reflect the demands of themarkets they serve. Much of the expertise required forplanning and taking action to protect critical infrastruc-tures and key assets lies outside the federal government,including precise knowledge of what needs to beprotected. In effect, the front lines of defense in thisnew type of battle have moved into our communitiesand the individual institutions that make up our critical infrastructure sectors.Private industry owns and operates approximately 85 percent of our critical infrastructures and key assets.Facility operators have always been responsible for protecting their physical assets against unauthorizedintruders. These measures, however conventionallyeffective, generally hav e not been designed to cope with significant military or terrorist threats, or the cascadingeconomic and psychological impact they may entail. The unique characteristics of critical infrastructures and key assets, their continuing\u2014often rapid\u2014evolution,and the significant impediments complicating theirprotection will require an unprecedented level of keypublic- and private-sector cooperation and coordination.Our country has more than 87,000 jurisdictions of local governance alone. The challenge ahead is to develop acoordinated and complementary system that reinforcesprotection efforts rather than duplicates them, and thatmeets mutually identified essential requirements. Inaddition, many of our critical infrastructures also spannational borders and, therefore, must be protectedwithin the context of international cooperation. : Our open society, highly creative and responsive economic markets, and system of values that engendersindividual recognition and freedom have created wealthfor our nation, built a strong national security system,and instilled a sense of national confidence in thefuture. Destruction of our traditions, values, and way oflife represents a key objective of our terrorist enemies.Ironically, the tenets of American society that make us free also create an environment that facilitates terrorist operations. As we strive to understand the nature of terrorism and identify appropriate means to defend against it, we willrequire new collaborative structures and mechanisms for working together. During the Cold War era, manygovernment and private organizations isolated parts of their physical and information infrastructures into\"stovepipes\" to assure their protection. This approach is no longer adequate to protect our homeland fromdetermined terrorists. Stimulating voluntary, rapidlyadaptive protection activities requires a culture of trustand ongoing collaboration among relevant public- andprivate-sector stakeholders, rather than more tradi-tional systems of command and control. Security investments made by all levels of government and private industry have increased since theSeptember 11 attacks. As terrorism continues to evolve, so must the way in which we protect our 8 country and ourselves. The costs of protection\u2014 including expenditures to develop new technologies,tools, and procedures\u2014will weigh heavily on all levelsof government and private industry. Consequently, aneffective protection strategy must incorporate well-planned and highly coordinated approaches that havebeen developed by the best minds in our countrythrough innovation and sharing of information, bestpractices, and shared resources. National Resilience: Sustaining Protection for the Long Term Combating terrorism will be a long-term effort. Its dynamic nature means that we must enhance theprotection of our critical infrastructures and key assetsin an environment of persistent and evolving threats. Our Nation's critical infrastructures are generally robust and resilient. These attributes result from decades of experience gained from responding tonatural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, and the deliberate acts of malicious individuals. The critical infrastructure sectors have learned from each disruption and applied those lessons to improve theirprotection, response, and recovery operations. Forexample, during the immediate aftermath of theSeptember 11 attacks, the electric system in New York City remained operational for the island of Manhattanoutside of the World Trade Center complex\u2014GroundZero.Furthermore, needed electric service at Ground Zero was quickly and efficiently restored to support rescue and recovery operations. This success is a good example of American ingenuity, as well as a tenaciousapplication of lessons learned from the 1993 WorldTrade Center bombing and other terrorist events. Resilience is characteristic of most U.S. communities, and it is reflected in the ways they cope with naturaldisasters. Over time, residents of communities in areasthat are persistently subjected to natural disastersbecome accustomed to what to expect when oneoccurs. Institutions and residents in such areas grow tounderstand the nature of catastrophic events, as well astheir roles and responsibilities in managing their after-effects. They are also familiar with and rely on trustedcommunity systems and resources that are in place to support protection, response, and recovery efforts.As a result, they have confidence in their communities'abilities to contend with the aftermath of disasters and learn from each event. Institutions and residents nationwide must likewise come to understand the nature of terrorism, its conse-quences, and the role they play in combating it. Ideally,they will become familiar with and have confidence in 9 Agriculture and Food 1,912,000 farms; 87,000 food-processing plants Water 1,800 federal reservoirs; 1,600 municipal waste water facilities Public Health 5,800 registered hospitals Emergency Services 87,000 U.S. localities Defense Industrial Base 250,000 firms in 215 distinct industries Telecommunications 2 billion miles of cable Energy Electricity 2,800 power plants Oil and Natural Gas 300,000 producing sites Tran sportation Aviation 5,000 public airports Passenger Rail 120,000 miles of major and Railroads railroads Highways, Trucking, 590,000 highway and Busing bridges Pipelines 2 million miles of pipelines Maritime 300 inland/costal ports Mass Transit 500 major urban public transit operators Banking and Finance 26,600 FDIC insured institutions Chemical Industry and 66,000 chemical plants Hazardous Materials Postal and Shipping 137 million delivery sites Key Assets National Monuments 5,800 historic buildings and Icons Nuclear Power Plants 104 commercial nuclear power plants Dams 80,000 dams Government Facilities 3,000 government owned/operated facilities Commercial Assets 460 skyscrapers *These are approximate figures.the protection, response, and recovery mechanisms that exist within their communities. Together with localofficials, private organizations and residents must workto improve these systems and resources to meet thechallenge of safeguarding our country from terrorists. Our challenge is to identify, build upon, and apply the lessons learned from the September 11 attacks toanticipate and protect against future terrorist attacks on our critical infrastructures and key assets. Our ability todo so will determine how successfully we adapt to thecurrent dynamic threat environment and whether wecan emerge as a stronger, more vibrant nation with our values and way of life intact. 10 This document reaffirms our Nation's longstanding policy regarding critical infrastructure and key assetprotection. It also delineates a set of guiding principlesthat underpins our strategy for action to protect ourNation's critical infrastructures and key assets from terrorist attack. As a Nation, we are committed to protecting our critical infrastructures and key assets from acts ofterrorism that would: Impair the federal government's ability to perform essential national security missions and ensure thegeneral public's health and safety; Undermine state and local government capacities to maintain order and to deliver minimum essentialpublic services; Damage the private sector's capability to ensure the orderly functioning of the economy and the deliveryof essential services; and Undermine the public's morale and confidence in our national economic and political institutions. As a Nation, we must utilize every tool at our disposal and work collaboratively to develop and implement theprotective measures that this policy entails. Thestrategic objectives discussed in the Introduction will focus and drive this effort. Our domestic protection efforts are grounded in core strengths and values that we have traditionally reliedupon during major periods of crisis in our Nation'shistory. Using these core strengths and values as aguide, eight principles underpin this Strategy and its associated enabling initiatives: 1. Assure public safety, public confidence, and services Anticipating that widespread or large-scale disruptions will undermine public confidence in ourpolitical and economic institutions, terrorists willcontinue to use horrific violence against people andproperty to impact the efficient functioning of our society and economy. By making strategic improve- ments in security and reducing the vulnerability ofour Nation's critical infrastructures and key assets tosuch physical attack\u2014particularly those involvingthe most catastrophic potential consequences\u2014thisstrategy seeks to reassure the public and reinforce itsconfidence in our institutions and systems. 11 By making our infrastructures and key assets more robust through such measures as deliberate redun- dancies, hardening, and dispersal, we increase theircapacity to withstand attack without sustaining significant damage. Through effective protectionand response planning, we make them moreresilient to allow for the quick restoration of critical services to minimize the detrimental effects to oureconomy and public welfare. Implementing andexercising well-developed plans assures their effectiveness in times of crisis and is key to shapingpublic expectations and instilling confidence in ourNation's ability to manage the aftermath of terrorist attacks. 2. Establish responsibility and accountability This Strategy recognizes the crucial role of government, industry, and the public at large inprotecting our critical infrastructures and key assetsfrom terrorist attack. Our valued heritage of federalism and limited government decentralizes our governance and affords private citizens and institutions with certain rights and freedoms toconduct their lives and businesses. In this context,organizations and individuals outside of the federalgovernment must take the lead in many aspects ofcritical infrastructure and key asset protection. Consequently, a key component of this Strategy is the delineation of roles, responsibilities, andaccountability among the various public- andprivate-sector entities that have an important partto play in domestic protection. This necessarilyencompasses the mechanisms required to coordinateand integrated protection policies, planning,resource management, performance measurement, and enabling initiatives across federal, state, andlocal governments and the private sector. 3. Encourage and facilitate partnering among all levels of government and between government and industry Critical infrastructure and key asset protection concerns span all levels of government as well as the private sector. Protection over the long term isnecessarily a shared responsibility that involvesmustering resources and expertise nationwide. The National Strategy for Homeland Security recognizes the need to mobilize our entire society in a collec-tive effort to defend our homeland. Accordingly, itplaces great emphasis on \"the crucial role of stateand local governments, private institutions, and theAmerican people.\" This principle is central to ourcritical infrastructure and key asset protection effort.Every disruption or attack is initially a local problem. Because of the immediate effects experienced by local communities, state and localgovernments, and private-sector infrastructureowners and operators invariably form the vanguard of response when terrorists strike. Consequently,public confidence depends heavily on how well thecommunity implements protective measures andplans in advance of a crisis. Accordingly, the federalgovernment will provide overall support,coordination, and focused leadership to foster anenvironment in which all stakeholders can bettercarry out their individual protection responsibilities. 4. Encourage market solutions whenever possible; compensate for market failure with focused government intervention Protecting our Nation's critical infrastructures and key assets requires a broad spectrum of possiblegovernment actions, including: improving understanding and awareness of the current threatenvironment; providing threat indications and warnings; investing in research and development;transferring pilot technology; exploring variousforms of financial incentives; and taking targetedregulatory action, where appropriate. Through this Strategy ,the federal government strives to encourage proactive, market-based protectivesolutions. Many of the critical infrastructure sectorsare currently highly regulated, and additional regula-tory directives or mandates should only be necessaryin instances where market forces are insufficient toprompt the investments necessary to assure criticalinfrastructure and key asset protection. They mayalso be used when a uniform national standard orcoordinated response is required to address a particu-larly challenging threat, especially in the context ofcross-sector interdependencies. In many cases, incentives can reinforce knowledge and experience within the private sector and stateand local governments, including the developmentof new tools and innovative processes that areappropriate for their particular systems, operations,and security challenges. Incentives can also help tooffset certain negative aspects of market dynamics,such as the natural tendency of market pressures toeliminate redundancies, and, hence, create singlepoints of failure. 5. Facilitate meaningful information sharing Information sharing underpins any true partnership and is necessary to mitigate the threat posed by acunning, adaptive, and determined enemy. To 12 formulate comprehensive security plans and make informed security investment and action decisions,individuals and institutions alike require timely,accurate, and relevant information. Accordingly, wemust adopt measures to identify and evaluate poten- tial impediments or disincentives to security-relatedinformation sharing and formulate appropriatemeasures to overcome these barriers. We must alsodevelop and facilitate reliable, secure, and efficientcommunications and information systems tosupport meaningful information sharing amongvarious public- and private-sector entities. 6. Foster international security cooperation Following the events of September 11, the United States moved quickly to engage friends and allies around the world in the war on terrorism. We alsotook prompt action with Canada and Mexico toinitiate programs designed to improve the securityof our shared borders and trans-border infrastruc-tures. Further global engagement is needed toprotect our critical infrastructures and key assetsfrom terrorists. In a world characterized by complexinterdependencies, international cooperation is a keycomponent of our protective scheme. 7. Develop technologies and expertise to combat terrorist threats The National Strategy for Homeland Security underscores the importance of science and technology as key elements of homeland security.Our efforts to secure critical infrastructures and key assets must fully leverage our technologicaladvantages to make protection more effective,more efficient, and less costly. Pooling our national resources and fostering collaboration between the public and private sectors will enable us to capitalizeon emerging technologies and enhance our protection against the most lethal threats. Similarly, through advances in modeling, simulation, and analysis we can improve our understanding ofthe complex, interdependent nature of the infra-structures and assets we must protect. Emergentcapabilities in this area will facilitate protection planning, decision making, and resource allocation. 8. Safeguard privacy and constitutional freedoms Our society is a tapestry of diverse races, ethnicities, cultures, religions, and political viewpoints. Thispluralism and our ability as a society to accommo-date diversity significantly contribute to America'sstrength. However, as the National Strategy for Homeland Security observes, our free society is also inherently vulnerable. Nevertheless, achieving secu-rity at the expense of the civil rights and liberties that form an integral part of our national characterwould hand a victory to terrorism. Consequently, we must accept some level of terrorist risk as a persisting condition in our daily lives. The challenge is finding the path that enables us to mitigate risk and defend our country whilepreserving the freedoms and liberties that shape our way of life. In providing for our collectiveprotection, we will respect privacy, the freedom ofexpression, the freedom of movement, the freedomfrom unlawful discrimination, and other cherishedliberties that define us as a Nation. 1314 Implementing a comprehensive national critical infrastructure and key asset protection strategy requiresclear and unifying organization, clarity of purpose, common understanding of roles and responsibilities,accountability, and a set of well-understood coordi-nating processes. A solid organizational scheme setsthe stage for effective engagement and interactionbetween the public and private sectors. Without it,accomplishing the task of coordinating and integratingdomestic protection policy, planning, resource management, performance measurement, and enablinginitiatives across federal, state, and local governments,and the private sector would be impossible. The work of providing a clearly defined and unifying organizational framework began with the publicationof the President's National Strategy for Homeland Security and continues in this document. This chapter clarifies public- and private-sector roles and responsi- bilities for critical infrastructure and key assetprotection. Ultimately, success lies in our ability todraw effectively and efficiently upon the unique corecompetencies and resources of each stakeholder. Giventhe range and complexity of required protection activities and the number of entities involved, clearly-defined authority, accountability, and coordinatingprocesses will provide the foundation for a successfuland sustainable national protection effort. Overlapping federal, state, and local governance and the ownership structure of our critical infrastructuresand key assets present significant protection challenges.The entities involved are diverse, and the level ofunderstanding of protection roles and responsibilitiesdiffers accordingly. Furthermore, these organizationsand individuals represent systems, operations, andinstitutional cultures that are complex and diverse.The range of protective activities that each mustundertake is vast and varies from one enterprise to the next. Finally, overlapping protection authoritiesacross federal, state, and local jurisdictions vary greatly.Success in implementing this Strategy's wide range of protection activities lies in establishing a unifying orga-nizational framework that allows the development ofcomplementary, collaborative relationships and efficiently aligns our Nation's protection resources. In our federalist system of government, federal, state, and local governments and private industry havespecific roles and perform certain functions that mustbe integrated to assure protection. Additionally, eachcritical infrastructure owner/operator possesses uniquecapabilities, expertise, and resources that, when inte- grated appropriately, can contribute to a comprehensivenational protection effort. 15 Federal Government Responsibilities The federal government has fundamental, clearly defined responsibilities under the Constitution.Providing for the common defense and promoting the general welfare of our country are among them. Thefederal government alone has the capability to usemilitary, intelligence, and diplomatic assets to defendAmerica's interests outside its borders. Closer to home,with support from state and local governments, thefederal government has also traditionally led the effortto maintain the security of our borders. To preventterrorists from entering the U.S., the federal govern-ment employs several tools unique to its arsenal,including: military, diplomatic, and intelligence-gathering activities; immigration and naturalizationfunctions; and border agents, customs inspectors,and port and air terminal security. The federal law enforcement apparatus consists of mechanisms that allow it to coordinate multi-jurisdictional approaches to security threats and inci-dents and the pursuit of perpetrators across state linesand overseas. Additionally, federal agencies conductvital research activities, coordinate protection planningand incident management, and provide material andother types of support to state and local authorities.These capabilities serve as elements of deterrence,prevention, protection, and incident response. Beyond such critical services and functions, the federal government has the capacity to organize, convene, andcoordinate across governmental jurisdictions and theprivate sector. It therefore has the responsibility todevelop coherent national policies, strategies, andprograms. In the context of homeland security, thefederal government will coordinate the complementaryefforts and capabilities of government and privateinstitutions to raise our level of protection over thelong term for each of our critical infrastructures andkey assets. Every terrorist event has national impact. The federal government will therefore take the lead to insure that the three principal objectives defined in theIntroduction of this Strategy are met. This leadership role involves: Taking stock of our most critical facilities, systems, and functions and monitoring their preparednessacross sectors and governmental jurisdictions; Assuring that federal, state, local, and private entities work together to protect critical facilities,systems, and functions that face an imminent threatand/or or whose loss would have significant,national-level consequences;Providing and coordinating national threat assess- ments and warnings that are timely, actionable, andrelevant to state, local, and private sector partners; C reating and implementing comprehensive, multi-tiered protection policies and programs; Exploring potential options for enablers and incentives to encourage public- and-private sectorentities to devise solutions to their unique protection impediments; D eveloping protection standards, guidelines, and protocols across sectors and jurisdictions; Facilitating the exchange of critical infrastructure and key asset protection best practices and vulnerability assessment methodologies; C onducting demonstration projects and pilot programs; Seeding the development and transfer of advanced technologies while taking advantage of privatesector expertise and competencies; Promoting national-level critical infrastructure and key asset protection education and awareness; and Improving its ability to work with state and local responders and service providers through partnership. As custodian of many of our Nation's key assets, such as some of our most treasured icons and monuments,and as the owner and operator of mission-critical facil-ities, the federal government also has significant, directprotection responsibilities. Accordingly, the federalgovernment will take appropriate steps to: Identify its own critical facilities, systems, and functions; Identify the critical nodes upon which these assets depend; Assess associated vulnerabilities; and Implement appropriate steps to mitigate those vulnerabilities and protect the infrastructures andassets under its control. Federal Lead Departments and Agencies Each critical infrastructure sector has unique security challenges. The National Strategy for Homeland Security provides a sector-based organizational scheme forprotecting America's critical infrastructures and keyassets. (See Federal Organization for Critical Infrastructure and Key Asset Protection ,p.18.) This organizational scheme identifies the federal leaddepartments and agencies charged with coordinating 16 protection activities and cultivating long-term collabo- rative relationships with their sector counterparts. In addition to securing federally-owned and -operated infrastructures and assets, the roles of the federal leaddepartments and agencies are to assist state and localgovernments and private-sector partners in their efforts to: Organize and conduct protection and continuity of operations planning, and elevate awareness andunderstanding of threats and vulnerabilities to critical facilities, systems, and functions; Identify and promote effective sector-specific, risk-management policies and protection practices and methodologies; and Expand voluntary, protection-related information sharing among private entities within sectors, aswell as between government and private entities. Each federal lead department or agency selects a \"sector liaison,\" who represents industry's primary interfacewith the government. Industry's counterpart, the \"sectorcoordinator,\" is designated by the federal lead depart-ment or agency to serve as a neutral party and facilitatesector coordination for a wide range of planning andactivities to secure critical facilities and systems. The federal government will expand on this model of public-private sector cooperation as a key componentof our strategy for action. Accordingly, the federal leaddepartments and agencies of critical infrastructuresectors newly identified in the National Strategy for Homeland Security will take immediate steps to designate sector liaisons and coordinators and initiateprotection activities. This will include identifying critical facilities, systems, and functions within theirsectors and facilitating the development of sectorprotection plans. Department of Homeland Security The organizational model of federal lead departments and agencies provides a focused leadership structure fornational-level protection coordination and planning.The newly created Department of Homeland Security(DHS) will significantly enhance the effectiveness ofthis model by providing overall cross-sector coordina-tion. In this role, DHS will serve as the primary liaisonand facilitator for cooperation among federal depart-ments and agencies, state and local governments, andthe private sector. As the cross-sector coordinator, DHS will also be responsible for the detailed refinement and implemen- tation of the core elements of this Strategy .This charter includes building and maintaining a complete, current,and accurate assessment of national-level critical assets, systems, and functions, as well as assessing vulnerabili-ties and protective postures across the criticalinfrastructure sectors. DHS will use this information toassess threats, provide timely warnings to threatenedinfrastructures, and build \"red team\" capabilities to evaluate preparedness across sectors and government jurisdictions. Furthermore, DHS will collaborate withother federal departments and agencies, state and localgovernments, and the private sector to define andimplement complementary structures and coordinationprocesses for critical infrastructure and key asset protec-tion. An effective starting point for this effort is theapproach presently employed by federal lead depart-ments and agencies and state and local governments tocooperate when responding to natural disasters. In addition to cross-sector coordination, DHS will act as the federal lead department for several sectors,including government, emergency response, transporta-tion, postal and shipping, and information andtelecommunications. To fulfill these responsibilities, DHS will: Build partnerships with state and local governments and the private sector by designing and implementing its ownprocesses to be open, inclusive, and results-oriented. A ctively develop opportunities to build upon proven models; Identify and share the federal government's core competencies, capabilities, and selected resources toenhance the efforts of its partners; and Facilitate honest brokering and communication between organizations and sectors. Office of Homeland Security The Office of Homeland Security (OHS) will continue to act as the President's principal policy advi-sory staff and coordinating body for major interagencypolicy issues related to Homeland Security, includingthe critical infrastructure and key asset protectionmission area. The functions of OHS will be to adviseand assist the President in the coordination of theExecutive Branch's efforts to detect, prepare for,prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover fromterrorist attacks within the United States. OHS willwork with the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) to integrate and endorse the President's critical infrastructure and key asset protection budgetproposals. Under its existing authority, OHS will alsowork with OMB to certify that the budgets of otherfederal departments and agencies are sufficient to carryout their respective protection missions effectively. 1718 President Secretary of Homeland Security Federal, state, local, and private sector coordination and integration Comprehensive national infrastructure protection plan Mapping threats to vulnerabilities and issuing warnings Sector Lead Agency Agriculture Department of Agriculture Food: Meat and poultry Department of Agriculture All other food products Department of Health & Human Services Water Environmental Protection Agency Public Health Department of Health & Human Services Emergency Services Department of Homeland Security Government: Continuity of government Department of Homeland Security Continuity of operations All departments and agencies Defense Industrial Base Department of Defense Information and Telecommunications Department of Homeland Security Energy Department of Energy Transportation Department of Homeland Security* Banking and Finance Department of the Treasury Chemical Industry and Hazardous Materials Environmental Protection Agency Postal and Shipping Department of Homeland Security National Monuments and Icons Department of the Interior * Under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ,the Transportation Security Administration, responsible for securing our Nation's trans- portation systems, will become part of the Department of Homeland Security. The new Department will coordinate closely with theDepartment of Transportation, which will remain responsible for transportation safety.Other Federal Departments and Agencies Besides the designated federal lead departments and agencies, the federal government will integrate theunique expertise and skill sets of numerous otherdepartments and agencies to enhance the physicalprotection dimension of homeland security. Forexample, the National Institute of Science andTechnology's (NIST's) National Standards and Measurements Laboratory will play a significant role instandards-setting for the critical infrastructure and keyasset protection mission. Recent examples of this roleare reflected in the language of the USA Patriot Act of 2001, Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2002, and National Construction Safety Team Act. Overall sector initiatives will often comprise interna- tional components, require the development ofcoordinated relationships with foreign governments oragencies, and entail information sharing with foreigngovernments. Accordingly, the Department of State(DoS) will support the development and implementa-tion of protection initiatives by laying the groundworkfor bilateral and multilateral infrastructure protectiveagreements with our international friends and allies.Through its unique responsibility to lead U.S. foreignpolicy and support the programs and efforts of otherfederal departments and agencies, DoS will play a keyrole in advancing our critical infrastructure and key asset priorities. State and Local Government Responsibilities The 50 states, 4 territories, and 87,000 local jurisdic- tions that comprise this Nation have an important andunique role to play in the protection of our criticalinfrastructures and key assets. All U.S. states and terri-tories have established homeland security liaison officesto manage their counter-terrorism and infrastructureprotection efforts. In addition, the states have lawenforcement agencies, National Guard units, and othercritical services that can be employed to protect their communities. Like the federal government, states should identify and secure the critical infrastructures and key assets undertheir control. With the support of federal lead depart-ments and agencies, states should also promote thecoordination of protective and emergency responseactivities and resource support among local jurisdic-tions and between regional partners. States shouldfurther facilitate coordinated planning and prepared-ness by applying unified criteria for determiningcriticality, prioritizing protection investments, andexercising preparedness within their jurisdictions. Theyshould also act as conduits for requests for federalassistance when the threat at hand exceeds the capabilities of state and local jurisdictions and the private entities within them. States should also facili-tate the exchange of relevant security information andthreat alerts down to the local level. Many states have well-organized relationships with one another through various organizations, such as theNational Emergency Managers Association and the National Governors Association, as well as through mutual support agreements. Coordinating with one another, they can capitalize on their mutual capabilitiesthrough regional approaches to protection. As provenduring September 11 response efforts, mutual aidagreements and other such successful cooperativeprocesses for crisis management demonstrate thecompetence of various jurisdictions and organizationsto plan and work together. At the onset, every disruption or attack is a local problem. Regardless of who owns and operates theaffected infrastructure, each requires an immediateresponse by local authorities and communities who must support the initial burden of action before the incident escalates to a national event. Local governments represent the front lines of protec- tion and the face of public services to the Americanpeople. Their core competencies must include knowl-edge of their communities, residents, landscapes, andexisting critical services for maintaining public health,safety, and order. Communities look to local leadershipto assure safety, economic opportunities, and quality oflife. Public confidence, therefore, starts locally and isdependent upon how well communities plan and areable to protect their citizens, respond to emergencies,and establish order from chaos. When local authoritiessucceed in preventing or mitigating loss of life or prop-erty, or, as in New York City on September 11, respondto disaster with clarity of purpose and effectiveness,they affirm their capabilities and bolster public confi-dence. For this reason, local communities play criticalroles in preparing their citizens for emergencies and engaging their public and private leadership in thedevelopment of coordinated local and regional plans to assure the protection of residents and businesses. State and local governments look to the federal government for support and resources when nationalrequirements exceed their capabilities to fulfill them. Protecting critical infrastructures and key assets will require a particularly close and well-organized partnership among all levels of government. DHS, inparticular, will provide a single point of coordinationfor state and local governments for homeland securityissues. Other federal lead departments and agenciesand federal law enforcement organizations will provide 19support as needed and appropriate for specific critical infrastructure and key asset protection issues. Private-Sector Responsibilities The lion's share of our critical infrastructures and key assets are owned and operated by the private sector.Customarily, private companies prudently engage inrisk management planning. They also invest in security as a necessary component of their business operationsand to assure customer confidence. In the presentthreat environment, the private sector remains the firstline of defense for its own facilities. Consequently,private-sector owners and operators should reassess and adjust their planning, assurance, and investmentprograms to accommodate the increased risk presentedby deliberate acts of terrorism. Since the events ofSeptember 11, enterprises nationwide have increased their investments in security to meet the demands ofthe new threat environment. For most enterprises, the level of security investment they undertake reflects implicit risk-versus-conse-quence tradeoffs, which are determined based on:(1) what is known about the risk environment,and (2) what is economically justifiable and sustainablein a competitive marketplace or in an environment of limited resources. Given the dynamic nature of theterrorist threat and the severity of the potential consequences associated with many potential attackscenarios, the private sector will look to the government to help better inform its crucial securityinvestment decisions. Similarly, the private sector willrequire assistance when the threat exceeds an enter- prise's capability to protect itself beyond a reasonablelevel of security investment. The federal governmentwill collaborate with public- and private-sector entities to assure the protection of nationally criticalinfrastructures and assets, provide timely warnings andhelp assure the protection of infrastructures that arespecifically threatened, and promote an environment inwhich the private sector can better carry out its specificprotection responsibilities. The availability of both timely, credible information and relevant expertise, complemented by inclusive access to affordable tools and best practices, encourages theprivate sector to make prudent investments earlier andat all levels of the risk management spectrum. By developing mutually beneficial relationships and coordi-nating protection efforts, public-private partnershipcan significantly enhance our Nation's ability to protect its critical infrastructures and key assets. Working with DHS and other federal lead departments and agencies, sector coordinators will play a crucial rolein enabling this collaboration. Sector coordinators will also work with the government to identify, promote,and share industry-specific best practices. To fulfill theirprotection agendas, sector coordinators will rely onDHS and other federal lead departments and agenciesto provide consistent guidance and criteria for sector-specific protection planning and investment as well asfor relevant, actionable, and timely indications andwarnings. The private sector may also require incentivesto stimulate investment. Accordingly, sector liaisons andsector coordinators will work with their counterparts toexplore potential catalysts and reduce the barriers topublic-private sector cooperation. In addition to formal government support, private industry can take many steps to improve its own securityposture across the board. Many industries have devel-oped alliances to sustain reliability and assure publicconfidence in their national-level infrastructures.Because the public's perception of a sector's overallperformance can affect the shareholder values of its individual members, many institutions cooperate withina framework for sharing operational and security-relatedbest practices. Sectors whose constituent enterprises arehighly interconnected have also developed mutual aidagreements to prevent the disruption of one member'ssystems from cascading to others across the sector.Reliability activities of the energy sector, specifically theelectricity industry, are an example of an effective criticalinfrastructure partnership. Even before the September 11 attacks, several critical infrastructure industries had already establishedInformation Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) toformalize information exchange among their membersand improve the management of operational risks fromphysical and cyber disruption. Moreover, many sectororganizations, working with their federal counterparts,have also developed plans to contribute to the nationalprotection effort. Federal support of sector ISACs andprotection planning must now expand to include thenewly designated critical infrastructure sectors. Partnership will provide the foundation for developing and implementing coordinated protection strategies.True partnerships require continuous interaction and, above all, trust. Currently, however, there are barriersimpeding the public and private sectors from achievinga relationship of this level. Many current attitudes andinstitutional relationships, processes, and structures areproducts of a bygone era. Safeguarding our criticalinfrastructures and key assets from terrorism in today'sfluid marketplace and threat environment requires anew, more cooperative set of institutional relationshipsand attitudes. The need for partnering is clear. 20 This chapter addresses the overarching, cross-sector initiatives that represent our national-level priorities forcritical infrastructure and key asset protection. Thefocus is on cross-sector protection issues and activitiesthat require immediate attention, encourage coopera-tion, and increase the cost-effectiveness of securityinvestments. The protection initiatives outlined hereinalso support the three underlying objectives of thisStrategy :(1) identifying and assuring the protection of our most nationally critical infrastructures and assets;(2) providing timely warning and assuring the protec-tion of infrastructures and assets that face a specific,imminent threat; and (3) fostering an environment inwhich all stakeholders can better protect the infrastruc-tures and assets under their control. We have entered a fluid threat environment in which security must be viewed as an integral component ofcore practices and standard operations\u2014not a box tobe checked before addressing other issues. As thethreat of terrorism persists and evolves, we must beable to adapt our security planning and protection efforts to remain effective and sustainable over the longterm. The activities that follow in this Strategy represent the first steps in this national journey. The cross-sector security initiatives addressed in this chapter fall into the following categories: Planning and Resource Allocation Information Sharing and Indications and Warnings Personnel Surety, Building Human Capital, and Awareness Technology and Research & Development M odeling, Simulation, and Analysis Each section describes a cross-sector protection issue as well as the impediments to protection associated with thatissue. It then identifies specific actions that will be takento address those challenges and remove barriers hinderingthe implementation of needed protection activities. 21- Effective and efficient risk assessment, protection planning, and resource allocation go hand in hand.They depend upon the ability of federal, state, and localgovernments, the private sector, and our internationalpartners to work together to articulate and attain theirindividual and shared goals, requirements, and priorities. State and local governments currently face unprece- dented demands for their limited resources. Declines inrevenues mean that states and local communities often lack the resources to undertake a full spectrum ofprudent critical infrastructure protection measures.Because of these resource limitations, federal, state,and local authorities must collaborate more efficientlyto assess, plan, and allocate their limited resources. Industry is likewise coping with the consequences of dynamic threats and difficult economic environments.In some cases, certain critical-sector enterprises areconcentrating their resources solely on remaining inbusiness. To instill greater stability in the securityinvestment process, it will be necessary for private-sector organizations to closely coordinate critical infrastructure protection plans and programs to ensurethat federal and state governments, in particular, under-stand and recognize their future spending landscape. Risk assessment and management must also be closely integrated and coordinated. Industries and institutionsare in need of a common vocabulary and standards toguide their protection efforts. Close cooperationamong all levels of government and the private sectorboth nationally and internationally is essential to devel-oping a shared vernacular and vision for the future.Planning and Resource Allocation Challenges Heavy demands on state and local resources, uncertainties created by a lack of coordination, anddynamics of the terrorist threat underlie many of thechallenges of the domestic protection environment.Since the September 11 attacks, state and local govern- ments have been called upon to provide increasedsecurity for their critical infrastructures and key assets,border areas, airports, and seaports. Unanticipatedrevenue declines have affected most states and chal- lenged their abilities to meet the requirements ofoperating under balanced budgets. Hence, they cannotincrease expenditures to account for additional protective measures without making correspondingreductions in spending for other programs and services. We often rely on state and local jurisdictions to protect key national assets (e.g., bridges, tunnels, nuclear powerplants, dams, and airports). Conversely, state and localgovernments request federal resources at times to ensurethe protection of their own critical infrastructures andkey assets. Under uncertain and sustained elevatedthreat conditions, determining how best to allocate thescarce resources of the various jurisdictions responsiblyand appropriately will require unprecedented levels ofcooperation across all levels of government. Another resource allocation challenge relates to the mechanisms through which states must apply forfederal assistance. Current policies and proceduressometimes create inefficiencies in the federal grantdecision-making process. Because they must seekfunding from various sources according to differentguidelines, state and local government officials oftenview complying with grant requirements and reviewprocesses as leading to duplications of effort.Rectifying the lack of streamlined mechanisms forproviding federal funding to state and local govern-ments will require a thorough cross-agency review. Engaging U.S. states and territories in a collaborative framework for infrastructure protection is anotherimportant planning challenge. State and local lawenforcement agencies and emergency responders arethe first line of defense against deliberate acts ofviolence. In fact, state and local jurisdictions continueto bear a large share of post-September 11 securityexpenditures nationwide. Their concerns andconstraints must be recognized and factored into ournational protective scheme. 22 A key challenge in prioritizing efforts to enhance infrastructure protection is the difficulty in estimatingthe economic damage that could result from a terroristattack. Such damage includes both the immediateeffects of a strike (e.g., losses to plant and equipment)as well as any subsequent long-term economic losses.The cascading effects often overshadow short-termrepercussions over time, yet they are extremely difficult to estimate. Relatively short-term disruptions to criticaloperations can produce significant downstreameconomic effects (e.g., price changes, lost contracts,lost financing, and losses in insurability). Predicting the extent of such effects accurately requires acutesensitivity to the myriad of interdependencies presentin modern industrial and financial markets. In the risk management process, certain aspects of criticality determination may also produce inadvertentconsequences. Designating certain facilities as \"critical\"in conjunction with domestic protection efforts may result in their becoming more difficult and expensive to insure and operate. The federal government must workin concert with other key stakeholders to exploreoptions for incentives to compensate for the costsengendered by the current threat environment. Aligning disparate assessment methodologies presents another challenge. Presently, multiple methodologiesfrom various departments and agencies are currentlybeing used to assess vulnerabilities. In many cases, theyare neither consistent, nor comparable, thereby compli-cating protection planning and resource allocation across the board. Many critical infrastructures also cross international borders, raising unique protection challenges. We must, therefore, work closely with our friends and allies around the world to develop plans to secure the interconnected infrastructures that make up the international marketplace. Planning and Resource Allocation Initiatives It is incumbent in the planning and resource allocation process that federal, state, and local governments andprivate-sector stakeholders work together to: D efine clearly their critical infrastructure and key asset protection objectives; D evelop a business case for action to justify increased security investments; Establish security baselines, standards, and guidelines; and Identify potential incentives for security-related activities where they do not naturally exist in the marketplace.To enable such actions, we will: Create collaborative mechanisms for public- and private-sector critical infrastructure and key asset protection planning DHS and other federal lead departments and agencies will enable and encourage the developmentof clearly defined collaborative mechanisms throughwhich the public and private sectors can cooperatein national-level protection planning and perform-ance measurement. The federal government will alsowork in conjunction with other stakeholders toassess critical infrastructure and asset vulnerabilities,share information, develop protection strategies andplans to eliminate or mitigate these vulnerabilities,and develop restoration and recovery plans forimplementation in the aftermath of an attack. DHSwill assess these sector plans for clarity, comprehen-siveness, consistency, and resource prioritization. DHS will also assimilate the individual sector plans into a comprehensive national plan for critical infrastructure and key asset protection to inform the federal government's annual process of planning,programming, and budgeting for national-levelprotection activities. Identify key protection priorities and develop appropriate supporting mechanisms for these priorities DHS, in collaboration with other key stakeholders, will develop a uniform methodology for identifyingfacilities, systems, and functions with national-levelcriticality to help establish federal, state, and localgovernment and the private-sector protection prior-ities. Using this methodology, DHS will build acomprehensive database to catalog these criticalfacilities, systems, and functions. DHS will alsomaintain a comprehensive, up-to-date assessment of vulnerabilities and preparedness across criticalsectors. This effort will help guide near-termprotective actions and provide a basis for long-termleadership focus and informed resource investment. DHS will furthermore establish a multi-year approach for critical infrastructure and key assetprotection to instill predictability and structure in the planning process. Foster increased sharing of risk-management expertise between the public and private sectors Many different risk assessment methodologies are in use based on a wide variety of requirements andstandards. Government and industry could eachbenefit greatly from the extensive experience of theother. DHS will coordinate the sharing of lessonslearned and best practices to build a common 23domestic protection assessment framework that is adaptable to different user environments. Identify options for incentives for private organizations that proactively implement enhanced security measures Consulting with the private sector, DHS will work with the Department of Commerce (DoC) and the Department of the Treasury to identify appropriate options for developing cost-effectiveincentives to compensate stakeholders for enhancedsecurity investments. This could include rewarding early adopters of new policies or providing various incentives for incorpo-rating security enhancements into critical sectorproducts and services. Coordinate and consolidate federal and state protection plans DHS will work with other federal departments and agencies to consolidate federal protection plans toclarify roles, responsibilities, and expectations. DHS will also work with the states to coordinate protec-tion-planning efforts and provide them with a clearroadmap for action. Additionally, the Homeland Security Advisory System will be coordinated with state-level critical infrastructure and key assetprotection plans. Establish a taskforce to review legal impediments to reconstitution and recovery following an attack against a critical infrastructure or key asset DHS, in concert with the Department of Justice (DoJ), will convene representatives from federal,state, and local governments, and the private sectorto scrutinize regulatory and licensing proceduresthat could impede reconstitution of critical infra-structure service in emergencies and identify optionsfor resolving them. Reconstitution requirements for critical infrastruc- tures may necessitate the waiving of establishedlicensing and regulatory procedures during emergencies. Procedures for establishing these \"post incident rule sets\" need to be predetermined as partof part of a collaborative public-private partnership. Develop an integrated critical infrastructure and key asset geospatial database To enable effective critical infrastructure and key asset protection planning, analysis, and decisionsupport, we must develop an integrated criticalinfrastructure and key asset geospatial database foraccess and specific use by federal, state, and localgovernment officials, and the private sector. A geospatial assurance partnership of appropriate government departments and agencies is needed toserve as the imagery/geospatial data broker, inte-grator, and coordinator for this database. DHS andother federal departments and agencies willcontinue current efforts to acquire data for prioritypopulation centers, domestic critical infrastructuresectors, and transborder infrastructures in coopera-tion with the private sector. This database willprovide a common frame of reference for seniorpublic- and private-sector decision makers andoperational planners in support of vulnerabilityanalysis, domestic preparedness, and incidentmanagement. Conduct critical infrastructure protection planning with our international partners In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, we developed comprehensive bilateral critical infrastruc-ture protection framework agreements and began aseries of protection initiatives with our Canadian andMexican neighbors. DHS, in concert with DoS andother federal departments and agencies will work toexpand this security collaboration to include otherkey international partners. The overall objective of this effort will be to determine our transborder infra-structure vulnerabilities and implement measures toeliminate or mitigate these vulnerabilities. 24 To meet the challenges associated with the terrorist threat, public- and private-sector critical infrastructureand key asset protection stakeholders must have theability to work together seamlessly. The federal government\u2014particularly the intelligence and lawenforcement communities\u2014has a significant role inproviding, coordinating, and ensuring that threat infor-mation is understood across all levels of government.Likewise, state and local law enforcement and private-sector security entities are also valuable sources oflocalized threat information. Additionally, they possessa much better understanding of the vulnerabilitiesimpacting their facilities, systems, and functions thandoes the federal government. Development of acceptedand efficient processes and systems for communicationand exchange of crucial security-related information is critical to bridging existing gaps and building afoundation for cooperation. The difficulties and roadblocks routinely faced by those attempting to share security information serve as majorimpediments to progress in the critical infrastructureand key asset protection mission area. An extraordinarylevel of cooperation and perseverance will be requiredto change the status quo. Federal, state, and localgovernments and the private sector must make everyeffort to promote effective information sharing andembrace efforts to establish timely, effective, and usefulpaths of communication between those who need itmost. Information is a crucial tool in fightingterrorism, and getting the right information to theright party at the right time is a top priority. Adequate protection of our critical infrastructures and key assets requires: Improved collection of threat information; C omprehensive and relevant threat assessment and analysis; Robust indications and warning processes and systems; and Improved coordination of information sharing activities. Accurate, timely information is a fundamental element of our national critical infrastructure and key assetprotection effort. It underpins all components of ourprotection strategy and enables preventive action,warning, preparation, and crisis response. Presently,major impediments exist to accomplishing effectiveinformation sharing among all levels of the public and private sectors. Overcoming these obstacles entails: Identifying what is to be accomplished by exchanging security-related information; D efining the type of information that must be shared to accomplish that purpose; Determining how and when to share and safeguard critical security information most properly; D eciding who the appropriate recipients of such information will be; Assigning responsibility for analyzing information and determining the threat implications; and Assigning responsibility for appropriate action once that information has been analyzed and the threatimplications are clear. Information Sharing and Indications and Warnings Challenges The overall management of information sharing activities among government agencies and between thepublic and private sectors has lacked proper coordinationand facilitation. As a result, the existing national mecha-nisms for collecting threat information, conducting riskanalyses, and disseminating warnings have been inadequate for the domestic protection mission. State and local governments and private sector officials have indicated that the threat information they receivefrom the federal government is often vague, duplicative, 25 and\u2014in some cases\u2014conflicting. They argue that they seldom receive indications and warnings that arespecific, accurate, and timely enough to support difficultresource allocation decisions. Conversely, when relevant, timely information is shared, they point out that it oftenfails to reach the appropriate parties because of securityclearance requirements. Additionally, the current security clearance process is redundant and costly, with lengthy delays. In one example, current regulations require certain state andlocal law enforcement officials to be screened twice, onceby state and local authorities and again by the federalgovernment. We must streamline this process to make itmore responsive to our protection needs. In fact, protecting the Nation's critical infrastructures and key assets may not necessarily require such clear-ance for all stakeholders. If intelligence sources andmethods are omitted, many intelligence reports may bedeclassified. Time-efficient procedures are needed todeclassify relevant intelligence or extract informationfrom classified sources and disseminate that informa-tion to the appropriate recipients. These concerns arecomplicated by the ineffective means by which sensitiveinformation is transferred, as well as the mechanisms currently in place to ensure that required information isdisseminated appropriately. Currently, there is nocentral, coordinating mechanism to assess the impact ofsensitive information and ensure that it gets to all theparties with a need to know. Adding to this problem isthe lack of technical communications systems to enablethe secure transmittal of classified threat information tothe owners and operators of concern. The above issues pose a significant challenge and stand in the way of the partnership our Nation needs to assurethe protection of its critical infrastructures and keyassets. Underlying these issues is an inherent lack oftrust among key stakeholders that we must overcome.Without all pieces of the information puzzle, we operate from a major disadvantage in the fight against terrorism. Information Sharing and Indications and Warnings Initiatives The enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 , the Act,represents substantial progress in removing the legal obstacles that stand in the way of informationsharing between the public and private sectors. The Act provides that critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to DHS, when accompanied byan express statement of the expectation that it will be protected, will be exempt from disclosure under theFreedom of Information Act and state \"Sunshine\" laws. Further, if such information is submitted in good faith,it may not be directly used in civil litigation without the consent of the person submitting it. The Actalso provides for the establishment of governmental procedures for receiving, handling, andstoring voluntarily submitted critical infrastructureinformation and for protecting the confidentiality ofsuch information. It also provides for the developmentof mechanisms that, while preserving confidentiality,also permit the sharing of such information within thefederal government and with state and local govern-ments. The Actauthorizes the federal government to provide advisories, alerts, and warnings to relevantbusinesses, targeted sectors, other governmental actors,and the general public regarding potential threats tocritical infrastructure. The Actalso stipulates that the federal government must protect the source of anyvoluntarily submitted information forming the basis ofa warning as well as any proprietary or other informa-tion that is not properly in the public domain. Finally, the Actenables private-sector actors to enter into voluntary agreements to promote critical infra-structure security, including appropriate forms ofinformation sharing, without incurring the risk ofantitrust liability. Under this new legal regime, DHSwill be able to give proper assurances to private-sectorowners and operators of critical infrastructure that the sensitive or proprietary information that they furnishwill be protected. These assurances will encourage theprivate sector\u2014which is uniquely positioned to provideinformation about the vulnerabilities of the infrastruc-ture it owns and operates\u2014to share that vitalinformation with the government. At the same time,government will ensure that such action does notdiminish competition in the market place. Creating a more effective and efficient information- sharing regime to enable our core protective missionswill require further government leadership and intensecollaboration between public- and private-sector stakeholders. Specific initiatives include efforts to: Define protection-related information sharing requirements and establish effective, efficient information sharing processes One of the first steps we must take is to precisely define information sharing requirements as theypertain to the critical infrastructure and key assetprotection mission. These requirements should focuson the sharing of real-time threat, vulnerability, andincident data; operational inconjunction with DoJ, DoS, and other federal leaddepartments and agencies, will lead efforts to 26 establish this two-way requirements framework in collaboration with other key stakeholders, includinginternational partners. Once requirements are determined, processes must be established to ensurethat the appropriate users can access needed infor-mation in a timely manner. Implement the statutory authorities and powers of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to protect security and proprietary information regarded as sensitive by theprivate sector To facilitate meaningful information exchange between the public and private sectors, we willimplement the provisions of the Actrapidly to encourage the private sector to share sensitive security-related information and incident data.Accordingly, within the framework established by the Act,DHS will work with DoJ, Congress, other federal lead departments and agencies, and statelawmakers to: Implement appropriate protections for the private sector to share vulnerability assessments,incident reports, and other security data withgovernment; and Explore appropriate mechanisms to share and exchange security-related information with ourinternational partners. Promote the development and operation of critical sector Information Sharing Analysis Centers Sector-focused ISACs provide a model for public- private sector information sharing, particularly in thearea of indications and warnings. Numerous criticalinfrastructure sectors use this structure to communi-cate potential risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and incident data among their constituent memberships. ISACs generally have mechanisms in place that allow them to share many categories of relevant,sensitive information in a timely manner. Althoughthe ISACs have proven to be a successful informa-tion sharing model thus far, their capabilities couldbe greatly improved, particularly with respect todeveloping advanced analytical capabilities. DHSand other federal lead departments and agencies will provide increased support to sector efforts toexchange security-related information via theISACs. Additionally, DHS will work with industryto establish processes and mechanisms to helpincorporate state and local government participationinto the ISAC process.Improve processes for domestic threat data collection, analysis, and dissemination to state and local governmentand private industry Our intelligence community has longstanding processes for collection, analysis, and disseminationof information on threats to our national securityinterests. We must establish similar collection andassessment processes are needed to integrate infor-mation from all sources in the context of domesticcritical infrastructure and key asset protection. Additional processes must be put in place to ensure that state and local law enforcement and infrastruc-ture and key asset owners and operators have fulland timely access to needed information, includingassessments of terrorist organization tactics, tech-niques, and procedures; assessments of terroristcapabilities and motivations; lessons learned from terrorist operations in other countries; and the comprehensive mapping of these products tosector vulnerabilities. DHS, in collaboration with the intelligence commu- nity and the DoJ, will develop comprehensive threatcollection, assessment, and dissemination processesthat integrate intelligence and law enforcementcapabilities relevant to the domestic protection mission. They will also develop processes to ensurethat the results of this fusion of relevant intelligenceand law enforcement data are disseminated to theappropriate stakeholders in a timely manner. Thisincludes exploring ways to expedite the conduct ofnecessary background checks and issuance of securityclearances to those with a need to know. Support the development of interoperable secure communications systems for state and local governmentsand designated private sector entities DHS will enlist the assistance of experts from NIST, the Department of Defense (DoD), andother appropriate organizations to develop technicalsystems for the sharing of sensitive information and then help state and local governments acquire access to them. Complete implementation of the Homeland Security Advisory System The Homeland Security Advisory System was implemented in early 2002. DHS will continue towork with other federal departments and agencies,state and local governments, and the private sectorto interpret, harmonize, and identify appropriateactions that correspond to the various threat levelsincluded in this system as they relate to their partic-ular assets and operations. 27Domestic security starts in our communities, in our own institutions, and in our businesses. Those who have access to and operate our critical infrastructuresand key assets are crucial to our national protectivescheme. The key issues impacting personnel surety,building human capital, and awareness encompass four main areas: D eveloping safeguards to prevent an insider or a disaffected or co-opted employee from conductingsabotage activities or facilitating terrorist access to acritical facility or system; Recruiting and training more skilled operations and security personnel to protect our critical infrastructures and key assets; Assuring that these workers are secure while doing their jobs; and Implementing communication and awareness programs to help businesses and communities takeaction to protect their respective assets and managerisk constructively.Personnel Surety The September 11 attacks demonstrated that terrorist organizations possess the capability to conduct long-term clandestine operations, with individual membersblending into daily life in the United States. The\"insider threat\" is becoming an increasingly serious concern for critical infrastructure and key asset protection across all sectors. An \"insider\" is defined asan employee or anyone else who has routine access tocritical facilities and systems. This group also includescontractors, temporary help, and outsourcers. Insiders,because of their access and positions of trust, canintentionally or unwittingly become terrorist surrogatesby disclosing information relevant to critical nodes,vulnerabilities, operating characteristics, or securitymeasures. They can also provide terrorists with directaccess to and mobility within critical facilities andsystems, such as operations centers and control rooms. Building Human Capital Related to personnel surety is the fundamental need toensure that trustworthy, reliable, and trained personnelare available to protect critical infrastructures and keyassets from terrorist attack. Private sector owners andoperators depend on skilled employees to accomplishthe protection mission. Security personnel and firstresponders, in particular, require adequate training, equipment, and other support to carry out theirresponsibilities effectively and with some degree of assurance that their personal security will not be injeopardy while accomplishing their mission. Awareness A state of sustained preparedness requires widespread consciousness among members of the public\u2014especially among those in government and the privatesector most directly affected\u2014of the scope and natureof the threat we face and the precautions we must taketo meet the threat. The federal government, workingwith the private sector, has been engaged for severalyears in a systematic program to develop protectionawareness among key business leaders in the criticalsectors. This effort, which has increased significantlysince September 11, has been especially productive.Additionally, the scope of the attacks themselves and the extensive publicity they engendered (e.g., congres-sional hearings and media coverage) have significantlyraised public consciousness of the terrorist threat. Thislevel of awareness must be sustained over the long termfor our national protective effort to be truly successful. 28 , , Personnel Surety, Building Human Capital, and Awareness Challenges Time-efficient, thorough, and periodic background screening of candidate employees, visitors, permanentand temporary staff, and contractors for sensitive posi-tions is an important tool for protecting against the\"insider threat.\" Unfortunately, in-depth personnel screening and background checks are often beyond thecapabilities of private sector and non-federal govern- ment entities. Private employers also lack access topersonnel reliability data\u2014often in the possession of thefederal government\u2014that could help determine whetheremployees, contractors, and visitors should be employedat or allowed access to sensitive facilities. Part-time,temporary, and seasonal workers also challenge effective background screening processes because of the high level of employee turnover. Other challenges include concern for constitutional freedoms, costs associatedwith screening processes, and a lack of verifiable documentation and other sources of information. Aside from personnel surety, shortages of skilled personnel in various professions\u2014ranging from secu-rity technicians to emergency first responders\u2014also impede critical infrastructure and key asset protection.Similarly, although private security officers are identi- fied as an important source of protection for criticalfacilities, few formal standardized qualifications,training, or certification requirements exist for thesepositions across the critical sectors. Given the dynamicnature of the terrorist threat, there is an urgent needfor ongoing training of security personnel to sustainskill levels and to remain up-to-date on evolvingterrorist weapons and tactics. Protection of employees from the terrorist threat or exposure to the potential aftereffects of an attack is animportant concern for critical infrastructure and keyasset owners and operators. They are also potentialdisincentives for their employees, security personnel,and first responders. Future attacks could result inbiological, chemical, or radiological contaminants at anincident site that, without proper precautions, couldendanger emergency workers, their families (by cross-contamination), and others in the exposed areas. Despite the events of September 11, awareness of the implications of terrorist threats to critical infrastruc-tures among members of industry in general remainsrelatively low. As time passes and focus on the events of that day recedes, the awareness and interest of thegeneral public also recedes. As a result, security-relatedactivities could lack the consistent focus required toassure protection, thus leaving us exposed once more.Personnel Surety, Building Human Capital, and Awareness Initiatives To overcome the challenges described above, we will: Coordinate the development of national standards for personnel surety DHS, in concert with DoJ, will convene an advisory task force to perform a comprehensive review ofcritical infrastructure sector personnel suretyprograms. The task force\u2014to be comprised offederal agencies and departments, state and localgovernments, and private sector representatives\u2014will develop advice on the creation of nationalstandards and capabilities for background checks,screening, criminal investigations, and positive identification of key personnel employed in criticalservice sectors. Harmonizing personnel surety policies and programs among critical infrastructure sectors will help createuniform standards and address concerns articulatedby businesses regarding the adequacy of backgroundchecks for occupants of critical job categories. Indeveloping national standards for personnel surety,however, we must find the balance that enables us to mitigate risk and defend our country whilepreserving individual freedoms and liberties. Develop a certification program for background- screening companies To complement private-sector employer efforts, DHS, in concert with DoJ, will develop a certifica-tion program for background-screening companiesto ensure a base-line level of competence and reduceobstacles to timely and accurate verification ofemployee backgrounds and investigative histories. In addition, DHS will initiate a study to identify options for creating or enabling access to databasesto accredit candidates for critical positions and otherpotential hires, contract workers, and key servicesupplier personnel. Federal databases, such as thoseoperated by the Immigration and NaturalizationService and various intelligence and law enforce- ment agencies, could be used to seed this process.As we undertake this effort, we must take theprecautions necessary to protect individual constitutional freedoms. Explore establishment of a certification regime or model security training program for private security officers To maximize the effectiveness of the Nation's corps of private security personnel, DHS will work withlaw enforcement and federal security officials toinitiate a dialogue with state and local counterparts, 29private-sector infrastructure owners and operators, and private security firms concerning the creation ofa training and certification regime for private secu-rity officers. One possible model is the program for security training provided by the federal lawenforcement academies. Identify requirements and develop appropriate programs to protect critical personnel DHS will work with state and local government and industry representatives to identify requirementsand develop appropriate programs to protect criticalpersonnel who may become terrorist targets becauseof their roles in protection activities. Security and first responder personnel must be assured of their own personal safety while engagingin their protection and response missions. Thesepersonnel may need to be equipped with the protec-tive devices and clothing necessary to shield themfrom toxic or biological contamination and impedethe transmission of potentially dangerous agents toothers. In this regard, personal protective equipmentmust be developed with the needs of law enforce- ment and other first responders uppermost in mindacross the critical infrastructure sectors. Programsmust be implemented to ensure that security personnel and first responders receive protectiontraining and education necessary for them to carryout their responsibilities. Facilitate the sharing of public- and private-sector protection expertise DHS, in concert with other federal lead departments and agencies, will develop a program to facilitate the sharing of protection expertisebetween the public and private sectors.Training and exercises that test protection plans and personnel capabilities are critical to assessingrequired improvements in preparedness and sharing best practices. Accordingly, DHS will also developand incorporate realistic hands-on and virtual exer-cises into its critical infrastructure and key assetprotection education and training programs withthe objective of exploring common protection issuesand solutions. With proper design, these exercisescan serve important outreach, training, coordina- tion, and evaluation purposes across the public andprivate sectors. Develop and implement a national awareness program for critical infrastructure and key asset protection DHS, in concert with other key stakeholders, will identify and assess the requirements for a compre-hensive, national awareness program that will support sustainability of preparedness programs,security investment, and protection activities, as well as the public's understanding of the terroristthreat environment. Building awareness means creating a national appreciation for how security must be fundamentallyincorporated into our daily lives and business opera-tions. Our national awareness program should focuson the specific needs of the critical infrastructureindustries to support informed private-sector decisions and enable the planning of relevant andeffective protection strategies and resource allocation. It must also be sufficiently comprehensive in scope to maintain the public's understanding and appreci-ation of the threat environment as it evolves andfoster confidence in the strategies and approachesbeing taken to address it. 30 The terrorist threat challenges us to marshal our nation's advantages in the sciences and technology.Protecting our Nation's critical infrastructures and key assets against this threat will require a systematic,national effort to fully harness our research and devel-opment (R&D) capabilities. Doing so will enable us tomeet many of our immediate needs for protective stan-dards and solutions. It will also help lay the long-termfoundation for developing the advanced tools and tech-nologies that will enable more comprehensive andcost-effective protection solutions in the future, partic-ularly regarding the most catastrophic threats we mayhave to confront. Organizing this national effort will require persistence, careful planning, and coordination. Our national research enterprise is vast and complex. Private compa- nies, universities, research institutions, and governmentlaboratories of all sizes are conducting pure and appliedresearch to develop the advanced materials, products, and services that will contribute to assuring the protec-tion of critical infrastructures and key assets. To best realize these advances, however, we must be able to identify needs\u2014standards, tools, andprocesses\u2014that span multiple sectors as a critical firststep. Accomplishing this will enable us to establishresearch priorities and concentrate efforts and assign responsibilities in these areas while avoiding unneces- sary duplication that can draw valuable capacity awayfrom other needed research. It will also provideresearchers, engineers, and infrastructure owners and operators with a minimum threshold of capabilities toguide product development efforts and provide endusers a metric to gauge the sufficiency of the technological solutions they adopt. Technology and Research & Development Challenges The number and diversity of stakeholders present impediments to coordinating technological R&Dactivities for critical infrastructure and key asset protec-tion. Organizations at each level of government andacross the critical infrastructure sectors all have individual R&D priorities and interests intended to identify solutions to the particular problems theyconsider most important. One major challenge at theoutset is to define the points of commonality amongthese disparate needs and efforts to determine wherecoordinated R&D activities will yield value across thebroadest range of interests.At the national level, the general lack of focus on long- term research, development, testing, and engineeringfor critical infrastructure and key asset protection is asignificant shortfall in our current domestic protectionposture. A need exists for a process to coordinate, withbroad sector input, the creation and adoption ofnational research priorities, and support to cross-sectorR&D activities. In addition, our domestic protection requirements create a demand for new tools to contribute to securityat the operational level. In this regard, we must work toimprove our capability to conduct a wide range of testson potential contaminants (e.g., biological, chemical,and radiological) that can be used to threaten our foodand agriculture, water, mass transit, and other sectors.Similarly, we must expand our monitoring and surveil- lance capabilities to improve our ability to detect thepresence of weapons of mass destruction and their components. An especially great need exists for standards to support interoperable communications. The current lack ofcapability in this area consistently ranks as one of the most critical shortcomings in our protection and emer-gency response posture across the Nation. At present,federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel andfire, medical, and emergency management personneluse incompatible communications systems, introducingdifficulties and barriers in information exchange andsecurity operations. This lack of common standards in 31 communications equipment can seriously impede close collaboration among security personnel, first respon-ders, state emergency management personnel, andfederal officials prior to, during, and in the aftermathof a terrorist incident. Responses to terrorist incidentscan be further complicated if differences in communi- cations connectivity themselves become a target for terrorist exploitation. The lack of reliable tools to authenticate the identities of personnel with direct access to our most criticalfacilities and systems also impedes security acrosssectors. A similar situation exists with respect to iden-tification of law enforcement, fire, and emergencyresponse personnel working in protection and incident response roles. Finally, harmonizing the oftentimes conflicting need to enhance security while simultaneously maintainingreasonably open channels of commerce requires both new tools and processes that challenge technology. Forexample, critical dams, particularly those on navigablewaterways, present difficult security challenges. Thelocks on such dams must remain available for the flowof commerce, yet waterborne threats must be abated.Other sectors such as air transportation, rail and maritime shipping, and site security at major commer-cial and government buildings, national landmarks, andthe like present similar needs for effective, non-invasivemonitoring and sensor capabilities. Technology and Research & Development Initiatives To respond to these challenges, government and industry must work together to develop standards insecurity technology for both physical and informationinfrastructures. Such standards would enable key stakeholders to collaborate more effectively to developthe products essential to enhancing the security of infrastructures and managing the interdependenciesamong them. Accordingly, we will: Coordinate public- and private-sector security research and development activities DHS will coordinate with other appropriate federal agencies to support security technology research anddevelopment, including specialized pilot programsand projects. This effort will include exploration ofmechanisms to migrate technologies developed bythe DoD and other government agencies to theprivate sector for use in infrastructure protection.Activities in this area will include appropriate collab- oration with our international partners to expand ourresearch base and capitalize on technological solutions being developed by our friends and allies. Coordinate interoperability standards to ensure compatibility of communications systems We will act to establish and disseminate interoper- ability standards to ensure compatibility ofcommunications systems used by federal, state,and local authorities. The Federal CommunicationsCommission (FCC), will lead this effort, working in concert with DHS, other federal lead departments and agencies such as DOC's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, other standard-setting bodies such as NIST, affected user groups, and equipment manu-facturers. Establishment of standards will enablesecure and assured interoperable communicationsamong all levels of homeland security entities.Standardized communication systems will enhance protection and incident response, as well as promoteefficient planning and training at all levels. Explore methods to authenticate and verify personnel identity We must provide better means of identifying people in order to increase the security of our critical facilities, systems, and functions. We must create auniform means of identifying law enforcement andsecurity personnel and individuals with access tocritical facilities and systems. Technologies to be examined for this authentication scheme include biometric identifiers, magneticstrips, microprocessor-enabled \"SMART\" cards,and other systems. Such tools would enable quickauthentication of identities in the protection andemergency response domains. The enhanced \"scenecontrol\" entailed would facilitate investigations at thesites of terrorism incidents, and create an investiga-tive baseline for comparing different analytical data. Improve technical surveillance , monitoring and detection capabilities We must improve our technical surveillance, detec- tion (including non-invasive inspection methods),and monitoring systems for perimeter, entry area,and key node vigilance. We must also develop more robust detection systems for use by securitypersonnel across our critical infrastructure sectors. DHS, in collaboration with other public- and private-sector stakeholders, will develop a researchagenda to explore technical solutions to surveillanceand detection deficiencies in critical sectors, toinclude capabilities to detect chemical, biological,and radiological (CBR) residues. 32 Modeling, simulation, and analysis activities help to prioritize critical infrastructures and key assets protectionactivities and investments. This Strategy has discussed the challenges and uncertainties presented by critical nodesand single-points-of-failure within infrastructures, as wellas increasing interdependencies that exist among thevarious infrastructure sectors both nationally and interna-tionally. These interdependencies and key nodes are oftendifficult to identify and resolve, as are the cascading andcross-sector effects associated with their disruption.Properly employed, modeling, simulation, and analysis can provide valuable, predictive insights into potential consequences that could result from these dependenciesand interdependencies in various threat scenarios. Modeling, simulation, and analysis can also facilitate protection planning and decision support by enablingthe mapping of complex interrelationships among theelements that make up the risk environment. Forexample, modeling traffic patterns through a particularjunction, such as rail or air traffic through a key railhead or air terminal, allows analysis of the variouspossible outcomes of an attack on that node at variouspoints in time. Such information would be helpful indrawing attention to likely cascading consequences thatotherwise might have gone unconsidered. Using models and simulations, responsible authorities can evaluate the risks associated with particular vulner- abilities more accurately and subsequently make moreinformed protection decisions. Modeling and simula-tion can also be used as a real-time decision supporttool to help mitigate the effects of an attack or avert asecondary attack altogether. Private-sector infrastructure and asset owners and opera- tors possess considerable experience in preparing for andresponding to a wide variety of naturally occurring eventslike floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Their expertise in planning and response stems from long histories ofcontending with the challenges associated with thesenaturally occurring phenomena. In contrast, the pervasivethreat of terrorist strikes against our critical infrastructuresand key assets is relatively new. Hence, no similar long-term data exist that track the patterns of such deliberate incidents; nor is there evidence as to which safeguardswould be most effective, making the need to develop reliable, predictive surrogate data even more important. Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis Challenges Historically, we have relied on modeling, simulation, and analysis capabilities to enable decision support and plan-ning activities related to national defense and intelligencemissions. We must now find ways to employ them todevelop creative approaches and enable complex decisionsupport, risk management, and resource investmentactivities to combat terrorism at home. Modeling, simulation, and analysis would provide significant value to many sectors across governmentand the economy. Demands for such studies will likelybe great; and, as in the case of R&D planning, we willhave to establish priorities among the projects to beundertaken, giving emphasis to those studies that arelikely to yield common benefits and address the moststressing threats and vulnerabilities. Improving our modeling and simulation resources must also include an effort to enhance data collection and standardization. Currently, much data relevant to national-level protection activities may not exist,be accessible, or reside in a standard format. Data collection processes, systems, and standards will have to be created and adopted to provide common representations of data across models and simulations. Furthermore, enhancing our national modeling, simulation, and analysis capabilities will require a unifiedeffort across the public and private sectors to yield theresults needed in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible. Through effective partnering across thefederal interagency community, state and local govern-ment, national laboratories, academia, and commercialenterprises, we can enlist tremendous talents andresources to drive this capability forward. Cross-sector collaboration is also essential to establishing standardmethodologies and consistent analytical frameworks forinterpreting research results, especially when modelinginfrastructure interdependencies. 33, , Most industry officials have a fairly complete understanding of their own operations and associatedvulnerabilities. However, many of these enterprisesrequire assistance to identify their dependencies on other sectors and the degree of risk to which they areexposed as a function of those interdependencies. Thepotential impact of such interdependencies hit homefor the banking and financial services sector onSeptember 11, when the collapse of the World Trade Center towers interrupted telecommunications servicesin lower Manhattan. The disruption brought electronicfinancial transactions to a halt, with long-termeconomic impacts still being felt more than a year later. In most cases, modeling and simulation capabilities are not well integrated into existing infrastructure protection plan-ning activities. Achieving this integration will be critical to the task of translating modeling and simulation researchdata into effective guides for sector-focused protectionplanning, decision support, and resource allocation. Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis Initiatives Modeling, simulation, and analysis initiatives that wewill pursue across the critical infrastructure sectorsinclude efforts to: Integrate modeling, simulation, and analysis into national infrastructure and asset protection planning and decisionsupport activities DHS will establish an advisory panel consisting of representatives from the public and private sectors, national laboratories, academia, and commercialresearch organizations to explore alternatives to integrate modeling and simulation activities intodomestic protection planning. The panel will be charged to review modeling, simulation, and analysis and advise DHS on ways tofocus on-going and planned research activities onnational priorities. Early in the process, emphasis willbe given to developing and disseminating standardsand methods for modeling sector interdependencies.Such standards will be based on a clear definition of assets or services deemed to be critical and will betasked for development through nationally coordi-nated planning activities overseen by DHS. Develop economic models of near- and long-term effects of terrorist attacks The economic significance of terrorist attacks is not always clear, with short-term effects often onlypartially predictive of longer-term realities. Modelsof the temporal and cross-sector scope of economicdamage caused by physical infrastructure attackswould assist policymakers and emergency manage-ment specialists in understanding and mitigating worst case effects. Develop critical node/chokepoint and interdependency analysis capabilities Fundamental to the core objective of modeling interdependencies and mapping the consequences of particular terrorist events, we will also undertakeresearch to develop metrics for gauging the adequacy of infrastructure subsystems and key nodescompared to level of threat and effect. This includescomparing the robustness of different infrastructuresat points where key centers or critical nodes are in close proximity to one another and can havecascading effects if attacked. Clearly identifying and addressing interdependencies among critical infra-structures in both a national and internationalcontext is high on our list of protection priorities. Model interdependencies among sectors with respect to conflicts between sector alert and warning procedures and actions Modeling alert responses and possible counter- productive effects of alert system designs willenhance flexibility and minimize duplication ofeffort. The intent of raising the Homeland SecurityAlert status is to trigger actions to protect infra-structures and make it more difficult for terrorists toact. These actions, however, may have disruptiveconsequences that may themselves interact in waysthat could create additional vulnerabilities. Conduct integrated risk modeling of cyber and physical threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences Risk assessments help to identify and determine ways to manage risk to best allocate resources. These assess-ments include threat analysis to provide a baseline and frame of reference for risk management andinvestment decisions. This analysis, coupled withvulnerability assessments to determine the effectivenessof security systems and tools to provide consequenceanalysis, will provide information on critical assets andnodes. Such studies would comprise models of securityincidents involving various types of both cyber andphysical attacks. Analysis will focus on the complexinteractions between physical and cyber systems todetermine the full range of potential consequences andto ensure the applicability of findings across infrastruc-tures in both a domestic and international context. Develop models to improve information integration The integration of threat and vulnerability informa- tion between sectors needs to be modeled, as doesinformation sharing between the federal govern-ment and critical infrastructures, to identify pointsof inefficiency and information loss. 34 Our society and modern way of life depend on a complex system of critical infrastructures. The National Strategy for Homeland Security has identified 13 critical sectors. As we learn more about threats, means of attack, and thevarious criteria that make targets lucrative for terrorists,this list will evolve. The critical infrastructure sectorsconsist of agriculture and food, water, public health,emergency services, government, 1the defense industrial base, information and telecommunications,2energy, transportation, banking and finance, chemicals andhazardous materials, and postal and shipping. 3Common issues of concern to these sectors are described in theCross-Sector Security Priorities chapter of this strategy. For each critical sector, this chapter discusses: Unique characteristics of the infrastructure sector itself and the industry that supports it; Current efforts that are underway to protect sector-specific goods and service delivery and associated critical assets, systems, and functions; Unique protection challenges; andPriority protection action areas for the sector to address in a collaborative fashion. Consistent with the principles of this Strategy ,a n y initiatives involving significant federal resources will be prioritized across the critical sectors, taking intoaccount the risks and consequences of potential threatsand the proper sharing of protection responsibilitiesamong the various stakeholders. ________ 1 The primary focus of this Strategy is the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets. Each lead federaldepartment and agency has developed a continuity of opera-tions plan (COOP) to ensure the continuity of government(COG) for its sector. As these plans are classified, COG willnot be discussed in this document. 2 The protective strategy for information technology and network assets for specific sectors is discussed in detail in theNational Strategy to Secure Cyberspace .Accordingly, the protection of the Information Technology component of theInformation and Telecommunications sector is not discussedin this document. 3 The protection of National Monuments and Icons is addressed in Chapter VII, \"Protecting Key Assets.\" 35 From farm to table, our Nation's agriculture and food systems are among the most efficient and productive inthe world. These industries are a source of essentialcommodities in the U.S., and they account for close toone-fifth of the Gross Domestic Product. A significantpercentage of that figure also contributes to our exporteconomy, as the U.S. exports approximately one quarterof its farm and ranch products. The Agriculture and Food Sectors include:The supply chains for feed, animals, and animal products; C rop production and the supply chains of seed, fertilizer, and other necessary related materials; and The post-harvesting components of the food supply chain, from processing, production, and packagingthrough storage and distribution to retail sales,institutional food services, and restaurant or home consumption. Changes in the ways that food is produced, distributed, and consumed present new challenges for ensuring itssafety and security. More of our food is grown abroad,many foods are transported long distances, and we eataway from home more frequently. Public confidence in the safety of agricultural and food-processing andpackaging systems represents a key part of sustainingthe economic viability of these sectors. America's reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, high quality foodstuffs is likewise essential to maintaining theconfidence of foreign customers who are important to the national economy as a whole. The United States has a strong, well functioning food-safety system to protect the public against unin-tentional contamination of food products. Besides theagriculture and food industries' measures to ensurefood safety, the overall mechanism includes extensiveanalyses of critical control points in the food supplychain and federal, state, and local inspections of foodprocessing and storage facilities, as well as food serviceestablishments. Sector enterprises are currently in theprocess of assessing physical security practices andprocedures in place at their facilities, particularlyprocessing plants. Agriculture and Food Sector Challenges The fundamental need for food, as well as great publicsensitivity to food safety makes assuring the security offood production and processing a high priority. Our food and agriculture industries have been devel- oped over several decades and are unique with respectto their structures and processes. The greatest threatsto the food and agricultural systems are disease andcontamination, in which case, sector decentralizationrepresents a challenge to assuring their protection. Government and industry have worked together in thepast to deal with isolated instances of deliberate foodtampering. The effectiveness of the food safety systemwith regard to preventing, detecting, and mitigating 36 the effects of unintentional or isolated contaminations offers a foundation to build upon for countering deliberate acts to corrupt the food supply. Because of the food system's many points of entry, detection is a critical tool for securing the agricultureand food sectors. There is an urgent need to improveand validate analytical methods for detecting bioter-rorist agents in food products, as well as a need for enhanced laboratory capabilities and capacities. Theexisting system of federal, state, and local public healthand agriculture laboratories was established to detectthe presence of traditional human pathogens that occasionally and unintentionally contaminate foods.Although this system continues to serve an importantrole in safeguarding public health from these tradi- tional agents, its capabilities must be enhanced toenable protection from a wide spectrum of nontradi-tional agents. This enhanced system must also becapable of eliminating the occurrence of false positives for threat agents in food and agricultural products inaddition to inconsistencies in detecting them whenthey are present. Additionally, we must expand our system of laborato- ries to accommodate the requirements that could result from a bioterrorist attack on the food supply. We mustalso increase the number of qualified personnel (veteri-narians and lab technicians) and laboratories with theability to diagnose and treat animal disease outbreaksand crop contamination. Moreover, many state budgetsfor such inspection, detection, and training protocolswill need to be revisited to provide for such initiatives. Moving and processing crops and animals require transporting them over long distances. During trans-port, these resources spend time in storage areas andfacilities where they may come in contact with otherproducts. Accordingly, the agriculture and food sectorsdepend on transportation system owners and operators,particularly regarding trucks and containers, to meetthe safety and security standards necessary to protectfood products in transit. We must improve mechanismsdesigned to track the movement of animals andcommodities in transit and enable officials to pinpointwhere an outbreak or contamination originates. Rapid acquisition and use of threat information could help to prevent an attack from spreading beyond individual facilities or local communities to become aregional or national problem. Unfortunately, serious institutional barriers and disincentives for sharing suchinformation exist within the sectors and their structures.For instance, there are significant, direct economicdisincentives associated with reporting problems or suspected contamination in food processing. Meanwhile, the agriculture and food markets are highly competitive, and many parts of the food system operatewithin slim profit margins. As a result, some companiesmay be more likely to hold onto information related toincidents involving suspected contamination in order toprevent the potential financial consequences of whatmight be a false alarm. Protecting the public from an outbreak or contamina- tion incident requires timely reporting of informationfor prompt decision-making and action. In the currentenvironment, when crops or animals must be culled orpreventively killed to deal with disease or contamina-tion, the fear of a negative public response andattendant economic implications to the sector mayimpede the needed levels of response in the agricultureand food sectors. Deliberate contaminations by terrorists aim to harm people or animals to the greatest extent possible.Another principal objective is to create panic andinflict economic damage. Because of the influence themedia has on how the public responds to incidents,clear and accurate communication of information to news outlets is essential. Official spokespersons at state, regional, and national levels should be pre-assigned. Although food regulators routinelycommunicate with industry on food-safety issues,planning for public communications in the event of adeliberate contamination should also be a priority,as should defining stakeholder responsibilities withinthose plans. 37 Agriculture and Food Sector Initiatives Information derived from assessment of sector food-safety processes and procedures can provide afoundation for developing an agriculture and foodsector critical infrastructure protection system. Forexample, two major efforts to establish procedures foraccidental outbreaks of animal disease have alreadybeen completed. 1While plans for these studies were drafted with accidental introductions of disease orcontamination in mind, their findings and recommen-dations may also apply to intentional acts. Anotherexample of ongoing activities in this area is the imple-mentation of recommendations from the 1999 Animaland Plan Health Inspection report, Safeguarding American Plant Resources .Further study and collabora- tive policy development are required to determinewhether and how the food safety system could beextended to deal with food security issues. Additional agriculture and food sector protection initiatives include efforts to: Evaluate overall sector security and identify and address vulnerabilities DHS and the Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS), workingin collaboration with state and local governmentsand industry, will undertake a broad risk assessmentof the agriculture and food sectors to evaluateoverall security and identify and address existing vulnerabilities. Enhance detection and testing capabilities across the agricultural and food networks DHS, USDA, and HHS, in collaboration with state and local governments and industry, will work toincrease detection and testing capacity. Exploringmechanisms to improve detection capabilities,ranging from technology development to increasingthe number of veterinary, epidemiology, and technical specialists at the state level, will facilitateearlier detection and response. Enhancing trace-back systems and increasing detection capabilities at borders and ports of origin will also significantly increase protection. Identifying,creating, and certifying additional laboratorycapacity across the country would likewise increase the speed of analysis and response. Assess transportation-related security risks DHS, USDA, HHS, and the Department of Transportation (DoT) will work with representa- tives from the agriculture and food industries toassess security risks in food and commodity trans-port and develop appropriate solutions. The scopeof the issues requires a thorough risk assessmentintegrating transportation security measures intoongoing and newly initiated countermeasuresundertaken by the food industry. Additional consid-erations include standardizing the methods bywhich the agriculture and food industries reporttruck hijackings and cargo thefts, and then dissemi-nating these reports within the food industry. Identify potential infrastructure protection incentives; identify and address existing disincentives DHS working with USDA and HHS will explore options for developing incentives or reducing disincentives to encourage the prompt reporting of problems. Develop emergency response strategies DHS, USDA, and HHS, working with sector counterparts, will develop a strategy to coordinaterisk communications and other emergency response activities. ________ 1 These efforts are reported in The Animal Health Safeguarding Review: Results and Recommendations ,October 2001, by the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture Research Foundation, and The U.S. National Animal Health Emergency Management System, 2001 Annual Report. 38 The Nation's water sector is critical from both a public health and an economic standpoint. The water sectorconsists of two basic, yet vital, components: fresh watersupply and wastewater collection and treatment. Sectorinfrastructures are diverse, complex, and distributed,ranging from systems that serve a few customers tothose that serve millions. On the supply side, theprimary focus of critical infrastructure protectionefforts is the Nation's 170,000 public water systems.These utilities depend on reservoirs, dams, wells, andaquifers, as well as treatment facilities, pumpingstations, aqueducts, and transmission pipelines. Thewastewater industry's emphasis is on the 19,500municipal sanitary sewer systems, including an estimated 800,000 miles of sewer lines. Wastewaterutilities collect and treat sewage and process waterfrom domestic, commercial, and industrial sources. Thewastewater sector also includes storm water systemsthat collect and sometimes treat storm water runoff. The water sector has taken great strides to protect its critical facilities and systems. For instance, governmentand industry have developed vulnerability assessmentmethodologies for both drinking water and wastewaterfacilities and trained thousands of utility operators toconduct them. In response to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 , the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has devel-oped baseline threat information to use in conjunctionwith vulnerability assessments. Furthermore, to defraysome of the cost of those studies, the EPA has providedassistance to drinking water systems to enable them to undertake vulnerability assessments and develop emergency response plans. To improve the flow of information among water-sector organizations, the industry has begun development ofits sector-ISAC. The Water ISAC will provide a secureforum for gathering, analyzing, and sharing security-related information. Additionally ,several federal agencies are working together to improve the ware-housing of information regarding contaminationthreats, such as the release of biological, chemical, andradiological substances into the water supply, and howto respond to their presence in drinking water. Withrespect to identifying new technologies, the EPA has an existing program that develops testing protocols andverifies the performance of innovative technologies. Ithas also initiated a new program to verify monitoringtechnologies that may be useful in detecting or avoidingbiological or chemical threats. Water Sector Challenges The basic human need for water and the concern for maintaining a safe water supply are driving factors for water infrastructure protection. Public perceptionregarding the safety of the Nation's water supply is also significant, as is the safety of people who reside or work near water facilities. In order to set prioritiesamong the wide range of protective measures thatshould be taken, the water sector is focusing on thetypes of infrastructure attacks that could result in significant human casualties and property damage orwidespread economic consequences. In general, thereare four areas of primary concentration: Physical damage or destruction of critical assets, including intentional release of toxic chemicals; A ctual or threatened contamination of the water supply; C yber attack on information management systems or other electronic systems; and Interruption of services from another infrastructure. To address these potential threats, the sector requires additional focused threat information in order to direct 39 investments toward enhancement of corresponding protective measures. The water sector also requiresincreased monitoring and analytic capabilities toenhance detection of biological, chemical, or radiolog-ical contaminants that could be intentionally introducedinto the water supply. Some enterprises are already inthe process of developing advanced monitoring andsampling technologies, but additional resources fromthe water sector will likely be needed. Environmentalmonitoring techniques and technologies and appro-priate laboratory capabilities require enhancement toprovide adequate and timely analysis of water samplesto ensure early warning capabilities and assess the effectiveness of clean-up activities should an incident occur. Specific innovations needed include new broad-spectrum analytical methods, monitoring strategies,sampling protocols, and training. Approaches to emergency response and the handling of security incidents at water facilities vary according tostate and local policies and procedures. With regard tothe public reaction associated with contamination orperceived contamination, it is essential that local, state,and federal departments and agencies coordinate theirprotection and response efforts. Maintaining the public'sconfidence regarding information provided and thetimeliness of the message is critical. Suspected eventsconcerning water systems to date have elicited strongresponses that involved taking systems out of service until their integrity could be verified, announcing theincident to the public, and issuing \"boil water\" orders. The operations of the water sector depend extensively on other sectors. The heaviest dependence is on theenergy sector. For example, running pumps to movewater and wastewater and operating drinking waterand wastewater treatment plants require large amountsof electricity. To a lesser extent, the water sector alsodepends on the transportation system for supplies ofwater treatment chemicals, on natural gas pipelines forthe energy used in some operational activities, and onthe telecommunications sector. Water and wastewatersystems are increasingly automated and controlled fromremote locations for efficiency.Water Sector Initiatives Water infrastructure protection initiatives are guided both by the challenges that the water sector faces andby recent legislation. 1Additional protection initiatives include efforts to: Identify high-priority vulnerabilities and improve site security EPA, in concert with DHS, state and local governments, and other water sector leaders, willwork to identify processes and technologies to bettersecure key points of storage and distribution, such asdams, pumping stations, chemical storage facilities,and treatment plants. EPA and DHS will alsocontinue to provide tools, training, technical assis-tance, and limited financial assistance for researchon vulnerability-assessment methodologies and risk-management strategies. Improve sector monitoring and analytic capabilities EPA will continue to work with sector representa- tives and other federal agencies to improveinformation on contaminants of concern and todevelop appropriate monitoring and analytical technologies and capabilities. Improve sector-wide information exchange and coordinate contingency planning DHS and EPA will continue to work with the sector coordinator and the water ISAC to coordi-nate timely information on threats, incidents, andother topics of special interest to the water sector.DHS and EPA will also work with the sector andthe states to standardize and coordinate emergencyresponse efforts and communications protocols. Work with other sectors to manage unique risks resulting from interdependencies DHS and EPA will convene cross-sector working groups to develop models for integrating prioritiesand emergency response plans in the context ofinterdependencies between the water sector andother critical infrastructures. ________ 1 On June 12, 2002, President Bush signed the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002(Bioterrorism Act) into law. The Bioterrorism Act requires many drinking water systems to conduct vulnerability assess-ments, certify and submit copies of their assessments to EPA,and prepare or revise their emergency response plans. 40 The public health sector is vast and diverse. It consists of state and local health departments, hospitals,health clinics, mental health facilities, nursing homes,blood-supply facilities, laboratories, mortuaries,and pharmaceutical stockpiles. Hospitals, clinics, and public health systems play a crit- ical role in mitigating and recovering from the effectsof natural disasters or deliberate attacks on the home-land. Physical damage to these facilities or disruptionof their operations could prevent a full, effectiveresponse and exacerbate the outcome of an emergency situation. Even if a hospital or public health facilitywere not the direct target of a terrorist strike, it couldbe significantly impacted by secondary contaminationinvolving chemical, radiological, or biological agents. In addition to established medical networks, the U.S. depends on several highly specialized laboratory facilities and assets, especially those related to diseasecontrol and vaccine development and storage, such asthe HHS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,the National Institutes of Health, and the NationalStrategic Stockpile. Public Health Sector Challenges Public health workers are accustomed to placing themselves in harm's way during an emergency.They may be unlikely, however, to view themselves as potential targets of terrorist acts. Most hospitals and clinics are freely accessible facilities that provide the public with an array of vital services.This free access, however, also makes it difficult toidentify potential threats or prevent malicious entryinto these facilities. This fact, combined with a lack ofmeans and standards to recognize and detect poten-tially contaminated individuals, can have an importantimpact on facility security and emergency operations. Another significant challenge is the variation in structural and systems design within our hospitals andclinics. On one hand, so-called \"immune buildings\" have built-in structural design elements that helpprevent contamination and the spread of infectiousagents to the greatest extent possible. Such featuresinclude controlled airflow systems, isolation rooms,and special surfaces that eliminate infectious agents on contact. At the other extreme are buildings with relatively little built-in environmental protection. Protection of this category of facility presents the greatest challenge.During an epidemic, infectious individuals who continue to operate in the community at large maypose a significant public health risk. The sector needsto develop comprehensive protocols governing theisolation of infectious individuals during a crisis. Additional public health sector challenges relate to the maintenance, protection, and distribution of stockpilesof critical emergency resources. Currently, other thanthe National Strategic Stockpile, there are limitedresources for rotating and replenishing supplies of critical materials and medicines. Supply chain manage-ment for medical materials also requires greaterattention to ensure secure and efficient functioningduring an emergency. Potential solutions to these problems are impacted by complex legal and tax issues.Currently, the federal government has only limitedregulatory authority to request information from companies concerning their available inventory ofmedical supplies and their capacity to produce them.Since pharmaceutical companies are taxed on their product inventories, they try to avoid stockpilingfinished goods and meet demand through \"just-in-time\" manufacturing. Sector-specific legal and regulatory issues also tend to impede the effective protection of assets and services.The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act requires hospitals to treat patients requiring emergency care regardless of their insurance status. Disaster 41 situations involving mass casualties tax the resources of critical facilities in terms of manpower, medical supplies,and space. As patients are stabilized, it is often necessaryto transfer them to other hospitals to free up criticalresources for newly arriving casualties. With respect to disaster victims without insurance, however, once treat-ment is no longer an emergency, hospitals are not boundto treat them. As a result, many second-tier, noncriticalhospitals will not or cannot accept uninsured patients,thereby requiring the critical hospital by default tocontinue nonemergency treatment. Additionally, privacyrules mandated in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act should be reviewed to determine whether they could prevent the sharing of critical data in the event of an epidemic. Existing security challenges have focused the public health sector on assessing its ability to deliver criticalservices during a crisis. Many hospitals, however, arefaced with operating at limited profit margins and,therefore, have difficulty making appropriate security investments. Finally, specialized medical and pharmaceutical laboratories merit special attention\u2014particularly thosehandling highly toxic or infectious agents. These facili-ties are mission-critical with respect to identifyinghazardous agents should an attack or outbreak occur.These facilities also enable the containment, neutral-ization, and disposal of such hazardous materials.Overcoming the protection challenges associated with securing these specialized assets is a top priority. Public Health Sector Initiatives Public health sector protection initiatives include efforts to: Designate trusted communicators HHS will work with state and local public health officials to identify, appoint, train, and prepare recognized subject matter experts to speak on behalf of the public health sector in times of crisis. Theseappointees would act as important envoys of homeland security information to communicateconsistent, accurate information, as well as toinform, instruct, and reassure the American public.Additionally, HHS leaders will be prepared to play substantial roles at the national level in communi-cating with the public regarding risks associated with bioterrorism or other public health emergencies. Review mission critical operations, establish protection priorities, and ensure adequate security and redundancyfor critical laboratory facilities and services HHS will work with hospitals and clinics in the public health sector to review their mission-criticalsystems and operations and help them create detailed plans to focus security investments andincrease their protection. In partnership with statehealth departments, HHS and DHS will identifyand prioritize national-level critical hospitals andmedical centers, as well as their most importantcomponent facilities, systems, and services. HHS and DHS will work with the health care sector to ensure that key laboratory facilities areprotected and have adequate redundancy withrespect to critical capabilities and data systems. Enhance surveillance and communication capabilities HHS will assist public health sector officials to identify requirements for robust surveillance systemsand coordinate links between public health moni-toring facilities and healthcare delivery systems. Develop criteria to isolate infectious individuals and establish triage protocols HHS will work with state and local health officials to develop isolation and quarantine standards toimprove the protection of the unaffected populationduring a public health crisis. HHS will also workwith state and local health officials during conse-quence management planning to set priorities forthe deployment of vaccination and prophylaxisresources in of the event of a terrorist incident involving biological or chemical weapons. Enhance protection of emergency stockpiles of medical supplies and domestic and international pharmaceuticalmanufacturing facilities HHS and DHS will work with the health care sector to enable the protection of stockpiles ofmedical supplies and other critical materials, distri-bution systems, and the critical systems of medicalinstitutions, including basic surveillance capabilitiesnecessary for tracking the spread of diseases andtoxic agents. Additionally, HHS will identifyproviders of critical resources and ensure a readystockpile of vital medicines for use in an emergency. Explore options for incentives to increase security spending In partnership with state health departments, HHS will examine legal and regulatory impediments thatcould prevent critical health facilities from providingcritical services during a crisis. HHS will also explorepossible incentives to encourage increased invest-ment in the physical security of facilities in thepublic health sector. The current federally sponsoredinvestment program to improve critical hospitalcapabilities within local communities provides an appropriate point of departure for this effort. 42 The emergency services infrastructure consists of fire, rescue, emergency medical service (EMS), and law enforcement organizations that are employed to savelives and property in the event of an accident, naturaldisaster, or terrorist incident. Emergency Services Sector Challenges Lessons learned from the September 11 attacks indicate that the most pressing problems to be addressed in thissector include: inadequate information sharing betweendifferent organizations\u2014particularly between lawenforcement and other first responders; telecommunica-tions problems, such as a lack of redundant systems;and the challenge of enhancing force protectionthrough such measures as stronger crime scene controland enhanced security to mitigate secondary attacks. Terrorists pose a major challenge to our national emergency response network. Although the existinginfrastructure is sufficient for dealing with routine acci-dents and regional disasters, the September 11 attacksrevealed shortfalls in its specific capabilities to respond to large-scale terrorist incidents and other catastrophicdisasters requiring extensive cooperation among local,state, and federal emergency response organizations.Most pressing among these shortfalls has been theinability of multiple first-responder units, such as policeand fire departments, to coordinate their efforts\u2014evenwhen they originate from the same jurisdiction. Major emergencies require cooperation by multiple public agencies and local communities. Systemssupporting emergency response personnel, however, havebeen specifically developed and implemented withrespect to the unique needs of each agency. Such specifi- cation complicates interoperability, thereby hindering the ability of various first responder organizations to commu-nicate and coordinate resources during crisis situations. Robust communications systems are essential for personnel safety and the effective employment ofhuman resources during a crisis or an emergency.Failure of communications systems during a crisis impedes the speed of response and puts the lives ofresponders at risk. Another important issue is the extent to which emergency response communicationsdepend on key physical nodes, such as a centraldispatcher, firehouse, or 911-call center. Unlike most critical infrastructures, which are closely tied to physical facilities, the emergency services sectorconsists of highly mobile teams of specializedpersonnel and equipment. Another challenge for the emergency services sector, therefore, is assuring theprotection of first responders and critical resourcesduring emergency response operations. Future terroristincidents could present unseen hazards at incidentsites, including the risk of exposure to CBR agents.Moreover, past experience indicates that emergencyservices response infrastructure and personnel can alsobe the targets of deliberate direct or secondary attacks,a bad scenario that could be made worse by communi-cation difficulties and responding units that are ill-prepared for such a likelihood. 43 Preparedness exercises serve to provide experience and feedback on preparation for response and emergencymanagement activities. Various state and local govern-ments and federal agencies have hosted local orregional exercises. The approaches used vary widely\u2014 a fact that could impede the effectiveness of multi-jurisdictional response efforts. Faced with the threat of a major terrorist attack, no single jurisdiction has the ability to maintain orassemble all of the resources necessary to provide aneffective response. Mutual aid agreements facilitate theflow of public safety personnel, equipment, and othervital resources across jurisdictional boundaries to enable local communities to help each other duringemergencies and disasters. Emergency Services Sector Initiatives Emergency services sector protection and responseinitiatives include efforts to: Adopt interoperable communications systems DHS and DoJ will work with state and local governments and other appropriate entities to studyand resolve important communications interoper-ability issues. This problem is already widelyrecognized and accepted as a valid concern at the state and local government level. The common,overriding need to assure effective communications during an emergency can be used as a catalyst todrive individual agencies toward a solution. Develop redundant communications networks DHS will work with state and local officials to develop redundant emergency response networks toimprove communications availability and reliability, especially during a major disruption. Implement measures to protect our national emergency response infrastructure DHS will inventory and analyze the vulnerability of our national emergency response infrastructure,including critical personnel, facilities, systems, andfunctions. DHS will work with states, localities, andother entities to develop plans to assure the safety of personnel during response efforts, as well as theprotection of our emergency response critical infrastructure. Coordinate national preparedness exercises DHS will work with state and local governments to develop a coordinated national emergency responseexercise program. Coordinated preparedness exercises would promote consistency in protectionplanning and response protocols and capabilities atthe regional and national levels, as well as provide aforum for sharing lessons learned and best practices. Enhance and strengthen mutual aid agreements among local jurisdictions DHS will work with officials from local communi- ties to strengthen existing mutual aid agreementsand develop new ones in regions across the U.S.where needed. Furthermore, it will promote discus-sion regarding the adoptio n of common standards and terminology for equipment and training. 44 Our nation's defense and military strength rely primarily on the DoD and the private sector defenseindustry that supports it. Without the importantcontributions of the private sector, DoD cannot effec-tively execute its core defense missions, includingmobilization and deployment of our nation's militaryforces abroad. Conversely, private industry and thepublic at large rely on the federal government toprovide for the common defense of our Nation andprotect our interests both domestically and abroad. Success in the war on terrorism depends on the ability of the United States military to mount swift, calculatedoffensive and defensive operations. Ensuring that ourmilitary is well trained and properly equipped is criticalto maintaining that capability. Private industry manu-factures and provides the majority of the equipment,materials, services, and weaponry used by our armedforces. For several decades, DoD has worked to identify its own critical assets and systems. It has also begun to address its dependency on the defense industrial base, and is now taking the concerns ofprivate industry into consideration in its critical infrastructure protection assessment efforts. Market competition, co nsolidations, globalization, and attrition have reduced or eliminated redundant sourcesof products and services and therefore increased risk forDoD. Outsourcing and complex domestic and foreigncorporate mergers and acquisitions have made it evenmore difficult for DoD to be assured that its primecontractors' second-, third-, and fourth-tier subcontrac-tors understand its security requirements and areprepared to support them in a national emergency. Defense Industrial Base Challenges Over the past 20 years, DoD's dependency on the private sector has greatly increased. Outsourcing hascaused the department to rely increasingly on contrac- tors to perform many of the tasks that were once underthe exclusive purview and control of the military. Eventhe utilities that service many of the nation's importantmilitary installations are being privatized. Because ofmarket competition and attrition, DoD now reliesmore and more on a single or very limited number ofprivate-sector suppliers to fulfill some of its mostessential needs. DoD, unlike other federal governmentagencies, requires strict adherence to military productspecification and unique requirements for services.Select private-industry vendors may be the onlysuppliers in the world capable of satisfying these unique requirements. Many of these sources havesingle manufacturing and distribution points thatwarrant additional security review and assessment. A related problem involves the current process through which DoD contracts with the private sectorto provide critical services and supplies. Most often the procurement process is based on cost and effi-ciency. Such an approach may not always take intoaccount the vendor's critical infrastructure protectionpractices (e.g., workforce hiring, supplier base) and itsability to supply products and services and providesurge response during an emergency or exigent circumstances. Finally, there are also growing concerns within the private sector regarding the potential for additionalcosts and risks resulting from federal mandates thatrequire private industry to implement enhanced infrastructure protection measures. Defense Industrial Base Initiatives The infrastructures of the private defense industry andDoD are already integrated on many levels. DoD, inconcert with DHS, will continue working with theprivate sector to identify critical installations and infrastructures, and, subsequently, to delineate specificprotection requirements. Furthermore, DoD and DHSwill collaborate with key defense industrial base 45 organizations to integrate and build upon their individual existing protection plans. Additional defense industrial base protection initiatives include efforts to: Build critical infrastructure protection requirements into contract processes and procedures DoD will collaborate with the defense industry to review contract processes and procedures to deter- mine how to include provisions that address criticalinfrastructure protection needs. Contracts willspecifically address national emergency situationrequirements, such as contractor response times, supply and labor availability, and direct logisticsupport. When appropriate, contracts will alsoinclude language regarding program manageraccountability for the protection of supportinginfrastructures. Sensitive contractual documents will receive greater scrutiny and revision prior to public posting. Additionally, DoD will give specificscrutiny to its potential dependency on foreigncommercial operators and suppliers. Incorporate security concerns into production and distribution processes and procedures DoD and industry will explore ways to eliminate key production and distribution bottlenecks. Develop an effective means of sharing security-related information between defense organizations andprivate-sector service providers DoD will work with DHS and the intelligence and law enforcement communities to establish thenecessary policies and mechanisms to facilitate aproductive exchange of security-related informationwith the defense industry. 46 The composition of the telecommunications sector evolves continuously due to technology advances, business and competitive pressures, and changes in theregulatory environment. Despite its dynamic nature, the sector has consistently provided robust and reliablecommunications and processes to meet the needs ofbusinesses and governments. In the new threat environment, the sector faces significant challenges toprotect its vast and dispersed critical assets, both cyberand physical. Because the government and critical-infrastructure industries rely heavily on the publictelecommunications infrastructure for vital communi-cations services, the sector's protection initiatives are particularly important. The telecommunications sector provides voice and data service to public and private users through a complexand diverse public-network infrastructure encom-passing the Public Switched TelecommunicationsNetwork (PSTN), the Internet, and private enterprise networks. The PSTN provides switched circuits fortelephone, data, and leased point-to-point services.It consists of physical facilities, including over 20,000switches, access tandems, and other equipment. Thesecomponents are connected by nearly two billion milesof fiber and copper cable. The physical PSTN remainsthe backbone of the infrastructure, with cellular,microwave, and satellite technologies providingextended gateways to the wireline network for mobileusers. Supporting the underlying PSTN areOperations, Administration, Maintenance, andProvisioning systems, which provide the vital manage- ment and administrative functions, such as billing,accounting, configuration, and security management. Advances in data network technology and the increasing demand for data services have spawned therapid proliferation of the Internet infrastructure.The Internet consists of a global network of packet-switched networks that use a common suite ofprotocols. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provideend-users with access to the Internet. Larger ISPs useNetwork Operation Centers (NOCs) to manage their high capacity networks, linking them through Internetpeering points or network access points. Smaller ISPsusually lease their long-haul transmission capacity fromthe larger ISPs and provide regional and local Internetaccess to end-users via the PSTN. Internet accessproviders interconnect with the PSTN through pointsof presence, typically a switch or a router, located at carrier central offices. International PSTN and Internet traffic travels via underwater cables that reachthe United States at various cable landing points. In addition to the PSTN and the Internet, enterprise networks are an important component of the telecom-munications infrastructure. Enterprise networks are dedicated networks supporting the voice and dataneeds and operations of large enterprises. Thesenetworks comprise a combination of leased lines orservices from the PSTN or Internet providers. 47 The Telecommunications Act of 1996 opened local PSTN service to competition. It required incumbent carriersto allow their competitors to have open access to theirnetworks. As a result, carriers began to concentratetheir assets in collocation facilities and other buildingsknown as telecom hotels, collocation sites, or peeringpoints instead of laying down new cable. ISPs alsogravitated to these facilities to reduce the costs ofexchanging traffic with other ISPs. Open competition,therefore, has caused the operation of the PSTN andthe Internet (including switching, transport, signaling,routing, control, security, and management) to become increasingly interconnected, software driven, andremotely managed, while the industry's physical assets are increasingly concentrated in shared facilities. The telecommunications infrastructure is undergoing a significant transformation that involves the conver-gence of traditional circuit-switched networks withbroadband packet-based IP networks, including theInternet. Eventually, the packet networks will subsumethe circuit-switched networks, leading to the establish-ment of a public, broadband, diverse, and scaleablepacket-based network known as the Next GenerationNetwork (NGN). Additionally, the evolution of the telecommunications infrastructure has included steadygrowth in mobile wireless services and applications.Wireless telecommunications providers transmit messages using an infrastructure of base stations andradio-cell towers located throughout the wirelessprovider's service area. Wireless services consist ofdigital mobile phones and emerging data services,including Internet communications, wireless local-areanetworks, and advanced telephony services. Convergence, the growth of the NGN, and emergence of new wireless capabilities continue to introduce newphysical components to the telecommunications infrastructure. Government and industry consistentlywork together to develop strategies to ensure that theevolving infrastructure remains reliable, robust, and secure. Public-private partnerships and organizationscurrently addressing telecommunications securityinclude the President's National SecurityTelecommunications Advisory Committee and Critical Infrastructure Protection Board (PCIPB), theGovernment Network Security Information Exchanges,the Telecommunications ISAC, and the NetworkReliability and Interoperability Council of the FCC.Recommendations by these bodies and collaborationamong industry and government will shape the securityand reliability of the evolving infrastructure.Telecommunications Sector Challenges Every day the sector must contend with traditional natural and human-based threats to its physical infra-structure, such as weather events, unintentional cablecuts, and the insider threat (e.g., physical and cybersabotage). The September 11 attacks revealed thethreat terrorism poses to the telecommunicationssector's physical infrastructure. While it was not adirect target of the attacks, the telecommunicationssector suffered significant collateral damage. In thefuture, certain concentrations of key sector assetsthemselves could become attractive direct targets forterrorists, particularly with the increased use of colloca-tion facilities. The telecommunications infrastructurewithstood the September 11 attacks in overall termsand demonstrated remarkable resiliency becausedamage to telecommunications assets at the attack sites was offset by diverse, redundant, and multifacetedcommunications capabilities. Priorities for telecommunications carriers are service reliability, cost balancing, security, and effective risk management postures. The government places highpriority on the consistent application of security acrossthe infrastructure. Although private- and public-sector 48 stakeholders share similar objectives, they have different perspectives on what constitutes acceptablerisk and how to achieve security and reliability. Therefore, an agreement on a sustainable securitythreshold and corresponding security requirementsremains elusive. Because of growing interdependencies among the various critical infrastructures, a direct or indirect attackon any of them could result in cascading effects acrossthe others. Such interdependencies increase the need toidentify critical assets and secure them against bothphysical and cyber threats. Critical infrastructures relyupon a secure and robust telecommunications infra-structure. Redundancy within the infrastructure iscritical to ensure that single points of failure in oneinfrastructure will not adversely impact others. It is vitalthat government and industry work together to charac-terize the state of diversity in the telecommunicationsarchitecture. They must also collaborate to understandthe topography of the physical components of thearchitecture to establish a foundation for defining astrategy to ensure physical and logical diversity. Despite significant challenges, the telecommunications marketplace remains competitive, and customerdemand for services is steady, if not increasing. Aneconomic upturn within the industry could rapidlyaccelerate service demands. The interplay of marketforces and FCC oversight will ensure the continuanceof service delivery to sustain critical telecommunica-tions functions. Nevertheless, recent economic distresshas forced companies to spend their existing resourceson basic network operations rather than re-capitalizing,securing, and enhancing the infrastructure, which couldamplify the financial impact of necessary infrastructureprotection investments. Telecommunications Sector Initiatives Given the reality of the physical and cyber threats to the telecommunications sector, government andindustry must continue to work together to understandvulnerabilities, develop countermeasures, establish policies and procedures, and raise awareness necessaryto mitigate risks. The telecommunications sector has a long, successful history of collaboration with government to address concerns over the reliability and security of the telecommunications infrastructure.The sector has recently undertaken a variety of new initiatives to further ensure both reliability and quickrecovery and reconstitution. Within this environment of increasing emphasis on protection issues, public-private partnership can be further leveraged to addressa number of key telecommunications initiatives,including efforts to: Define an appropriate threshold for security DHS will work with industry to define an appropriate security threshold for the sector anddevelop a set of requirements derived from thatdefinition. DHS will work with industry to closethe gap between respective security expectations and requirements. Reaching agreement on amethodology for ensuring physical diversity is a key element of this effort. Expand infrastructure diverse routing capability DHS will leverage and enhance the government's capabilities to define and map the overall telecom- munications architecture. This effort will identify critical intersections among the various infrastruc-tures and lead to strategies that better addresssecurity and reliability. Understand the risks associated with vulnerabilities of the telecommunications infrastructure The telecommunications infrastructure, including the PSTN, the Internet, and enterprise networks,provides essential communications for governmentsat all levels and other critical infrastructures. DHSwill work with the private sector to conduct studiesto understand physical vulnerabilities within thetelecommunications infrastructure and their associ-ated risks. Studies will focus on facilities wheremany different types of equipment and multiplecarriers are concentrated. Coordinate with key allies and trading partners More than ever our Nation has a common reliance on vital communications circuits and processes withour key allies and trading partners. DHS will workwith other nations to consider innovative communi-cations paths that provide priority communications processes to link our governments, global industries, and networks in such a manner that vital communications are assured. 49 Energy drives the foundation of many of the sophisticated processes at work in American societytoday. It is essential to our economy, national defense,and quality of life. The energy sector is commonly divided into two segments in the context of critical infrastructureprotection: electricity and oil and natural gas. The elec-tric industry services almost 130 million householdsand institutions. The United States consumed nearly3.6 trillion kilowatt hours in 2001. Oil and natural gasfacilities and assets 1are widely distributed, consisting of more than 300,000 producing sites, 4,000 off-shoreplatforms, more than 600 natural gas processing plants,153 refineries, and more than 1,400 product terminals,and 7,500 bulk stations. Almost every form of productive activity\u2014whether inbusinesses, manufacturing plants, schools, hospitals, orhomes\u2014requires electricity. Electricity is also necessaryto produce other forms of energy, such as refined oil.Were a widespread or long-term disruption of the power grid to occur, many of the activities critical to oureconomy and national defense\u2014including those associ-ated with response and recovery\u2014would be impossible.The North American electric system is an interconnected, multi-nodal distribution system thataccounts for virtually all the electricity supplied to the United States, Canada, and a portion of BajaCalifornia Norte, Mexico. The physical system consistsof three major parts: generation, transmission anddistribution, and control and communications. Generation assets include fossil fuel plants, hydroelectric dams, and nuclear power plants. Transmission and distribution systems link areas of the national grid. Distribution systems manage and controlthe distribution of electricity into homes and busi-nesses. Control and communications systems operateand monitor critical infrastructure components. In addition to these components, the electric infrastructure also comprises ancillary facilities andsystems that guarantee fuel supplies necessary tosupport electricity generation, some of which involvethe handling of hazardous materials. The electricitysector also depends heavily on other critical infrastruc-tures for power generation, such as telecommunicationsand transportation. The North American electric system is the world's most reliable, a fact that can be attributed to industry-led efforts to identify single points of failure andsystem interdependencies, and institute appropriateback-up processes, systems, and facilities. After New York's power blackout in 1965, the industry established the North American Electric ReliabilityCouncil (NERC) to develop guidelines and proceduresfor preventing similar incidents. NERC is a nonprofitcorporation made up of 10 regional reliability councils,whose voluntary membership represents all segmentsof the electricity industry, including public and privateutilities from the U.S. and Canada. Through NERC,the electricity sector coordinates programs to enhancesecurity for the electricity industry. The electricity sector is highly regulated even as the industry is being restructured to increase competition.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)and state utility regulatory commissions regulate someof the activities and operations of certain electricityindustry participants. The Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (NRC) regulates nuclear power reactorsand other civilian nuclear facilities, materials,and activities. 2 50 Electricity Sector Challenges The electricity sector is highly complex, and its numerous component assets and systems span theNorth American continent. Many of the sector's key assets, such as generation facilities, key substations, andswitchyards, present unique protection challenges. Increased competition and structural changes currently taking place within the sector may alter security incentives and responsibilities of electricity marketparticipants. These stakeholders are diverse in size,capabilities, and focus. Currently, individual companies pay for levels of protection that are consistent withtheir resources and customer expectations. Typically,these companies seek to recover the costs of new security investments through proposed rate or priceincreases. Under current federal law, however, there is no assurance that electricity industry participantswould be allowed to recover the costs of federallymandated security measures through such rate or price increases. Another challenge for the electricity industry is effective, sector-wide communications. The owners andoperators of the electric system are a large and hetero-geneous group. Industry associations serve as clearinghouses for industry-related information, but not allindustry owners and operators belong to such organi-zations. Data needed to perform thorough analyses on the infrastructure's interdependencies is not readilyavailable. A focused analysis of time-phased effects ofone infrastructure on another, including loss of opera-tions metrics, would help identify dependencies andestablish protection priorities and strategies. For certain transmission and distribution facilities, providing redundancy and increasing generatingcapacity provide greater reliability of electricity service. However, this approach faces several challenges. Longlead times, possible denials of rights-of-way, state andlocal siting requirements, \"not-in-my-backyard\"community perspectives, and uncertain rates of returnwhen compared to competing investment needs arehurdles that may prevent owners and operators of elec-tricity facilities from investing sufficiently in securityand service assurance measures. Building a less vulnerable grid represents another option for protecting the national electricity infrastruc-ture. Work is ongoing to develop a national R&Dstrategy for the electricity sector. Additionally, FERChas developed R&D guidelines, and the Departmentof Energy's (DoE's) National Grid Study containsrecommendations focused on enhancing physical and cyber security for the transmission system.Electricity Sector Initiatives The electricity industry has a history of taking proac- tive measures to assure the reliability and availability ofthe electricity system. Individual enterprises also workactively in their communities to address public safetyissues related to their systems and facilities. SinceSeptember 11, 2001, the sector has reviewed its secu- rity guidelines and initiated a series of intra-industry working groups to address specific aspects of security.It has created a utility-sector security committee at the chief executive officer level to enhance planning,awareness, and resource allocation within the industry. The sector as a whole, with NERC as the sector coordinator, has been working in collaboration withDOE since 1998 to assess its risk posture in light of the new threat environment, particularly with respectto the electric system's dependence on informationtechnology and networks. In the process, the sector hascreated an awareness program that includes a \"Business Case for Action\" for industry senior executives, a strategic reference document, \"An Approach to Action for the Electric Power Sector,\" and security guidelines related to physical and cyber security. With respect to managing security information, the sector has established an indications, analysis, andwarning program that trains utilities on incidentreporting and alert notification procedures. The sector has also developed threat alert levels for both physicaland cyber events, which include action-response guidelines for each alert level. The industry has alsoestablished an ISAC to gather incident information,relay alert notices, and coordinate daily briefs between the federal government and electric grid operators around the country. Power management control rooms are probably the most protected aspect of the electrical network.NERC's guidelines require a backup system and/ormanual work-arounds to bypass damaged systems.FERC is also working with the sector to develop acommon set of security requirements for all enterprisesin the competitive electric supply market. Additional electricity sector protection initiatives include efforts to: Identify equipment stock pile requirements DHS and DoE will work with the electricity sector to inventory components and equipment critical toelectric-system operations and to identify and assessother approaches to enhance restoration andrecovery to include standardizing equipment and increasing component interchangeability. 51Re-evaluate and adjust nationwide protection planning, system restoration, and recovery in response to attacks The electric power industry has an excellent process and record of reconstitution and recovery fromdisruptive events. Jointly, industry and governmentneed to evaluate this system and its processes tosupport the evolution from a local and regionalsystem to an integrated national response system.DHS and DoE will work with the electricity sectorto ensure that existing coordination and mutual aidprocesses can effectively and efficiently supportprotection, response, and recovery activities as thestructure of the electricity sector continues to evolve. Develop strategies to reduce vulnerabilities DHS and DoE will work with state and local governments and the electric power industry toidentify the appropriate levels of redundancy of critical parts of the electric system, as well asrequirements for designing and implementing redundancy in view of the industry's realignment and restructuring activities. Develop standardized guidelines for physical security programs DHS and DOE will work with the sector to define consistent criteria for criticality, standard approachesfor vulnerability and risk assessments for criticalfacilities, and physical security training for electricitysector personnel. The oil and natural gas industries are closely inte-grated. The oil infrastructure consists of five generalcomponents: oil production, crude oil transport,refining, product transport and distribution, and control and other external support systems. Oil andnatural gas production include: exploration, field devel-opment, on- and offshore production, field collectionsystems, and their supporting infrastructures. Crude oiltransport includes pipelines (160,000 miles), storageterminals, ports, and ships. The refinement infrastruc-ture consists of about 150 refineries that range in sizeand production capabilities from 5,000 to over 500,000barrels per day. Transport and distribution of oilincludes pipelines, trains, ships, ports, terminals andstorage, trucks, and retail stations. The natural gas industry consists of three major components: exploration and production, transmission,and local distribution. The U.S. produces roughly 20percent of the world's natural gas supply. There are278,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 1,119,000miles of natural gas distribution lines in the U.S.Distribution includes storage facilities, gas processing, liquid natural gas facilities, pipelines, citygates, andliquefied petroleum gas storage facilities. Citygates aredistribution pipeline nodes through which gas passesfrom interstate pipelines to a local distribution system.Natural gas storage refers to underground aquifers, depleted oil and gas fields, and salt caverns. The pipeline and distribution segments of the oil and natural gas industries are highly regulated. Oversightincludes financial, safety, and siting regulations. Theexploration and production side of the industry is lessregulated, but is affected by safety regulations and restrictions concerning property access. Oil and Natural Gas Sector Challenges Protection of critical assets requires both heightened security awareness and investment in protective equip-ment and systems. One serious issue is the lack ofmetrics to determine and justify corporate securityexpenditures. In the case of natural disasters or accidents, there are well-established methods for determining risks and cost-effective levels of invest-ments in protective equipment, systems, and methodsfor managing risk (e.g., insurance). It is not clear whatlevels of security and protection are appropriate andcost effective to meet the risks of terrorist attack. The first government responders to a terrorist attack on most oil and natural gas sector facilities will be local police and fire departments. In general, theseresponders need to improve their capabilities and preparedness to confront well-planned, sophisticatedattacks, particularly those involving CBR weapons.Fortunately, because of public-safety requirements related to their operations and facilities, the oil and natural gas industries have substantial protectionprograms already in place. Quick action to repair damaged infrastructure in an emergency can be impeded by a number of hurdles,including the long lead time needed to obtain local,state, and federal construction permits or waivers;requirements for environmental reviews and impact statements; and lengthy processes for obtainingconstruction rights-of-way for the placement ofpipelines on adjoining properties if a new pathbecomes necessary. The availability of necessary materials and equipment, and the uniqueness of suchequipment are also impediments to rapid reconstitutionof damaged infrastructure. The current system for locating and distributing replacement parts needs to be enhanced significantly. The components themselves range from state-of-the-art systems to mechanisms that are decades old. While 52 newer systems are standardized, many of the older components are unique and must be custom-manufac-tured. Moreover, there is extensive variation in size,ownership, and security across natural gas facilities. There are also a large number of natural gas facilitiesscattered over broad geographical areas\u2014a fact thatcomplicates protection. Oil and Natural Gas Sector Initiatives Oil and natural gas sector protection initiatives includeefforts to: Plan and invest in research and development for the oil and gas industry to enhance robustness and reliability Utilizing the federal government's national scientific and research capabilities, DHS and DoE will workwith oil and natural gas sector stakeholders todevelop an appropriate strategy for research anddevelopment to support protection, response, andrecovery requirements. Develop strategies to reduce vulnerabilities DHS and DoE will work with state and local governments and industry to identify the appro-priate levels of redundancy of critical componentsand systems, as well as requirements for designingand enhancing reliability. Develop standardized guidelines for physical security programs DHS and DoE will work with the oil and natural gas industry representatives to define consistentcriteria for criticality, standard approaches forvulnerability and risk assessments for various facilities, and physical security training for industry personnel. Develop guidelines for measures to reconstitute capabilities of individual facilities and systems DHS and DoE will convene an advisory task force of industry representatives from the sector,construction firms, equipment suppliers, oil-engineering firms, state and local governments, andfederal agencies to identify appropriate planningrequirements and approaches. Develop a national system for locating and distributing critical components in support of response and recoveryactivities DHS and DoE will work with industry to develop regional and national programs for identifying spare parts, requirements, notifying parties of their availability, and distributing them in an emergency. ________ 1 Pipelines that transport oil and gas supplies are components of the transportation sector's critical infrastructure and areregulated by the Department of Transportation (DoT) for safety purposes. Their protection is discussed in further detailon pages 58-59 of the Transportation Sector Section of this document. 2 Nuclear power plants are an important component of the energy sector's critical infrastructure. Because of the potentialpublic health and safety consequences an attack on a nuclearfacility could cause, specific issues related to their protectionare included on page 74 of the Protecting Key Assets chapter of this document. 53 The transportation sector consists of several key modes: aviation, maritime traffic, rail, pipelines, high-ways, trucking and busing, and public mass transit. Thediversity and size of the transportation sector makes itvital to our economy and national security, includingmilitary mobilization and deployment. As a whole, itsinfrastructure is robust, having been developed overdecades of both private and public investment.Together the various transportation modes provide mobility of our population and contribute to ourmuch-cherished individual freedom. The transporta- tion infrastructure is also convenient. Americans relyon its easy access and reliability in their daily lives. Interdependencies exist between transportation and nearly every other sector of the economy. Consequently,a threat to the transportation sector may impact otherindustries that rely on it. Threat information affectingtransportation modes must be adequately addressedthrough communication and coordination amongmultiple parties who use or rely on these systems. The aviation mode is vast, consisting of thousands of entry points. It also has symbolic value, representingthe freedom of movement that Americans value sohighly as well as the technological and industrialprowess that have made the United States a world power. The Nation's aviation system consists of twomain parts: Airports and the associated assets needed to support their operations, including the aircraft that theyserve; and A viation command, contr ol, communications, and information systems needed to support and maintain safe use of our national airspace. Before September 11, the security of airports and their associated assets was the responsibility of privatecarriers and state and local airport owners and operators. In the months following the September 11attacks, Congress passed legislation establishing theTransportation Security Administration as the responsible authority for assuring aviation security. Aviation Mode Challenges As the events of September 11 illustrated, aviation's vital importance to the U.S. economy and the freedomit provides our citizens make its protection an impor-tant national priority. Aviation faces several uniqueprotection challenges. Its distribution and open accessthrough thousands of entry points at home and abroadmake it difficult to secure. Furthermore, components ofthe aviation infrastructure are not only attractive 54 terrorist targets, but also serve as potential weapons to be exploited. Together, these factors make the U.S.aviation infrastructure a potential target for futureterrorist strikes. Additional unique protection challenges for aviation include: Volume: U.S.air carriers transport millions of passengers every day and at least twice as many bagsand other cargo. Limited capabilities and available space: Current detection equipment and methods are limited innumber, capability, and ease of use. Time-sensitive cargo: \"Just-in-time\" delivery of valuable cargo is essential for many businesses\u2014anysignificant time delay in processing and transportingsuch cargo would negatively affect the U.S.economy. Security versus convenience: Maintaining security while limiting congestion and delays complicatesthe task of security and has important financialimplications. Accessibility: Most airports are open to the public; their facilities are close to public roadways forconvenience and to streamline access for vehiclesdelivering passengers to terminals. Another concern for the aviation industry is the additional cost of increased security during sustainedperiods of heightened alert. Since September 11, 2001,airports across the country have-in effect-been workingat surge capacity to meet the security requirements ofthe current threat environment. Some cash-strappedoperators must now balance providing higher levels ofsecurity with staying in business. Aviation Mode Initiatives Airport security failures on September 11 have placed the aviation industry under intense public scrutiny. Toregain the public's confidence in air travel, public and private organizations have made substantial invest-ments to increase airport security. Much work remains.DHS, as the federal lead department for the trans-portation sector, will work with DoT, industry, andstate and local governments to organize, plan, andimplement needed protection activities. Aviation mode protection initiatives include efforts to: Identify vulnerabilities, interdependencies, and remediation requirements DHS and DoT will work with representatives from state and local governments and industry to implement or facilitate risk assessments to identifyvulnerabilities, interdependencies, and remediation requirements for operations and coordination-center facilities and systems, such as the need for redun-dant telecommunications for air traffic commandand control centers. Identify potential threats to passengers DHS and DoT will work with airline and airport security executives to develop or facilitate newmethods for identifying likely human threats whilerespecting constitutional freedoms and privacy. Improve security at key points of access DHS and DoT will work with airline and airport security executives to tighten security or facilitateincreased security at restricted access points withinairport terminal areas, as well as the perimeter ofairports and associated facilities, including operations and coordination centers. Increase cargo screening capabilities DHS and DoT will work with airline and airport security officials to identify and implement or facili-tate technologies and processes to enhance airportbaggage-screening capacities. Identify and improve detection technologies DHS and DoT will work with airline and airport security executives to implement or facilitateenhanced technologies for detecting explosives.Such devices will mitigate the impact of increased security on passenger check-in efficiency andconvenience, and also provide a more effective andefficient means of assuring vital aviation security. 55 During every hour of every day, trains traverse the United States, linking producers of raw materials tomanufacturers and retailers. They carry mining, manu-facturing, and agriculture products; liquid chemicalsand fuels; and consumer goods. Trains carry 40 percentof intercity freight\u2014a much larger portion than ismoved by any other single mode of transportation.About 20 percent of that freight is coal, a criticalresource for the generation of electricity. More than 20 million intercity travelers use the rail system annu-ally, and 45 million passengers ride trains and subwaysoperated by local transit authorities. Securing rail-sector assets is critical to protecting U.S. commerce and the safety of travelers. Rail Mode Challenges Our Nation's railway system is vast and complex, with multiple points of entry. Differences in design, struc- ture, and purpose of railway stations complicate thesector's overall protection framework. The size andbreadth of the sector make it difficult to react tothreats effectively or efficiently in all scenarios. Thisfact complicates protection efforts, but it also offerscertain mitigating potential in the event of a terroristattack. For example, trains are confined to specificroutes and are highly controllable. If hijacked, a train can be shunted off the mainline and rendered less of a threat. Similarly, the loss of a bridge or tunnel canimpact traffic along major corridors; however, the potential for national-level disruptions is limited. The greater risk is associated with rail transport of hazardous materials. Freight railways often carryhazardous materials that are essential to other sectorsand public services. The decision-making processregarding their transport is complex and requires close coordination between industry and government.A sector-wide information sharing process could helpprevent over-reactive security measures, such asrestricting the shipment of critical hazardous materials nationwide as a blanket safety measure in response to alocalized incident. Security solutions to the container shipping challenge should recognize that, in many cases, commerce,including essential national security materials, mustcontinue to flow. Stifling commerce to meet securityneeds simply swaps one consequence of a securitythreat for another. In the event that a credible threatwere to necessitate a shutdown, well-developed conti-nuity of operations procedures can mitigate furtherunintentional negative consequences. For example,contingency planning can help determine how quicklycommerce can be resumed; whether rerouting providesa measure of protection; or what specific shipmentsshould be exempt from a shutdown, such as nationaldefense critical materials. An additional area of concern is the marking of container cars to indicate the specific type of hazardousmaterials being transported. During an emergencyresponse, placards on rail cars help to alert first respon- ders to hazardous materials they may encounter.Planners must take care, however, to devise a system of markings that terrorists cannot easily decipher. Like the aviation sector, the rail industry also faces the additional costs of sustaining increased security duringperiods of heightened alert. Since the events ofSeptember 11, the railroads across the country have\u2014 in effect\u2014been working at surge capacity to meet thesecurity requirements of the increased threat environ-ment, which entails assigning overtime and hiringtemporary security personnel. Such reservoirs ofcapacity are costly to maintain. Nevertheless, the rail sector has had to adopt these heightened security levelsas the new \"normal\" state. Some cash-strapped opera-tors now face trade-offs between providing increasedlevels of security and going out of business. Railroads have well-developed contingency plans and backups for dispatch, control, and communicationsequipment that are sufficient for localized or minordisruptions. Developing this type of backup to enable 56 continuation of operations after a cataclysmic event is problematic given the costs associated with extensivestructural enhancements. Rail Mode Initiatives The rail mode has been working actively with DoT to assess the risk environment. As a result, it has devel-oped a comprehensive modal risk assessment andestablished a surface transportation ISAC to facilitatethe exchange of information related to both cyber andphysical threats specific to the railroads. Since September 11, many rail operators have added investments to their security programs. Additional railmode protection initiatives include efforts to: Develop improved decision-making criteria regarding the shipment of hazardous materials DHS and DoT, coordinating with other federal agencies, state and local governments, and industrywill facilitate the development of an improvedprocess to assure informed decision-making withrespect to hazardous materials shipment. Develop technologies and procedures to screen intermodal containers and passenger baggage DHS and DoT will work with sector counterparts to identify and explore technologies and processesto enable efficient and expeditious screening of rail passengers and baggage, especially at inter-modal stations. Improve security of intermodal transportation DHS and DoT will work with sector counterparts to identify and facilitate the development of technologies and procedures to secure inter-modalcontainers and detect threatening content. DHS and DoT will also work with the rail industry to devise or enable a hazardous materials identifica-tion system that supports the needs of firstresponders, yet avoids providing terrorists with easy identification of a potential weapon. Clearly delineate roles and responsibilities regarding surge requirements DHS and DoT will work with industry to delineate infrastructure protection roles and responsibilities toenable the rail industry to address surge requirementsfor resources in the case of catastrophic events. Costs and resource allocation remains a contentious issue for the rail sector. DHS and DoT will alsoconvene a working group consisting of governmentand industry representatives to identify options forthe implementation of surge capabilities, includingaccess to federal facilities and capabilities in extreme emergencies., , The trucking and busing industry is a fundamental component of our national transportation infrastruc-ture. Without the sector's resources, the movement ofpeople, goods, and services around the country wouldbe greatly impeded. Components of this infrastructureinclude highways, roads, inter-modal terminals,bridges, tunnels, trucks, buses, maintenance facilities,and roadway border crossings. Highways, Trucking, and Busing Mode Challenges Because of its heterogeneity in size and operations and the multitude of owners and operators nationwide,the trucking and busing infrastructure is highlyresilient, flexible, and responsive to market demand. For the same reason, the sector is fractionated and regulated by multiple jurisdictions at state, federal, and\u2014sometimes\u2014local levels. The size and pervasivenature of the trucking and busing infrastructure posesignificant protection challenges. Transportation choke points (e.g., bridges and tunnels, inter-modal terminals, border crossings, and highwayinterchanges) present unique protection challenges.Overall understanding of infrastructure choke points is limited. Common criteria for identifying critical chokepoints are therefore difficult to establish. We mustundertake a comprehensive, systematic effort to iden-tify key assets, particularly those whose destruction or 57 disruption would entail significant public health and safety consequences or significant economic impact. Although many states have conducted risk assessments of their respective highway infrastructures, no true basisfor comparison among them exists to determine relativecriticality. Likewise, there is no coordinated mechanismfor assessing choke-point vulnerabilities or conductingand evaluating risk mitigation planning. A major reasonfor this lack of synchronization within the sector is apaucity of funds to promote communication amongindustry members and facilitate cooperation for jointprotection planning efforts. As a result, the sector as awhole has neither a coherent picture of industry-widerisks, nor a set of appropriate security criteria on which to baseline its protection planning efforts, such as whatconditions constitute threats for the sector, or standardsfor infrastructure protection or threat reduction. Thesector's diverse and widely distributed constituencycomplicates this situation. Given the number of public and private small-business owners and operators in this sector, the cost of infra- structure protection is also a major challenge. Like therail mode, in addition to the financial concerns associ-ated with new security investments, highway, trucking,and busing organizations also regard the possibility ofsecurity-related delays at border crossings as a potentialproblem of major financial significance. Another challenge is the way in which sector security incidents are handled across multiple jurisdictions.Because different law enforcement agencies differ intheir approaches to crimes like truck theft, law enforce-ment responses to security incidents in this sector areinconsistent across jurisdictional lines. Highways, Trucking, and Busing Mode Initiatives Like the other major transportation modes, the highways, trucking, and busing mode has assessed itsown security programs in light of the September 11 attacks. However, the sector's vast, heterogeneousnature requires further expanded coordination amongstakeholder organizations to assure a more consistent,integrated national approach. Additionally, a betterunderstanding of the overall system would lead tomore adaptable, less intrusive, and more cost-effectivesecurity processes. Highways, trucking, and busingprotection initiatives include efforts to: Facilitate comprehensive risk, threat, and vulnerability assessments DHS, working closely with DoT and other key sector stakeholders, will facilitate comprehensive risk,threat, and vulnerability assessments for this mode.Develop guidelines and standard criteria for identifying and mitigating chokepoints DHS, working with DoT and other sector key stakeholders, will develop guidelines and standardcriteria for identifying and mitigating choke points,both nationally and regionally. Harden industry infrastructure against terrorism through technology DHS will work jointly with industry and state and local governments to explore and identify potentialtechnology solutions and standards that will supportanalysis and afford better and more cost effectiveprotection against terrorism. Create national transportation operator security education and awareness programs DHS and DoT will work with industry to create national operator security education and awarenessprograms to provide the foundation for greatercooperation and coordination within this highlydiverse mode. The United States has a vast pipeline industry, consisting of many hundreds of thousands of miles ofpipelines, many of which are buried underground.These lines move a variety of substances such as crudeoil, refined petroleum products, and natural gas. Pipeline facilities already incorporate a variety of stringent safety precautions that account for the poten-tial effects a disaster could have on surrounding areas.Moreover, most elements of pipeline infrastructurescan be quickly repaired or bypassed to mitigate local- ized disruptions. Destruction of one or even several of its key components would not disrupt the entiresystem. As a whole, the response and recovery capabili-ties of the pipeline industry are well proven, and mostlarge control-center operators have established extensive contingency plans and backup protocols. Pipeline Mode Challenges Pipelines are not independent entities, but rather integral parts of industrial and public service networks.Loss of a pipeline could impact a wide array of facili- ties and industrial factories that depend on reliable fueldelivery to operate. Several hundred thousand miles of pipeline span the country, and it is not realistic to expect total securityfor all facilities. As such, protection efforts focus oninfrastructure components whose impairment wouldhave significant effects on the energy markets and theeconomy as a whole. For the pipeline industry, 58 determining what to protect and when to protect it is a factor in cost-effective infrastructure protection.During periods of high demand\u2014such as the winter months\u2014pipeline systems typically operate at peakcapacity and are more important to the facilities and functions they serve. The pipeline industry as a whole has an excellent safety record, as well as in-place crisis management protocols to manage disruptions as they occur. Nevertheless, manyof the products that pipelines deliver are inherentlyvolatile. Hence, their protection is a significant issue. Pipelines cross numerous state and local, as well as international jurisdictions. The number and variety of stakeholders create a confusing, and sometimesconflicting, array of regulations and security programsfor the industry to manage, especially with respect tothe ability of pipeline facilities to recover, reconstitute,and re-establish service quickly after a disruption. The pipeline industry's increasing interdependencies with the energy and telecommunications sectors neces-sitate cooperation with other critical infrastructuresduring protection and response planning. Individually,companies have difficulty assessing the broader impli-cations of an attack on their critical facilities. These interdependencies call for cross-sector coordination for to be truly responsive to national concerns.Additionally, some issues concerning recovery or recon- stitution will require at least regional planning withinthe industry, as well as the sharing of sensitive businessinformation that may run into proprietary concerns. Pipeline Mode Initiatives Historically, individual enterprises within this sector have invested in the security of their facilities toprotect their ability to deliver oil and gas products. Representatives from major entities within this sectorhave examined the new terrorist risk environment. As aresult, they have developed a plan for action, including industry-wide information sharing. In addition toindustry efforts, DoT has developed a methodology fordetermining pipeline facility criticality and a system ofrecommended protective measures that are synchro- nized with the threat levels of the Homeland SecurityAdvisory System. Additional pipeline mode protection initiatives include efforts to: Develop standard reconstitution protocols DHS, in collaboration with DoE, DoT, and industry, will initiate a study to identify, clarify,and establish authorities and procedures as neededto reconstitute facilities as quickly as possible after a disruption. Develop standard security assessment and threat deterrent guidelines DHS, in collaboration with DoE and DoT, will work with state and local governments and thepipeline industry to develop consensus securityguidance on assessing vulnerabilities, improvingsecurity plans, implementing specific deterrent and protective actions, and upgrading response andrecovery plans for pipelines. Work with other sectors to manage risks resulting from interdependencies DHS, in collaboration with DoE and DoT, will convene cross-sector working groups to developmodels for integrating protection priorities andemergency response plans. 59 The maritime shipping infrastructure includes ports and their associated assets, ships and passenger trans-portation systems, costal and inland waterways, locks,dams and canals, and the network of railroads andpipelines that connect these waterborne systems toother transportation networks. There are 361 seaportsin the United States, and their operations range widelyin size and characteristics. Most ports have diverse waterside facilities that are owned, operated, and accessed by diverse entities. State and local governments control some port authorityfacilities, while others are owned and operated byprivate corporations. Most ships are privately ownedand operated. Cargo is stored in terminals at ports andloaded onto ships or other vehicles that pass throughon their way to domestic and international destina-tions. DoD has also designated certain commercialseaports as strategic seaports, which provide facilitiesand services needed for military deployment. Maritime Mode Challenges The size, diversity, and complexity of this infrastructuremake the inspection of all vessels and cargo that passesthrough our ports an extremely difficult undertaking.Current inspection methods\u2014both physical and tech-nological\u2014are limited and costly. As with other modesof transportation that cross international borders, we must manage the tension between efficient processing of cargo and passengers and adequate security. Major portions of the maritime industry's operations are international in nature and are governed by inter-national agreements and multinational authorities,such as the International Maritime Organization.Negotiation of maritime rules and practices with foreign governments lies within the purview of DoS.Often these international efforts involve extendednegotiation timelines. DoT currently recommends guidelines for passenger vessel and terminal security, including passenger andbaggage screening and training of crews. The industryrequires R&D for cost-effective technologies for the rapid detection of explosives and other hazardoussubstances, as well as for new vessel designs to mini-mize the likelihood of a ship sinking if it were attacked. Much of the port system represents a significant protection challenge, particularly in the case of highconsequence cargo. Physical and operational securityguidelines have undergone a comprehensive review,from which DoT and DHS will issue guidance andrecommendations for appropriate protective actions. Efforts to increase the security of the maritimeindustry must also consider infrastructures subject to 60 multi-agency jurisdictions and the international framework in which the industry operates. Maritime Mode Initiatives Following the September 11 attacks, initial risk assessments were conducted for all ports. These assess-ments have helped refine critical infrastructure and keyasset designations, assess vulnerabilities, guide thedevelopment of mitigation strategies, and illuminatebest practices. Most port authorities and private facilityowners have also reexamined their security practices. Based on these preliminary risk assessments, DoTincreased vessel notification requirements to shiftlimited resources to maintain positive control of move-ment of high-risk vessels carrying high-consequencecargoes and large numbers of passengers. DoT and the U.S.Coast Guard have also established a Sea Marshal program and deployable Maritime Safety and SecurityTeams to implement these activities. Additionally, DoT has participated in efforts to expe- dite compliance with existing international standardsand to develop additional standards to enhance port,vessel, and facility security. DoT is also working withthe U.S. Customs Service to implement the Container Security Initiative to ensure the security of the shipping supply chain. Shippers who do not comply withoutlined rules and regulations will be subject to greater scrutiny and delays when entering U.S. ports. Additional maritime mode protection initiatives include efforts to: Identify vulnerabilities, interdependencies, best practices, and remediation requirements DHS and DoT will undertake or facilitate additional security assessments to identify vulnera-bilities and interdependencies, enable the sharing ofshare best practices, and issue guidance or recom-mendations on appropriate mitigation strategies. Develop a plan for implementing security measures corresponding to varying threat levels DHS and DoT will work closely with other appropriate federal departments and agencies, portsecurity committees, and private-sector owners andoperators to develop or facilitate the establishmentof security plans to minimize security risks to ports,vessels, and other critical maritime facilities. Develop processes to enhance maritime domain awareness and gain international cooperation DHS and DoT will work closely with other appropriate federal departments and agencies, portsecurity committees, and port owners and operators,foreign governments, international organizations,and commercial firms to establish a means for identifying potential threats at ports of embarkationand monitor identified vessels, cargo, and passengersen route to the U.S. Develop a template for improving physical and operational port security DHS and DoT will collaborate with appropriate federal departments and agencies and port owners andoperators to develop a template for improving physicaland operational port security. A list of possible guide-lines will include workforce identification measures,enhanced port-facility designs, vessel hardening plans,standards for international container seals, guidancefor the research and development of noninvasive security and monitoring systems for cargo and ships,real-time and trace-back capability information for containers, prescreening processes for high-riskcontainers, and recovery plans. Activities will includereviewing the best practices of other countries. Develop security and protection guidelines and technologies for cargo and passenger ships DHS and DoT will work with international maritime organizations and industry to study and developappropriate guidelines and technology requirementsfor the security of cargo and passenger ships. Improve waterway security DHS and DoT, working with state and local government owners and operators, will developguidelines and identify needed support forimproving security of waterways, such as developingelectronic monitoring systems for waterway traffic;modeling shipping systems to identify and protectcritical components; and identifying requirementsand procedures for periodic waterway patrols. Each year passengers take approximately 9.5 billiontrips on public transit. In fact, mass transit carries morepassengers in a single day than air or rail transportation.If the effect on air transportation resulting from theSeptember 11 attacks is an indicator, then a terrorist attack on a major mass transit system could have asignificant regional and national economic impact. Mass transit systems are designed to be publicly accessible. Most are owned and operated by state andlocal agencies. A city relies on its mass transit systemto serve a significant portion of its workforce in addition to being a means of evacuation in case ofemergency. Protection of mass transit systems is,therefore, an important requirement. 61Mass Transit Mode Challenges Mass transit is regulated by various agencies. These agencies must communicate and work together effec-tively to allow transit to work as a system rather thanin separate modes. Mass transit is funded and managedat the local level, and operated as a not-for-profitentity. The Federal Transit Authority has limitedlegislative authority to oversee the security planningand operations of transit systems. Mass transit systems were designed for openness and ease of public access, which makes monitoring pointsof entry and exit difficult. Protecting them is alsoexpensive. Transit authorities must have the financialresources to respond to emergencies and maintain adequate security levels to deter attacks over broadgeographic areas. The cost of implementing new security requirements could result in significant financial consequences for the industry.Each city and region has a unique transit system, varying in size and design. No one security program or information sharing mechanism will fit all systems.Despite these differences, as a general rule, basic planning factors are relatively consistent from systemto system. Mass Transit Mode Initiatives Since transit is localized and varies significantly in size and design from system to system, identifying criticalguidelines and standards for planning is key to unifyingmass transit security activities. Panels in the TransitCooperative Research Program have recommended and are overseeing 10 research projects in the areas ofprevention, mitigation, preparedness, and response.Their recommendations can provide additional input to the development of these planning areas. Additional mass transit protection initiatives include efforts to: Identify critical planning areas and develop appropriate guidelines and standards DHS, working closely with DoT and other federal, state, and local mass transit officials, will identifycritical planning areas and develop appropriateguidelines and standards to protect mass transitsystems. Such critical planning areas and guidelinesinclude design and engineering standards for facili-ties and rail and bus vehicles; emergency guidancefor operations staff; screening methods and trainingprograms for operators; security planning oversightstandards; mutual aid policies; and continuity ofoperations planning. Identify protective impediments and implement security enhancements DHS, working closely with DoT and mode representatives, will review legal, legislative, and statutory regimes to develop an overall protectivearchitecture for mass transit systems and to identifyimpediments to implementing needed securityenhancements. Work with other sectors to manage unique risks resulting from interdependencies DHS, in collaboration with DoT, will convene cross-sector working groups to develop models forintegrating priorities and emergency response plansin the context of interdependencies between masstransit and other critical infrastructures. 62 The banking and financial services sector infrastructure consists of a variety of physical structures, such as buildings and financial utilities, as well as humancapital. Most of the industry's activities and operations take place in large commercial office buildings. Physicalstructures to be protected house retail or wholesalebanking operations, financial markets, regulatory institutions, and physical repositories for documentsand financial assets. Today's financial utilities, such aspayment and clearing and settlement systems, are primarily electronic, although some physical transfer ofassets does still occur. The financial utilities infrastruc-ture includes such electronic devices as computers,storage devices, and telecommunication networks. Inaddition to the sector's key physical components, manyfinancial services employees have highly specializedskills and are, therefore, considered essential elements ofthe industry's critical infrastructure. The financial industry also depends on continued public confidence and involvement to maintain normaloperations. Financial institutions maintain only a smallfraction of depositors' assets in cash on hand. If deposi-tors and customers were to seek to withdraw theirassets simultaneously, severe liquidity pressures wouldbe placed on the financial system. With this in mind,federal safeguards are in place to prevent liquidityshortfalls. In times of crisis or disaster, maintainingpublic confidence demands that financial institutions,financial markets, and payment systems remain opera-tional or that their operations can be quickly restored. Additionally, in times of stress the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the Securities and Exchange Commission proactivelyaddress public confidence issues, as was done followingthe September 11 terrorist attacks. The Department ofthe Treasury and federal and state regulatory commu-nities have developed emergency communicationsplans for the banking and finance sector. With regard to retail financial services, physical assets are well distributed geographically throughout theindustry. The sector's retail niche is characterized by ahigh degree of substitutability, which means that onetype of payment mechanism or asset can be easily replaced with another during a short-term crisis. For example, in retail markets, consumers can make payments through cash, checks, or credit cards. The banking and financial services industry is highly regulated and highly competitive. Industry profes- sionals and government regulators regularly engage inidentifying sector vulnerabilities and take appropriateprotective measures, including sanctions for institutionsthat do not consistently meet standards. 63 Banking and Finance Sector Challenges Like the other critical sectors, the banking and financial services sector relies on several critical infrastructure industries for continuity of operations,including electric power, transportation, and publicsafety services. The sector also specifically relies oncomputer networks and telecommunications systems toassure the availability of its services. The potential fordisruption of these systems is an important concern.For example, the equity securities markets remained closed for four business days following September 11, not because any markets or market systems were inop-erable, but because the telecommunications lines inlower Manhattan that connect key market participantswere heavily damaged and could not be restored imme-diately. As a mitigation measure, financial institutionshave made great strides to build redundancy andbackup into their systems and operations. Overlapping federal intelligence authorities involved in publicizing threat information cause confusion andduplication of effort for both industry and government.The Department of the Treasury organized theFinancial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) as a standing committee of thePCIPB. The FBIIC comprises representatives from 13 federal and state financial regulatory agencies. 1 The FBIIC is currently working with the NationalInfrastructure Protection Center, the Financial ServicesISAC (FS-ISAC), and the OHS to improve the information dissemination and sharing processes. Banking and Finance Sector Initiatives The attacks in New York City on September 11showed that the financial services industry is highlyresilient. The strong safeguards and back-up systems the industry had in place performed well. Since 1998,the sector has been working with the Department ofthe Treasury to organize itself to address the risks ofthe emerging threat environment, particularly cyberintrusions. It was also the first sector to establish anISAC to share security-related information amongmembers of the industry. Major institutions in this sector continue to perform ongoing assessments of their security programs.After the September 11 attacks, the industry and its associations initiated lessons-learned reviews to identify corrective actions for the improvement of security andresponse and recovery programs, as well as to provide a forum for sharing best practices through their tradeassociations and other interdisciplinary groups. Thesector as a whole, with the support of the Departmentof the Treasury, has also initiated a sector-wide riskreview. In addition to sector-wide efforts, individual institutions have stepped up their investments becauseof their better understanding of the threat. Additional banking and finance sector protection initiatives include efforts to: I dentify and address the risks of sector dependencies on electronic networks and telecommunications services The financial services sector's reliance on informa- tion systems and networks has resulted in a numberof concerns for the industry. The Department of the Treasury, in concert with DHS, will convene aworking group consisting of representatives fromthe telecommunications and financial servicessectors, as well as other federal agencies, to studyand address the risks that arise from the sector'sdependencies on electronic networks and telecommunications services. Enhance the exchange of security-related information DHS will work with the Department of Treasury, the FBIIC, and the FS-ISAC to improve federalgovernment communications with sector membersand streamline the mechanisms through which theyexchange threat information on a daily basis as wellas during an incident. ________ 1 The FBIIC includes representatives of the federal and state financial regulatory agencies, including: the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Reserve Board, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the National CreditUnion Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency, the Office of Federal Housing EnterpriseOversight, the Offices of Homeland and Cyberspace Security, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 64 The chemical sector provides products that are essential to the U.S. economy and standard of living.The industry manufactures products that are funda-mental elements of other economic sectors. Forexample, it produces fertilizer for agriculture, chlorinefor water purification, and polymers that create plasticsfrom petroleum for innumerable household and indus-trial products. Additionally, more than $97 billion ofthe sector's products go to health care alone. Currently, the chemical sector is the Nation's top exporter, accounting for 10 cents out of every dollar.The industry is also one of our country's most innova-tive. It earns one out of every seven patents issued inthe U.S., a fact that enables our country to remaincompetitive in the international chemical market. The sector itself is highly diverse in terms of company sizes and geographic dispersion. Its product andservice-delivery system depends on raw materials,manufacturing plants and processes, and distributionsystems, as well as research facilities and supportinginfrastructure services, such as transportation and electricity products. Public confidence is important to the continued economic robustness and operation of the chemicalindustry. Uncertainty regarding the safety of a productimpacts producers as well as the commercial users ofthe product. With respect to process safety, numerousfederal laws and regulations exist to reduce the likeli-hood of accidents that could result in harm to humanhealth or the environment. However, there is currentlyno clear, unambiguous legal or regulatory authority atthe federal level to help ensure comprehensive, uniformsecurity standards for chemical facilities. In addition to the economic consequences of a successful attack on this sector, there is also the poten-tial of a threat to public health and safety. 1Therefore, the need to reduce the sector's vulnerability to acts ofterrorism is important to safeguard our economy andprotect our citizens and the environment. Chemical Industry and Hazardous Materials Sector Challenges Assurance of supply is critical to downstream users of chemical products for various reasons. Many largemunicipal water works maintain only a few days supply of chlorine for disinfecting their water supplies.Agricultural chemicals, particularly fertilizers, must beapplied in large volumes during very short time periods.Some products cannot be transferred between trans- portation modes. Facilities with \"just-in-time\" deliverysystems maintain fewer and smaller chemical stockpiles. The industry's ability to protect and assure the quality of its own chemical stockpiles is also important.Because chemicals are vital to many applications,contamination of key chemical stocks could impact awide range of other industries, thereby affecting publichealth and the economy. In addition to the risk ofcontamination at product storage facilities, manychemicals are also inherently hazardous and, therefore,represent potential risks to public health and safety in a malicious context. Improving security can be expensive, 65 but there are cost-effective steps that industry can take to reduce vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, the riskprofiles of chemical plants differ tremendously becauseof differences in technologies, product mix, design,and processes. Therefore, no single, specific securityregime would be appropriate or effective for all chemical facilities. Many current statutes related to the handling of highly toxic substances were created decades ago and may nolonger be effective for monitoring and controllingaccess to dangerous substances. For example, althoughlicensed distributors of pesticides can only sell them tolicensed purchasers, license requests, which are grantedat the state level by county extension agents, are fairlyeasy to obtain. In addition, the basis for licensing variesfrom state to state. As in most other industries, the chemical industry relies on the availability, continuity, and quality of service and supplies from other critical infrastructures.For example, the chemical industry is the Nation's third largest consumer of electricity. An assured supplyof natural gas at competitive prices is another crucialresource for the sector. Chemical Industry and Hazardous Materials Sector Initiatives Currently, parts of the industry have taken positive, voluntary steps to protect sector infrastructure. Forexample, several trade associations have developed orare developing security codes 2to help their members address the need to reduce vulnerabilities. Thesecommendable efforts will make important contribu-tions to protecting key elements of the chemical andhazardous materials infrastructure against terroristattack. These efforts are in the early stages of implementation. However, it should be also noted thata significant percentage of companies that operatemajor hazardous chemical facilities do not abide byvoluntary security codes developed by other parts ofthe industry.Chemicals and hazardous materials sector protection initiatives include efforts to: Promote enhanced site security DHS, in concert with EPA, will work with Congress to enact legislation that would requirecertain chemical facilities, particularly those thatmaintain large quantities of hazardous chemicals inclose proximity to population centers, to undertake vulnerability assessments and take reasonable stepsto reduce the vulnerabilities identified. Review current laws and regulations that pertain to the sale and distribution of pesticides and other highly toxicsubstances EPA, in consultation with DHS and other federal, state, and local agencies, as well as with otherappropriate stakeholders, will review current prac-tices and existing statutory requirements on thedistribution and sale of highly toxic pesticides andindustrial chemicals. This process will help identifywhether additional measures may be necessary toaddress security issues related to those substances. Continue to develop the chemical ISAC and recruit sector constituents to participate The purpose of the chemical sector's ISAC, which is in the early stages of development, is to facilitateadvanced warnings on security threats and thesharing of other security-related data. DHS andEPA, in concert with chemical industry officials, will promote the ISAC concept within the sector in order to draw increased participation from theindustry at large. ________ 1 Specific chemical and hazardous materials facilities may fall within the definitional context of \"key assets,\" however, theirspecific protection issues relate directly to the entire sectorand are therefore discussed in this chapter. 2 For example, the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care\u00ae Security Code of Management Practices. 66 Americans depend heavily on the postal and shipping sector. Each day, we place more than two-thirds of abillion pieces of mail into the U.S. postal system; andeach day more than 300,000 city and rural postalcarriers deliver that mail to more than 137 million delivery addresses nationwide. In all, the vast networkoperated by the United States Postal Service (USPS)consists of a headquarters in Washington, D.C., tens ofthousands of postal facilities nationwide, and hundredsof thousands of official drop-box locations. USPSemploys more than 749,000 full-time personnel inrural and urban locations across the country and generates more than $60 billion in revenues each year.Together, USPS and private-industry mailing and shipping revenues exceed $200 billion annually. The postal system is highly dependent on and interconnected with other key infrastructure systems,especially the transportation system. USPS depends ona transportation fleet composed of both service-ownedand contactor-operated vehicles and equipment. Mailalso travels daily by commercial aircraft, truck, railroad,and ship. Because of these dependencies, many key postal facilities are collocated with other transportationmodalities at various points across the United States. The expansiveness of the national postal facilities network presents a significant, direct protection chal-lenge. Additionally, the size and pervasiveness of thesystem as a whole have important implications in termsof the potential secondary effects of a malicious attack.The Fall 2001 anthrax attacks underscore this concern.In addition to localized mail stoppages across the U.S.,the tainted mail caused widespread anxiety that translated into significant economic impact. Historically, the American public has placed great trust, confidence, and reliance on the integrity of the postalsector. This trust and confidence are at risk when thepublic considers the mail service to be a potential threatto its health and safety. Consequently, USPS continuesto focus on the specific protection issues facing itssector and is working diligently to find appropriatesolutions to increase postal security without hamperingits ability to provide fast, reliable mail service. 67 Postal and Shipping Sector Challenges The protection challenges and initiatives discussed in this section relate specifically to the efforts undertakenby USPS. Commercial postal and shipping companiesare in the process of organizing themselves as a sectorto identify and address specific protection issues withintheir industry. While the USPS has worked with manyof these companies to address critical infrastructureprotection issues, there is further work to be done inthis area. Assisted by USPS, DHS will engage theindustry's major players in an effective dialogue toaddress critical infrastructure protection issues thatcross the entire sector. USPS has identified five areas of concern for the postal system: Points of entry and locations of key facilities; The mail's chain of custody; Unique constitutional and legal issues; Interagency coordination; and The ability to respond in emergency situations. The fact that there are numerous points of entry into the postal system complicates its protection.Compounding this problem is the fact that these accesspoints are geographically dispersed, including the multitude of postal drop boxes nationwide. Effective, affordable technology to scan mail and provide earlywarning of potential hazards is under current evaluation. The location of many key postal service facilities can also aggravate risk-management challenges. Severalmajor USPS facilities are collocated with or adjacent toother government agencies or major transportationhubs. Relocating these facilities to mitigate risk is oftenconstrained by limited resources, a lack of available,alternative sites, and other pressing local imperatives. Another factor affecting postal security is the fact that USPS does not always maintain control of the mailduring its entire chain of custody. Oftentimes, inde-pendent contractors transport mail for USPS. BecauseUSPS utilizes hundreds of long-haul mail carriers, mailmoves into and out of USPS control along its route.To address this issue, USPS transportation purchasing requirements call for all transportation vendors, their employees, and subcontractors to submit to criminaland drug background checks. These checks includefingerprinting and follow-up if necessary by the PostalInspection Service. USPS security efforts face constitutional and legal challenges that are unique to the postal and shippingsector. Specifically, the Fourth-Amendment prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure and the sanctity ofthe postal seal make it necessary to justify the scanningor x-ray of a parcel for hazardous materials. Regardless,some technology vendors resist developing ormarketing advanced sensing equipment out of concernthat they would be held liable if their device failed todetect an actual threat. The Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies (SAFETY) Act ,enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ,reduces these risks by providing strong product liability protection for manufacturers of anti-terrorism devices. Ensuring that USPS is able to respond effectively in emergency situations is another challenge for thesector. While USPS has worked extensively withvendors and the White House Office of Science andTechnology Policy to develop solutions, currently there is no recognized set of standards to guide USPS andthe private shipping industry in evaluating products for detecting, decontaminating, and remediating theeffects of certain hazards. Furthermore, there are inadequate stockpiles of equipment and materials toenable sustained response activities. For instance,the supply of chemicals used to decontaminate facilitiesaffected by the Fall 2001 anthrax incidents dependedon a few companies, each of which produces only oneof the compound's constituent parts. In responding to the anthrax incidents, USPS worked with various federal agencies and state and localgovernments and continues to coordinate and planwith these groups. Further coordination and planningwill be necessary to ensure that protection measuresdeveloped are effective across the entire sector. Thefederal authority to implement certain protective andresponse measures related to the actual or potential transmission of certain biological agents across statelines is not widely understood. Resolving these ambi-guities in advance of a crisis situation would contributegreatly to the coordination of protection and emergency response efforts. Postal and Shipping Sector Initiatives DHS will work with private shipping and mail firms to enable them to incorporate their protection issuesinto a more comprehensive approach to critical infrastructure protection for this sector. Additionally, the USPS has outlined six core initiatives in its emergency preparedness plans: prevention;protection and health-risk reduction; detection action areas that supportthese initiatives include efforts to: 68 Improve protection and response capabilities DHS and USPS will conduct planning to increase reserve stockpiles of equipment and materials needed for emergency-incident response, particu-larly for CBR contaminants. They will also reviewrequirements for manufacturing surge capacity for certain materials. DHS and USPS will also work with other federal agencies and state and local authorities to facilitatecoordinated planning efforts to develop and imple-ment risk avoidance and reduction measures, as wellas to establish common protocols for incidentresponse and remediation. Assure security of international mail DHS and USPS will work with other appropriate agencies to clarify and formalize responsibilities forassuring the security of mail transiting U.S. borders,both inbound and outbound (e.g., between theUSPS and U.S. Customs Service). Promote and support ISAC participation DHS will promote the postal and shipping sector's participation within an appropriate informationsharing structure. This structure must include keygovernment- and private-sector stakeholdersinvolved with the delivery of air and ground mail,private parcels, and heavy cargo.Conduct enhanced risk analyses of key facilities DHS, USPS, and U.S. Postal Inspection Service will conduct assessments of postal facilities that arecollocated with other high-risk facilities requiringmore thorough risk analyses. These more rigorousassessments, which must take into account terroristcapabilities and motivations and facility vulnerabili- ties, will provide both indications and justificationfor the relocation of high-risk USPS facilities. Improve customer identification and correlation with their mail USPS will implement customer identification and correlation mechanisms at designated mail intakepoints and improve passive, nonintrusive parcelinspections for the detection of hazardous material. Identify conflicts with respect to coordinated multi-jurisdictional responses DHS, USPS, and DOJ will work together with state and local governments to identify and addressconflicts in federal, state, and local laws and regula-tions that impair the abilities of multi-jurisdictionalentities, like the USPS, to respond effectively inemergency situations. 6970 Key assets represent a broad array of unique facilities, sites,and structures whose disrup-tion or destruction could havesignificant consequencesacross multiple dimensions.One category of key assetscomprises the diverse array ofnational monuments, symbols,and icons that represent ourNation's heritage, traditions and values, and politicalpower. They include a widevariety of sites and structures,such as prominent historicalattractions, monuments,cultural icons, and centers ofgovernment and commerce.The sites and structures thatmake up this key asset cate-gory typically draw largeamounts of tourism andfrequent media attention-factors that impose additionalprotection challenges. Another category of key assets includes facilities and struc-tures that represent ournational economic power andtechnological advancement.Many of them house signifi-cant amounts of hazardous materials, fuels, and chemicalcatalysts that enable important production and processingfunctions. Disruption of thesefacilities could have significantimpact on public health andsafety, public confidence, andthe economy. A third category of key assets includes such structures as prominent commercial centers, office buildings, andsports stadiums, where large numbers of people regularly congregate to conduct business or personal transactions, shop, or enjoy a recreational pastime.Given the national-level fame of these sites and facilities and the potential human consequences thatcould result from their attack, protecting them isimportant in terms of both preventing fatalities andpreserving public confidence. 71 National Monument and Icon Challenges Our national monuments and icons present specific challenges because their protection typically combinesthe authorities, responsibilities, and resources of federal,state, and local jurisdictions, and, in some cases, privatefoundations. A clear division of labor, resources, andaccountability is often difficult to distinguish. The need to protect our national icons and monuments from terrorist attack requires the development andcoordination of comprehensive policies, practices, andprotective measures. We are also faced with the task ofbalancing open visitor access to these structures withthe protection of visitors and the structures themselves.Most often their protection entails restricting publicaccess to certain areas and curtailing, or evenprohibiting, the assembly of large numbers of visitors. The Department of the Interior (DOI) is the lead federal department with primary jurisdiction overnational icons and monuments. It has diverse responsibilities, including the protection of a number of potential targets. Such protection is particularly important in the case of icons and symbols that figureprominently in national celebrations and events.Accordingly, DOI must coordinate with law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions and entitiesdirectly responsible for intelligence gathering andhomeland security. DOI and its state, local, and private sector counterparts also face unique challenges with respect to recruiting,training, and retaining a robust security force.Given the need for the physical protection of such a wide array of potential targets (e.g., national parks,monuments, and historic buildings), maintaining a highly trained security force is a priority. National Monument and Icon Initiatives To address the challenges associated with the protection of our national monuments and icons,we will take action in the following areas: Define criticality criteria for national monuments, icons, and symbols DOI will work in concert with DHS to develop specific guidance to define criteria and standards fordetermining the criticalities and protection prioritiesfor our national monuments, icons, and symbols. 72 Conduct threat and vulnerability assessments DOI will work in concert with DHS and other appropriate authorities to conduct threat andvulnerability assessments to identify gaps in visitorprotection processes as well as asset protection. Retain a quality security force DOI will explore alternatives to foster efforts to recruit, train, and retain a skilled and motivated security force. Conduct security-focused public outreach and awareness programs DOI will enlist public support in the protection of our national icons and symbols through sustainedpublic outreach and awareness programs. Collaborate with state and local governments and private foundations to assure the protection of symbols and iconsoutside the federal domain DOI will work with state and local governments and private institutions to explore alternatives toprotect symbols and icons such as historical buildings and landmarks that are outside thepurview of the federal government. Evaluate innovative technologies DOI, in concert with DHS and other key stakeholders, will explore ways to employ securitytechnologies to ensure the protection of visitors to monuments and other like attractions. Make provisions for extra security during high-profile events DOI will work with law enforcement agencies to manage visitor periods at national monuments andprovide extra security during high-profile eventstaking place in or around national icons. 73 Nuclear power represents about 20 percent of our Nation's electrical generation capacity. The U.S. has 104 commercial nuclear reactors in 31 states. For 25 years,federal regulations have required that these facilitiesmaintain rigorous security programs to withstand anattack of specified adversary strength and capability.Nuclear power plants are also among the most physi- cally hardened structures in the country, designed to withstand extreme events such as hurricanes, tornadoes,and earthquakes. Their reinforced engineering designprovides inherent protection through such features asrobust containment buildings, redundant safety systems, and sheltered spent fuel storage facilities. The security at nuclear power plants has been enhanced significantly in the aftermath of the September 11attacks. All plants remain at heightened states of readiness, and specific measures have been implemented to enhance physical security and to prevent and miti-gate the effects of a deliberate release of radioactivematerials. Steps have been taken to enhance surveillance, provide for more restricted site access,and improve coordination with law enforcement andmilitary authorities. In addition to these augmentedsecurity measures, all nuclear power plants have robustsecurity and emergency response plans in place tofurther assure public health and safety in the unlikelyevent of a malicious act and/or radioactive release. Nuclear Power Plant Challenges Losing the capabilities of a single nuclear power plant may have only a minor impact on overall electricitydelivery within the context of our robust nationalpower grid. Nevertheless, a terrorist attack on anynuclear facility would be considered a significant security event. In an unlikely worst-case scenario,a successful terrorist strike against a nuclear facilitycould result in a release of radioactive material. Even if radioactive material were not released, widely heldmisconceptions of the potential consequences of an 74 attack on a nuclear facility could have significant negative impact. NRC is currently performing a detailed design basis threat and vulnerability analysis for nuclear powerplants to help identify additional security enhance-ments that may be warranted. Additional prudentmeasures should be examined to help strengthen thedefensive posture of these facilities. Nuclear Power Plant Initiatives To overcome protection challenges, we will: Coordinate efforts to perform standardized vulnerability and risk assessments NRC and DHS will work with owners and operators of nuclear power plants to develop a standard methodology for conducting vulnerabilityand risk assessments. Establish common processes and identify resources needed to augment security at nuclear power plants The NRC and DHS will work in concert with plant owners and operators and appropriate local, state, and federal authorities to develop a standard processfor requesting external security augmentation atnuclear power plants during heightened periods ofalert and in the event of an imminent threat. Criminalize the carrying of unauthorized weapons or explosives into nuclear facilities NRC, in coordination with DHS, will pursue legislation to make the act of carrying an unautho-rized weapon or explosive into a nuclear power plant a federal crime. Enhance the capabilities of nuclear power plant security forces NRC, in coordination with DHS, will pursue legislation authorizing security guards at licensedfacilities to carry and use more powerful weapons. Itwill also assist the industry to develop standards andimplement additional training in counter-terrorist techniques for private security forces. Seek legislation to apply sabotage laws to nuclear facilities NRC, in coordination with DHS, will pursue legislation to make federal prohibitions on sabotageapplicable to nuclear facilities and their operations. Enhance public outreach and awareness NRC and DHS will work with plant owners and operators and appropriate local and state authoritiesto enhance public outreach and awareness programsand emergency preparedness programs. 75 Some of our larger and more symbolic dams are major components of other critical infrastructure systems that provide water and electricity to large populations,cities, and agricultural complexes. There are approxi-mately 80,000 dam facilities identified in the NationalInventory of Dams. Most are small, and their failurewould not result in significant property damage or lossof life. The federal government is responsible forroughly 10 percent of the dams whose failure could cause significant property damage or have public health and safety consequences. The remaining criticaldams belong to state or local governments, utilities,and corporate or private owners. Dam Challenges Under current policies and laws, dam owners arelargely responsible for the safety and security of theirown structures. Hence, the resources available to protect dam property vary greatly from one category tothe next. Additionally, the distributed nature of damownership also complicates assessment of the potential consequences of dam failure for certain categories ofdams. Given these realities, the need to develop morecomprehensive mechanisms for assessing andmanaging risks to dams is clear.Dam Initiatives To overcome protective challenges for dam structures, we will take action to: Develop risk assessment methodologies for dams DHS, in cooperation appropriate federal, state, and local government representatives and private-sectordam owners will design risk assessment methodolo-gies for dams and develop criteria to prioritize thedams in the National Inventory to identify structures requiring enhanced security evaluationsand protection focus. Develop protective action plans DHS, together with other appropriate departments and agencies, will establish an intergovernmentalworking group to explore appropriate protectiveactions for the Nation's critical dams. Establish a sector-ISAC DHS will work with other appropriate public and private sector entities to establish an informationand warning structure for dams similar to the ISACmodel in use within other critical infrastructuresectors. Institute a national dam security program DHS and other appropriate departments and agencies, such as the Association of State DamSafety Officials and United States Society of Dams, will collaborate to establish a nationwide securityprogram for dams. Develop emergency action plans DHS, together with other appropriate departments and agencies, will identify the areas downstreamfrom critical dams that could be affected by damfailure and develop appropriate population and infra-structure protection and emergency action plans. Develop technology to provide protective solutions DHS, together with other appropriate departments and agencies, will explore new protective technologysolutions for dams. Technology solutions holdsignificant promise for the identification and miti-gation of waterborne threats. For example, technicaloptions might include deploying sensors, barriersand communications systems to reduce the possi-bility of an unauthorized craft or device entering acritical zone located near a navigational dam. 76 Before the September 11 attacks, the principal threat to government buildings was the use of explosives.After the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P . MurrahBuilding in Oklahoma City, the operators of manylarge government centers across the country imple-mented enhanced measures, such as concrete barriers,intensified surveillance, and parking restrictions, tosafeguard key physical assets. While explosives remainan important concern, the innovative, highly coordi-nated Al-Qaeda attacks have added new dimensions tothe threats now facing U.S. government facilities. The General Services Administration (GSA) is a principal agency responsible for the management offederal government facilities. Additional departmentsand agencies are similarly involved in the managementof federally owned or operated facilities, including DoDand the Department of Veterans Affairs. Within theoverall federal inventor y are buildings that the federal government owns and others that it leases from theprivate sector. GSA works with other federal agencies toconduct facility security assessments to ensure that eachfacility owned or leased by GSA identifies vulnerabilitiesto specific types of threats. The Federal ProtectiveService, which will transition into DHS, works with government tenants and private-sector owners to identify credible threats and implement appropriatecountermeasures to provide cost-effective security. Government Facilities Challenges Most government organizations occupy buildings thatare also used by a variety of nongovernmental tenants,such as shops and restaurants where the public is able tomove about freely. In f ederally owned buildings, federal laws and regulations apply. In private facilities withfederal tenants, federal laws and regulations only apply in areas that are federally occupied. For instance, federallaws and regulations prohibit the entry into federal buildings of prohibited weapons. In buildings where the federal government leases space, the weapons ban isapplicable only to those spaces occupied by the federaltenants. Private owners of these properties may not wantor have the ability to modify their procedures to accom-modate the increased or special security countermeasuresrequired by their federal tenants, such as installing surveillance cameras in lobbies, redesigning entry pointsto restrict the flow of traffic, or setting up x-ray machinesand metal detectors at entrances. The need to considerthe delicate balance between security and the public'sright to privacy presents additional challenges.Government F acilities Initiatives To overcome protection challenges associated with government facilities, we will: Develop a process to screen nonfederal tenants and visitors entering private-sector facilities that house federal organizations DHS, together with GSA and other federal departments and agencies, will work with real-estateassociations in the private sector to implement anoninvasive screening process at facilities that houseprivate businesses as well as federal organizations. Determine the criticality and vulnerability of government facilities DHS, together with GSA and other federal departments and agencies, will work with owners of federally occupied facilities to establish a standardmethodology to determine a government facility'scriticality and vulnerability to facilitate security-related planning. Develop long-term construction standards for facilities requiring specialized security measures NIST, together with DHS and other federal government departments and agencies, will continuecurrent efforts to develop long-term constructiondesign standards for facilities requiring blast resistance or other specialized security measures. Implement new technological security measures at federally occupied facilities DHS, together with GSA and other federal departments and agencies, will work with owners offederally occupied facilities to explore measures toenhance security measures in the common areas offederally occupied facilities (e.g., sensor sy stems in lieu of manual-access control). 77 Protecting prominent commercial centers, office buildings, sports stadiums, theme parks, and other siteswhere large numbers of people congregate to pursuebusiness activities, conduct personal commercial transactions, or enjoy recreational pastimes presentssignificant challenges. Day-to-day protection of suchfacilities is the responsibility of their commercialowners and operators, in close cooperation with local law enforcement. The federal government's responsibility for the protection of these assets is more or less indirect. Itsactivities include providing timely threat indicationsand warnings and working with commercial enterprisesto harmonize individual facility security processes withthe various Homeland Security Advisory System levelsof alert. Additionally, providing support and input toorganizations that develop standards and guidance forbuilding construction and facility heating, ventilating,and air conditioning (HVAC) systems constitutes animportant federal government activity. The federal government typically coordinates or provides physical security at commercial facilities onlyin conjunction with dignitary visits or designatedNational Security Special Events. Given the national-level visibility and potential human andeconomic consequences of prominent commercial sitesand facilities, it is important for the government andcommercial sectors to work together to assure theprotection of our nation's prominent business centersand gathering places. Commercial Key Asset Challenges The likelihood of terrorists targeting and attacking anyspecific, prominent commercial facility or activity isdifficult to determine. Potential terrorist attackmethods range from conventional explosives to CBRweapons of mass destruction. Each facility's vulnera-bility to the various means by which terrorists couldstrike is unique as determined by its engineeringdesign, size, age, purpose, and number of inhabitants.Standards for building design, construction, and secu- rity also vary widely across enterprises, industrial sectors, and governmental jurisdictions. For the mostpart, commercial owners and operators must beresponsible for assessing and mitigating their specific facility vulnerabilities and practicing prudent riskmanagement and mitigating measures. 78 Commercial Key Asset Initiatives There are no specific actions that will eliminate all of the potential risks associated with the threat of a deter-mined terrorist attack on a prominent commercialfacility or activity. However, there are certain steps thatcan be taken to reduce a facility's attractiveness as a target by complicating attack planning and execution,and helping to mitigate the effects of an explosiveattack or CBR release. For example, reducing a commercial facility's vulnerability to a high explosive or CBR attackrequires a comprehensive approach. The first step is to integrate considerations for potential threats into theengineering design of the facility and its supportingsystems (e.g., HVAC systems). The second step is a thorough assessment of physical-security design features, systems, processes,and procedures that serve to deny or limit terroristaccess to a facility and its key nodes. Preventingterrorist access to a targeted facility requires adequatephysical security for all entrances, storage areas, main-tenance areas, and rooftops, as well as securing accessto the outdoor air intakes of facility HVAC systems. The third step is an interior assessment of HVAC systems and their components. Specifically, thismeasure focuses on their vulnerability as conduits forthe introduction and dispersal of CBR agents. Keyareas considered during this assessment include HVACsystem controls, airflow patterns, overpressure, purgecapability, filtering efficiency, and leakage potential. If designed, installed, and maintained properly, air filtra-tion and cleaning systems can mitigate the effects ofCBR agents by removing contaminants from a facility'sairborne environment. A final step involves developing and rehearsing facility contingency plans based on scenarios involving themost likely and worst-case physical security breaches,aircraft impact, conventional explosive detonation, andCBR release scenarios. This final and importantmeasure must include establishing processes andsystems for coordinating and cooperating with locallaw enforcement and emergency response personnel. To facilitate the protection of prominent commercial sites and facilities against terrorist attack, we will takeaction to: Share federal building security standards and practices with the private sector DHS, together with GSA, NIST and other federal departments and agencies will develop a program to share federal building protection standards,vulnerability and risk assessment methodologies, best practices, and technology solutions (e.g.physical barriers, closed-circuit television, intrusiondetection devices, CBR detection sensors, andexplosive detection systems) with commercialfacility owners and operators. Facilitate efficient dissemination of threat information DHS, in concert with the intelligence and law enforcement communities, will explore processesand systems to enable the timely dissemination ofthreat indications and warning information tocommercial facility owners and operators. Implement the Homeland Security Advisory System DHS will collaborate with commercial facility owners and operators to align the Homeland Security Advisory System with specific measures and procedures pertinent to commercial facility security. Explore options for incentives for the implementation of enhanced design features or security measures DHS will explore options to facilitate incentives for commercial owners and operators who incorporatespecific security and safety features into their facilitydesign, or who adopt specific processes, procedures,and technologies that serve to deter, prevent, ormitigate the consequences of terrorist attacks. Improve building codes for privately owned facilities NIST will develop a comprehensive set of building codes for privately owned facilities designed tobetter assure structural integrity, minimize probability of collapse, and increase resistance tohigh-temperature fires. 79 80 Protecting our county's critical infrastructures and key assets is a core homeland security mission. ThisStrategy reaffirms our commitment as a Nation to protect our critical infrastructures and key assetsagainst further terrorist attacks. As we begin to address the myriad of physical protection challenges, we must keep in mind thecomplex nature of the infrastructures and assets we aimto protect. As a potential target set, our country's crit-ical infrastructures and key assets are a highly diverse,interdependent mix of facilities, systems, and functions.Government owns and operates some of them. Most,however, are controlled by the private sector. All arevulnerable in some way to the terrorist threat. They also represent a true \"system of systems.\" Failure in one asset or infrastructure can cascade to disruptionor failure in others, and the combined effect couldprompt far-reaching consequences affecting govern-ment, the economy, public health and safety, nationalsecurity, and public confidence. As a whole, our protection mindset must include a thorough appreciation of these complexities as we carry out this national strategy for action. In this document we have highlighted the diverse physical protection challenges that we face as a Nation.We have laid out a comprehensive agenda that will allow us to address the most pressing impediments to our physical protection based upon the prudentmanagement of threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.This is only the beginning, however, of a long andchallenging journey. As we begin, we must also keep in mind the nature of the adversary we now face. The September 11 attacks onthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon highlight ournational-level physical vulnerability to the threat posedby a highly adaptive, patient, cunning, and flexibleenemy. The attacks also demonstrate the extent of our 81 enemy's determination and sophistication, and the lengths to which terrorists will go to further their causes. We no longer assume that terrorists are incapable of undertaking a devastating physical attack on ourhomeland and infrastructure base. In fact, given thecreative and adaptive nature of our terrorist adversaries,we can expect future strikes to be even more sophisti-cated in terms of capability and synchronization. Ironically, the very nature of our free society greatly enables terrorist operations and tactics, while, at thesame time, hinders our ability to predict or preventterrorist acts or mitigate their effects. Given these real-ities, the imperative to implement the comprehensivenational physical protection strategy outlined in thisdocument is most pressing. The issues and enabling initiatives outlined in the Cross-Sector Security Priorities chapter of this document represent important near-term national priorities. They focus on impediments to physical protection thatsignificantly impact multiple key sectors of our govern-ment, society, and economy. Potential solutions to thechallenges identified\u2014such as information sharing and threat indications and warning\u2014are high-leverageareas that, when realized, will enhance the Nation'soverall ability to protect critical infrastructures and key assets across the board. These action areas, which include the prompt identification and protection of nationally criticalinfrastructures and development of processes andsystems to properly warn and protect specificallythreatened assets will be the focus of the federalgovernment's near-term critical infrastructure and keyasset protection effort. Accordingly, DHS and desig-nated federal lead departments and agencies willprepare detailed implementation plans to support thecross-sector and sector-specific priorities outlined inthis document. As we work to refine and implement our priority protection initiatives, we must bear in mind theguiding principles set forth in this document. First andforemost, our efforts must assure public health andsafety, critical services, and public confidence in ourgovernment and economy. To accomplish this, we mustestablish clear roles and responsibilities, accountability,and coordinating structures and processes that willgovern the interaction of all stakeholders.We must also build and foster a partnership among all levels of government, as well as between governmentand the private sector. This public-private partnershipshould be based on a commitment to a two-waycommunications flow and the timely exchange ofinformation relevant to critical infrastructure and keyasset protection. This partnership should also extend tothe research, development, and fielding of advancedtechnology solutions to common protection problems.Collaborative efforts should also include the develop-ment and sharing of modeling and simulationcapabilities to enable public-private sector decision support and interdependency analysis. Terrorists do not respect international boundaries and are, therefore, not restricted by them. Hence, we mustextend our infrastructure and key asset protection partnership to include our Mexican and Canadianneighbors, as well as other friendly nations around theglobe. Finally, as we take action to overcome the majorimpediments to our physical protection, we must takecare to safeguard the fundamental constitutional freedoms that have long been the hallmark of this great Nation. Federal departments and agencies, state and local government, and private sector owners and operatorshave made great strides to enhance the security of thecritical infrastructures and key assets they respectivelycontrol. An intense cooperative spirit and tremendoussense of urgency have characterized our nationaldomestic protection environment in the aftermath ofthe terrorist strikes of September 11. We have come along way, but much work remains. We must acttogether now\u2014through aggressive leadership at alllevels inside and outside government\u2014to build on this shared cooperative spirit and carry out the implementing activities endorsed in this document. Our desired end state is the protection of our most nationally critical infrastructures and assets; timelywarning and protection of those infrastructures andassets that face a specific, imminent threat; and acollaborative environment in which all stakeholders caneffectively and efficiently carry out their respectiveprotection responsibilities. Make no mistake\u2014the roadahead will be fraught with challenges. Unified in ourapproach, however, we will overcome these challengesand secure our critical infrastructures and key assetsfrom terrorist exploitation. 82 CBR: Chemical, Biological, or Radiological DHS: Department of Homeland Security DoD: Department of Defense DoE: Department of Energy DoI: Department of the Interior DoJ: Department of Justice DoS: Department of State DoT: Department of Transportation EMS: Emergency Medical Service EPA: Environmental Protection Agency FBIIC: Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee FCC: Federal Communications Commission FERC: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FS-ISAC: Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center GSA: General Services Administration HHS: Department of Health and Human ServicesHV AC: Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning ISAC: Information Sharing and Analysis Center ISP: Internet Service Provider NERC: North American Electric Reliability Council NGN: Next Generation Network NIST: National Institute of Science and Technology NOC: Network Operation Center NRC: Nuclear Regulatory Commission OHS: Office of Homeland Security PCIPB: President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board PSTN: Public Switched Telecommunications Networks R&D: Research and Development USDA: United States Department of Agriculture USPS: United States Postal Service 83 The Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets february 2003 "}
