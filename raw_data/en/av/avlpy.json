How We Ranked The Best THC Detox Products All THC detox supplements claim to cleanse THC from your body. However, not all THC detox supplements work as advertised. To separate the best and worst THC detox supplements, we used the following metrics: Test Passing Score We tested each THC detox product whenever possible then used drug tests to analyze their effectiveness. We gave each THC detox product a test passing rating. The more tests a product passed, the higher we ranked it. Science-Backed Ingredients There's little evidence that herbal remedies can significantly reduce THC levels in your body. However, we preferred THC detox products that used science-backed ingredients like vitamin B2, vitamin B3, zinc, and antioxidant-rich fruit juices. Honest Advertised Benefits Some THC detox products exaggerate their benefits and engage in deceptive marketing. They claim you can pass a drug test with a 100% success rate, even if you smoked weed this morning. There's little evidence any THC detox product works at all - and there's even less evidence they work on a short-term basis. We preferred THC detox companies that were open and honest with their advertised benefits. Manufacturer Reputation & Transparency The THC detox kit industry is, by nature, a little shady. That's why we preferred upfront, honest, and reputable manufacturers. We chose THC detox product manufacturers with a proven reputation for creating quality products that genuinely helped customers pass tests. Customer Reviews, Testimonials, and Success Stories Although we tested each THC detox product whenever possible, we relied on customer reviews to compile accurate rankings. When a THC detox product has thousands of people claiming it helped them pass a drug test, it means something. Fast, Easy, and Affordable Shipping Options If you're shopping for a THC detox product, you typically need to buy that product as soon as possible. We preferred THC detox products with fast, easy, and affordable shipping options. Most of the top-ranked THC detox companies on our list included free shipping with all products, with some offering free overnight shipping and other perks. Ease of Use The best way to pass a drug test is to exercise for six straight days before your drug test while drinking 4 gallons of water per day. However, this isn't realistic for most people. We considered the ease of use of each THC detox method, and we preferred products that were effective and easy to use. Moneyback or Pass Test Guarantee Some of the best THC detox supplements have a moneyback guarantee. If you fail your drug test after using the formula, or if you're unsatisfied with the supplement for any reason, then you can request a complete refund. How Long Does Cannabis Stay in Your System? If you have recently consumed cannabis, then traces of cannabis could remain in your system for 36 hours to 90 days. - Hair: 90 days - Urine: 3 days to 30 days or more, depending on usage - Saliva: 48 hours - Blood: 36 hours - Sweat: 7 to 14 days Typically, a drug test (for work purposes) tests your blood or saliva for THC. If you have consumed THC within the last 36 to 48 hours, this THC could appear on a drug test. How you use cannabis impacts the length of time it remains in your system. Someone who uses large amounts of cannabis for an extended period, for example, may have cannabis stay in their system for longer. What Remains in the System After Using Cannabis? After you consume marijuana, cannabinoids enter your body. They circulate through your body via your bloodstream. Researchers have identified dozens of cannabinoids in the cannabis plant. You ingest all of these cannabinoids when you consume cannabis. THC is one well-known cannabinoid with psychoactive properties (i.e., it gets you high). CBD is another well-known cannabinoid. While THC gives you a short-term high, THC and other cannabinoids remain in your system long after you ingested the cannabinoids. That's because THC and other cannabinoids are fat-soluble. Your body absorbs these cannabinoids in its fatty tissue. THC can remain in your fat deposits for several weeks after ingestion. Side Effects of Cannabis Detox and Withdrawal Yes, you can experience withdrawal symptoms from using cannabis. The most common side effects are insomnia and headaches. Many people also experience stress and anxiety. Some experience feelings of rage. Common side effects of cannabis and THC detox include: - Depression and anxiety - Vivid dreams or nightmares - Anger and irritability - Stress - Loss of focus or concentration - Emotional instability and mood swings, including everything from anger to euphoria - Loss of appetite - Tremors or shakiness These symptoms may last anywhere from a few days to a month, depending on your cannabis usage. Some who use heavy amounts of cannabis for a more extended period will experience more prolonged and more severe THC withdrawal effects than a light user. Natural Remedies for THC Withdrawal Some of the best tips for handling THC withdrawal include: - Drink plenty of water - Reduce the amount of fat you eat - Reduce or eliminate caffeine - Exercise - Take a warm bath How Do Drug Tests Work? Understanding how THC detox products work helps to understand how drug tests work. Drug tests look for traces of cannabinoids in the person's system. A urine drug test, for example, looks for traces of cannabinoids in your urine. Urine tests are the most popular blood tests because they're cheap, easy, and effective. Urine tests can also identify the presence of cannabinoids up to three months after ingestion. Hair tests, blood tests, and saliva drug tests are also standard. Drug tests are more innovative than many people realize. Drug tests look for traces of something called THC-COOH. It's a metabolite, which means your body creates THC-COOH as it processes THC. If your body has stored THC in its fat cells, then a drug test could detect THC-COOH weeks after ingestion. How Do THC Detox Products Work? You can find plenty of THC detox products that claim to eliminate all traces of cannabis from your system, helping you pass a drug test. But do these detox products truly work? Can you genuinely eradicate all traces of THC from your body with a capsule, powder, or shampoo? Detoxes may or may not be effective. It depends on your unique physiology and your THC consumption. Some THC detox products work by flushing your kidneys releasing creatine and other natural contaminants in your urine. This flushing can cause your urine to appear contaminated during a urine drug test. That generally means you need to retake the test at a future date - but it could also give you more time to flush THC from your system. THC detox kits use natural ingredients to cleanse THC from your body. Typically, you take capsules, oils, or powders to cleanse your body. THC detox kits could contain: - Dandelion Leaf: A popular traditional cleansing compound, dandelion root may encourage your body to release more contaminants via urine. - Rhubarb Root: Rhubarb root is a popular way to release cannabis compounds from your body while supporting inflammation in the bladder. - Burdock Root: Burdock root has a long history of use in traditional medicine as a way to cleanse the blood and detoxify your system. - Goldenseal Root: Goldenseal root is one of the most popular natural ingredients for cleansing the body of cannabis, although it's not as familiar as other ingredients listed here. These ingredients are proven to release more urine from your body, which may seem like it would cleanse cannabis compounds. However, Some people use THC detox drinks. You might buy a beverage then drink it to release THC from your system. Or, you might buy a powder, then mix the powder with water to remove THC. THC detox drinks tend to use similar ingredients to THC detox kits, supplements, and capsules. You can also find THC detox shampoos. It's rare for an employer to request a drug test using your hair. However, because cannabis remains in your hair for up to 90 days after use, it's an effective way to make sure someone is clean. A good THC detox shampoo could genuinely help you pass a drug test: these shampoos penetrate deep into your hair follicles to remove toxins - including THC. Some of the best-rated THC detox shampoos remove chemicals, environmental pollutants, and other contaminants from your hair. Roughly 10% of employers use saliva drug tests. Saliva tests are cheap and easy. However, they aren't as effective for detecting THC. Saliva tests work by detecting THC in the tissues around your mouth. If you consume marijuana in the last 24 to 72 hours, traces can remain in your mouth. Otherwise, a saliva test isn't practical. A THC detox mouthwash (or any mouthwash) could genuinely work if concerned about a saliva test. Mouthwashes help detoxify the mouth. However, you should use the detox mouthwash within 30 minutes of the saliva test. Otherwise, it may not be as effective. Are you looking for last-minute THC detox solutions? Science doesn't support these products. There's little evidence that taking a THC detox product the day of a test will have any significant effect on THC levels in your body. Overall, the best way to pass a drug test is by completing a seven-day cleanse. When following a cleanse and taking a THC detox formula, you give your body the best chance of releasing THC entirely from your system, allowing you to pass a drug test. Scientific Evidence for THC Detox Products Researchers have conducted formal studies on THC detox methods and products. We'll review some of that evidence below. Abstaining from THC, understandably, is the best way to pass a drug test. However, it's not a guaranteed solution. According to [this 2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4627404/), second-hand marijuana smoke could cause you to test positive for THC. Researchers placed participants in a non-ventilated room with marijuana smokers for 60 minutes in the study. Multiple non-smokers tested positive for THC even without smoking. It's also possible to test positive for opioids by consuming a poppy seed bagel. Exercise is another proven way to release THC from your system. That's because exercise burns fat, and fat cells contain THC. When you exercise and burn fat, it releases THC and forces your body to expel it from your system. However, you should not exercise within 24 hours of the test, as it could cause THC to be released from your fat cells without being expelled from your body, increasing the chances of a positive test. In [this 2013 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24018317/), for example, researchers found exercise could increase blood plasma THC concentrations by 15%. Drinking water can help you pass a drug test. Some cynics argue that THC detox products only work because they recommend consuming large amounts of water. Drinking a large amount of water (say, a gallon per day or more) could slightly increase your chances of passing a drug test. However, one of the best ways to pass a drug test with water is by using a combination of water, vitamin B2, and electrolyte powder. Drink a large amount of this concoction, then test your urine using a home drug test. You should notice the drug test gradually reports a lower concentration of THC in your system the more you drink. Can you use fake pee to pass a drug test? Researchers have answered that question. In [this 2019 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30194711/), researchers tested the effects of synthetic urine on drug test strips. Researchers gathered a group of military drug testers then gave them fake or genuine urine samples. Testers identified 5 of the eight synthetic urine samples through physical observation. All eight synthetic urine samples, however, screened negative in the test. In other words, synthetic urine could work for your drug test, but a physical check by the testers could foil your plans. Some people recommend niacin flushes as a way to beat urine drug tests. Niacin is a form of vitamin B3. If you look online, you'll find plenty of people who swear niacin is the best way to beat a urine drug test. However, researchers found little medical evidence supporting this claim in this study. Researchers found evidence that following niacin flush protocols seen online could lead to niacin toxicity. Other traditional remedies for passing a drug test include: Coffee Some people use coffee to pass a drug test because it increases the frequency of urination (coffee is a diuretic). Theoretically, that means coffee should increase the elimination of toxins from your body. Coffee is also rich in natural antioxidants that can boost your detox. There's some evidence that a combination of strong coffee and water with electrolytes could help pass a drug test by cleansing your body from multiple angles. Apple Cider Vinegar You can find plenty of anecdotal reports of apple cider vinegar boosting the chances of passing a drug test. Apple cider vinegar has natural antimicrobial properties (like all vinegar). However, it also speeds up metabolism, which can help your body process THC more rapidly. Still, it's not a good idea to start chugging apple cider vinegar to pass a drug test. It doesn't taste good, and it's acidic enough to damage your mouth. Cranberry Juice Cranberry juice is a popular way to support urinary tract health, which is why it's become popular as a way to pass drug tests. Cranberry is a popular detox beverage overall. And, unlike apple cider vinegar, cranberry juice tastes good. By mixing cranberry juice with water, you can help remove toxins from your kidneys, intestines, lymphatic system, and other organs in around seven days. Cranberry juice, like coffee, is also a natural diuretic, which means it increases the frequency of urination. These things can make cranberry juice a popular THC detox beverage for passing a drug test. Lemon Many people mix lemon juice with water then drink it daily to support detoxification and overall health. Although there's no specific evidence lemon can help you pass a drug test, it could help cleanse your body in a small way. Other Remedies The internet is filled with traditional THC detox solutions, including water, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, ground ginger, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, honey, etc. Some people also recommend eating specific foods to cleanse THC, including garlic, broccoli, grapefruit, and mung beans. Although there's little evidence proving these ingredients release THC from your body, they could support your body's natural detoxification processes and overall health.

However, there's little evidence cranberry juice can meaningfully reduce THC levels in your body more than water or fruit juices. Q: Is apple cider vinegar good for THC detox?

A: If you don't have time for a THC detox, then don't panic: pre-test yourself using an at-home drug test to see if you even have cannabis in your system. Then, you can adjust your strategy. If your drug test is within 24 hours, drink lots of water and take a THC detox supplement. Suppose your drug test is more than 24 hours away, exercise while drinking lots of water and taking a THC detox supplement. As a last resort, use fake pee or synthetic urine. Q: Is it legal to fake a drug test? A: Laws about drug tests are confusing. Generally, it's not illegal to cheat the drug test. However, it's unlawful to use or possess a device explicitly designed to cheat a drug test, and it's also illegal to manufacture those devices. Q: Does alcohol help pass a THC drug test?

Research indicates that people who smoke weed while drinking alcohol have higher levels of THC. No evidence drinking alcohol before a drug test can increase your chances of passing a test. Q: Does exercising help me pass a drug test? A: Exercising can help you pass a drug test. When you exercise, you burn fat\u2014your body stores THC in fat cells. By releasing fat cells, you excrete THC from your body. However, you should not exercise within 24 hours of a drug test, as it releases THC without eliminating it from your body.
