Section I: Scope of Work 1.Summary of Proposal Hospital Co-Applicant s: Johns Hopkins H ealth System and University of Maryland Medical Center Hospital Members: Johns Hopkins Ho spital (JHH) , Johns Hopkins B ayview Medical Center (JHBMC) , University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) Downtown, UMMC Midtown, Howard County General Hospital (HCGH) , Suburban Hospital Health System Affiliations: Johns Hopkins Health System and University of Maryland Medical System Funding Track: Diabetes Prevention and Management Total Budget Request: $45,410,914 Target Patient Population The Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS) and the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) are collaborating to create the Baltimore Metro politan Diabetes Regional Partnership (BMD RP) to address diabetes prevention and management within service areas in the State. S eventeen zip codes within Baltimore City are identified as the prediabetes target patient population to focus Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -approved National Diabetes P revention Program (DPP) activities. R esidents in these zip codes have high prevalence of risk factors for incident diabetes and face numerous social determinan t challeng es. In addition to DPP, the BMDRP will implement American Diabetes Association - approved diabetes self -management training (DSMT) activities in a total of 37 zip codes representing partner hospital service areas in Baltimore City, Howard County, and Montgom ery County. DSMT services will address the disproportionate diabetes burden among racial/ethnic minorities in each of these geographic regions, including higher diabetes prevalence, ED visits, and mortality rates due to diabetes. Proposed Activities BMDRP will build infrastructure and aim to increase access to DPP for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in 20% more of the population with prediabetes in the service areas and will aim to expand access to DSMT for management of diabetes in 25% more of the population with diabetes in the service areas. The following overarching activities will be implemented : Establish BMDRP D PP Centralized Management S ervices and DSMT Centralized Management Services in the region to work with community partner organizations that will become accredited sites for delivery of and CMS reimbursement for DPP and DSMT services. Partner with a diverse range of community collaborators to ensure access to DPP right in the comm unities where people live, work, and receive routine care (i.e. faith organizations, s enior centers, community engagement centers, and FQHCs). Expand DSMT sites beyond hospital outpatient clinics to community -based ambulatory care clinics and to communit y pharmacy locations. Seamlessly integrate social needs wrap around services with DPP and DSMT through collaborators addressing social determinant s of health (SDOH) including food insecurity and transportation, and build technology infrastructure for infor mation transfer throughout the state. 1BMDRP pairs evidence -based DPP and DSMT programming with key innovations, including : a CRISP inventory of DPP programs across the City/State which is available to providers for patient referrals , Epic EMR integration and implementation of remote monitoring of diabetes patient data for DSMT , establishing community pharmacies as ADA accredited DSMT programs with reimbursement, integrating an ADA -recognized Diabetes Support program for long -term impact in communities , pro vider Patient Engagement Training, and health equity -focused trainings for workforces to facilitate equity in DPP and DSMT access and outcomes . Measurement & Outcomes The BMDRP will utilize an evaluation strategy including structure, process, and outcome measures that are typically used within health care organizations. Structure measures will be used primarily in the first planning year as the governance structure and committees are formed and workforces are hired. Process measures will target t he throughput of the grant activities , DPP and DSMT program scaling, and will include the numbers and types of referrals to wrap -around services, as well as qualitative feedback from participants. Internal program -specific measures will be utilized to evaluate for program efficiencies and effectiveness in achieving DPP and DSMT performance outcomes . For HSCRC scale target outcomes, BMDRP will use reporting tools that the HSCRC is developing with CRISP to measure progress toward scale targets. Additional tools an d program -specific measures are proposed, as per the RFP, to enable statistical evaluation of effectiveness, equity, and sustainability of the DPP, DSMT, and wrap around services. Scalability & Sustainability Sustainability will be ensured through: Initiating a local health improvement c oalition (LHIC) with the Baltimore City H ealth Department to focus on diabetes and promote diabetes health education and type 2 diabetes prevention. HCGH and Suburban Hospital will collaborate with the existing Howard and Montgomery County LHIC in achieving goals. Utilizing the American Diabetes Association's $25,000 commitment to the BMDRP to create a Shared Learning Bridge with out -of-state DPP initiatives, fostering a national learning collaborative. Improvements in DPP and DSMT billing and reimbursement infrastructure and processes . Rigorous outcomes evaluation and financial sustainability analyses (ROI, PAU, reimbursements). Governance Structure The governance structure of BMDRP consists of a Governance Council at the highest level with input from both a Patient, Family and Community Advisory Committee and a Financial Sustainability Committee. A BMDRP Management Committee will have grant administration and oversight and will be supported by two Executive Directors - one each from JHHS and UMMC. The Executive Council, responsible for the daily activity implementation and oversight, will lead four workgroups that support the DPP and DSMT Centralized Management Services and Wrap Around Services core: Patient Ascertainment and Engagement, Provider Education and Referral, Intervention Quality and Coordination, and Data, Monitoring & Evaluation. This structure will be developed and implemented during the first planning year of the grant. Improvements and revisions to the structure will be made on an ongoing basis as needed throughout the grant period. Participating Partners & Financial Support 2BMDRP will partner with numerous national and local community organizations, FQHCs, the faith community, and the Baltimore City Health Department to fulfill all of the grant requirements and to meet the identified scale targets. Both organizations (UMMC and JHHS) bring a wealth of experience in working with community partners currently, and through this grant, collaborative partnerships will be expanded. The many participating partners bring additional strengths to the proposed activities through the provision of wrap -around services, hosting community classes, providing referrals to progra ms, promoting classes and services, local coalition building, and leadership of evidence -based programs. These partnerships are key to the success of BMDRP , and UMMC and JHHS look forward to expanding these partnerships in the community. Implementation P lan An accompanying Implementation Work Plan outlines the numerous process steps which will be undertaken to deploy this proposal. The Implementation Work Plan spreadsheet is presented in pdf form. Budget & Expenditures UMMC and JHHS are co -applicants in the BMDRP, and therefore separate health system budgets have been developed and submitted. The total funding requested by the BMRDP is $45,410,914. UMMC's portion of the funding request is $16,348,586, and JHHS's portion of the funding request is $29,06 2,32 8. The two health systems have collaborated on creation of a Shared Initiatives budget totaling $3,955,944 with 65% allocated to JHHS and 35% allocated to UMMC. The amounts per each health system are included in their overall UMMC and JHHS budget reque st, though the Shared Initiatives budget detail is included in a separate spreadsheet document. Achieving the ambitious overarching goals of the BMRDP will require significant efforts including recruitment and establishment of central management functions: leadership, project management, data analytics, and governance support functions; recruitment, training and retention of highly qualified staff for DPP and DSMT programs; and coordination of social needs wraparound service provision with vendors and CBOs to ensure seamless integration with DPP and DSMT services. 2.Target Population s BMDRP , a partnership between Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) , Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (JHBMC) , University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) Downtown, UMMC Midtown, Howard County General Hospital (HCGH) , and Suburban Hospital , proposes to address diabetes prevention within BMDRP Baltimore City service areas and will address diabetes management within BMDRP Baltimore City,Montgomery County, and Howard County service areas. See Appendix A for maps of the service areas for BMDRP DPP activities and the service areas for DSMT activities , respectively . 2.a. Baltimore City Target Population for Diabetes Prevention JHH/ JHBMC and UMMC are proud to serve patients from the East and West side communities of Baltimore City and will target Medicaid and Medicare populations with prediabetes in the zip codes within each Baltimore City partner hospital's service area (Table 1). Nation ally, 34.5% of adults have prediabetes , with 90% o f people with prediabetes unaware.1 In Maryland, a n estimated 10.5% of adults report prediabetes , and 33.7% of Baltimore City residents have obesity, an important risk factor for prediabetes .2 There is racial 1CDC.

A ccessed at https://ibis.health.maryland.gov June 19, 2020 3dis parity in obesity prevalence in the C ity at 22.2% among White, Non -Hispanic adults and 42.0% among Black, Non -Hispanic adults .2 Table 1. Target Population for Diabetes Prevention Zip Hospital Adult Population3 Medicaid Population4 Medicaid Prediabetes Population (pop x 10.5%) x 10.5%) 136 868 91 L ife expectancy in Baltimore City varies widely. There is nearly a 20 year difference in life expectancy between the communities of North Baltimore/Guilford (84 years) and Madison/East End (68.9 years) and Southwest Baltimore (68 years). Several social d eterminants of health (SDOH) negatively affect p ersons in the BMDRP target zip codes and increase the risk of development of prediabetes and diabetes. In Baltimore City, 29% of families live in poverty.6 The zip codes served by both hospitals have some of the highest Hardship Indices in the state (at 51 on a scale of 1 -100 for Baltimore City) , while the Madison/East End, Upton, Sandtown, Midway/Coldstream, and Southwest Baltimore neighborhoods have the top five worst Hardship Indices in the City. 5 Lack of financial resources severely limits individuals' ability to acquire needed medications, medical supplies, healthy food, public transportation, and cell phone service, among other needs . Approximately 24 % of Baltimore City residents live in a defined healthy food priority area (HFPA) also known as a food desert.7 In a joint Baltimore City resident survey during UMMC's and JHH /JHBMC' s Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in FY18, 39% of residents stated that access to transportation was stated as a barrier to accessing healthcare. It is also noted that 30% of Baltimore City residents do not have a vehicle available. Reliance on public transportation may at times limit individuals' ability to attend health promotion classes, access health care, and/or access healthy food. 3 Maryland Census Data - ZIP Code Tabulation Areas https://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/eb706b48117b43d482c63d02017fc3ff 4 Maryland Medicaid eHealth Statistics.

Target Population for Diabetes Management Diabetes management activities will be implemented and scaled by all BMDRP partner hospitals for their \"touch attributed\" Medicare populations (Table 2) . Table 2. Target Population for Diabetes Management Hospital Zip Codes Touch Attributed1 Medicare ( Howard County DSMT community sit e) zip codes, touch attributed population =1245 Target population numbers were obtained from CRISP MADE reports (Medicare CCLF file) by choosing the criteria of Touch Attribution (IP &ED) and the diabetes chronic condition flag by hospital. T hose rosters were then exported to excel to further limit the \"n\" by hospital service area zip codes (for that hospital only --not for all RP hospitals). Time period is CY 2019. I assumed that the target population denominators would not change over the fiv e year grant period. Acco rding to Maryland BRFSS data, 14.4% of Baltimore City adult residents and 26.9% of residents age 65 and older have diabetes, compared to 12.1% of adults statewide. Diabetes prevalence in Montgomery and Howard counties is 9.3%8 and 8%9, respectively. Health inequities are present in all BMDRP regions. In Montgomery County, diabetes prevalence among White residents is 8.0 %, compared to 10.2 % among Hispanic resident s and 11.8 % among Black residents .8 In Howard County, the ED visit rate due to diabetes (per 100,000) is 309.8 for Black adults compared to 73.5 among White adults.10 In Baltimore City, mortality rates from diabetes are almost twice as high for Black residents than for White residents (44.5 vs 23.8 deaths per 100,000 popu lation) .11 The proposed activities outlined in Section 3 will increase the capacity of BMDRP hospitals and community partners to offer DPP and DSMT directly in com munities, and will also increase the number of referrals into these programs. The wrap -around services identified are critical elements of the B MDRP proposal to mitigate the effects of poverty, food insecurity, and transportation barriers. These services will support the success of individuals in the target population and their ability to achieve diabetes prevention and management goals which will support improved health outcomes. 8 Maryland Dept. of Health, BRFSS Data 2018.

State of Health in Baltimore: White Paper 2017. Accessed at 3 .a. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) 3.a.1. DPP Model to be Implemented BMDRP will expand the Johns Hopkins Brancati Center DPP model, a successful community -based DPP model since 2015 . The model utilizes the expertise of the Johns Hopkins Brancati Center as a DPP umbrella organization, with DPP technical experts and c ommunity partn ers, as community experts, working together for the long -term goal of establishing and maintaining DPPs that are outcomes -driven and enduring. In 2017, The Brancati Center became the first DPP in Baltimore City to achieve full CDC recognition . To date, in conjunction with community par tners, Brancati Center DPPs continue to achieve performance outcomes that exceed national DPP benchmarks [i.e. among 116 DPP participants (51% with Medicaid), 72% retention over 1 year, 86% attendance, and 5.6% weight loss at 12 months.]. Brancati Center also participated in the national Medicaid DPP demonstration (2016 -2018), which informed reimbursement of the DPP for Medicaid members in Maryland. Brancati Center had the first Medicare DPP in Baltimore City and is one of the few approved HealthChoice (Medicaid) DPPs in Maryland. BMDRP expa nds in frastructure and capacity, and reach . The BMDRP will expand UMMC's Community DPP model significantly, which will increase their footprint of DPP in West Baltimore 3.a.2. Target Population for DPP: JHH/ JHBMC and UMMC will expand DPP services in the BMDRP Baltimore City service area (Section 2, Table 1), a high -need geographic region with regard to obesity, diabetes incidence, and their inequities . HCGH and Suburban Hospital will not participate in DPP expansion to scale targets in their counties under this fundin g m echanism. However, both hospitals will explore DPP implementation model strategy, partnerships, and leverage the Baltimore City DPP planning and capacity -building, including shadowing at sites. Table 3 shows the combined number of Medicare and Medicaid participants needed to meet the HSCRC Catalyst Grant DPP scale targets for JHH/JHBMC and UMMC . Table 4 (below) outlines the plan for building and expanding DPP services with a focus each hospital's community's needs. 3.a.3. Services and Interventions Patients willReceive: Participants enrolled in the DPP will receive t he 2012 CDC-Developed C urriculum , 12 which focuses on reducing risk through lo ng-term lifestyle changes. Primary program elements are improving nutrition, increasing physical activity, and achieving a goal of 5-7% weight loss over 12 months. Strategies include self -monitoring of food intake and physical activity, increasing self- efficacy, utilizing social support, and basic problem -solving to achieve lifestyle change goals. The Brancati Center's curriculum is led , evaluated, and updated by a Senior Interventionist from the original (NIH) DPP randomized trial and CDC Master Select trainer. The curriculum includes the standard sessions 12 CDC. Diabetes Prevention Resources. Accessed from https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/resources/curriculum.html on May 15, 2020. Table 3.

In-person sessions : In -person programs will be delivered in collaboration with community -based organizations (e.g ., churches, senior centers, FQHCs) whose spaces provide a private area for weigh- ins and a suitable area for classroom -style, group learning for sessions. Based on DPP participant feedback, both UMMC and Brancati Center offer 33 sessions over the yearlong program (minimum required by CDC is 22) , beginning weekly during the first five months and then transitioning to every -other -week thereafter Distance learning sessions : Make -up sessions are offered via distance learning, most commonly through telephone calls between coach and participant. During COVID -19, in -person programs were converted to distance learning via Zoom and will continue, as needed. BMDRP anticipate s a combination of in -person and distance learning for our in -person programs. Zoom sessions have been well -received with 96% attendance across 38 sessions. Online DPP : During the nat ional Medicaid DPP demonstration, approximately one half of Medicaid members selected to participate in an online, rather than in -person, DPP. Understanding the interest of this underserved population in an online DPP, the Brancati Center subsequently developed a CDC -recognized online DPP, Act Today to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes (act 2), which launched January 2020. Act2 utilizes synchronous and asynchronous communication capabilities of an online platform to deliver a tailored, CDC - approved interv ention. JHH/JHBMC will offer act 2 to Medicaid HealthChoice members who prefer an online modality. During year 2 , UMMC will similarly implement an online DPP option , such as act 2. Wrap -around services : DPP w rap around services (see Section 3.c.) support session attendance and lifestyle change. CHWs are in tegrated into the DPP to connect participants to services . CHW s get to know each participant, attend groups regularly , and assist with SDOH as they arise during the program. Over the past 2.5 years, Brancati Center CHWs have made 23 referrals for DPP participants (30% related to healthy food, 26% related to transportation, 17% other SDOH). UMMC DPP participants also have a 30% referral rate to wrap around services. Social workers are brought in for appropriate follow -up as needed. 3.a.4. Roles of the Participating Partners in DPP Participating hospitals will work together and with community partners across the collective BMDRP service area to implement the DPP, as shown in Figure 1. Brancati Center: The Brancati Center will provide DPP Ce ntralized Management Services for BMDRP. C enter faculty and staff will use their expertise to assist partner hospitals and community partner sites with Table 4.

UMMC: The UMCDE will facilitat e expansion of DPP delivery for the UMMC's Downtown and Midtown Campuses in coordination with leadership in their Community an d Population Health departments . UMMC will designate DPP leadership t o serve with The Brancati Center in BMDRP DPP Centralized Management Services roles. Community partner s: The Brancati Center has historically implemented two models of DPP in partnership with community organizations ( Figure 2). In Model 1, The Brancati Center plays the major role in implementation and oversight for the DPP partner site, and the DPP is launched under the JHHS/Brancati Center's CDC organization code as the umbrella DPP organization. Model 2 shifts the primary delivery to the community -based organization under their own CDC organization code, with the intent that after the first year o f program delivery, the community partner will be independent in deli vering the DPP. BMDRP DPP partner sites will determine their long -term goals and whic h model is best for their organization . It is anticipate d that most partners will choose Model 1 (umbr ella DPP) based on past experience. 3.a.5. Implementation Components The majority of Y ear 1 will be devoted to planning for launch of DPPs . BMDRP will work with CBOs to orient them to the DPP and determine the model ( above ) under which they wish to provide DPP at their sites. T asks include establishment of outreach and recruitment procedures; identification and training of community coaches ; execution of MOUs; set up of data procedures, including what data collection system community partners will use; and implementation of recruitment procedures. Key aspects of planning and implementation topics are described below. P lanning occur s in each year as new DPPs are established. DPP Technology Infrastructure BuildingFigure 1. Hub and spoke model for DPP expansion in Baltimore City Figure 2. Models for Community -based DPPs 8Tec hnology will be an essential innovation for participant identification and outreach, referral processes, and program performance monitoring. Tasks are described in Table 5. DPP Workforce JHH/ JHBMC : The Brancati Center 's existing infrastructure, with a rigorous, outcomes -based training curriculum, will support DPP implementation as follows: 1) DPP Maste r Select Trainer will train new lifestyle coaches to deliver the DPP program with a focus on program objectives/metrics, curriculum content, roles and expectations for lifestyle coaches, and documentation (CDC Lifestyle Coach Training and Certification); 2 ) Lifestyle coaches will complete training in participant confidentiality, cultural competence, data integrity as well as training to increase their knowledge of barriers to lifestyle change most frequently experienced by people in the community and potent ial solutions/available resources to address barriers identified by participants; 3) The Brancati Center has a physician, a Registered Dietician, and a Research Data Manager with content expertise in the DPP and data management/analysis; 4) Two additional staff will become DPP Master Trainers and 4) Continuous, year -round performance evaluations, quality assurance meetings, and feedback when the programs are implemented. UMMC: The existing infrastructure of the UMCDE will be expanded significantly to suppor t the migration of DPP into numerous new community sites in West Baltimore . Two staff will become DPP Master Trainers to perform new DPP Lifestyle Coach Training and Certification. One new CDE position, 3 additional CHWs, 2 Lifestyle Coaches, a Referral Coordinator, Case Manager, Social Worker, and Data analyst will be added to form a robust UMMC DPP operational infrastructure. The current medical staff of the UMCDE will continue to provide oversight to the new structure with leadership from Population and Community Health. Participant Identification for DPP, including Provider Engagement and Referral Epic EMR : BMDRP will leverage existing tracking tools within Epic to identify patients with prediabetes , including development and refinement of a prediabetes registry and development and implementation of an Epic referral process (Table 5). Table 5. DPP Technology Infrastructure Building Tasks Technology Component Description Identifying Eligible Participants (provider level) Leverage existing tracking tools within Epic to create best practice advisories for patients with prediabetes Identifying Eligible Participants (population level) Refine Epic report that refreshes on a daily basis identifying eligible participants based on hemoglobin A1c and BMI in past year and absence of diabetes diagnosis Referring Eligible Participants Development and implementation of Epic referral process fo r the DPP Outcomes Tracking (internal reporting) Develop a tableau dashboard to track each of the scale target outcomes CRISP Tracking (external reporting) Work with CRISP to ensure to ensure that data sources and target population definitions are in alignment with internal outcomes tracking CRISP DPP Class Network UMMC to begin work with CRISP to develop embedded DPP class referral system accessible to all community providers with access to CRISP ; to be utilized by both JHH/JHBMC and UMMC Social Med ia Presence A market ing/PR firm will be consulted for advice regarding strategies to market the DPP and engage participants through the use of social media platforms Online DPP Integration of the act 2 platform with Johns Hopkins' electronic health records system (EPIC), as well as establishing billing processes and procedures 9CRISP: UMMC will take the lead to work with CRISP to develop a process for streamlined referral to community DPP cla sses for any provider with access to CRISP (Table 5). During the COVID crisis, CRISP was leveraged to list all available community testing sites throughout the state. UMMC leadership worked with the Baltimore City Health Department on this initiative, and discovered the broader application of this for DPP class referrals. CRISP intends to build this DPP referral system (See CRISP Letter of Support). Clinic -based referral: BMDRP will work with providers within the respective health systems, with a focus on primary care given that is the location of most care of patients with prediabetes, to provide provider education, deploy a usable referral process (Table 5), and determine appropriate work -flows to identify and refer patients with prediabetes to a DPP. BMDRP will also do outreach to providers/clinics not within our health systems to increase referrals to the DPP , to supplement the CRISP -based DPP cross -referral process. Community outreach : Roughly 80% of the Brancati Center's DPP participants have come from community outreach . BMDRP will work with each community site hosting a DPP to determine the most appropriate recruitment procedures for their community. Common community -based outreach mechanisms have included: advertisement and co -hosting of DPP Open Houses at community sites; co -led appeals at church services; word -of-mouth from prior participants; social media outreach; and posting of flyers. Community outreach will also occur via a formal marketing and public health campaign (see Section 3.d ). Dire ct referrals from payers : BMDRP will work with payers to determine and implement outreach approach es for their members that are informed by methods Brancati Center has done successfully with payers. DPP Participant Engagement Screening: Participant screening is a critical aspect of recruiting eligible and appropriate participants for the yearlong DPP . BMDRP will build best practices into workflows, including a st andardized screening process that is associated with increased success with implementation of D PP. This screening process includes: 1) a structured questionnaire administered by telephone, in which a trained DPP lifestyle coach confirms clinical eligibility (i.e., age, absence of diabetes diagnosis, prediabetes, and elevated body mass index) , and 2) a brief behavioral interview to determine if the participant is prepared to engage in the yearlong DPP. P otential barriers are determined (e.g., transportation ) and get addressed for starting the program. Retention and achievement of DPP outcomes : Screened and eligible participants are invited to a Session 0 of the DPP . They attend this initial group sessio n to get a sense of the DPP experience and determine if this is the right program for them. Participants who attend Session 1 subsequently are cons idered enrolled. After enrollment, several approaches are taken to enhance participation and outcomes achievement, including: Individualized feedback on food and activity trackers, brief o ne-on-one meetings with lifestyle coaches to discuss progress and go als, follow up within 24 hours after a missed session using a standard retention protocol, an assigned Community Health Worker (CHW) to each DPP group to address barriers, and bi-monthly DPP supervision meetings with DPP lifestyle coaches and CHWs with th e Director for DPP Intervention. UMMC will utilize a peer mentor program to engage participants in their lifestyle learning and wrap -around services. DPP Billing and Reimbursement Infrastructure Building The Brancati Center is an approved Medicare and HealthChoice DPP supplier . UMMC will work during grant years 1 -2 to become a Medicare and Medicaid DPP supplier. The Brancati Center launched its first Medicare - billable program in September 2019 (Zion Baptist Church) and plans to launch its first Medicaid -billable program (Memorial Baptist Church) in the fall of 2020. The Johns Hopkins E pic team has built custom flow 10sh eets for the DPP, and the Johns Hopkins billing department has configured the system to release claims in accordance with Medicare's and Medicaid's rulings. The Brancati Center will continue to build out sites in Epic to increase the number of billable s ites. UMMC Downtown and Midtown and JHBMC will build the same infrastructure in grant year 1. The Brancati Center is currently contracted with two Managed Care Organizations, Priority Partners and Jai Medical Systems, as well as Johns Hopkins' Medicare Advantage plan. The BMDRP will conduct additional payer outreach (e.g., Medicare Advantage plans and MCOs) and establish contracts with new payers. Data Collection for DPP Performance Measures and Outcomes Table 6 outlines the measures and outcomes that will be collected and the method of data collection to evaluate program implementation and effectiveness as BMDRP proceeds toward meeting scale targets. Program data that are required by CDC for reporting every six months include self-reported sociodemographics, session attendance, physical activity minutes, and weight. Table 6.

DSMT Target Population and Model to be Implemented The target population for DSMT is shown in Section 2, Table 2. To reach the HSCRC's yearly scale targets, the BMDRP will establish 10 new accredited DSMT program locations across the service areas. The DSMT model will follow the National Standa rds for Diabetes Self- Management Education and Support (DSMES ).13 13 2017 National Standards for Diabetes Self -Management Education and Support. Diabetes Care Oct 2017, 40 (10) 1409- 1419. Beck J, Greenwood DA, Blanton L, et al. 2017 National Standards for Diabetes Self -Management Education and Support. D iabetes Educ. 2020;46(1):46 Management Services : JHH/ JHBMC and UMMC have a long history of recognition as accredited DSMT programs under the Education Recognition Program (ERP) of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) . Given the expertise and experience of these large academic medical centers in delivering DSMT, they will serve as the core hub for development and expansion o f new DSMT clinic sites throughout the hospitals' service areas. In Year 1, the focus will be on either a) expanding clinic sites under the existing accreditation of the regional partner hospitals or b) development of new ADA accredited programs. The DSMT Centralized Management Services of the B MDRP will define and document a mis sion statement and goals, seek ongoing stakeholder input ( DSMT instructors, referring providers , patients, community partners), and evaluate the communities served by BMDRP to determine the optimal resources, design, and delivery methods of the DSMT programs that will best align with the population's need. This comprehensive needs assessment may reveal opportunities for improvement of the existing ADA accredited programs at JHH/JHBMC and UMMC ; however, the existing models of DSMT in place at these academic medical centers institut ions will serve as the foundation for the new programs. ADA Approved DSMT Curricula: The ADA's Life with Diabetes (6th edition) and Diabetes Conversation Maps will be used as the DSMT curricula, both of which meet the National Standards for DSMES . Life with Diabetes is a series of teaching outlines that offers a detailed and complete guide to diabetes topics, with illustrations, visual teaching aids, patient handouts, participant assessments, education records, and an extensive support material section. Diabetes Conversation Maps , which were developed in 2007, were designed to shift group DSMT instruction away from a lecture -style format to more of a discussion . Through the regional partnership, DSMT instructors will have access to and, as desired, expert training in, more than one ADA -approved curriculum to further enhance program quality and maximize the benefit. Instruction Modalities : Both in -person and telehealth DSMT services will be offered to participants to increase access and engagement. As a result of COVID -19, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued the 1135 waiver allowing DSMT services to be provided by qualified providers remotely to a patient in the patient's home via video (audio permitted if audio/video is not possible). Given uncertainty with the trajectory of the C OVID -19 pandemic in Maryland, BMDRP anticipate s that this waiver will remain in place at least through the end of 2021 or when a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID -19 becomes available. Since April, 2020, the DSMT programs at JHH/JHBMC and UMMC have been offering video visits for group and in -person instructions , and participants hav e expressed positive feedback about this modality . In fact, DSMT patient volumes have increased significantly as a result of this telehealth option. Considering that transportation can be a barrier to in -person attendance of DSMT, it is hope d that the mor e convenient telehealth modality will remain a long -term reimbursable option . Individualization: An individualized DSMES plan , developed in collaboration with the participant based on their priorities and needs, will be designed for each participant at the initial visit. For participants who are followed in hospital- based clinics affiliated with JHH/BMC or UMMC, the individualized DMSES plan will be entered into Epic , the electronic medical record, using a recently developed DSME S smar tform and episodes tracker (available with November 2020 version of Epic), which allows for seamless tracking and monitoring of participant progress in the EMR. Diabetes Support Programs: In 201 9 ADA lau nched a Diabet es Support Program Directory of ADA -vetted and recognized programs for long -term support following DSMT. DECIDE, an ADA -recognized Diabetes Support Program, will be incorporated into CBOs. In addition, several peer support s trategies will be available (see further Details in Table 7 in the next section). 123. b.2. Services and Interventions DSMT Patients will Receive Individual and group DSMT will be provided by qualified healthcare professionals in both face -to-face and telehealth hospital -based outpatient clinics , community -embedded ambulatory clinics , and community pharmacy (Walgreens) clinics. JHH/JHMBC and UMMC have existing remote patient monitoring (RPM) programs that will provide real- time support to assist participants in achieving their goals. Since 2013, JHH has had a partnership with Johns Hopkins Home Care Group to provide RPM for patients discharged from the hospital, providing weight, blood pressure, and diabetes data monitoring for high -risk patients. The DSMT team will review and respond to remote participant data to pr ovide just -in-time and adaptive support. Table 7 presents several additional DSMT intervention enhancements that will be used to improve program implementation and patient outcomes, including clinical decision support, healthy nutrition for diabetes self- management, weight loss goals, and a social media and in -person peer support communities.

Peer support Social media groups (Facebook, Twitter) CDE-led Facebook and Twitter pages with live sessions, question & answer forum, invited speakers, and educational materials l isted above. Peer mentoring program Identify existing patients who have successfully completed DSMT program as a patient who have a desire to share success stories with and support current participants in the program. 3.b.3 . Target Patient Population(s) Medicare beneficiaries who have at least one inpatient or emergency department encounter in a regional partnership hospital (JHH, JHBMC, HCGH, Suburban, UMMC) AND an ICD-10 code for diabetes mellitus within the hospital service area zip codes will be the target patient population for this regional partnership (Section 2.b). A targeted screening approach using EMR \"opportunity reports\" (to be developed in Year 1) will be used to identify patients who have the greatest need for this service (e.g. new diagnosi s, A1C >8%, recent hospitalization or ED visit for glucose -related issue, relevant SDOH ). 3.b.4. Roles of the Participating Partners in DSMT Hospital Partners JHH/JHBMC/UMMC : These hospital outpatient DSMT partners will serve as the DSMT centralized management services core, as described in Section 3.b.1 . 14HCGH/Suburban Hospital : To ensure that patient experience and benefits related to DSMT services are consistent and standardized across JHHS, two of the JHHS community hospitals, HCGH and Suburban Ho spital will collaborate for DSMT program -building and extending DSMT services into community partner clinical sites . Neither hospital currently has ADA accredited DSMT. Each hospital will identify a quality coordinator to work with the DSMT centralized se rvices core for the DSMT program -building, accreditation, and activities. Community Partners CMS policy requires specific clinical venues for delivery of DSMT, and lay persons are not permitted to deliver DSMT.14 In addition to the hospital outpatient serv ices above, community -embedded ambulatory clinics , FQHC, and community pharmacies are approved sites that will be utilized. Community Ambulatory Clinics /FQHCs : Johns Hopkins Community Physicians ( JHCP ) has identified 8 community -based clinics in Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Howard County, and Montgomery County that serve a large proportion of the target population for the JHHS r egional partnership hospitals. JHCP will identify a QI lead to serve on the advisory group of the DSMT core to help identify current barriers to DSMT referral and proposed solutions, assist in the interviewing and recruitment process of qualified certified diabetes care and education specialists (CDCES) to provide DMST instruction in JHCP locations, assist with coordination of clinical scheduling to accommodate existing CDCES staff at JHCP locations, assist in the development of marketing materials to increase JHCP provider awareness of DSMT services, identify additional commu nity resources to increase awareness of local DSMT programs, and conduct community health fairs and/or diabetes expos at JHCP clinic sites. Chase Brexton, an FQHC, has expressed interest in exploring partnership for delivery of DSMT as well. Columbia Medic al Practice (CMP ): CMP is the leading multi- specialty group in Howard County, with 30 providers. A large proportion of the DSMT target population for HCGH (~1700 patients per year) is cared for at this practice, and there is currently a lack of DSMT programs to support this practice. In Year 1 of this grant, the DSMT core hub will assist CMP in training and recruitment of a CDCES and help set up the clinic to attain ADA accreditation. Community Pharmacies : Walgreens Pharmacy and Johns Hopkins Health S ystem have a long -standing history of collaboration (see Letter of Support). In Year 1, three possible models for collaboration: a) assist in training of existing Walgreens pharmacists to become CDCES who deliver and bill for DSMT , b) new Walgreens CDCES hire(s) to build DSMT, c) assign JHH/JHBMC s or UMMC DSMT instructors to rotate through Walgreens pharmacy clinic. In addition, there is an opportunity to develop training videos and informational materials to link DSMT directly to diabetes testing supplies sold in Walgreens stores, or expanding use of telehealth services . Additional pharmacy partnerships will be explored in Year 1. For example, Suburban Hospital has a partnership with Foer's Pharmacy. Baltimore City and Maryland Department s of Health : The BMDRP will partner with city and state health depart ments to promote and market DPP and DSMT programming. DSMT regional partnership webpage will be linked to both health department pages to help patients easily identif y their closest DSM T program. Also see Section 3.d. 3.b.5. DSMT Implementation Components . Planning and implementation activities begin in Year 1 and continue throughout the grant period, as new DSMT programs are built, accredited, and launched for enrollment (see Implementation Work Plan ). 14 Medicare Reimbursement Guidelines for DSMT https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/dsmes - toolkit/reimbursement/medicare.html 15The DSMT centralized management support will include clinical experts from JHH/JHBMC and UMMC. Year 1 will consist of knowledge transfer and sharing of best practices, development of new workflows, establishment of remote patie nt monitoring tools , collaboration with community partners, EMR programming, and dashboard building to effectively monitor performance of the joint initiative over the 5 - year period. In addition, core hub leadership from JHH and JHBMC will plan and implem ent new DSMT program s at CMP servi ng HCGH, Suburban Hospital, JHCP , and Walgreens pharmacy. Collaboration of the DSMT initiative will be done using Microsoft Teams, a unified communication and collaboration platform that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage (including collaboration on files), and application integration. Community partners : BMDRP will work with CMP, JHCP, and Walgreens clinic sites to orient them to DSMT programs and establish their interest in providing DS MT under the model described in Section 3.b.2. DSMT Centralized Management will work with each site to recruit DSMT instructors and quality coordinators, provide information about CDCES certification, execute MOUs, set up data procedures (including ADA ERP reporting database and any additional data collection system non -Epic clinic sites will use) and implement recruitment procedures. Chase Brexton has indicated an interest in partnering with the BMDP to offer DSMT . This potential partnership will be planne d during Year 1 . Payers/reimbursement : A prerequisite to billing Medicare for DSMT services is obtaining accreditation through ADA or ADCES as both organizations meet or exceed CMS quality standards for DSMT as outlined by the National Standards for Diabetes Self- Management Education Support . University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) has a single ADA accredited program across 5 affiliated sites. The JHH DSMT service currently holds accreditation through the American Diabetes Association, with JHH as the \"parent site\" and JHBMC as a \"multi -site,\" or semi location. DSMT sites for BMDRP include SMH, HCGH, several JHCP sites and, a community Walgreens. It is anticipated that each site will operate semi-independent ly with oversight from the parent site. S ites must be able to provide DSMT and meet documentation standards before an application can be submitted. This will require harmonization of DSMT specif ic EMR tools at each location. The JHH DSMT quality coordinator will provide and oversee training related to the ADA DSMT standards to multi -site team members. In order to meet the scale targets outlined by the HSCRC, DSMT sites must have the ability to bill Medicare prior to January 1, 2022. Prospective DSMT sites should have multi -site accreditation applications submitted on or around 8/1/2021 to allow time for application revisions, if required. DSMT Technology Infrastructure Building Table 8 outlines opportunities to make enhancements in the EMR for patient ascertainment, streamlined referrals, tracking of participant progress, and tracking of population outcomes (i.e. scale targets). Established Epic programmers within JHHS and UMMC to refine existing tools at each of these steps and ensure standardization across both health systems. Table 8. DSMT Technology Infrastructure Building Technology Component Description Identifying Eligible Participants (provider level) Leverage existing tracking tools within Epic to create best practice advisories or patient header flags to increase provider awareness Identifying Eligible Participants (population level) Create an Epic report that refreshes on a daily basis identifying eligible participants, most recent A1C, diabetes -related complications, and key SDOH . Increase awareness of DSMES Benefits Tracker ( see Appendix B. Current DSME Benefit Tracker in Epic) 16Referring Eligible Participants Streamline electronic referral form, including automated entry of relevant questions (e.g. complications, diabetes diagnosis type), simplification of referral form, and/or \"teed up\" referrals by DSMT team MyChart messaging to Eligible Participants Outreach eligible patients directly via Epic MyChart messages with information about DSMT, available programs and schedules, and direct sign up Individualizing/documenting DSMT plan Use \"Episodes of Care\" functionality in Epic to create and document an individualized education plan (available with Nov 2020 upgrade; see Appendix C. New Epic DSMES Worfklow) Tracking DSMT plan Use built -in Epic DSMES tracker to monitor progress of participant across the program (available Nov 2020 u pgrade) Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) Explore the use of Healthy Planet (part of EPIC) as an interface with RPM Patient Webpage Develop a regional partnership website linked to respective webpages of hospital and community partners DSMT Workforce Studies have shown that DSMT is most effective when delivered by a multidisciplinary team .15 Each DSMT program will be comprised of: 1) Certified Diabetes Care and E ducation Specialists ( registered nurse, registered dietician, pharmacist holding certification as a CDCES, who will deliver DSMT instruction and bill for services); 2) Quality Coordinator responsible for oversight of each ADA accredited program, evaluation of program effectiveness, and continuous QI; 3) Social workers responsible for integration of social needs into diabetes care ; 4) CHWs providing peer, culturally -informed outreach, linkage to community resources, education reinforcement , social support, and advocacy in commu nity/home settings ; 5) Administrators ; and 6) Referral coordinators responsible for identifying referrals, scheduling patients, reviewing IT -driven opportunity reports to identify eligible participants and \"teeing up\" referrals for primary care physicians . DSMT Patie nt Ascertainment and Engagement The first step in increasing access to DSMT is identifying individuals who are eligible for the benefit. Unfortunately, busy primary care physicians do not have time during an encounter to search through the EMR to verify whether a patient has previously received DSMT. Although Epic has a built -in DSME benefit tracker visible in the sna pshot view for each participant, many clinicians may not be aware that this tracking system exists or the information may be buried . Two solutions will be implemented. The first is Techno logy Infrastructure Building previously described . The second is the Johns Hopkins Patient Engagement Program (PEP). Some patients who are eligible for DSMT may be initially reluctant to engage in the program. Providers need additional mo tivational interviewing training and resources to motivate patients to initiate DSMT. PEP at Johns Hopkins offers training to increase providers' ability to engage patients as active partners in their care. Year 1 , PEP training materials aimed at increasing patient engagement around DSMT will be developed. Provider Engagement and Referral There are multiple provider -level barriers to DSMT referral, including lack of knowledge about DSMT, lack of awareness of availability of local DSMT programs, lack of available DSMT programs, perceived lack of benefit from the service, confusing referral process, lack of understanding about reimbursement for DSMT, concerns about insurance coverage and costs to the patient, and lack of relationships between hospi tals where DSMT services are offered and community clinics where eligible patients are seen. 15 Beck J, Greenwood DA, Blanton L, et al. 2017 National Standards for Diabetes Self -Management Education and Support. Diabetes Educ. 2020;46(1):46 -61. 17Me dicare requires a detailed referral to justify DSMT services. Completion of such a detailed referral form is daunting and time consuming, and it is a det errent for busy PCPs . Providers would welcome assistance with identifying and referring eligible participants. To overcome many of these barriers, in Year 1 a systematic needs assessment will be implemented to prioritize CDC-proposed strategies to overcoming these barriers , including: a) reducing burden of referral process; b) closing referral loop to reinforce buy -in; c) establish referral network through use of promotional materials; d) create care pathways and EMR automation; e) identify and partner with relevant specialists (podiatrists, ophthalmologists, wound care specialists, etc.) to refer people with uncontrolled diabetes.16 The Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists provides a list of \"tips for reaching prescribers,\" which will be syste matically incorporated into our existing and new programs. The CDC providers sample provider letters and flyers that will be adapted for our program. 8 Using the CDC's DSMT health communication and marketing toolkit9 as a framework, a marketing/PR firm will be consulted to identify optimal strategies for communicating with healthcare providers. DSMT Billing and Reimbursement Infrastructure Building Each DSMT site must obtain ADA accreditation and submit a copy of their program certificate to the Medicare MAC in order to become eligible to receive CMS reimbursement for DSMT. Out patient hos pital locations included in BMDRP will provide DSMT in regulated space and claims will be submitted to Medicare Part B utilizing their hospital or facility NPI number. All outpatient hospital locations are currently enrolled with Medicare Part B, therefore professional team members need not be CMS approved providers to bill under the facility, however, must meet DSMT educator standards per the American Diabetes Association. Hospital charges corresponding to individual and group DSMT training codes; G0108 and G0109 will be built within the EMR for each site. Professional team members who will furnish DSMT in regulated space include but are not limited to RNs; RDs; PharmDs; and NPs. For locations that are considered unregulated space , claims mus t be submitted under the NPI number of an individual Medicare Part B provider. Notably, an individual provider cannot enroll with Medicare solely to bill DSMT, and thus must be able to bill Medicare Part B for at least one other non -DSMT service [(such as a Registered Dietitian who provides medical nutrition therapy (MNT) ]. The following provider types are permitted per CMS to bill independently; RDs, MDs; PAs; NPs; LSWs, nurse midwives and clinical psychologists . The appropriate professional fee charge c aptures corresponding to the individual and group DSMT training codes, G0108 and G0109 will be made available within Epic at each JCHP location. Per CMS regulations, for any single patient, only one entity or individual provider can bill Medicare for init ial and follow up training. To ensure payment in unregulated space, a primary educator will be identified at each JHCP site, and their NPI number used to bill all DSMT claims. Remote patient monitoring is a financially sustainable service, as there are cu rrently CPT codes (99453, 99454, and 99457, 99458) that cover initial patient monitoring equipment and setup ($21), device transmission fee ($69/month), and monitoring and treatment ($53/month). 17 16 Beck J, Greenwood DA, Blanton L, et al. 2017 National Standards for Diabetes Self -Management Education and Support.

Participant progress will be monitored using built -in tracking tools in EPIC. EPIC EMR data from all clinic sites in BMDRP will be captured by CRISP for outcome evaluation. For participants who are seen at community health clinics outside of the he alth-system, data will be captured using RedCap. 3.c. Wrap Around Services Wrap around services are designed to mitigate known barriers that stand in the way of people with prediabetes and diabetes : 1) enrolling in, attending, participating in, and completing DPP and DSMT; and 2) having the ability to carry out the behavioral and lifestyle change activities that are the focus of DPP and DSMT. SDOH , health system barriers, community level barriers, and individual level barriers stand in the way of people both participating in DPP and DSMT and carrying out the lifestyle change behaviors. The National Academy of Medicine recommends a model of integrati ng social needs into medical care to address SDOH as a primary barrier to achieving population health outcomes, especially in minority and underserved communities of health inequity in the U.S.18 In addition, diabetes -specific models demonstrate the role of everyday life barriers and challenges in impeding the integration of diabetes lifestyle and self -care behaviors, resulting in worse disease outcomes.19 Based on these models, BMDRP wrap around services are designed facilitate and support achievement of DPP and DSMT program goals . In addition, Because diabetes and prediabetes are k nown diseases of health disparity, Health Equity Trainings , including Unconscious Bias trainings for providers at hospital and community -based care sites, and Race, Ethnicity and Language (REaL) and sexual orientation and gender identify (SOGI) trainings will be 18National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Diabetes Care Dec 2016, 39 (12):2126 -2140. 20SDOH wrap around services will be available to all DPP and DSMT populations in the BMDRP service areas implementing the programs. SDOH needs and wrap around services are currently assessed and managed by personnel within the DPP and DSMT program t hemselves, by partner hospitals, and by community care teams in some service areas. During Year 1 BMDRP will complete planning for needs assessment, coordination of wrap around services, and technology infrastructure for streamlined referral and follow -up, as well as documentation and tracking for wrap around service evaluation of effectiveness in achieving BMDRP goals. Provider/workforce wrap arounds (PEP and Health Equity Trainings) will also be available to all workforces. 3.d. Innovations Each of the Proposed Activities described ( DPP, DSMT, wrap around services ) include s innovations. First, all will rely on new technologies for operational efficiency and linkages both within organizations and across regional partnership organizations and regions . A particular innovation will be the CRISP inventory of DPP programs across the City/State which is available to providers for patient referrals . Second, the implementation and Epic EMR integration of Glooko, a universal diabetes device download software, is a major innovation of this proposal. To our knowledge, the BMDRP would be the first program in the country to have a fully EMR -integrated universal diabetes device software for remote monitoring of a broad range of diabetes patient data. By pulling Glooko flowsheet statistics directly into Epic, there are unprecedented opportunities to develop targeted workflows to identify at -risk patients for proactive outreach for DSMT, to tailor DSMT further to individual patients' clinical needs, and to track the imp act of DSMT on immediate glycemic outcomes. A third innovation is the community extension of DSMT through an ADA -approved Diabetes Support program , DECIDE, that enables long- term life skills enhancement for managing diabetes in the context of daily life, proven especially effective with populations of health inequity (lower socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minorities, and persons with vision or cognitive impairment) . Additional, peer -based formal support programs are also integrated. Fourth, community ph armac y locations will be established as ADA accredited DSMT programs with reimbursement. Finally, provider supports are innovative, including PEP trainings for skills to increase patient engaging in DPP and DSMT , and health -equity trainings to address dyna mics that contribute to prediabetes and diabetes inequities See Letters of Support for each) . Each innovation within this proposal will be disseminated to population health audiences through shared learning networks and to evidence -based practice audiences through publication , with a goal of advancing best practice s and evidence . 3.e. Marketing and PR Campaign A Marketing and PR firm will be hired in Year 1 to provide strategy for and i mplement a Baltimore City -wide public health campaign for DPP and DSMT over the 5- year period. Reach will include broad as well as targeted communications within communities most in need, and social media. In addition, the firm will provide tailored marketing and PR strategy to serve HCGH and Suburban Hospital service areas in Howard and Montgomery counties, respectively. Additional opportunities are partner site -specific communication campaigns (e.g. pamphlets, videos on plasma screens in hospital spaces and clinical waiting areas). 4.Measurement and Outcomes The B MDRP will utilize reporting tools that the HSCRC is working with CRISP to develop to measure progress toward scale targets. HSCRC will make these tools available to the RP as they are developed. In this section, additional tools and program -specific measures are described that the BMDRP will use to coordinate and measure its progress toward scale targets. Measures used to assess the quality and outcomes within health 21care org anizations and systems typically rely heavily on the Donabedian21 model of structure, pro cess, and outcome measures. Described are structural, p rocess, and performance measures that will be used to achieve outcomes as defined in the expected scale targe ts. In addition, program -specific (internal) outcome evaluation is described. 4.a. Structural Measures Structural measures are defined as elements which define the \"capacity, systems, and processes\" which must be in place to deliver high quality health care. These elements must be in place in order to provide a sound foundation for the remaining four years of the grant period. For purposes of this application, the following structural measures will be assessed at the conclusion of the first year of the grant, CY 2021 . Implementation of the following groups during the first quarter of Year 1, with a designated schedule: BMDRP Governance Council (with representation from JHM and UMMC) , Management Committee , Operations Committee , Community Advisory Committ ee. By conclusion of Year 1 convening the Baltimore City LHIC with Director in place, Epic build- out of Pred iabetes and Diabetes Registr ies with connectivity to CRISP for program community c lass listings and CHW access , and staff hired for JHHS and UMMC's BMDRP expansions. 4.b. Process Measures Process measures are defined as actions taken by health care professionals to maintain and/or improve anindividual or population's health. These actions drive progress to the expected or anticipated outcomes an d ar e used to measure progress towards the scale targets. The DPP and DSMT process measures and data collection are described in Tables 6 and Table 9, respectively. These dashboards and documentations will be used in real -time to guide any modifications to strategy implementation for processes including participant outreach, enrollment, retention, and completion. CRISP reports to be developed for this HSCRC diabetes RPgrant will be critical for coordinating data across BMDRP and its partner hospitals for quality monitoring . 4.c. Performance Measures Performance measures indicate effectiveness of the programs in achieving behavioral and clinical outcom es. The CDC -required performance measures for DPP (attendance, physical activity, weight loss) and the ADA ERP specific performance measures for DSMT (A1C, ER visits, hospitalizations, weight loss) are also reported in Tables 6 and Table 9 . These will be e valuated at 6 month - and 12 -month time points during program scaling and implementation Years 2 - 5. 4.d. Program -Specific Outcome s Evaluation An internal evaluation will be planned to answer questions necessary for JHHS and UMMC decision -making regarding DPP and DSMT i mpact and future program investment . Preliminary evaluation objectives are to: 1) examine whether the programs are associated with potentially avoidable utilization (PAU), i.e. reductions inED visits, hospitalizations, and readmissions asso ciated with enrollment in DSMT and DPP, respectively, vs. comparator groups; 2) track incident diabetes over 5 years in the prediabetes population that receives DPP vs comparator in order to quantify prevention or delay in progression to type 2 diabetes/risk reduction in our regional partnership population(s); 3) evaluate questions of health equity, such as benefits from DPP, DSMTenrollment, and completion by race/ethnicity, age, gender, service area zip codes, and other populationdemographics; 4) examine patterns of use of and benefits from Wrap Around Services in achievement of DPP and DSMT outcomes; 5) determine performance of individual partner sites with regard to program outcomesand mediators and modifiers of effect; and 6) participate with the Finance Team in cost and cost savingsanalyses. 21 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2015).

Scalability and Sustainability For sustainability of the Baltimore City -wide diabetes prevention and management programs, across RPs, The BMDRP commits investment in Initiating a local health improvement cou ncil (LHIC) with the Baltimore City Dept. of Health to focus on diabetes and promote diabetes health education and type 2 diabetes prevention. For regional and national sustainability efforts for DPP and DSMT, the American Diabetes Association is committing $25,000 to BMDRP, if funded, to create a Shared Learning Bridge with other East Coast area initiatives, fostering a national learning collaborative for diabetes population health. R egarding DPP and DSMT sustainability, specifically, these programs were selected by HSCRC because of their evidence of effectiveness in reducing diabetes burden via prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes (DPP) and via improvement in clinical markers associated with reduced risk of diabetes complications and excess utilization (DSMT). To sustain and continue to disseminate DPP and DSMT programming after the funding is discontinued , building the infrastructure for CMS billing and reimbursement both for DPP and DSMT are a priority in Year 1 in order to achieve scale target measurement. Billing and reimbursement can cover the program costs of DSMT. However, billing and reimbursement are not necessarily sufficient for financial sustainability of DPP or for DSMT depending on scale of program growth , program features, and wh at he alth care professionals serve as instructors. Consequently, it is imperative that DPP and DSMT both demonstrate additional sustainability. In this section we describe billing and reimbursement and return on investment (ROI ). PAU, derived from formal evaluation, will be available to BMDRP partner organizations . In addition, Community Benefits are an additional sustainability option for DPP and for w rap around services described for some partners . 5.a. DPP Sustainability 5. a.1. CMS Billing and Reimbursement for DPP . CMS reimbursement is available for DPP delivery to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Nationally and statewide, the available reimbursement for DPP isunderutilized. One primary goal of the HSCRC funding is to increase the number of claims for DPP, an indicator of reach of reimbursed programs to service areas. Table 11 shows the DPP Billing Codes and CMS Payments for milestones achieved for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. DPP is delivered in community settings by (usually unsalaried) lay persons who are trained as DPP Lifestyle Coaches. Lay person workforces generally are not eligible for CMS reimbursement. The reimbursement is new revenue for lay workforces providing DPP in JHHS service areas. Maximum reimbursement is $725 per participant over 2 years for Medicare, and maximum reimbursement is $670 per participant over 1 year for Medicaid. As shown in Table 11, reimbursement is dependent on an individual's performance (i.e., attendance and weight loss). Reimbursement offsets the DPP program costs in Medicare by approximately 40%. In Medicaid, Table 11. DPP Billing Codes for Medicare and Medicaid Medicare Billing Codes Description CMS Payment Medicaid Billing Codes Description CMS Payment G9873 or G9890 First session attended $25 G9873, E1639, or 0488T First core sessions attended $90 G9875 G9875 G9880, $50 23max imum reimbursement ($670) would cover the cost of the 12 month program ($617), but would be estimated at lower than 100% cost coverage based on population averages for target achievement. 5.a.2. DPP ROI. The American Medical Association (AMA) Cost Saving Calculator22 utilizes evidence -based algorithms derived from over a decade of data on costs and costs savings for DPP. For example, for the JHH/ JHBMC service area, b ased on the Brancati Center's DPP program cost of $617 per participant, a 3 - 5 y ear ROI of 4% (lower li mit) to 18% (upper limit) is expected. Using the same AMA calculator, UMMC's DPP cost of $586 per participant, and HSCRC's scale targets for enrollment and completion, UMMC expects to generate a positive ROI beginning in year 4 of the grant. 5.a.3. Community Benefits . Community benefits are defined by the HSCRC as \"a planned, organized, and measured approach, by a non -profit healthcare organization, to meeting identified community health needs within its service area.\"23 Both UMMC and JHM annually rep ort community benefits to the HSCRC and the IRS. The UMMC has included Diabetes Prevention Programming in their annual report, because they have not collected any type of patient reimbursement for these progra ms. If grant funding is awarded and the organizations pursue reimbursement either through billing or other funding, both will n o longer count DPP p rogramming as a community benefit. Long -term sustainability of these programs will be based on the ability to bill CMS, and therefore, woul d not qualify for community benefits. 5.b. DSMT Sustainability 5.b.1. CMS Billing and Reimbursement for DSMT . Currently, billing for DSMT by the personnel within the BMDRP is variable. Some instructors and sites routinely bill, while others do not. For Medicare populations, accredited DSMT program costs can be directly offset by reimbursement. Based on estimates from the DSMT programs at JHH and JHBMC , the annual cost per pa rticipant (two hours of DSMT) is $185. This cost assumes DSMT instruction is provided by RD/RN who is a certified diabetes educator , as these are the predominant disciplines represented in DSMT instruction. See Table 12 for the Medicare DSMT Benefit, billing cod es, and 2020 CMS Payment rates .24 The majority of the benefit is group program delivery. DSMT groups generally comprise up to 10 patients for a 60 minute duration. For a Medicare service line therefore, reimburseme nt is $121.14 per hour of individual DSMT and up to $33.68 per hour of group DSMT . 5.b.2. DSMT ROI PAU. Assuming that approximately 30% and 70% of DSMT will be delivered via group and individual instruction, respectively, Medicare reimbursement for an average patient receiving two hours of DSMT instruction per year by an RN or RD is approximately $210, which exceeds the per -patient cost of the program of $185. Therefore, the DSMT program costs are expected to be directly covered by reimbursement alone. In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated the DSMT 22 American Medical Association.

S tudies have demonstrated that DSMT programs can achieve hemoglobin A1C decreases of ~0.6% to 1.0% in people with diabetes. C onsidering that each 1% increase in hemoglobin A1C is associated with an approximate 35% increased risk of diabetes -related complications, this degree of A1C lowering is clinically meaningful. PAU resulting from DSMT in BMDRP will be evaluated. 5.c. Wra p Around Services Sustainability . Over the course of the grant period, BMDRP will engage actively with CBOs and agencies that are effective in serving the social needs of diabetes and prediabetes patients and communities, as described in this grant. However, as SDOH are not limited to patients with diabetes and prediabetes in our service areas; these needs must be addressed systematically. For sustainability, therefore, an essential goal of the grant is collaboration with hospital partner leadership on solutions at the institutionallevel that will be implemented and sustained acro ss patient populations and diseases, beyond this RP grant. BMDRP will also collaborate with local and state officials and committees seeking address sustainable SDOHand health inequity solutions. At JHHS, for example, with the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Health Equity,there are workgroups on processes including identification and documentation of social needs, and Epic workflows to respond to social needs. The COVID -19 response mobilized a Baltimore City -wide collaborative, inclusive of JHHS and UMMS, to address social needs among vulnerable and at -risk patients. BMDRP allows for examination of reach of these regional and institutional efforts to people with diabetes and prediabetesin RP service areas, and enables collaborative planning to ensure that following the HSCRC grant period, theemerging regional and institutional infrastructure for social needs is and remains accessible to patients in theservice areas. 6. Participating Partn ers and Decision -Making Process The BMDRP has proposed an initial governance structure (See Appendix D). This structure is composed of a Governance Council that will have key leaders from both JHHS and UMMC ) and input from a Patient, Family and Community Advisory Committee and a Finance and Sustainability Committee . The BMDRP Management Committee will oversee all grants administration and management. The Executive Council, responsible forthe daily activity implementation and oversight, will lead four workgroups that support the DPP and DSMT Centralized Management Services and Wrap Around Services core : Patient Ascertainment and Engagement , Provider Education and Referral, Intervention Quality and Coordination, and Data, Monitoring & Evaluation.All of these committees and workgroups will have representation and decision -making from both JHM and UMMC to lead this initiative. BMDRP collaborators that will partner to carry out the DPP, DSMT, and wrap around services activities include national and community organizations, the faith community, and the Baltimore City Health Department to fulfill all of the grant requirements and to meet the identified scale targets. Both organizations (UMMC and JHHS) bring a wealth of experience in working with community partners currently, and through this grant, collaborative partnerships will be expanded. The many participating partners bring additional strengths to the proposed activities through wrap -around services, hosting community classes, providing referrals to programs, local coalition building, L 3 and leadership of evidence -based programs.

The Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partnership (BMDRP) aims to expand access to two evidence based models that assist with improving diabetes prevention and management: the Diabete s Prevention Program (DPP) and Diabetes Se lf-Management Training (DSMT). The BMDRP proposal aligns with our developing Johns Hopkins Medicin e Office of Population Health and has been reviewed with health system and hospital care coordination, finan ce and other leadership , and we will support the program if approved for funding by the HSCRC. Thank you in advance for your consideration. Sincerely, Scott A. Berkowitz, MD, MBA July 16, 2020 Adam Kane Chair Health Services Cost R eview Commission 4160 Patterson Avenue Baltimore, MD 21215 Re: Regional Partnership Catalyst Grants Dear Chairman Kane, Thank you for your commitment to preventing and reducing the burden of diabetes for Maryland citizens through the Health Services Cos t Review Commission (HSCRC) Regional Partnership Catalyst Grant Program. Diabetes is a serious condition, and while prediabetes may be reversible, diabetes has no cure. It is critically important to address this potentially life altering disease as early as possible. Race and ethnicity affect the risk of diabetes. In my work on health disparities, I strongly believe that the prevalence of diabetes in minority populations can only be addressed and improved through enhanced population health strategies. The Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partnership aims to expand access to evidence -based models that will prevent the onset of the disease through Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP ) and reduce health care complications associated with diabetes through Di abetes Self - Management Training (DSMT). The Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partnership proposal targets disadvantaged communities and population that will greatly benefit from enhanced focus and services. The Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partners hip includes a diverse range of community partners and shifts focus on diabetes from inside the walls of hospitals to community -based interventions and clinics. I strongly support the application for the Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partnership and h ope you will give this proposal consideration for funding. Sincerely, Nick J.

As a long -time partner, with Johns Hopkins Health System and UMMC as lead agencies, we will have our Local Health Improvement Council (LHIC) focus on diabetes and promote their diabetes health education classes, including the Diabetes Prevention Program and Diabetes Self-Management Training. This partnership will help the Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partnership identify and educate community members in an effort to prevent and manage diabetes. The project will help the families we serve by bringing health resources to a vulnerable, underserved community. In addition, this partnership will fund our LHIC Director after our Accountable Health Communities Project Director funding ends. We look forward to partnering with Johns Hopkins Health Sys tem and UMMC on this exciting opportunity to prevent and manage diabetes in Baltimore City, and we hope that the Health Services Cost Review Commission will favorably review and fund this vital project.

ADA seeks to facilitate national reach and learnings from regional diabetes population health initiatives , such as this, in support of our mission \"to prevent and cure diabetes and to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes.\" ADA will commit $25,000 to support Hopkins' Regional Partnership Catalyst Initiative in Year 1. These funds will be used to create a Shared Learning Bridge between Hopkins' propos ed Diabetes Prevention & Self-Management Programs and several concurrent ADA led and steered regional improvement projects in the Greater Philadelphia area : ADA is leading a 3 -year project focused on improving clinical management for patients with diab etes and CVD by working with the American Heart Association, Jefferson Health, Penn Medicine, Temple Health, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hopkins, and HealthShare Exchange, the regional HIE. ADA is on the steering committee of an American Medica l Association and Jefferson College of Population Health collaboration focused on improving nDPP capacity and enrollment in city of Philadelphia and surrounding counties. ADA is on the regional steering committee of a global initiative call ed Cities Changing Diabetes, which has selected Philadelphia as its next US city and focuses primarily on community health engagement strategies. The goal of ADA's commitment to Hopkins in support of Maryland's state -wide Regional Partnership Catalyst Pro gram is to bilaterally share learnings and institutional and program data (through data sharing agreements between Hopkins institutions and ADA) that support improvements in diabetes population health. These will include clinical workflow interventions, da ta use best practices including the role of HIEs, operational interventions such as building capacity and enrollment efficiency for DPP and DSME programs, and awareness and engagement strategies to better work with community health stakeholders.

Redwood Street, Ste. 1100 I Baltimore I MD I 21202 July 7, 2020 Health Services Cost Review Commission 4160 Patterson Avenue Baltimore, MD 21215 Dear Review Committee, We are very pleased to write this letter in support of the Baltimore Metro Regional Diabetes Partnership application for DPP and DSMT expansion. As vice president of Health Strategies for the American Heart Association, I have worked with both Johns Hopkin s and the University of Maryland Medical System on prior initiatives in Baltimore City. The mission of the American Heart Association (AHA) is to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives, and this application represents the kind of work that the AHA wants to support. Of particular relevance to this application is the Know Diabetes by Heart Initiative in which the AHA and the American Diabetes Association are working together to address heart disease and stroke in people with type 2 dia betes. Know Diabetes by Heart aims to comprehensively combat the link between type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease by empowering people living with type 2 diabetes to lower their risk for cardiovascular disease by providing the necessary tools and resources to drive more informed conversations between people living with type 2 diabetes and their doctors. One of the unique aspects of the AHA's presence in Baltimore City is the Simple Cooking with Heart Kitchen (SCWH Kitchen). Launched in 2014, the mi ssion of the SCWH Kitchen is to teach participants how to prepare simple, delicious and inexpensive meals at home so they can enjoy the benefits of eating healthier and feel more confident cooking for their families. Starting in 2018, we began a partnershi p with the Brancati Center around the kitchen, \"The Heart of Diabetes\" initiative. The Brancati Center has started a DPP program at the Under Armour House (location of the kitchen) in which the DPP participants participate in eight cooking classes sponsore d by the AHA with the goal of supporting healthy changes in their nutrition by building real -world, practical cooking skills with a focus on healthy nutrition and food safety. We have worked in conjunction with the Brancati Center to integrate eight cookin g class modules with the DPP. These classes are ongoing (now virtually) and have been extremely well -received by participants. We have also begun offering cooking classes to other Brancati Center DPPs. As part of the Baltimore Metro Regional Diabetes Par tnership, we pledge our support to work with Johns Hopkins and University of Maryland Medical System to provide in -person and virtual cooking classes, advertise DPPs, and provide Know Diabetes by Heart clinical support tools which we think will be especial ly beneficial for DSMT participants. The current application for funding is a natural extension of the work that the AHA has started with the Brancati Center, and we look forward our collaboration with the Baltimore Metro Regional Diabetes Partnership. Sincerely, Rhonda Ford Chatmon Vice President American Heart Association 7778 The Brancati Center for the Advancement of Community Care Depar tment of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine 2024 East. Monument Street / Room B-303 Baltimore, MD 2120 5 USA 410-614-6441 July 7, 2020 Dear Review Committee : As the Executive Director of the Johns Hopkins Brancati Center for the Advancement of Community Care, I am pleased to offer my highest support for the HSCRC Regional Partnership Catalyst Grant application entitled \"Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partner ship.\" The mission of the Brancati Center is to improve the health of communities by developing, evaluating and disseminating new models of healthcare that leverage the skills of a diverse range of healthcare providers. Founded in 2014, the Center chose to focus early efforts on diabetes prevention because of the lack of existing prevention resources as well as the high incidence of diabetes in our local community. In 2015 t he Brancati Center be gan working with two churches , Memorial Baptist Church and Zion Baptist Church, to deliver the first National Diabetes Prevention Program s (DPP) in East Baltimore. 100% of our participants completed the program and the group met all CDC requirements at 12 months . As a result, the program was the first DPP to receive full recognition by the CDC in Baltimore City and the Brancati Center has been approved as a Medicare and HealthChoice DPP provider. The Brancati Center continues to implement 5 -8 DPP programs each year in the East Baltimore community. To date, 16 8 people have enrolled in Brancati Center DPPs. We are off to a good start, but we know we can do more to reach others at risk of developing diabetes in our communities. Given our experience and prior success, our team is in a strong position to develo p the methods, tools and strategies to increase enrollment and retention in DPP programs. Our health system and community partners agree. Our partners are eager to continue and other sites have expressed interest in implementing the DPP. In addition, the Johns Hopkins Strategic Planning Executive Council recently invested $787,000 in the Brancati Center's diabetes prevention efforts. The funds requested in this application are essential to designing and achieving large -scale implementation of effective com munity -based DPPs across diverse communities utilizing other community sites .

The Baltimore Metro Diabetes Partnership leverages over 10 years of Johns Hopkins University/JHHS and University of Maryland/UMMC collaboration to train diabetes providers and researchers and to discover the most effective approaches to improve the health of highest risk and underserved populations with diabetes. The Baltimore Metro RP will build infrastructure and scale to provide access to DSMT to 25% more of the population with diabetes in our service area and will expand access to DPP for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in 20% more of the population with prediabetes. We look forward to partnering together on this exciting opportunity to prevent and manage diabetes in Baltimore. If you have any further questions about our support of our contribution to this grant, please feel free to reach me at kmunir@som.umaryland.edu. Thank you, Kashif M. Munir, MD Associate Professor of Medicine , University of Maryland School of Medicine Direct or, Uni versity of Maryland Center for Diabetes and End ocrinology Vice - Ms. Tequila Terry, MPH, MBA Deputy Director, HSCRC July 8, 2020 Dear Ms. Terry, The Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is thrilled to participate in the Baltimore Metropolitan Diabetes Regional Partnership's Diabetes Self - Management Training program. Our mission is to p rovide superb evidence -based care for patients with diabetes and endocrine disorders, foster innovative clinical and translational research, and provide outstanding educational programs for medical students, residents, endocrine fellows, clinicians, and the community. Diabetes self- management training is a fundamental and evidence -based component of diabetes management. We are pleased that the HSCRC recognizes the importance of increasing patient access to this important service through this regional partnership. The current ADA accredited program at the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center is overseen by our Division through our Comprehensive Diabetes Center, which opened in 1984 for the purpose of improving the live s of people with diabetes through education at all levels, original research, and direct patient services. Patient education is integral to good care and is the responsibility of our health care members. Our clinical team are the health system leaders for all community diabetes outreach efforts. We organize annual diabetes screenings and awareness campaigns for our patients and employees. Our expert team of endocrine physicians and fellows, advanced practice providers, nurses, and registered dieticians provide care to over ~5,300 patients with diabetes per year. Of these, approximately 1,200 (23%) are Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older. Thus, we see a large volume of the patients who are the target of this DSMT initiative. Despite our successful ADA accredited DSMT program, we recognize many opportunities to improve patient engagement and increase referrals across our health system . In addition, the community -based endocrinologists in the Johns Hopkins Health system have adjunct faculty appointments in our Division, and are engaged actively in our mission. I could not recommend a better leader for this DSMT program than Dr. Nestoras Mathioudakis, who has served as the Clinical Director of our Division since 2016. He is an energetic, innovative, and committed leader and I have confidence that he will mobilize all resources at his disposal to achieve the scale targets outlined by the HSCRC. The Johns Hopkins Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism wholeheartedly support s the important wor k proposed by the Baltimore Metropolitan Diabetes Regional Partnership DSMT core. I am excited to see the benefits that this program will bring to our patients, clinicians, and community. Sincerely, Rexford S.

The Health Resources Community Collaboration is a coalition of more than 20 church leaders in the East Baltimore community. Three of our member churches (Zion Baptist Church, Memorial Baptist Church, and Israel Baptist Church) have partnered with the Johns Hopkins Brancati Center to implement the diabetes prevention program for our congregation and surrounding community ; we have been working with the Brancati Center since 2015 . We would be pleased to take part in this expansion of the DPP that will be nurtu red by our own community members and in which we will take a leadership role with professional guidance from the Brancati Center. We are pleased to offer sites , health ministr y members to serve as ambassadors, and qualified persons to serve in an advisory role to the project team. We cannot state strongly enough how important it is to build a model for a neighborhood- centered , church-based prevention program. The churches in our community serve all people, not just members of our congregation. Community service is a strong mission at all of our churches . \"Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people...\" Galatians 6:10 The Health Resources Community Collaboration is pleased that the HSCRC is taking action to address the serious problem of diabetes in our communities.

JHCP o ffers primary care and specialt y services to patients throughout Maryland. Indeed, a l arge proportion of the attribu table population for the regional partnership hospitals (Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins Ba yview Medical Center, Howard County General Hospital, and Suburban Hospital) receive primary medical care at nearby JHCP community sites. Despite the l arge patient population followed by JHCP primary care physicians, there is currentl y no DSMT program offered at any of our community-based clinic sites. Considering that the maj ority of patients with diabetes in the Johns Hopkins Health System are cared for by primary care physic ians rather than diabetes s pecialists, this represents a significant clinical c are gap, which we are excited to address. In Year 1 of this proposal, JHCP is eager to explore one of more of these strategies to enhance our patients' access to DSMT services: Engaging with our primary care phys icians to identify current b arriers to DSMT referral and proposing solutions Recruiting qualified certified diab etes care and education spec ialists (CDCES) to provide services in JHCP locations Arranging for existing CDCES staff in other JHHS sites to provi de remote or in-clinic DSMT instruction at our JHCP locations Assisting in the development of marketing materials to increase JHCP provider and patient awareness of DSMT services Identifying additional communit y resources to increase awarenes s of local DSMT programs, including barber shops, be auty salons, faith-based organizations, YMCAs, or civic organizations near our clinic locations Conducting community health fairs and/or diabetes expos at our clinic sites We identified that a large per centage of the t arget population for this proposal receives care at one of our JHCP sites. Based on our preliminary review data, the following JHCP clinic sites would be interested in receiving D SMT services, either as expansion sites or by having existing DSMT staff brought to these cl inics on a rota ting basis: 85Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, Inc.

Founded in 2013, Centro SOL has many longstanding partnerships with community organiz ations in the Latinx community, including the Latino Providers Network, Comi t\u00e9 Latino de Baltimore, Esperanza Center and several faith -based organizations. In 2015 Centro SOL piloted the D iabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in Spanish in partnership with a local school . Pilot participants were local Latino immigrants who faced comp eting demands on their time and a lacked an understanding of diabetes and its seriousness. As such , we encountered challenges with recruitment and retention. Our experience taught us that to ensure success we needed to culturally and linguistically tailor the program to serve the growing Latino population in our city which is a new destination for Latino immigrants . The Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partnership provides an excellent opportunity for us to share what we learned from piloting the Spanish l anguage D iabetes Prevention Program , to tailor the program for Latino immigrants in new destinations and for immigrants elsewhere and thereby increase the reach of the DPP to Latin os In support of this application, Centro SOL commits faculty and staff tim e for further tailoring of the Nationa l DPP for the Latin o population , and we will work closely with the Brancati Center on implementation of the National DPP. In addition, we will provide wraparound support from our bilingual community health workers to ad dress barriers participants may have to program enrollment and completion. Centro SOL is eager to partner with the Brancati Center to expand access to the DPP. Latinos bear a disproportionate burden of diabetes and deserve access to proven prevention programs. The proposed project capitalizes on the combined strengths and expertise of our two Centers to better serve the local community with the aim of reducing h ealth disparities.

Priority Partners is the largest Maryland Medicaid managed care organization and is jointly owned by Johns Hopkins HealthCare LLC (JHHC) and Maryland C ommunity Health Systems (MCHS). Priority Partners services over 300,000 members throughout the state of Maryland. We have more than 20,000 primary care providers and specialists in our network and we lead the industry in quality and member satisfaction among large plans. At Priority Partners, we are very interested in effective programs that can help our members, especially targeted approaches that reduce unnecessary future acute care use and promote preventive care which supports keeping people healthy. In my role as Sr. Director at Priority Partners, I have been involved in programs to scale -up effective interventions such as the Maryland Diabetes Prevention Program demonstration grant through the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) which taught members within the targeted audience to lower their risk for diabetes or prevent diabetes. This program was part of the national demonstration proj ect to determine if Medicaid would cover diabetes prevention across the nation. PPMCO collaborated with the Johns Hopkins Brancati Center in the Medicaid Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Demonstration Project which laid the groundwork for Medicaid reimbursement for the DPP in Maryland. During that project, we worked closely with the Brancati Center, meeting at least weekly, to support the enrollment and retention of Priority Partners members in Brancati Center DPPs in the Baltimore Metro area. We were ext remely pleased with the results; nearly 60% of those who attended 3 DPP sessions finished the entire yearlong program, and those 31 PPMCO members lost an average of 5.2% of their baseline weight by 12 months. Specific to this application, we are pleased to continue our partnership with the Brancati Center. Priority Partners is committed to identifying and referring eligible members to diabetes prevention programs in all catchment areas established under this grant. We wish the best of luck on this application and hope to work with you on this important initiative. Sincerely, Kathy Pettway, MAS AR MSTRONG INSTITUTE FOR PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY Ms. Tequila Terry, MPH, MBA Deputy Director, HSCRC July 8, 2020 Dear Ms. Terry, T he Armstrong Institute's Diabetes Clinical Community is delighted to provide this letter of support for the Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partners hip's DSMT proposal. Formed in 2013, our Diabetes Clinical Community is self- governing network in the Johns Hopkins Health System comprised of physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, registered dieticians, certified diabetes educators, pharmacists, and primary care physicians who have an interest in improving outcomes and experiences for our patients with diabetes. Our Clinical Community reports directly to the Vice President of Quality of the Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS), and has decision-making authority for health system- wide diabetes-related protocol and policy changes. Given the important focus of this proposal \u2014 increasing patient access to diabetes self-management education and support services \u2014 our team is well-positioned to assist the DSMT program's leadership in the development and implementation of DSMT programs throughout JHHS. Since Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Howard County Hospital, and Suburban Hospital are all represented in the Diabetes Clinical Community, we will leverage our existing partnerships to facilitate collaboration, sharing of best practices, marketing, and implementation of new protocols to ensure that patients receiving DSMT have similar experiences across all of our clinical sites. We have a proven track record of successful programmatic implementation across our four JHHS partner hospitals. Our interdisciplinary team has developed and implemented ambulatory diabetes medication \" smartsets \" in Epic, a comprehensive tableau dashboard to compare diabetes clinical outcomes (e.g. glycemic control, length of stay, readmissions) across the health system, standardized hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia protocols in the inpatient setting, and electronic insulin dosing decision support tools. In addition, we have served as champions in JHHS to advocate for additional diabetes related resources at our hospitals and clinic sites. Dr. Nestoras Mathioudakis, who will be the DSMT Director for this proposal, serves as co- lead of our Clinical Community . Dr. Mi hail Zilbermint, who is also co-lead of our Clinical Community, will serve as the physician champion for DSMT at Suburban Hospital. Their joint leadership which will help to synergize the work of this intervention with existing quality and systems work in our health system. Considering the high prevalence of diabetes in Baltimore city and the surrounding areas, we believe that this partnership has the potential to make an important impact in the lives of our patients by increasing access to this proven effective intervention. Our team is committed to this effort, and we support this proposal with the highest level of enthusiasm possible.

Their planned work is vitally important to the comm unities we serve in Baltimore. The members of Baltimore CONNECT are enthusiastic about working with the Partnership as members of the team. I served as Principal Investigator of the PCORI funded research project (CD-12-11-4948) \"Reverse innovation and patient engagement to improve quality of care and patient outcomes.\" A specific aim of the study was to create a network of community based organizations, neighborhood associations and churches to link more closely with the Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS). The project led to the creation of Baltimore CONNECT (Community -based Organizations Neighborhood Network: Enhancing Capacity Together) , a network of community- based organizations, faith based institutions and neighborhood associations. When the grant ended, an unusual thing happened: Baltimore CONNECT continued to exist as a 501c3 organization. The continued mission is to enhance communication and build relationships between the health system and the community. I remain in a leadership role as Execu tive Director/Board President. Baltimore CONNECT now includes representatives from over 25 community organizations across Baltimore, as well as members from acros s the Johns Hopkins community. We have met at least monthly since our inception to build and expand a self-sustained, active network to better serve the residents of Baltimore. We have an additional focus on service and research projects to address specific community -identified needs. We have provided guidance to many research teams and faculty. 92 In my role as a general internist practicing in East Baltimore, I am continually aware of the great and disproportionate impact that diabetes has on people in Baltimore City . Baltimore CONNECT will commit to connecting the Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partnership with Baltimore community leaders. S everal of the proposed community partners are members of Baltimore CONNEC T and will be enthusiastic about continuing to work together. I look forward to working with the Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partnership team. Please allow me to emphasize one last time: this work is crucial to the health and well- being of the people of Baltimore. Without it, we will not be able to take full advantage of the close partnership with community leaders that is so important in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Sincerely, Albert W.

Monument Street, Suite 2- 518 Baltimore, MD 21287 RE: Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partnership Dear Felicia , We write in support of the Baltimore Metro Diabetes Regional Partnership project . As the faculty co -leader s of the Patient Engagement Program (PEP), we want to express our enthusiasm for this project that will address a critical need in Maryland and our willingness to participate as partner s in providing training and program development services to ensure achievement of the grant goals. PEP has significant previous ex perience collaborati ng with regional partnerships, including Johns Hopkins Community in Health (JCHiP) , Community Health Partnership of Baltimore (CHPB), and the Howard County Health Partnership. These collaborations have resulted in improvement in partner ship providers and staffs communication and relationship- building skills to deliver higher quality patient -centered care and increase patient engagement in care. Through our involvement in prior regional partnerships and our work with other health care org anizations and institutions, PEP has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program that includes web -based programming, live skills workshops, and multi -modal skills maintenance activities as well assessment of learner knowledge, skill and att itude change . In the current project, we propose a multi -level provider education and training approach. We have found offering various levels of training and maintenance activities depending on the responsibilities of providers, clinics and departments to be very useful and increase the feasibility and participation in the program. The PEP program is u sed by Johns Hopkins Health System entities and by health care companies and institutions nation -wide. Our evaluation studies consistently show that partic ipating in PEP training is associated with significant improvements in relationship -building and communication skills that motivate patients to engage in chronic illness self -management behaviors. Previous research has shown that merely making services available does not lead to adequate levels of patient engagement and participation . Providers across the care continuum need to have the skills to engage patients effectively. Unfortunately, many past projects have not adequately address ed the provider com ponent in program implementation. We strongly support this projects efforts to provide wrap around services to reduce barriers to patient participation and provide education and training to improve provider engagement and their ability to engage enroll and retain patients in programs that have proven effectiveness. In the context of this grant, we be pleased to collaborate to develop provider- facing referral processes and provider- facing and patient -facing education materials around referrals to DPP and DSMT. We will also well prepared to provide grant staff with training and support in effective provider-patient communication to increase referrals, enrollment, and completion rates in DPP and DSMT. We l ook forward to working with you on this exciting and important project.

On behalf of the board running the Joint Venture store, we are excited to serve as a comm unity partner in the Baltimore Metropolitan Diabetes Regional Partnership's Diabetes Self -Management Training (DSMT) initiative . This important initiative by Johns Hopkins Medicine and Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS) in partnership with the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) is focused on improving patient access to diabetes self -management training (DSMT) services within their own communities. Both Walgreens and Johns Hopkins Medicine recognize the value of this initiative and are excited to explore potential strategies to leverage the hundreds of Maryland Walgreens stores to expand the reach of this clinical service within the communities served by the regional partner hospitals. Walgreens and Johns Hopkins Health System have a long -standing history of collaboration, with creation of a joint venture Walgreens store adjacent to the Johns Hopkins Hospital East Baltimore Campus (900 N. Washington Street) in 2009. This partnership was started by Dr. Fred Brancati and Dr. Jay Rosan (VP at Walgreen s) as a consulting agreement in four areas: Clinical framework review, in which Hopkins provided oversight of clinical guidelines and algorithms used in Walgreens healthcare clinics Research program incubation Development of training programs for Walgreens employees Clinical program development, such as new delivery models and creation of linkages across organizations The joint venture store opened in November 2013, and has been used by clinicians affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Brancati Center for the Advancement of Community Care. Although Walgreens' pharmacists do not currently provide acute care services or diabet es self -management training, with this important initiative, we recognize an opportunity to leverage our existing partnership, qualified healthcare professionals, and in- store clinical spaces to promote awareness of diabetes and increase access to important diabetes self - management training. We understand that the first year of this regional partnership will be devoted to securing community and clinical partners and solidifying the DSMT interventions. We are supportive of exploring three possible models as a community partner: Train Walgreens pharmacists to become certified diabetes educators, enabling them to provide and bill for DSMT services directly in Walgreens community pharmacy locations as American Diabetes Associated (ADA) accredit ed DSMT sites. DSMT services are reimbursed by the Medicare and Medicaid Services if delivered in clinical settings such as Walgreens. Hire and support (through the grant budget) a full -time certified diabetes educator to build a DSMT program at the curren t joint venture location in East Baltimore, and help to grow the program at other Walgreens locations. Assign Hopkins clinical DSMT staff to staff Walgreens clinic locations, beginning with the flagship East Baltimore location. Use existing clinic and meeting rooms to provide one -on-one and group DSMT instruction. Walgreens stores provide a large number of diabetes testing supplies, such as glucose meters, urine ketone test strips, and point -of-care hemoglobin A1C test kits. With this partnership, there is an opportunity to develop training videos and informational materials to link diabetes self -management education directly to the supplies sold in our stores. In addition, the Walgreens website offers tools, resources, and education related to diabetes. One such service, \"Pharmacy Chat,\" allows patients to get confi dential answers to general health and medication questions. These services could be expanded to include vetted diabetes self - management training materials developed by the DSMT regional partners. In addition, we are interested in exploring the possibility of using telehealth to deliver DSMT services remotely by our certified pharmacists. Linking the Walgreens website to the DSMT regional partner website is another approach that can help diabetes patients to identify their closest ADA accredited DSMT progra m. We look forward to partnering actively with our collaborators at Walgreens to explore these and other innovative approaches to improving the health of the communities we serve. Sincerely, Mark A. Cochran, PhD Executive Director Johns Hopkins Medicine Johns Hopkins HealthCare Solutions "}
