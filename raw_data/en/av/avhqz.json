Appendicitis (uh-pen-duh-SY-tis) is inflammation of the appendix. The appendix is a small, narrow outpouching of the large bowel in the lower-right belly. Appendicitis can happen at any age. It is most common in school-aged children and teens. An inflamed appendix may burst if not removed. This can spread infection around the belly and lead to more serious medical problems. Call your doctor right away or bring your child to our [Emergency Department](/clinics/emergency-department/) if they have belly pain that is severe or that lasts more than a few hours. - Most often, appendicitis happens when the inside of the appendix is blocked by: - Small, solid pieces of poop (stool) or other material from the bowel - Swelling caused by viruses Appendicitis at Seattle Children's We have treated thousands of children with appendicitis. Seattle Children's doctors have the experience to tell this illness from other problems that cause the same symptoms. Each year our surgeons perform hundreds of procedures to treat appendicitis.

Diagnosing Appendicitis It can be hard to tell if appendicitis is the reason for belly pain. The doctor will: - Ask about your child's symptoms. - Check your child's belly for tender spots. - Test your child's blood and pee (urine). - Do an ultrasound. This avoids exposing your child to the radiation in X-rays and CT (computed tomography) scans./li> Treating Appendicitis Surgery to remove the appendix is the most likely treatment, but some children are treated with antibiotics alone. The surgery is called an appendectomy. Your child does not need an appendix and can lead a healthy life without it. Most often, surgeons operate soon after a child is diagnosed. Before surgery, we will give your child medicine to make them sleep and not feel pain (general anesthesia). The surgery takes about an hour. Your child may need a nasogastric tube, which passes through the nose into the stomach. This helps prevent vomiting and keeps your child's stomach empty so their bowels can rest. We remove the tube when your child is ready to eat. - If your child's appendix did not burst, they will stay in the hospital long enough to recover from the surgery. Most often this means overnight but some children go home later the same day. At home your child will be able to eat and drink normally and return to normal activity with a few days. - - Doctors may delay surgery so they can give antibiotics first. - Your child will stay in the hospital 3 days or longer to heal from the surgery and treat the infection. - They will get antibiotics and fluids through an IV as they heal. - They will not be able to eat or drink right after surgery. - Before you leave the hospital, we will: - Teach you how to care for your child's incision by keeping it clean and dry until it heals - Explain what kinds of food or medicine to give your child - Tell you if you need to limit your child's activity Follow-up care depends on your child's condition: - If their appendix burst, the surgeon will see your child in 1 to 3 weeks. - If their appendix did not burst, a general surgery nurse will call you at home about 5 days after surgery to see how your child is doing. - If your child is doing well at these visits, no further follow-up is needed.
