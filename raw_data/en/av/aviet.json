Acupuncture is a holistic approach to healing with roots that date back over 2,500 years. In China, acupuncture is an integral part of their health care system and is used in conjunction with allopathic medicine. The goal of the acupuncturist is to bring the \"Chi\" or \"life force\" of their patient into balance by stimulating the body. This is accomplished by the use of one or more of the following: acupuncture needles, moxabustion (a form of heat therapy), cupping, tui na (Chinese massage), diet and lifestyle recommendations and raw herbs or herbal formulas. How Does It Work? The theory of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) allows that the human body has a natural rhythm and flow of Chi through channels called meridians. There are 14 main meridians, 8 extra ordinary meridians and hundreds of acupuncture points. When there is a disruption to the flow or rhythm of a person's Chi, the disease process begins to show its effects. The causes of the disruption are many and usually complex in their origins. The categories of where these disruptions come from are physical, mental, chemical and spiritual sources. Dr. Jeffrey will work with you to bring your Chi back into balance. What To Expect? The first visit will involve filling out a through patient intake form, consultation, examination that may involve taking your pulse, palpating (feeling) for ashi (tender) points, looking at the tongue and the treatment. Dr. Jeffrey uses disposable thin needles for your comfort. You will rest with the needles in for about 20 minutes to allow the treatment to accomplish its balancing of the body's energy. The number of treatments will vary depending on the type of problem, severity and your health. Usually you are seen one to two times a week until the problem is resolved. In most cases you can expect noticeable improvement no later than the third treatment. The number of treatments usually required to resolve most cases are from three to twelve treatments. The sensations felt from the needles depend on the points used and vary from person to person. The most common sensations are one of the following: dull, achy, tingling, electrical, sharp, and warmth. Most patients find the treatment very relaxing and some actually fall into a deep sleep during the treatment. Health Benefits The most common cases that come into the clinic for acupuncture are pain related such as neck pain, low back pain, sciatica, nerve related pain and musculoskeletal injuries. Dr. Jeffrey has successfully treated his patients for migraines, sinusitis, allergies, common cold and flu, menstrual problems and nausea using acupuncture. Acupuncture can be very effective for pregnant women experiencing extreme nausea (hyperemesis gravidarum). In some cases this condition can be so severe that expecting mothers have to be hospitalized. Dr. Jeffrey has great success with his patients that are pregnant and experiencing nausea. "}
