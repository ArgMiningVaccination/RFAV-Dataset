Patience is a virtue we have still not mastered the art of. It is believed that Ayurveda is an expensive affair but so is allopathy. If we are willing to shed a fortune on a bypass surgery then why not spend half the money on a recreational therapy that will guarantee the elimination of the ailment from its root?\", asks Ram. The system of Ayurveda he asserts is \"not superficial but comes with permanent and effective results.\" Agrees Niika Quistgard, Founder and Director Rasa Ayurveda Traditional Healing Centre for Women, Kerala and says, \"People are often dissatisfied with allopathic medicines and are wary of the side-effects of drugs; natural alternatives and organic methods of healing are the preferred options.
