Contact us at 734-995-3200 or visit us at 4201 Varsity Drive, Suite A, Ann Arbor, MI 48108: Bio Energy Medical Center", "sitename": "bioenergymedicalcenter.com", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "How is Bio Energy Medical Center different from a conventional medical practice? Bio Energy Medical Center is a holistic center focusing on total physical and mental health. We treat \"illness at its source\". Our ultimate goal is to facilitate your innate healing capacity and lead you to true wellness with an individually tailored therapeutic program that's specific to your health needs. Bio Energy Medical Center's services include Acupuncture, Classical Homeopathy, Detoxification, IV-Therapy, Bio Identical Hormone Replacement Therapy, Children's Health, Weight Loss and Infertility. We use a variety of specialty lab tests, energy tests, and live blood cell analysis to identify the core clinical imbalances that are contributing to your health problems. We assess your nutritional status and vitamin levels, digestive health and detoxification capacity, mitochondrial function, adrenal stress and more. At Bio Energy Medical Center we spend the time needed to understand you and discover the root cause(s) of your health concerns. We offer longer visit times than a conventional practice. We never double book patients and set aside time specifically for you. Many conventional offices have a high patient volume with office visits often scheduled for only 5-10 minutes seeing 6-12 patients per hour. We schedule new patient visits for one to two hours and follow up visits for 30-60 minutes. We run our business with respect for your time and do not leave you sitting in the waiting room for long periods of time only to move you to an exam room to wait again. How do Bio Energy Medical Center's treatments succeed when others don't? Most physicians are trained to diagnose disease and treat the symptoms of that disease rather than treat its cause. At Bio Energy Medical Center, we look underneath the symptoms to find the root cause. We believe that symptoms are a warning sign of an underlying problem in the body. Frequently, medicine treats conditions by suppressing the symptoms. We treat the source of the problem in the body, not just the symptoms. Bio Energy Medical Center has had great success in dealing with problems other health practitioners have given up on. This is the level at which we treat. In essence, we help the body detoxify itself of poisons that cause symptoms instead of just building up the immunity to handle the most current stressor. We look at health from the holistic view point. As well as your physical symptoms, we take into account your mental and emotional states. Why should I use Bio Energy Medical Center? If you are totally satisfied with your current treatment progress and your practitioners, we advise you to stay with them. However, if you have been told your condition is untreatable, psychosomatic, age related, you can't stand the side effects or you're looking for more natural healing\u2014we invite you to consider Bio Energy Medical Center. What kind of conditions do you treat? We treat acute and chronic illnesses and conditions\u2014heart disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, pain, low back or abdominal pain, neuropathy, vertigo, tinnitus, infertility, hypertension, depression or anxiety, hormone imbalances, injuries, medication side effects, childhood epidemics of Autism, learning disorders, A-D-H-D, asthma, eczema, obesity, reflux, allergies and many other medical conditions. Bio Energy Medical Center identifies the underlying issues beneath each patient's diagnosis, and then designs a treatment plan to address the specific causes. Do I need to be seen by the doctor or nurse practitioner to use any of your services? No. For many of our services, patients can simply schedule an appointment and come in for the service/services (acupuncture, homeopathy, darkfield, EMAP testing, BEMER, etc.). Some of our services do require that you be seen, and medical necessity or supervision is required (services that such as blood testing, IV therapy, and medication therapy). How long is the wait to get an appointment? The wait to see Dr. Neuenschwander and our nurse practitioners generally runs three to four months; however, they do have a cancellation list that allows many patients to get in earlier to consult with them. Our other providers can usually accommodate appointments within a few days. What can I expect at my first visit? We believe that the time spent with our patients is one of the most important aspects of our care. We spend the time necessary to understand your unique physical, emotional, psychological, social and spiritual needs. Treatment plans are carefully devised to meet your unique needs, and thorough follow-up is ensured through office visits or telephone consultations. Treatment plans are guided by a thorough and comprehensive history, and review of pertinent blood, urine, stool, or other testing. Please allow at least 90 minutes for your first appointment. If you are coming for a consultation for a particular health concern(s), your provider will carefully review your new patient questionnaire and any past medical records which you have provided. It is very important that you fill out your questionnaire thoroughly as this will maximize the time that you have with your provider. After assessing your health needs, your provider may recommend dietary modifications, nutritional supplements, or additional testing. How often do I need to be seen? The first follow-up visit is generally scheduled for 4-6 weeks after the initial visit to review any lab work that has been performed, to assess your progress on your current therapeutic plan, and make adjustments as necessary. Subsequent follow-ups will be determined by your provider based on individual care needed. If you are taking any prescription medications or have blood work done, you will need to be seen at least every six months for follow up in our office. How much do consultations cost? Our fees are very reasonable for the care you desire and deserve. The fee is determined on complexity, length of time, and severity of the condition. Our office visit fees range from $140.00 to $600.00. In general, the fees are on average $280.00-$400.00 per hour. We have an obligation to be profitable in order to remain open. We intentionally set our fees at a reasonable level to make this office affordable. We encourage you to contact other offices to inquire what they charge for 30-60 minutes of time with their providers. Part of our fee schedule is a no-show fee/late cancellation fee (50%-100% of charges). We require two business days' notice for appointments with Dr. Neuenschwander and our nurse practitioners and 24 hours for all other providers to avoid charges. Do you accept insurance? As of October 1, 2021 BEMC will no longer participate with any insurance plans with the exception of Medicare. We are sorry for the hardship this will cause for many of our patients, but we can no longer play with their constantly changing rules and requirements. Most people find their way to our practice because \"doing what everyone else is doing\" is not working for them. The insurance companies want us to do what everyone else is doing to pay us for our services. We will not submit to any insurance plans except for Medicare. We will provide you with a detailed receipt that you can submit to try and obtain reimbursement for the office visit charges. What type of testing do you do and what is the cost? Bio Energy Medical Center's testing is used to identify core clinical imbalances that are contributing to your health problems. Testing may be used to assess nutritional status, digestive health, amino acids, fatty acids, organic acids, oxidative stress, vitamin levels, hormones, detoxification capacity, mitochondrial function, food sensitivities, neurotransmitter levels, adrenal stress, cholesterol and heavy metal toxicity. Tests may be run on urine, stool, blood, or hair. Your therapeutic plan and nutritional supplementation will be customized based on your test results. Your provider will determine which tests may be most appropriate for you. Taking into account how much testing you would like to do and your financial resources - an individualized testing plan will be devised. The cost of tests varies significantly. Some tests can be run through a standard lab that is likely to be covered through your insurance company. Other testing may need to be run through specialized labs, some of which may be covered or partially covered by your insurance. Costs for individual tests range between $50-$2600. Testing can provide a more complete picture of your health status and help determine appropriate therapies. Please understand that effective care may be initiated without testing and testing can be done gradually over time. Do you use nutritional supplementation? Where can I purchase recommended supplements? Based on a thorough history of your health concerns, physical examination, and appropriate lab testing, your provider will determine a customized therapeutic plan for you. This may include nutritional supplements, herbal medicines, therapeutic diets, lifestyle modification, and drugs when appropriate. Nutritional supplementation, customized to the individual needs of each patient, is often an important part of your treatment plan. Our providers continually research nutritional supplements to be able to provide our patients guidance about the highest quality supplementation available. Some of these supplements are available in local stores or on the web, while some are only available through practitioner offices. As a convenience to our patients, we offer for sale many of the most common supplements recommended. They are of high quality and offered at the standard retail price. We are not able to compete with large companies and websites who can buy in large bulk at deeper discounts. We encourage you to do your research on the quality of the products you purchase outside our recommendations. If you are running low on supplements you have purchased at Bio Energy Medical Center, you may come by the office during normal business hours to pick them up\u2014or we would be happy to ship them to you. Can Dr. Neuenschwander be my primary care doctor? In general, we encourage people to keep a relationship with a primary care doctor for the following reasons\u2014Dr. Neuenschwander does not have a hospital practice/admitting privileges, is not available for urgent appointments, is an out of network provider for all insurances, and is not set up to do routine screenings or specialty referrals often found in the traditional world of medicine. Some patients\u2014who are willing to see the nurse practitioner for acute visits, find referrals on their own or through their insurance company, are willing to be admitted to a hospital using an on call doctor if needed, and pay the higher out of network fees\u2014we will provide primary care. Does Allopathic medicine differ from Homeopathic medicine? Yes\u2014Allopathic medicine is medicine in high concentration designed to suppress symptoms and is noted for its fast response in emergency situations. Repeated use can build up toxins and cause side effects. Homeopathic medicines are ultra-low dilutions and assist in detoxing the body of root causes of illness. They typically are slower acting because they help rebuild tissue systems. Are there any special considerations in taking homeopathic medicine? Yes. Please observe the following when taking homeopathic medicine: - The mouth should be clean and free of food, gum, toothpaste, and other substances for at least 20 minutes prior to taking a remedy. (However, if a first-aid emergency arises, administer the remedy immediately.) - Avoid handling the tablets or pellets. Tap them out of the container and into the cap. Then pour them directly into the mouth. Be mindful not to breathe into or lick the cap. - Let the remedies dissolve in the mouth, preferably under the tongue. Do not swallow or chew. - To allow for complete absorption, do not place anything in the mouth for 20 minutes after the remedy has dissolved. - While taking a remedy, avoid the following products which may interfere with effectiveness: caffeine (coffee, chocolate, colas, and teas); all camphor products (such as lip balms, body rubs, skin care products); mint, menthol and eucalyptus products (such as herbal teas, mint toothpaste, muscle ointments); and strong medications, drugs, and local pain killing injections (such as dental work). - Do not transfer remedies to other containers. Store them away from strong odors; keep them away from magnets, electrical equipment and x-rays (TB's microwaves, computers). Electromagnetic fields may destroy homeopathics. - Alcohol-based homeopathics are the most efficient way to take homeopathics because the remedy is absorbed directly into the bloodstream. The amount of alcohol in 10 drops is minimal. If you are concerned with taking alcohol, giving it to a small child or alcohol sensitive person, simply place the drops in a small amount of lukewarm water. The alcohol will evaporate and you will still get the benefit of the remedy. What can I do to ease the detoxing? Detoxing helps every organ, tissue and cell in our body. Detoxing helps the immune system and it's supporting organs by dramatically reducing the detoxification and cleanse workload that they would have to otherwise carry out on their own. This gives the immune system more time and resources to for tissue repair, and fighting diseases. As each type of tissue or organ is detoxed within our body, we are going to notice a significant change in the way we feel. This feeling, called the healing reaction (or cleansing effect), is often a positive feeling from detoxing. However the feeling can also be a temporary uncomfortable feeling until our body has adapted to having so much less toxins. Imagine that, our tissues and organs inside our bodies are so use to living in a highly toxic environment that we actually have to get used to having less toxins in our body! In the process of detoxifying, the body dumps the toxins into the blood stream for elimination. If the body is physically stressed and not fully hydrated, the dumped toxins may exceed the body's ability to eliminate them. When that happens, you may notice discomfort, an increase in symptom level or old symptoms recurring. If you start to notice symptoms increasing with discomfort, you need to increase your toxin elimination or decrease your toxin dumping. You can increase your toxin elimination by drinking eight to ten 8 oz. glasses of water daily, having colonics, coffee enemas, wheat grass implants, dry saunas, and extra rest. If you are not having at least two bowel movements per day, you are constipated and are increasing your toxicity. One teaspoon of Phyllium Seed Bulk with 8-16 oz. of water will increase and ease your stooling. If your symptoms are discomforting, you can decrease your toxin dumping by stopping your homeopathic medication for a day or until the symptoms recede. Then restart your remedies at \u00bd the dose, gradually increasing to the original prescription. Our slogan, \"Gain Without Pain\", applies. Discomfort means you are dumping toxins faster than you are eliminating them. If you find yourself still in discomfort with reduced remedies, please contact us for advice. Besides the detoxing symptoms above, you can also experience shifts in emotions, like anger or melancholy. This occurs rarely when taking new remedies for the first time. If these feelings are not tolerable, stop taking the remedies for a day and restart them the next. If unwanted emotions persist, please call "}
