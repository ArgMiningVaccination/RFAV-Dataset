We mark days with sunrise and nights with sunsets because they're powerful natural events that affect most things on our planet, including our spirits. That's why full moon nights overwhelm us; new moon nights make us feel ready. So, what's the \"best time\" for spiritual healing work? The best time for spiritual healing with scent, sound, crystals, thoughts, and other spiritual techniques is sunrise, sunset, new moon, full moon, supermoon, eclipse, celestial events, special days, and instinct. Syncing yourself to the rhythms of the world will put you into resonant with the natural world. Today we'll learn about the importance of different times of the day so you can use these special times to play singing bowls, meditate, practice yoga, do Reiki, or do crystal healing. The Importance of Different Times Of Day in Spirituality Most religions worldwide consider day and night important to the story of creation. From Jewish to Christian, Islamic, Hindu, Sikh, and Zoroastrian faiths, natural light is considered sacred in all sects. Light, daylight, Sun, and mornings often represent light or positivity. Furthermore, night, midnight, and dusk indicate darkness or negativity. More importantly, the day begins with night and vice-versa. Moreover, different days of the week have different energies associated with them. For instance, Monday is for clearing the mind, Tuesday is for action, Wednesday is for creativity, Thursday is for gratitude, Friday is for love, Saturday is for setting goals, and Sunday is for meditation or rest. In astrology, each day of the week is associated with a celestial body or planetary God. When Is The Best Time To Play Singing Bowls, Burn Incense, Or Do Spiritual Rituals? Now that you know the importance of different times of the day and days of the week let's look at even more special events that happen once in a few days, weeks, and months. Naturally auspicious times you should use for playing singing bowls, meditation, aromatherapy, or other spiritual practices are: Sun Do you know Sun is believed to be a God in Egyptian, Sumerian, Hindu, Buddhist, and Nordic cultures? Some of the sun gods are Ra (Egyptian), Surya (Hindu), Lugh (Celtic), Mithra (Persian), and Huitzilopochtli (Aztec). Sunrise Sunrise is a special time of the day, so meditating or waking up at this time activates your biological rhythm. But spiritually, sunrise is synonymous with purification, positivity, charging, clarity, birth, rebirth, enlightenment, and joy. Meditating or playing singing bowls in the morning with sun salutations or yoga is a great way to start your day full of positivity. Because sunrise wakes up your biological clock, spiritual practices at sunrise help you stay positive throughout the day. I love setting up my singing bowls, yoga mat, and incense a few minutes before sunrise with the help of a [sunrise calculator and the Time and Date website](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/). Sunset Whether you look in literature, poetry, history, or culture, sunsets are described vividly no matter where. Spiritually, it's a time for transitions, rest, and spiritual journeys. Some believe sunset marks the end of evil or the sign of death and dying. But mostly, sunset is a cathartic switch for reset. If you can watch the sunset without taking your eyes off it, its positivity will imprint on your mind forever. Try to enjoy aromatherapy, meditation, yoga, and self-care time during sunsets to heal from the inside. Moon The moon is also a powerful energy source, but it's different from solar vibrations of purification, amplifying cleansing, and charging. Moreover, there are as many Moon Gods as Sun Gods in history. Some of these are- Shinto (Japanese), Allah (Arabic), Selene/ Luna (Greek), Artemis (Greek), Coyolxauhquie (Aztec), Iz Chel (Mayan), Thoth (Egyptian), Diana (Roman), Sin (Mesopotamian). Full Moon You can focus the powerful energy of the Full Moon on finding your way, purpose, and truth in life. It's a time to take action and do things you've been postponing. Playing large singing bowls that motivate or energize is perfect for full moon night spiritual rituals. New Moon A time for new beginnings, New Moon helps you set realistic goals, manifestations, and ideals in life. It's not a time for action during the Full Moon. So, focusing on your future with meditation, yoga, aromatherapy, and sound healing works well. Supermoon There are 12 to 13 full moons and new moons every year. Out of this, 3 to 4 are supermoons. In plain words, a moon looks super-big or 7% larger than the usual full moon. Spiritually, these are excellent times to clear negativity and evil from your body, mind, and spirit. It makes Empaths feel overwhelmed, excited, conscious, and intuitive. So, moon bathing with singing bowls, herbs, incense, and crystals on supermoon nights is excellent. The last supermoon of 2022 was in August 2022, and the next one will be in August 2023. Eclipse We have seen solar and lunar eclipses with our eyes or on screen. But what do they mean spiritually? Solar eclipses are joyful occasions that spiritual people should use for taking action and setting new milestones. You can meditate or play singing bowls in the open air to focus on the beauty of the cosmos at this time. Lunar eclipses hold the key to scaling your spiritual destiny with purity, wisdom, and enlightenment because they're a time of transition. It's good to meditate or focus inward at this time with scents, candles, incense, crystals, and singing bowls. Celestial Events Do you know how many celestial events happen every year? Roughly 30 meteor showers due appear to us every year, and between 10 and 50 meteorites fall into Earth every day. These energies may be cleansing or disrupting. But they are still important astronomical events. So, how can you harness the energy of celestial events for harmony, peace, meditation, and so on? Simply find a comfortable space and use your singing bowl, yoga mat, and smudge sticks to switch to a meditative state. You can now cleanse or charge your intentions with healing sounds, scents, and thoughts on the celestial event that's happening. New Year and Special days For centuries, different cultures and religions have hosted special days like New Year, Easter, Christmas, Independence Day, Foundation Day, Spring, Leap Day, Father's Day, Mother's Day, and more. Today, every month-end and Friday warranties celebrations. Moreover, different cultures have different New Years' and special occasions to practice spiritual rituals using sound instruments, singing bowls, aromatherapy, crystals, and herbs. Important Events Apart from astronomical and astrological events, special personal days like birthdays, anniversaries, achievements, vacations, homecomings, and housewarmings are perfect for spiritual practice. You can use sage smudge sticks to clear negativity in a new house, like with incense, singing bowls, and crystals. Moreover, meditating with sound and smell before starting a new project or the day can be invigorating and motivating. Whenever You Feel Lastly, you don't need an auspicious time to play the singing bowl. Put simply, whenever your gut says to play it, you should go ahead and do it! Singing bowls, aromatherapy, meditation, and yoga poses are ideal activities to set positive daily routines. So, go ahead and set up a singing bowl altar with all your spiritual goodies. In A Nutshell: When Is The Best Time For Spiritual Healing? Natural events are important in the big picture, however insignificant they look. That's why sunrise activates the biological clock and sunset winds the same clock down for rest and reset. Apart from day and night, there are celestial events like the full moon, new moon, supermoon, or eclipse, as well as important events like the new year, birthday, anniversary, and special days that you can do spiritual work for harnessing positivity. While all these are finite times that are naturally auspicious for healing with sound, scent, or thoughts, you can also rely on your intuition to heal with singing bowls, herbs, essential oils, and incense at any time of day or night. So, what's your favorite time for spiritual healing, meditation, aromatherapy, or singing bowl sessions?
