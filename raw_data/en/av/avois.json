CB1RECEPTOR39 Located mainly in central and peripheral nervous system Effects of CB1are neuromodulatory Inhibits the release of neurotransmitters Mainly Glutamate, GABA brain Also acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and D-aspartate CB2RECEPTOR39 Present mainly on peripheral tissues and central immune cells Activation of this receptor leads to: Immunosuppression Anti-inflammatory Widespread in 2-AGPHARMACOKINETICS & PHARMACODYNAMICS FORMS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA2 Smoked - most common form Capsules Vaporization Edible form Transdermal Suppositories Liquid to drink HOW IS MARIJUANA USED? SMOKED VAPORIZED EATEN/DRUNK Smoked in a pipe, bowl, cigaretteInhaled through machine that converts active compounds into inhalable formConsumed as ingredient in baked goods, candies, sodas, pill form Rapid effects Rapid effectsTakes time to reach brain, so effects are delayed Releases toxins that can cause pulmonary problemsDoes not release toxins that cause pulmonary problemsDoes not release toxins that cause pulmonary problemsPHARMACOKINETICS OF CANNABIS41 Cannabinoids are highly lipophilic and protein bound Rapidly distributed into tissues, especially BBB Peak plasma concentration 3 min after smoking Volume of distribution (Vd) of THC = 10 L/kg Blood concentrations are therefore not directly related to the drug effect The release from the lipid stores along with enterohepatic recirculation accounts for retention of THC ONSET AND DURATION OF CANNABIS Physical and psychosocial effects commence within minutes after use Usually within 15 minutes Peak effects occur within 30 minutes to 60 minutes post-smoking and last 2-4 hours Psychosocial effects can stay for up to 4 to 8 hours depending upon route of administration Oral has a slower onset, but longer durationPSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS Effects do not depend on blood concentration Depends partially on the dose Effects are dose-dependent and route- dependent Lower dose effects: euphoria, relaxation, wide range from exhilaration to introspection, distortion of time and some visual hallucinations, me mory distortions (especially short-term memory), hunger Higher dose effects: anxiety, tension, anger, confusion, hallucinations, paranoia, and panic attacks PHARMACOKINETICS OF SMOKING THC31 Bioavailability: 10-25% 50% of the THC content is delivered into smoke 50% of smoke is exhaled again 60% of inhaled smoke may be metabolized by the lung Peak concentrations are reached within 2-10 minutes T1/2distribution: 0.5hr T1/2elimination: THC31 Bioavailability: 6-20% Usually 1/3 of that smoked due to gastric degradation and extensive first pass metabolism effects High patient variability Can lead to increased toxicities because delayed effect Multiple low peak 11-OH-THC, a potent psychoactive metabolite Rapid conversion in oral administration via first-pass metabolism METABOLISM OF THC44,45,46 THC metabolized by CBD metabolized by CYP2C19 inhibit CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 THC may induce CYP1A2 Only demonstrated in vitro - limited clinical dataPHARMACOKINETICS OF CANNABIS THC can be detected in urine for days after use Terminal half-life up to 4 days in frequent users Passive inhalation - \"second-hand high\" requires very high concentrations of smoke in a small enclosed area Very unlikely DOSE OF THC31 Effective dosing of THC THC exists via the down-regulation of the CB1 receptors High tolerance occurs with chronic use Low tolerance occurs with intermittent use VAPORIZATION Cannabinoids vaporize at a temperature lower than combustion Results in lower percent of noxious chemicals PHARMACODYNAMICS OF THC32 Elevation in heart rate: average >19bpm Increase in subjective feeling high Decrease in subjective alertness Increase in motor instability - body sway PK/PD MODEL OF THC32 In study by Zuuman et al, subjects were given increasing doses (2, 4, 6, 8mg) of THC via vaporizer at 1.5hr intervals PK/PD MODEL THC32 CANNABIS ON HORMONES Males: Decreases luteinizing hormone (LH) Decreases follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) Decreased Prolactin Decreased growth hormone (GH) Females: More sensitive than males to THC effects More estrogen suppression VE SLIDEMARIJUANA EFFECTS ON THE BRAINMARIJUANA EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN Hypothalamus : increased appetite Brain stem : nausea relief, lowered blood pressure, drowsiness, decreased pain, decreased spasticity, and decreased tremor Hippocampus : memory impairment MARIJUANA EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN Cerebral cortex : altered consciousness, perceptual distortions, memory impairment, delusions, hallucinations Cerebellum : loss of coordination Amygdala : changes in anxiety, pain attacks, lowered traumatic memories, decreased hostility USES OF MEDICAL MARIJUANAQUALIFYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS3 Severe and chronic pain Severe and persistent muscle spasms Ex.

the first age group to be considered for medical marijuana A use of medical marijuana in children is the treatment of severe seizures The oil of the cannabis is extracted and used for treatment The long-term effects of early marijuana use in children is not known ADVERSE EVENTS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANAADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MARIJUANA USE17 Chronically smoking marijuana use may cause the following adverse events: Dependence Withdrawal Irritability, depression, insomnia, nausea, obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer Using a vaporizer opposed to smoking may diminish the level of the more toxic components in marijuana Smoking marijuana contains 4 times more tar and 50% more carcinogens than that of tobacco DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF SMOKING34,35 Can lead to respiratory illness One marijuana cigarette causes as many pulmonary problems as 4-10 tobacco cigarettes Increase risk for bronchitis, emphysema, lung cancer Can cause cardiovascular complications Raises blood pressure and heart rate 20-100% 4.8 times risk of hear attack in hour after use EFFECTS IN PREGNANCY36 Increasing evidence that prenatal exposure can lead to: Increased risk of motor, social, and cognitive disturbances Higher rate of low birth weight in infants and childhood leukemia Marijuana has been found in breast milk Avoid when breastfeeding ACUTE TOXICITIES33 Medical marijuana is less lethal than alcohol and many illicit drugs TOXICOLOGY OF CANNABIS Has wide therapeutic index No known direct deaths Implied association with deaths due to underlying health conditions especially arrhythmias/heart attacks Fatal dose is unknown, but implied from animal studies that may be 4000 to 40000 times the highest recreational dose 2017 NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES REPORT2017 NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES REPORT Goal: to develop a comprehensive, in-depth review of existing evidence regarding the health effects (harms and benefits) of cannabis and cannabinoids use Make short and long-term recommendation regarding research agenda to identify the most critical research and advance the cannabis and cannabinoid research agenda 2017 NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES REPORT Between June and December 2016, a committee held 5 in-person meetings and 1 virtual meeting Conducted an extensive search of relevant databases 24,000 articles found Committee considered more than 10,000 abstracts to determine relevance for the report 2017 NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES REPORT 11 prioritized end-points Therapeutic effects Cancer incidence Cardiometabolic risk Respiratory disease Immune function Injury and death Prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal outcomes Psychosocial outcomes Mental health Problem cannabis use Cannabis use and abuse of other substance THERAPEUTICS In adults with chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, oral cannabinoids are effective antiemetics In adults with chronic pain, patients who were treated with cannabis or cannabinoids are more likely to experience clinically significant reduction in pain symptoms THERAPEUTICS In adults with MS related spasticity, short-term use of oral cannabinoids improves patient-reported spasticity symptoms For these condition, the effects of cannabinoids are modest; for all other conditions evaluated there is inadequate information to assess their effects RESPIRATORY DISEASE Substantial evidence of a statistical association between long-term cannabis smoking and worse respiratory symptoms and more frequent chronic bronchitis episodes Moderate evidence of a statistical association between cannabis smoking and improved airway dynamics with acute use, but not with chronic use RESPIRATORY DISEASE Moderate evidence of a statistical association between cannabis smoking and higher forced vital capacity (FVC) Moderate evidence of a statistical association between cessation of cannabis smoking and improvements in respiratory symptoms RESPIRATORY DISEASE Limited evidence of a statistical association between occasional cannabis smoking and an increased risk of COPD when controlled for tobacco use Insufficient evidence to support or refute a statistical association between smoking cannabis and hospital admissions for COPD Insufficient evidence to support or refute a statistical association between cannabis smoking and asthma development or exacerbationINJURY AND DEATH Cannabis use prior to driving increases the risk of being involved in a motor vehicle accident In states where cannabis is legal, there is increased risk of unintentional cannabis overdose injuries among children Unclear whether and how cannabis use is associated with all-cause mortality or with occupational injury CANCER Moderate evidence of nostatistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of lung cancer Moderate evidence of nostatistical association between cannabis use and the incidence of head and neck cancers Limited evidence of a statistical association between current, frequent, or chronic cannabis smoking and non-seminoma-type testicular germ cell tumors CANCER Insufficient evidence to support or refute a statistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of esophageal cancer Insufficient evidence to support tor refute a statistical association between cannabis use and the incidence of prostate cancer, cervical cancer, malignant gliomas, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, penile cancer, anal cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, or bladder cancerCANCER Insufficient evidence to support or refute a statistical association between parental cannabis use and subsequent risk of developing AML/acute non-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL, rhabdomyosarcoma, astrocytoma, or neuroblastoma in offspring CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK Evidence is unclear as to whether and how cannabis use is associated with heart attack, stroke, and diabetesIMMUNITY There exists a paucity of data on the effects of cannabis or cannabinoid-based therapeutics on the human immune system There is insufficient data to draw overarching conclusions concerning the effects of cannabis smoke or cannabinoids on immune competence IMMUNITY There is limited evidence to suggest that regular exposure to cannabis smoke may have anti-inflammatory activity Insufficient evidence to support or refute a statistical association between cannabis or cannabinoid use and adverse effects on immune status in individuals with HIVPRENATAL, PERINATAL, AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES Smoking cannabis during pregnancy is linked to lower birth weight in the infant The relationship between smoking cannabis during pregnancy and other pregnancy and childhood outcomes is unclearPSYCHOSOCIAL Recent cannabis use impairs the performance in cognitive domains of learning, memory and attention Recent use may be defined as cannabis use within 24 hours of evaluation A limited number of studies suggest that there are impairments in cognitive domains of learning, memory, and attention in individuals who have stopped smoking cannabis PSYCHOSOCIAL Cannabis use during adolescence is related to impairments in subsequent academic achievement and education, employment and income, and social relationship and social roles MENTAL HEALTH Substantial evidence of a statistical association between cannabis use and the development of schizophrenia or other psychoses, with the highest risk among the most frequent users In individuals with schizophrenia and other psychoses, a history of cannabis use may be linked to better performance on learning and memory tasks MENTAL HEALTH Cannabis use does not appear to increase the likelihood of developing depression, anxiety, and PTSD For individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorders, near daily cannabis use may be linked to greater symptoms of bipolar disorder than non-usersMENTAL HEALTH Heavy cannabis users are more likely to report thoughts of suicide than non-users Regular cannabis use is likely to increase the risk for developing social anxiety disorderPROBLEM CANNABIS USE Greater frequency of cannabis use increases the likelihood of developing problem cannabis use Initiating cannabis use at younger age increase the likelihood of developing problem cannabis use CANNABIS USE AND ABUSE OF OTHER SUBSTANCES Limited evidence of a statistical association between cannabis use and the initiation of tobacco use Limited evidence of a statistical association between cannabis use and changes in the rates and use pattern of other illicit and illicit substances CANNABIS USE AND ABUSE OF OTHER SUBSTANCES Moderate evidence of a statistical association between cannabis use and the development of substance dependence and/or a substance abuse disorder for substances including alcohol, tobacco, and other illicity drugs CONCLUSIONS There are specific regulatory barriers, including the classification of cannabis as Schedule I substance, that impedes the advancement of cannabis and cannabinoid research Often difficult for researchers to gain access to the quantity, quality, and type of cannabis product necessary to address specific research questions on the health effects of cannabis use CONCLUSIONS A diverse network of funders is needed to support cannabis and cannabinoid research that explores the beneficial and harmful health effects of cannabis use To develop conclusive evidence for the effects of cannabis use on short and long-term health outcomes, improvements and standardization in research methodology are needed REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 1: Address Research Gaps Develop comprehensive evidence on the short- and long- term health effects of cannabis use (beneficial and harmful) Public agencies, philanthropic and professional organizations, private companies, and clinical and public health research groups should provide funding and support for a national cannabis research agenda that address key gaps in the evidence REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 1: Address Research Gaps Prioritized research streams and objective should include Clinical and observational research Health policy and health economics research Public health and public safety research REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 2: Improve research quality To promote development of conclusive evidence on the short and long-term effects of cannabis use, agencies should jointly fund a workshop to develop a set of research standards and benchmarks to guide and ensure production of high-quality cannabis research US Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Institutes of Health REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 3: Improve surveillance capacity To ensure that sufficient data are available to inform research on short and long-term health effects, agencies should fund and support improvements to federal public health surveillance systems and state-based public health surveillance efforts CDC Substance abuse and mental health services administration Association of state and territorial health officials National association of county and city health officials Association of public health laboratories State and local public health departments REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 4: Address Research Barriers CDC, NIH, FDA, industry groups, and nongovernmental organizations should fund the convening of a committee of experts tasked to produce an objective and evidence-based report that fully characterizes the impacts of regulatory barriers to cannabis research Propose strategies for supporting development of resources and infrastructure necessary to conduct a comprehensive cannabis research agenda PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS CLINICAL USESDRONABINOL Also known as marinol FDA-approved Produced by Unimed Pharmaceuticals It is
