K J Kemper Abstract Paediatric use of complementary andalternative medicine is common and in-creasing, particularly for the sickest chil-dren. This review discusses the variousoptions available including dietary sup-plements, hypnosis, massage, chiroprac-tic, and acupuncture. Dis complementary medicine; alternative medicine; holistic medicine; dietary supplement;review Introduction and epidemiology The use of complementary and alternativemedical (CAM) therapies is increasing consid-erably in paediatric as well as adult popula-tions, particularly among the a Zuent and edu- cated. 12Approximately 20-30% of general paediatric patients have used one or moreCAM therapies 23; use among adolescents ranges from 50% to 75%.45Rates among patients with chronic, recurrent, or incurableconditions, such as those with cancer, asthma,rheumatoid arthritis, rangefrom 30% in neonatal andpaediatric intensive care units, report keeninterest in providing CAM to their childrenduring hospitalisation, but often have notdiscussed their interest in or use of CAM withtheir child's physician. 9-11 Paediatricians and medical institutions have struggled to adapt quickly to these rapid shiftsin culture and patient demand. Most medicalschools in the USA and Canada now o Ver at least one course in holistic/complementary/alternative medicine, and the numbers anddepth of these courses are increasingrapidly. 12-17Physicians, including paediatri- cians, report a high (over 50%) rate of usingCAM therapies themselves, 18-20and most phy- sicians provide CAM therapies themselves orrefer patients to CAM providers. 21-26Are physi- cians pandering to patient demands? Or arethere data to suggest that at least for some con-ditions and some therapies, integrative medi-cine to patients andtherapies, respectively. 27Holistic medicine re-fers to caring for the whole patient\u2014body,mind, emotions, and spirit\u2014in the context ofthe patient's and family's values, culture, andcommunity; this is simply another way of stat-ing the highest ideals of conventional medi-cine. 28\"Integrative medicine\" refers to consid- ering a broad range of therapies and selectingthose that have the best evidence of safety andeVectiveness in the context of holistic care. 29 Integrative medicine takes evidence basedmedicine one step further by including consid-eration of allpotential therapies, not simply those that have been part of mainstream medi-cal practice. Treatment goals Nearly every study of the epidemiology ofCAM has underscored the fact that only aminority of patients and families talk with theirphysicians about their use of CAM therapies. 30 If physicians want to know what families doand what they value, a systematic approach isnecessary in taking a history about patients'goals. We consider therapeutic goals in vemajor categories: (1) Curing disease(2) Managing wellness/resilience mising stress/toxins (5) Achieving inner peace and harmony.All of these goals are legitimate. To assess in a meaningful way whether or not a therapy is use-ful, both clinicians and patients must explicitlyunderstand the goal or goals of treatment. Forexample, in treating paediatric oncology pa-tients, acupuncture may be used, not to cure thecancer (goal 1), but to help manage pain andnausea symptoms (goal 2) or to promote a senseof well being (goals 4 and 5). CAM options The term CAM encompasses a wide range ofdisparate therapies that often rely on di Verent philosophies, beliefs, assumptions, and prac-tices. Visits with a homeopathic practitionertypically are lengthy and focus on taking a veryextensive history, while visits with a chiroprac-tor may be quite brief and focused on physicalexamination and adjustment procedures. Inorder to understand and remember the rangeof potential therapies in a clinically useful fash-ion, we consider the range of therapeuticArch Dis Child 2001; 84:6-9 6 Center for Holistic Pediatric Educationand Research,Childrens Hospital,300 Avenue,Boston, MA 02115,USAK J Kemper Correspondence to: Dr Kemperkemper_k@a1.tch.harvard.edu Accepted 23 August 2000 www.archdischild.com on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from options in four major domains: biochemical, lifestyle, biomechanical, and bioenergetic(table 1). Each domain contains several kindsof therapies. For example, biochemical thera-pies include medications as well as vitamins,herbs, and other dietary supplements. Biome-chanical therapies include massage and chiro-practic as well as surgery. Specic conditions and therapies Few clinicians would argue with the tenet thatpatient focused, humane, holistic care is theideal of medicine. Nor would modern physiciansdisagree on the importance of considering arange of treatment options and using anevidence basis to select those most likely to bebenecial and least costly or harmful. Questionsabout the e Vectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine tend to be focused on themerits of individual therapies for specic condi-tions and patients rather than the over archingphilosophical orientation to patient care. For the most part, a great deal more evidence is needed to evaluate claims of safety and e Vec- tiveness of natural therapies compared withmore synthetic medications and surgical ap-proaches. In practice, most paediatricians donot demand rigorous scientic evidence ofsafety or e Ycacy before recommending home remedies such as chicken soup, pepperminttea, or vaporisers for children su Vering from mild, self limited conditions such as upper res-piratory infections. On the other hand, com-mon sense demands that more stringentevidence is required for evaluating the e Vects of more toxic or costly treatments for lifethreatening conditions, particularly if e Vective treatments are already available. As scienticevidence accumulates, therapies considered asCAM may cross the line into mainstream care;this transition appears to be especially easy ifnancial support and professional advocacy areinvolved, for example, marketable products orwell organised practitioners. Dietary supplements Probiotics (for example, yoghurt) have proveneVective in reducing the severity and durationof diarrhoea in healthy children 31-33; many pae- diatricians have begun recommending in-creased yoghurt intake for children su Vering from diarrhoea and as prophylaxis for thosechildren assigned to antibiotic therapy. Healthfood stores are replete with medicinal products(capsules, tablets, and liquids), containinglactobacillus bacteria, that claim to \"supporthealthy intestinal function\" or balance and optimal dosing of such prod-ucts for children remains unknown. For many other dietary supplements (such as using St John's wort to treat depression andechinacea to treat the common cold), 34-36there are no published studies on e Vectiveness for children. Despite the absence of data on paedi-atric safety and e Vectiveness, tremendous eVorts are being made to market paediatricherbal products, enticing parents and pressur-ing paediatricians. Pediatricians are especiallylikely to be cautious about the hazards of thechronic use of herbs. Over the past 40 years,increasing data about the cumulative toxicity ofa herb that had been widely used for medical,religious, and recreational purposes forcenturies\u2014tobacco\u2014support this cautious ap-proach. Recent studies evaluating herb-druginteractions with St John's wort (leading tonotable declines in serum concentrations ofdigoxin and other medications) also suggest theneed for careful review of scientic data beforecasually reassuring patients about usingherbs. 37 Lifestyle therapies: mind-body medicineHypnosis migraines, 38-40chemotherapy associ- ated nausea pain, as several behav-ioural conditions, 41-44yet hypnosis and similar mind-body therapies have widely dis-seminated from behavioural paediatrics to gen-eral paediatric practice nor into specialty areasin which it might be quite useful in reducingprocedure related anxiety and pain. Currentlythere are no signicant market forces (otherthan some patient demand) promoting the useof mind-body therapies. Teaching such prac-tices demands substantial clinician time whichmay be worthwhile over the long term, butpoorly reimbursed in some health care systems.Additional research is needed on evaluating thelong term cost e Vectiveness of mind-body therapies and developing the most e Vective strategies for disseminating proven therapiesinto practice. Biomechanical therapies: massage and chiropracticLike hypnosis, massage has proven helpful intreating several paediatric conditions. Theseinclude low birth weight, pain, decit hyperactivity disorder, anddepression. 45-50Moreover, massage is enjoy- able, safe, and sought after by patients.51Y et, it is seldom among the therapeutic optionsconsidered rst by paediatricians. Historically,massage has been tainted by its link with theadult entertainment industry, and it may beviewed as self indulgent rather than medicallyindicated. Furthermore, as with mind-bodytherapies, the time required to provide services,personnel costs, and questions about long termbenets are signicant barriers to widespreaduse of massage therapies for children.T able on of hands +Prayer and ritual +HomeopathyComplementary and alternative medicine for children 7 www.archdischild.com on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from On the other hand, despite the fact that chiro- practic is one of the most common alternative therapies sought by families, there is a remark-able absence of randomised, controlled clinicaltrials suggesting that it is a signicantly helpfulor cost e Vective therapy for any major paediatric disease. 52 53Unlike hypnosis and massage therapy, chiropractors have formed a strongprofessional community that has e Vectively per- suaded the public to pay for their services. Bioenergetic therapies: acupunctureResearch on acupuncture is nally penetratinginto paediatric practice. Recent studies suggestthat certain children readily accept acupunctureas a potential treatment option, 55and that some acupuncturists specialise in treating children.56 It remains to be seen whether the benets notedin adult patients (for example, in treating painand nausea) are also found in children. 57 58 Although it markets no unique product and hasnot formed an e Vective professional guild, acupuncture has made intriguing inroads intomainstream medicine, and is now provided as atreatment option in approximately one third ofpaediatric pain treatment programmes at aca-demic medical centres in North America. 56The vast majority of paediatric patients/families payout of pocket for acupuncture services, but thirdparty payment for acupuncture is graduallygaining ground. 54 Costs and benetsThere is a widespread assertion that CAMpractices are less expensive than mainstreammedicine and that using such therapies willlower overall health care costs. This assertionposits that CAM therapies would replace moreexpensive mainstream therapies rather thanbeing used in addition to mainstream medi-cine. This assertion has not undergone rigor-ous testing. In fact, recent data suggest thatincluding complementary therapies as treat-ment options increases overall health care costsfor adults because CAM therapies are used as\"add ons\" rather than replacements. 59 60Simi- lar studies have not been reported for children. Summary Paediatric use of complementary and alternativemedical therapies is common and increasing,particularly for the sickest children. In order toanswer the question of whether or not suchtherapies work, it is essential that paediatricianssystematically elicit families' goals and expecta-tions of treatment, be aware of the range oftherapies used, be systematic and specic whenasking about them, and be aware of the complexinterplay among scientic evidence and marketforces governing availability of and payment forCAM therapies. These are the elements, not justof complementary or alternative care, but ofgood paediatric care in the modern era.

STAMPS IN PAEDIATRICS Oleander and yellow oleander are both poi- sonous plants. Accidental poisoning can occurby ingestion (as little as one leaf of the neriumoleander may be lethal in children), by inhala-tion of smoke from burning oleander, or fromthe use of medical preparations from the leavesof oleander which have been used as treatmentsfor malaria, leprosy, venereal diseases, and toinduce abortions. Deliberate poisoning hasbeen recorded in suicide attempts and incriminal cases. The American Association ofPoison Control Centres received 3873 reportsof oleander exposure between 1991 and 1995(Clin Chemistry 1996; 42:1654-8). Oleander is also used as an animal poison, which is bestillustrated by its role as a rat poison. All parts of the nerium oleander are poison- ous, primarily due to the contained is, oleandrin, nerin, digitoxi-genin, and olinerin of which oleandrin is theprincipal toxin. The bark also contains rosa-genin which has strychninelike actions. Theclinical features of oleander poisoning aretherefore similar to digoxin toxicity and includenausea and and lethal brady- andtachyarrhythmias including asystole and ven-tricular brillation. The stamp from Yugoslavia in 1967 which depicts the nerium oleander comes from a sixstamp set illustrating medical plants.
