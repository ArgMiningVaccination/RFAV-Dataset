Given its fragility, nature has compensated for this by endowing mothers with the ability to transfer their immunity onto their baby (called passive immunity) by way of antibodies through breast milk. A mother's breast milk is filled with protective immunoglobulins that work to fight off bacteria and viruses that could be harmful to it. This supports the fact that breastfed babies get sicker much less than formula-fed babies. Interestingly, during pregnancy a mother also passes on helpful antibodies - particularly IgG through the placenta which remain with baby for the first few months of life. From colostrum - mother's first milk - onwards, breast milk is filled with highly beneficial antibodies that a mother's own body has developed in response to her region's specific pathogens. A child's immune system will start to develop on its own at about 2-3 months of age. At this point the antibodies that mother has conferred start to decline. A baby's immune system begins to grow and develop when it comes into contact with bacteria, viruses and fungi and can wage an attack against them. By 1 year of age a baby will have developed its immune system significantly, although not entirely. Some experts suggest an immune system is not fully developed until a child is approximately 12-14 years of age, when they finally reach adult levels of antibody formation. Other experts claim the immune system is developed by the age of 3. Strategies to Boost Baby's Immunity *Breastfeed for as long as possible *Keep baby away from sick individuals *Ensure clean hands when dealing with newborns *Use baby probiotics to ensure a healthy intestinal tract *Ensure the breastfeeding mom is eating a healthy diet *Ensure adequate exposure to sunlight or vitamin D Even if vaccines did not contain dangerous chemicals, the physiology of the baby does not allow for the theory of vaccines to be effective. Whereas most muscles and bones are present at birth and only need to increase in size, our immune system, especially the Thymus gland, does not have the ability to fully function at birth. The thymus gland is responsible for \"training\" our white blood cells how to perform the crucial function of identifying our own cells (Self) from the cells of a harmful invader (Non-Self). It is certain types of our white blood cells which produce the immunoglobulins which are a vital part of our immune system. The thymus for most people is not fully developed until sometime around the age of somewhere between 3-7 years. Hence, giving vaccinations, which are intended to provoke an immune response from our white cells, prior to that time will be largely ineffective for many people. When exposed to a possible pathogenic organism, most infection of childhood diseases takes place through the transmission of fine droplets which get on the child's skin. The classic example is a child with a disease in the contagious phase will sneeze on their own hands and then touch an object such as a table or chair. Another child will also touch that surface, get the moisture on their own hands, and possible wipe their own nose or eat some food without washing their hands. This foreign pathogen then begins to stimulate the child's immune system at each of four levels in order: the skin, the internal mucous membranes in the respiratory tract or GI tract, the Lymph nodes and finally the blood. The bloodstream is considered to be the deepest and most serious level; once a disease makes it to the blood it is considered to have become \"systemic\" - and can be transmitted throughout the body almost instantly. Furthermore, children are generally exposed to only one pathogenic organism at a time. Those pathogens that are strong enough to make it past the body's outer defenses and enter the bloodstream are weakened when they get there, and the body's immune defenses were fully activated at each level. The vaccination process, however, bypasses all the body's outer defenses of the skin, mucous membranes and lymphatic system and injects pathogenic organisms directly into the bloodstream. To make matters worse, most modern vaccinations are multi-valent; that is, they consist of multiple pathogenic organisms, which arrive in the body's bloodstream, at full strength, with NONE of the levels of the immune system activated. These pathogens have the full run of the body until the immune system can respond, which can be days, weeks or even longer, since these vaccinations may have taken place at such an early age that the immune organs needed to mount the response are not fully developed! Furthermore, most of these vaccines contain various preservatives and other contaminants, such as the poison mercury, which can cause their own health problems. Current Risks of Infectious Disease In Western countries with proper nutrition, sanitation and hygiene, the risks of serious side effects, complications or death from the childhood diseases routinely vaccinated against is extremely low. Though the numbers vary from one illness to another, they are all on the order of 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1 million. In third world countries with poor nutrition and sanitation, the numbers are much worse - between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 1,000 may experience a serious case or death. Websites which state these lower statistics as the numbers for the risk of side effects or death among un-vaccinated children are stating the numbers from third-world countries. If you choose to not vaccinate your children it is important to be sure they eat a healthy diet with all the Essential Nutrients and avoid immune suppressing food items like white sugar, candy, sweetened breakfast cereals, sodas and french fries or other junk food cooked in bad fats. Most parents will want to do this anyway when they learn just how un-healthy these over-processed foods really are. I know you guys will be doing this already. Efficacy of Vaccinations Keep in mind the the goal of widespread vaccination programs was, on the surface, very noble - to eliminate infections diseases and the suffering and death they caused in days gone by. As they have been implemented in modern times, however, most vaccinations fall far short of this goal for several reasons. First, Vaccinations do not impart permanent immunity from the diseases they vaccinate against. Most modern studies show that a high percentage of people who were vaccinated as children have no stored immunity by the time they reach adulthood in their late teens or early twenties. When exposed to the diseases at this later age, they usually have a much more serious case of these illnesses, which can be fatal more often than when the diseases are acquired naturally as children. Second, Most epidemic-level outbreaks of the various diseases our society is vaccinating against are taking place among fully-vaccinated children. Even in the short-term, where vaccinations have been effective at reducing disease incidence, the immune effects are not universal and more and more children are getting sick anyway. In other words, children are being exposed to the risks of vaccination without the benefits of either short-term or long-term immunity. In roughly the last 30 years, for example, every case polio in the U.S. has been among previously vaccinated individuals. Third, the risks of side effects from vaccinations now appear to be higher than the risks of serious side effects from the naturally acquired childhood diseases. There still needs to be additional epidemiological research done in this area, but the preliminary findings are pointing in this direction. This will be especially true when the actual long- term side effects of an altered, hypo-functioning or dysfunctioning immune system are included. This will include conditions such as auto-immune diseases and cancer, all of which are now at epidemic levels in the U.S. and elsewhere where vaccinations are widespread. Fourth, the entire philosophy of vaccinations overlooks the crucial importance of actually catching the various childhood diseases as part of the normal development and training of our immune systems. Without ever being properly trained and allowed to exercise itself, we can never be fully certain that our immune system will be able to do its job throughout our lifetimes.

It is important upon arriving you tell the nurse and the doctor both, and make sure you see that they dictate it in your chart, what you do or do not want given to the baby. 1) Hepatitis B vaccine. You do not have hepatitis B. This should only be given to babies born to mothers who are infected, but a lot of hospitals give it routinely. It is my recommendation you do not let them give this vaccine to the baby at the hospital or ever. 2) Antibiotic eye drops to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum (ON). ON is a conjunctivitis or pink eye that occurs during the first month of life and is contracted during birth. The two main causes of ON are chlamydia or gonorrhea, both of which are sexually transmitted infections (Ali, Khadije et al. 2007). If you do not have these infections, the baby should not receive these eye drops. No medication should be given to a healthy baby. The risks include adverse effects include eye irritation and blurred vision, which may interfere with bonding, and widespread use may contribute to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria (Hedbert et al. 1990). The antibiotic can interfere with your baby's immune system. Erythromycin is not 100% effective at preventing ON (it has a 20% failure rate) (Lund et al., 1987). Furthermore, drug shortages happen occasionally. In 2009, there was an erythromycin shortage in the U.S. and providers began using alternative medicines that had never been tested in newborns. One of those medications- gentamicin- was later found to have severe adverse effects in newborns (CDC, 2010). According to NC state laws, your state uses silver nitrate drops. Silver nitrate is no longer used in most developed countries, because it is highly irritating to the eye and can cause severe pain, chemical pink eye, and temporary vision impairment. Silver nitrate is also not effective with infections caused by chlamydia, the most common cause of ON today. According to FL Statute Section 383.04, F.S., specifies that: \"Every physician, midwife, or other person in attendance at the birth of a child in the state is required to instill or have instilled intothe eyes of the baby within 1 hour after birth an effective prophylactic recommended by the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the prevention of neonatal ophthalmia. This section does not apply to cases where the parents file with the physician, midwife, or other person in attendance at the birth of a child written objections on account of religious beliefs contrary to the use of drugs. In such case the physician, midwife, or other person in attendance. Penalties exist for violation of current requirements. 3) Vitamin K injection: The injectable form of vitamin K can rarely cause severe (sometimes fatal) allergic reactions when given by injection into a muscle or vein. Therefore, vitamin K should be injected into a muscle or vein only when it cannot be given by injection under the skin or taken by mouth, or when your doctor has judged that the benefit is greater than the risk. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction such as rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, or trouble breathing.\" If a mom has a diet with good Vitamin K intake (eggs, alphalfa sprouts, etc.) then there would be no reason to consider it. Potential exists for the newborn to experience hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Each milliliter contains: Phytonadione ............. 2 mg fatty acid derivative ................... 70 mg Dextrose...................................................................... 37.5 mg Water for Injection, q.s. .................................................. 1 mL Added as preservative: Benzyl alcohol ...................... 0.9% Birth Exemptions: For those who are planning a hospital birth but want to evade invasive routine post natal procedures such as a Hep B shot, vitamin K injection, newborn screening, or the application of silver nitrate in the newborn's eyes, a very specific birthing plan must be submitted to the hospital in advance of the birth. Hospital staff must be informed, in advance, of your needs, wants and desires where your baby and birthing experience are concerned. The same applies to midwives. Steps: Create the Birthplan. (You can modify already written ones on this website http://www.vaclib.org/exempt/florida.htm) Sign the birthplan in front of a Notary. Submit the birth plan to your hospital or midwife. Keep a couple extra copies in case plans change. Make sure affected parties (doctors, nurses, etc) understand your requirements and wishes. Plan on having one or two trusted persons stay with the mother and child to watch the child at all times while in the hospital, so no unwanted injections are given the baby. The birth plan arrangements and letter should be turned in before delivery date, and bring one to give to staff at the hospital.**************************************************************************** At the baby's two month (only 8 weeks) check up, they will try to force you to give the following vaccines: Rotavirus2(RV)RV1 (2-dose series) - Babies might become irritable, or have mild, temporary diarrhea or vomiting after getting a dose of rotavirus vaccine. It can cause intussusception, a type of bowel blockage that is treated in a hospital, and could require surgery. The baby can have a severe allergic reaction. This vaccine can cause serious injury and death. Diphtheria, tetanus, & acellular pertussis - Babies may suffer fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3), tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10), vomiting (up to about 1 child in 50), fever (up to about 1 child in 4), seizure (about 1 child out of 14,000), non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about 1 child out of 1,000), high fever, 105 degrees Fahrenheit or higher (about 1 child out of 16,000), serious allergic reaction, long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness, and permanent brain damage. Haemophilus influenzae type b5 (Hib) - Risks include fainting and dizziness, severe shoulder pain and difficulty moving the arm, serious injury, death. Pneumococcal conjugate6 (PCV13) - Risks include high fever (103 degrees or higher), seizure (convulsions); wheezing, trouble breathing; severe stomach pain, severe vomiting or diarrhea; easy bruising or bleeding; or severe pain, itching, irritation, or skin changes where the shot was given, crying, fussiness; headache, tired feeling, muscle or joint pain; drowsiness, sleeping more or less than usual; mild redness, swelling, tenderness, or a hard lump where the shot was given;loss of appetite, mild vomiting or diarrhea; low fever (102 degrees or less), chills; or mild skin rash. Inactivated poliovirus7 (IPV:<18 yrs) - Risks include death, severe injury or allergic reaction, soreness, redness, swelling, or itching where the shot was given (30% - 74%),headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, dizziness (5% - 40%), hives, pain in the joints, fever (about 6% of booster doses), and nervous system disorders, such as Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) which causes paralysis. 2nd dose of Hepatitis B vaccine - Risks include aches or pain in the joints, fever, or skin rash or welts (may occur days or weeks after receiving the vaccine), blurred vision or other vision changes, confusion, difficulty with breathing or swallowing, dizziness, faintness, or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position, hives, itching, especially of the feet or hands, muscle weakness, numbness or tingling of the arms and legs, reddening of the skin, especially around the ears, sweating, swelling of the eyes, face, or inside of the nose, unusual tiredness or weakness (sudden and severe), fever, trouble sleeping, weight loss, severe allergic reaction, death. That is 6 vaccines for 8 diseases, all at once to a teeny little baby! The baby doesn't even have a working immune system for a long time, usually not fully funcitonal until age 3! Injecting these into perfect little babies is dangerous. They are very risky and they do not work. If they worked, there would be no reason for multiple booster shots, which they do for the most of the above vaccines many different times, including at the 4 month and 6 month check- ups. YOU CAN SAY NO TO SOME OR ALL VACCINES, AND YOU ALSO HAVE THE CHOICE TO DELAY VACCINES IF YOU CHOOSE TO GET THEM. At 6 months, they give booster shots of seven of the first 8 given and then add: Influenza-This vaccine proves time and again it is completely ineffective, yet the injection is very dangerous and has caused paralyzation and death in completely healthy individuals. You can check the CDC website to see the cases the government has settled for the injuries caused by this and all vaccines. How many people do you know that got the vaccine and still got the flu? It is a myth that the vaccine will lessen the severity of flu, should you get it. At 12 months, they give boosters for a lot of vaccines already given and add: MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)- I got this vaccine, yet I got the infection in my twenties, which only involved a low fever and swollen chipmunk cheeks for two days. Risks of the vaccine include seizure caused by fever (about 1 child in 1,250 who get MMRV), temporary severe low platelet count, swelling of glands, neck, anc cheeks, deafness, long-term seizures, coma, lowered consciousness, permanent brain damage. Hepatitis A- This vaccine should only even be considered for persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of infection; men having sex with men; users of injection and non-injection illicit drugs; persons who work with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory; persons with clotting- factor disorders; persons with chronic liver disease. Varicella-THIS IS CHICKEN POX. We all had chicken pox, got some itchy spots, our bodies NATURALLY developed antibodies to it, fought it off, and we will most likely never get it again. CDC reported side effects include soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given, fever, mild rash or several small bumps after vaccination, chickenpox rash after vaccination (THE VACCINE CAN CAUSE THE DISEASE), seizures, severe brain reaction, and low blood count. Even vets are starting to shy away from vaccines for animals because of all the side effects. Cancer is directly linked to some vaccines givven to pets. Why expose a baby to all of these diseases and dangerous chemicals if they can cause so many diesases? There are more vaccines given as your child grows, all of which have chemicals and additives that can be very dangerous, including metals and DNA from other animals and humans. The vaccine for HPV is extremely dangerous and has caused extensive permanent damage to many children. If you have questions regarding specific vaccines and cannot find the answers, Dr. Jin can help you.
