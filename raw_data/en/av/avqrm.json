Reproduce with permission from The Lancet Publishing Group.THE LANCET Oncology Vol 2 April 2001 226A significant proportion of cancer patients try unconventional therapies and many use 'comp-lementary' therapies, as adjuncts to mainstream care,for management of symptoms and to improve qualityof life. A smaller proportion use 'alternative'therapies, which are typically invasive, biologicallyactive, and commonly promoted as replacements for,rather than adjuncts to, mainstream therapy. Manyalternative therapies, including high-dose vitamin C,the Di Bella regimen, and laetrile have been shown notto be effective. For others, such as metabolic therapy,evidence is extremely limited. Conversely, mostcomplementary therapies are well studied and ofproven benefit. There is evidence from randomisedtrials supporting the value of hypnosis for cancer painand nausea; relaxation therapy, music therapy, andmassage for anxiety; and acupuncture for nausea.Such complementary therapies are increasinglyprovided at mainstream cancer centres. Lancet Oncol 2001; 2:226-32 Complementary and alternative medicine is a highly visible part of contemporary health care. No longer restricted to thelay sector and the medical fringe, such practices can befound in mainstream hospitals and cancer centres. In theUSA, and in other more-developed countries, many millionsof patients spend billions of dollars each year oncomplementary and alternative therapies. In this review, we discuss the terminology and usage of complementary and alternative medicine, report on themajor alternative approaches in current use by patients withcancer, along with any relevant data, and describecomplementary therapies useful in cancer medicineaccording to the clinical problems they benefit. Researchissues are noted and sources of further informationprovided. Terminology The general term 'complementary and alternative medicine'is used to describe techniques as diverse as chiropractic andyoga (Figure 1), iridology and meditation, colonic irrigationand spiritual healing. As such, it defies simple definition.Most published terminologies define complementary andalternative medicine simply as anything that is notconventional medicine. 1,2 An advantage of the phrase 'complementary and alternative' is that it offers the opportunity to makeimportant distinctions between the two. 'Alternative'therapies typically are invasive and biologically active andare commonly promoted for use instead of, rather than as an adjunct to, mainstream therapy. Conversely,'complementary' therapies are used together withmainstream care for management of symptoms and toimprove quality of life. This distinction is especially important in oncology, in which alternative methods are promoted as literalalternatives to conventional care. As a result, some patientsselect unproven methods instead of mainstream treatmentsafter diagnosis; most of these methods involve much traveland expense. A particularly important point is that manyalternative therapies are associated with significant risks ofadverse events.ReviewUnconventional therapies AJV and BRC are at the Integrative Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.

Reproduce with permission from The Lancet Publishing Group.THE LANCET Oncology Vol 2 April 2001 227Use of complementary and alternative medicine by patients with cancer A review of relevant published international data identified 26 surveys of cancer patients from 13 countries, includingfive from the USA. 3The average prevalence of use of these therapies across all studies was 31%. Those most commonlyused included dietary treatments, herbs, homoeopathy,hypnotherapy, imagery and visualisation, meditation,megadose vitamins, relaxation, and spiritual healing.Subsequent investigations have reported similar findings,although prevalence approached 50% in several. 4-6There is some indication of growth in the use of complementary andalternative medicine by patients with cancer in recent years. 3 Complementary therapies for control of pain Mind-body medicine A wide variety of complementary therapies are claimed torelieve stress and increase quality of life by producingrelaxation. One popular technique, progressive musclerelaxation, involves sequential tensing and relaxing ofmuscles. Another is hypnosis, the induction of a deeplyrelaxed state, with increased suggestibility and suspension ofcritical faculties. Once in this state, sometimes called ahypnotic trance, patients are given therapeutic suggestionsto encourage changes in behaviour or symptom relief.Visualisation and imagery techniques involve the inductionof a relaxed state followed by use of a visual image, such as apleasant scene that enhances the sense of relaxation. Severalrandomised trials have shown effects of hypnosis on bothprocedural and malignant pain. A recent systematic reviewand a National Institutes of Health technology assessmentpanel have both supported the use of hypnosis for cancer-related pain. 7,8There is also evidence from a randomised trial that relaxation and imagery decrease cancer pain.9 Acupuncture The details of practice may differ between individualschools, but all traditional Chinese medical theory is basedon the Taoist concept of yin and yang and the flow of Qi(energy) along hypothesised channels in the body (Figure 2).Many health professionals who practise acupuncture dispense with such traditional concepts. Instead, they viewacupuncture points as corresponding to physiological andanatomical features such as peripheral nerve junctions, anddiagnoses are developed in purely conventional terms. Manyrandomised trials have examined, and largely support, theuse of acupuncture for acute pain, such as dental surgery, 10 and chronic pain, such as migraine.11As yet, there has been no controlled study in the western literature on use forcancer-related pain. Several uncontrolled trials (eg ref 12)have shown promising results, but the value of acupuncturein reducing cancer pain remains to be sufficiently evaluated. Music therapy Music can be used in a controlled way to effect clinicalbenefit. It is ideally provided live by trained therapists, butReviewUnconventional therapies Figure 2. Acupuncture - trials have shown beneficial effects for relief of pain, nausea, and vomiting.

There is evidence from arandomised trial that music therapy is beneficial for acutepain, such as postoperative pain. 13However, there are insufficient data specifically for cancer-related pain. In asmall trial of 15 patients, improvements in cancer painscores taken during music therapy were twice those foundwith non-music sound. 14 Massage Therapeutic massage (Figure 3) involves manipulation ofthe soft tissue of the whole body or specific areas to inducegeneral improvements in health, such as relaxation orimproved sleep, or particular physical benefits, such as reliefof muscular aches and pains. Despite many anecdotalreports that massage reduces pain, current research evidenceis limited. Only two small randomised pilot trials haveprovided preliminary evidence of the effectiveness ofmassage 15and reflexology (foot massage)16for pain in cancer patients. Complementary therapies for anxiety and depression Mind-body medicine Several randomised trials have examined the effects of relaxation therapy on anxiety, depression, or mood incancer patients. Bindemann and colleagues, for example,randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed cancer torelaxation training or control groups. 17Anxiety and psychiatric morbidity increased significantly more incontrols than in treated patients. There was also a positiveeffect on depression scores in women. In studies with similardesigns in breast cancer, relaxation training led to bettermood 18 and general quality of life.19Relaxation training and hypnosis had an effect on anxiety during treatmentprocedures, such as chemotherapy or bone-marrowaspiration, in most 20,21but not all22randomised trials.Massage There is evidence from some ran-domised trials that massage (Figure3) reduces anxiety, in the short termat least, in groups as varied asadolescent psychiatric patients,intensive-care-unit patients, elderlypeople in residential care, andchildren clinically andstatistically significant improvementsin anxiety compared with controls.There were also improvements innausea, fatigue, and general well-being. 23Similarly, a crossover trial of reflexology16 reported statistically significant improvements in anxietyduring treatment phases comparedwith control phases. Music therapy In a study of the effects of music therapy on the mood ofpatients with cancer, 50 hospital inpatients were randomlyassigned either a live music therapy session or tape-recordedmusic. Patients receiving live music reported significantlylower anxiety scores than the other group. 24 Complementary therapies for nausea and vomiting Mind-body medicine Hypnosis has been found effective for the treatment of anticipatory nausea in children.25Trials have also generally found hypnosis and relaxation training to be beneficialagainst chemotherapy-induced nausea in adults, 26,27although some studies found no differences between groups.28One of the more effective methods seems to be 'systematicdesensitisation'. Patients describe situations that causeanticipatory nausea and place these in a hierarchy (forexample, driving to the hospital is placed lower than sittingin the treatment room). A relaxed state is then induced, andthe patients are asked to imagine the nausea-inducingsituations, which are presented in ascending order ofintensity, while remaining relaxed. 27Hypnosis and relaxation techniques do not seem to be effective forreducing nausea associated with bone-marrowtransplantation. 29 Acupuncture There is good evidence that acupuncture reduces nausea andvomiting. A systematic review of acupuncture-pointstimulation for nausea and vomiting related tochemotherapy, pregnancy, or anaesthetics that 11of 12 placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind studiesfavoured acupuncture. 30Of 16 trials published since the review, 11 also found significant differences or trends infavour of acupuncture. A recently published randomisedtrial compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture andReviewUnconventional therapies Figure 3. Massage - improves relaxation and reduces anxiety.For personal use only. Reproduce with permission from The Lancet Publishing Group.THE LANCET Oncology Vol 2 April 2001 229with antiemetic medication only in women undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy. The mean numbers ofvomiting episodes in the three groups were 6.3, 10.7, and13.4 respectively; the differences between the acupunctureand sham groups were highly significant. 31 Music therapy Music has been investigated for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing bone-marrowtransplantation, who receive particularly high doses andemetogenic regimens. Patients assigned antiemetic drugsplus music distraction reported significantly less nausea andvomiting than those assigned antiemetics alone. 32 Complementary therapies for other symptoms There are some uncontrolled data suggesting positive effectsfor acupuncture against vasomotor symptoms in patientswith prostate 33and breast cancers.34These results require confirmation in a randomised trial. In an uncontrolled study,3514 of 20 patients treated for cancer-related breathlessness reported substantial symp-tomatic improvement. Subjective feelings of breathlessnessdecreased by about a third within 5 minutes of needleinsertion. These results suggest that further hypothesis-testing research would be valuable. Alternative (unproven) treatments for cancer A large number of unproven treatments have beenrecommended for the treatment of cancer. Many of theseare promoted as alternatives to conventional care. Below aredescribed a small selection of some of the more popularalternative cancer treatments. Burzynski Some alternative remedies for cancer are the invention of asingle individual and are offered at a single site. An exampleis antineoplastons, developed by Stanislaw Burzynski.Clinical trials have either failed to accrue patients or havebeen uninterpretable. Nonetheless, this remains a popularalternative therapy, especially for children with braintumours. Di Bella The Di Bella regimen, consisting of melatonin, bromo-criptine, retinoids, and either somatostatin or octreotide,generated intense public interest in Italy in the late 1990s. Ina rare example of strategically planned and rapidlyimplemented research in alternative medicine, two studieswere completed. Neither showed any benefit for thistreatment. 36,37 Laetrile Laetrile is an interesting 'alternative' cancer medicinebecause, like many conventional chemotherapeutics, itconsists of a single compound isolated from a naturalsubstance (in this case, apricot pits or almonds). Yet unlike,for example, paclitaxel, it is promoted as natural, theinvented 'vitamin B17'. Proper use of this substance, proponents claim, could eradicate cancer entirely(www.worldwithoutcancer.com; www.sumeria.net/health/laetrile.html). However, a phase II trial showed no benefit, and some toxicity, with laetrile. 38 Although the product waned in popularity after that study, it was revived recentlyby new promoters who dismiss the study, along with thegeneral efforts of conventional regulatory bodies, as theresult of pressure exerted by vested interests trying to protecttheir profits in the cancer industry. Livingston-Wheeler Alternative cancer treatments appear subject to fashion, andthey commonly rise and fall in popularity. A therapy thatwas popular in the 1980s but is less so now is the Livingston-Wheeler regimen. On the basis of a hypothesis tested anddiscarded in the 1930s, Virginia C Livingston-Wheelerbelieved that cancer is caused by a bacterium, Progenitor cryptocides , an entity that has not been described outside of her work. The cancer treatment offered at the Livingston-Wheeler clinic in San Diego, California, USA, consisted ofefforts to strengthen the immune system by 'detoxification'through diet and enemas and by the administration ofspecial vaccines. A case-control study matched patients withadvanced cancer treated at the Livingston-Wheeler clinicwith those who received treatment at a conventional cancercentre. No difference in survival was found between the twosites, and Livingston-Wheeler patients had poorer quality oflife. 39 Macrobiotics Many diets have been suggested as cancer cures, withdifferent diets popular in different countries. Themacrobiotic diet, which is a common cancer diet in theUSA, has three features that make it typical of manyalternative cancer diets: first, unless followed to extremes, itis a relatively healthy diet, being high in fibre and low in fat;second, though adherence to such a diet may prevent cancer,there is no reason to believe that it is valuable as a cancertreatment; third, the diet is bulky and difficult to digest andso may be inappropriate for many patients. Megadose vitamin C Nobel laureate Linus Pauling claimed that large doses ofvitamin C could cure cancer, most effectively in patientswho had not received chemotherapy. A randomised trialfailed to support this idea. 40The trial was criticised by Pauling, who claimed that the inclusion of patients who had previously received chemotherapy invalidated the results. A further trial, this time including only patients without previous chemotherapy, similarly found no survival benefit from vitamin C. 41Nonetheless, proponents still advocate vitamin C, apparently on the basis of epidemiological evidence, animal studies, andaccusations of bias in the cancer research community(www.positivehealth.com/permit/Articles/Cancer/good2.htm;www.vitamincfoundation.org/). Metabolic therapy These therapies are based on the belief that cancer and otherillnesses result from an accumulation of toxins in the colon,which leads to liver failure and death. Treatment aims tocounteract liver damage with a practitioner-specific low-salt,ReviewUnconventional therapiesFor personal use only. Reproduce with permission from The Lancet Publishing Group.THE LANCET Oncology Vol 2 April 2001 230high-potassium diet, high doses of vitamins, minerals, and enzymes, several litres of fruit and vegetable juice daily, and'detoxification' by means of high colonic irrigation withherbs, coffee, or enzymes. Research purportedly showing asurvival benefit of 'Gerson' metabolic therapy was grosslyflawed by non-randomised comparisons and subgroupanalysis. 42A more recent case-series of 11 patients who received another variation of metabolic therapy reportedencouraging findings 43and serves as the basis for an ongoing controlled trial. Pau d'arco tea Pau d'arco tea is said to be an old Inca remedy for manyillnesses, including cancer. It is made from the bark of anindigenous South American evergreen tree, and its activeingredient, lapachol, has been isolated. Although lapacholshowed antitumour activity in animal studies, it does notappear to affect human cancers. 44The tea can induce nausea and vomiting. Shark cartilage The clinical basis for the use of shark cartilage in cancerseems to be the erroneous belief that, in the words of apopular book, \"sharks don't get cancer\". Advocates basetheir therapy on its putative antiangiogenic properties, but arecent phase I/II trial of shark cartilage found no clinicalbenefit. 45A study sponsored by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine is underway. 714-X A liquid medicine made from camphor, 714-X containsnitrogen, ammonium salts, sodium chloride, and ethanol. Itis generally given by injection. The treatment is based on anunusual set of theories about the biology of cancer, such asthe importance of 'somatids', particles essential to life,which can be seen only with a special microscope, and asubstance called 'cocancerogenic K factor', which is said toprotect cancer cells from immune attack. There does not seem to have been anysystematic human research on 714-X. Botanicals and related problems Many cancer patients use medicine derivedfrom plants ('botanical' or 'herbal'medicine). 3-6Some, such as 'MGN-3', a mushroom and rice bran extract, are taken tokill cancer cells; others, such as St John's wort,are taken to cope with symptoms associatedwith cancer, such as depression. In the USA,such medicines are considered neither foodsnor drugs and are exempted from review bythe Food and Drug Administration. Instead,they are classified as 'nutritionalsupplements', which are available withoutprescription and require no data on safety,purity, or efficacy. This issue is of particularconcern, because botanicals have been foundto be toxic or contaminated and to interactnegatively with pharmaceuticals. The very popular and useful St John's wort, for example, induces cytochrome P450 and therefore, in theory,lowers blood concentrations of protease inhibitors (used totreat HIV infection), cyclosporin and otherimmunosuppressive drugs, cholesterol medications,coumadin, and chemotherapeutic agents. 46 Pretreatment of cancer cells with berberine (Figure 4), found in highconcentration in several putative antitumour botanicals,reduces their sensitivity to paclitaxel. 47We recommend that patients about to receive cancer treatments should be askedto stop botanicals and any other non-prescription productsfor the duration of therapy. Integrative medicine Some complementary therapies, such as acupuncture,traditionally have been available only outside of mainstreamhospitals or cancer centres. Others, such as psychologicalsupport, humour therapy, and spiritual care, have beenavailable for decades as 'supportive' care in oncology andother mainstream settings. In this sense, complementarymedicine may be seen as an extension and an expansion ofsupportive care. In recent years, however, substantiallygreater integration of complementary and conventionalmedicine has occurred, often with both provided at the samesite, and many additional therapies have been introduced. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, practitioners of massage, music therapy, mind-bodyrelaxation therapies, and acupuncture work with inpatientsafter self-referral or referral by an oncologist or other healthprofessional. These therapies and others are also available atour outpatient sites, along with nutritional counselling andclasses in yoga, tai chi, art therapy, and various exerciseprogrammes. Similar units have been established at othercancer centres in the USA and elsewhere. The availability of complementary therapies within mainstream cancer centres affords the added benefit ofintegration at the academic and scientific level. Academicmedical facilities provide an infrastructure previously absentReviewUnconventional therapies Figure 4. Mahonia aquifolium - a source of berberine. \u00a9Garden MattersFor personal use only. Reproduce with permission from The Lancet Publishing Group.THE LANCET Oncology Vol 2 April 2001 231from research into complementary and alternative medicine. This benefit has led, for example, to high-qualitybasic and clinical research in botanical cancer remedies forthe first time. A small number of botanicals show promise asanticancer agents. Few of these have been promoted ascancer cures by alternative practitioners. Instead, they weredeveloped through laboratory and epidemiological researchcarried out by conventionally-trained scientists. Theseconsiderations suggest that complementary and alternativemedicine is best researched as well as used clinically as anintegrated component of oncology care. Conclusion Both the helpful and the problematic components ofcomplementary and alternative medicine are likely to persistin cancer medicine. Published evidence indicates thatpopular alternative therapies - cures promoted for useinstead of mainstream treatment - do not improve survivaland may, indeed, adversely affect it when patients do notreceive needed care at the appropriate time. Conversely,most complementary therapies used by cancer patients havedemonstrable, important benefits, including decreasedsymptoms and better quality of life. The challenge for thephysician and for the patient is to promote and utilisebeneficial complementary therapies and discard disprovedor implausible alternatives.
