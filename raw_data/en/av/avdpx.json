SYKES, Plaintiff v. KILOLO KIJAKAZI , 1 Acting MEMORANDUM OPINION By: PAMELA MEADE SARGENT United States Magistrate Judge I. Background and Standard of Review Plaintiff, Fayne J. Sykes, (\"Sykes \"), filed this action challenging the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, (\"Commissioner\"), denying his claims for disability insurance benefits, (\"DIB\"), and supplemental security income, (\"SSI\"), under the Social Security Act, as amended, (\"Act\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423 and 1381 et seq. Jurisdiction of this court is pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) and 1383(c)(3). This case is before the undersigned magistrate judge by transfer by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1). Neither party has requested oral argument; therefore, this case is ripe for decision. The court's review in this case is limited to determining if the factual findings of the Commissioner are supported by substantial evidence and were reached through application of the correct legal standards. See Coffman v. Bowen, 829 F.2d 514, 517 (4 th Cir. 1987). Substantial evidence has been defined as 1 Kilolo Kijakazi became the Acting Commissioner of Social Security on July 9, 2021. Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 25(d), Kilolo Kijakazi is substituted for Andrew Saul as the defendant in this suit. -2- \"evidence which a reasoning mind would accept as sufficient to support a particular conclusion. It consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\" Laws v. Celebrezze, 368 F.2d 640, 642 (4 th Cir. 1966). \"'If there is evidence to justify a refusal to direct a verdict were the case before a jury, then there is \"substantial evidence.\"'\" Hays v. Sullivan , 907 F.2d Cir. 1990) (quoting Laws , 368 F.2d at 642). The record shows Sykes protectively filed applications for DIB and SSI on February 18, 2016, alleging disability as of March 31, 2015, due to a heart murmur; anxiety; \"nerve\" problems; osteoarthritis; inability to read or write \"good;\" hearing problems; and back, neck and hip problems. (Record, (\"R.\"), at 15, 331 -38, 351, 363, 397.) The claims were denied initially and on reconsideration. (R. at 212 -14, 218 -25.) Sykes requested a hearing before an administrative law judge, (\"ALJ\") . (R. at 226-27.) A hearing was held on September 24, 2018, and a supplemental hearing2 was held on March 4, 2019, at both of which Sykes was represented by counsel. (R. at 40 -57, 59- 105.) By decision dated September 4, 2019, the ALJ denied Sykes's claims. (R. at 15-31.) The ALJ found Sykes met the nondisability insured status requirements of the Act for DIB purposes through December 31 , 2018. (R. at 17.) The ALJ found Sykes had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since March 31, 201 5, the alleged onset date. (R. at 1 7.) The ALJ determined Sykes had severe impairments, 2 A supplemental hearing was held af ter Sykes filed an objection to the medical interrogatories completed by medical expert, Dr. John A. Pella , M.D . (R. at 15, 42, 431- 32, 1364- 66.) Sykes argued Dr. Pella was a pulmonologist , and it was unclear what his expertise was in orthopedics or rheumat ology. (R. at 42.) Sykes's request to strike the evidence was denied, but he was allowed to submit additional questions to the medical expert. (R. at 15, 44-45.) Dr. Pella responded to the additional interrogatories submitted by Sykes. (R. at 15, 1447- 48.) By letter dated June 19, 2019, Sykes's attorney asked that Dr. Pella's opinion not be considered an expert opinion and requested it be given less weight. (R. at 15, 443.) -3- namely lumbar degenerative disc disorder, (\"ADHD\"); and substance abuse , but he found Sykes did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled one of the listed impairments in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. (R. at 1 8.) The ALJ found Sykes had the residual functional capacity to perform light3 work, except he could occasionally perform postural activities, but could not crawl or climb ladders, ropes or scaffolds; he could frequent ly perform reaching, handling, fingering and feeling with the left upper extremity; he should avoid concentrated exposure to industrial hazards; he could understand, remember and carry out simple instructions a nd perform simple tasks; he could occasionally interact with others; he could adapt to occasional changes in a customary workplace setting; he could not perform a job with reading or writing requirements; and he would be expected to be off task less than 10 percent of the workday. (R. at 21.) The ALJ found Sykes was unable to perform any of his past relevant work. (R . at 29 .) Based on Sykes's age, education, work history and residual functional capacity and the testimony of a vocational expert, the ALJ found a significant number of jobs existed in the national economy that Sykes could perform, including the jobs of a laundry worker , a housekeeper and a packing line worker . (R. at 29 -30, 97-98.) Thus, the ALJ concluded Sykes was not under a disability as defined by the Act, and he was not eligible for SSI and DIB benefits. (R. at 30-31.) See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(g), 416.9 20(g) (2020). 3 Light work involves lifting items weighing up to 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of items weighing up to 10 pounds. If someone can perform light work, he also can perform sedentary work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(b), 416.967(b) (2020). -4- After the ALJ issued his decision, Sykes pursued his administrative appeals, (R. at 326-28), but the Appeals Council denied his request for review. (R. at 1 -5.) Sykes then filed this action seeking review of the ALJ's unfavorable decision, which now stands as the Commissioner's final decision. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.981, 416.1481 (2020). This case is before this court on Sykes's motion for summary judgment filed February 18, 2021 , and the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment filed March 22 , 2021. II. Facts Sykes was born in 1990 , (R. at 47, 62 ), which classifie s him as a \" younger person\" under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1563( c), 416.963( c). He has an eighth -grade education and past work experience as a roof bolter, a shuttle car operator and a sweep operator . (R. at 47 , 52, 352 .)

(R. at 849.) He was diagnosed with back pain and spasm. (R. at 850.) From April 18, 2016, through August 3, 2016, Sykes saw Dr. James Abrokwah, M.D., for complaints of back and left leg pain, anxiety, attention deficit , racing thoughts and an inability to finish tasks.4 (R. at 559, 561, 563, 565 .) During this time, Sykes reported his pain was adequately controlled with medication , and he was able to perform house work and some yard work. (R. at 559, 561, 563, 5 65.) Sykes was fully oriented; he was not agitated or depressed; he exhibited no tremor; he had no vertebral tenderness; he exhibited signs of lumbar spondylosis with left sciatica; his straight leg raising tests were reduced on the left ; and he had disuse atr ophy. (R. at 565 -66.) Dr. Abrokwah reported Sykes's pain, 4 In July 2016, Sykes reported he had stopped taking methadone. (R. at 561.) He was fully oriented, but he stuttered and had difficulty constructing sentences. (R. at 561.) In August 2016, Sykes reported his symptoms were exacerbated by his father being inc arcerated for felony attempted murder and malicious wounding. (R. at 559, 1239.) Sykes was agitated and depressed , and his speech was pressured. (R. at 559.) -7- anxiety , depress ion and insomnia were controlled. (R. at 559, 561, 563, 56 6.) Dr. Abrokwah diagnosed spondylosis with radiculopathy in the lumbar region; anxiety ; depression; acute inflammation of l aryngopharynx; developmental learning difficulties; mixed insomnia; and restless leg syndrome , and Sykes was encouraged to exercise. (R. at 560, 562, 564, 566.) On May 26, 2016, Sykes's family brought him to the emergency department at Dickenson Community Hospital due to an overdose and altered mental state . (R. at 507 -21.) A urine drug screen was positive for methadone, opiates and tricyclic s. (R. at 511.) Sykes was transferred to the intensive care unit at Norton Community Hospital for toxic encephalopa thy. (R. at 522 -34.) Sykes reported a history of intravenous drug use, inhalation of unknown pills and use of illicit drugs. (R. at 527.) A CT scan of Sykes's head showed no abnormality. (R. at 534.) Sykes was evaluated by Lara Lilly, M.Ed., a resident in counseling at Frontier Health, who diagnosed opioid dependence and generalized anxiety disorder , and it was recommended that Sykes seek follow- up treatment at Dickenson County Behavioral Health Service . (R. at 545 -56.) On August 25, 2016, Melinda M. Fields, Ph.D., a licensed psychologist, evaluated Sykes at the request of Disability Determination Services. (R. at 567- 71.)

(R. at 569-70.) Fields opined that S ykes's social functioning was impacted by i mpaired auditory acuity, anxious mood, hand tremors and pressured, stuttering speech. (R. at 570.) Fields diagnosed panic disorder, opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder and ADHD . (R. at 570.) Fields opined it was \"unlikely\" Sykes would complete a typical workweek without presentation of symptoms, and he possibly could experience an exacerbation in symptoms if faced with stressors inherent in gainful employment. (R. at 571. ) Additionally, she opined it was likely Sykes would have difficulty interacting appropriately with supervisors, co-workers or the public. (R. at 571. ) She deemed his prognosis as guarded with appropriate treatment and environmental support. (R. at 570.) On August 31, 2016 , Dr. Tony Constant, M.D., a state agency physician, completed a medical assessment, finding Sykes could perform light work, except he could stand, walk and sit six hours each in an eight- hour workday; push/pull as much as the sionally climb, stoop, kneel, crouch and crawl; and he had no limitations on his ability to balance. (R. at 143-44.) Dr. Constant opined Sykes had no manipulative, visual, communicative or environmental limitations. (R. at 144.) On September 3, 2016, William Carne, Ph.D., a state agency psychologist, completed a Psychiatric Review Technique form, (\"PRTF\"), finding Sykes had mild 5 restrictions on his activities of daily living; moderate6 difficulties in 5 The regulations define \" mild limitations \" as an individual 's ability to function independently, appropriately, effectively and on a sustai ned basis as slightl y limited.

(R. at 140 -41.) That same day, Carne also completed a mental assessment, indicating Sykes had moderate limitations in his ability to un derstand, remember and carry out detailed instructions; to work in coordination with or in proximity to others without being distracted by them; to interact appropriately with the general public; and to respond appropriately to changes in the work setting. (R. at 144 -46.) Carne also found Sykes was markedly 7 limited in his ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods; to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and to perform a t a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods; and to get along with co- workers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes. (R. at 145 .) Carne stated Sykes's work -related mental abilities were, ot herwise, not significantly limited. (R. at 144- 46.) He opined Sykes could perform simple, unskilled work. (R. at 146.) On September 30, 2016, Sykes was psychiatrically evaluated by Cindy Vaughn, N.P.-C., a certified nurse practitioner with Family Preservation Services. (R. at 572 -76.) Sykes reported he did not like being in crowds, he had difficulty concentrating and had a lot of stress related to his father's incarceration. (R. at 6 The regulations define \"moderate limitations\" as an individual's ability to function independentl y, appropriately, effectively and on a sustained basis as fair. See 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.00 (F)(2)(c) (20 20). 7 The regulations define \" marked limitations\" as an individual's ability to function independently, appropriately, effectively and on a sustained basis as seriously limited .

(R. at 751.) On March 2, 2017, Sykes presented to the emergency department at Mountain View with complaints of spine pain, after sitting on a bucket, and bilateral, chronic shoulder pain. (R. at 738-44.) A CT scan of Sykes's cervical spine showed no evidence of acute cervical spine fracture or subluxation; his thoracic spine CT scan was normal; and his lumbar spine CT scan showed minimal multi -level degenerative disc disease and mild splenomegaly. (R. at 74 1-44.)

From April 4, 2017, through June 28, 2017, Sykes received outpatient treatment for opioid replacement therapy at Clinch Valley. 10 (R. at 768 -83.) During this time, Sykes had 25 urine drug screens, which were positive for methamphetamine; amphetamine; benzodiazepine; opioids; marijuana; On August 3, 2017, Sykes was admitted to Restoration & Wellness for substance abuse treatment.

(R. at 770.) -14- December 2017, Sykes explained to his counselor that, he had been accused of, but not charged with, manufacturing methamphetamine. (R. at 1239.) That same month, Sykes's case manager provided him with the op portunity to apply for work at Kelly Services. (R. at 1238.) On January 2, 2018, Dr. Cham Johnston M.D. , diagnosed Sykes with tobacco use disorder; severe anxiety; opioid use disorder, severe, dependence ; long term current use of opiate analgesic; long term current drug therapy; From August 29, 2017, through December 27, 2017, Sykes saw Dr. Abrokwah, report ing back, hip and arm pain;11 anxiety; social phobia ; depression; and irritability.

He reported his symptoms of social phobia, anxiety, agitation and anger improved with medication. (R. at 795, 797, 799.) In November 2017, Sykes reported he went shopping on Black Friday. (R. at 795.) In December 2017, Dr. Abrokwah assessed Sykes's anxiety and depression were not currently under control, but they were very much improved with his medication and that Sykes was stable on his medic ation regimen. (R. at 794.) Dr. Abrokwah continued to encourage Sykes to exercise. (R. at 794, 796, 798, 800, 802 .) On January 23, 2018, Sykes was admitted to Clinch Valley for outpatient opioid replacement therapy. (R. at 1077- 80, 1086, 1097 -1106.) He admitted to experiencing some withdrawal symptoms , but stated it was \"nothing I haven't been 11 Although Sykes reported back, neck, arm and hip pain in August and September 2017, his counselor reported he had a normal gait and no tremors. (R. at 1181, 1188, 1195, 1202, 1209, 1217, 1225.) On September 19, 2017, Sykes reported he was doing better and working more around the house , as he enjoyed cleaning up old projects.

(R. at 1102 .) On January 25, 2018, Sykes requested a work excuse. (R. at 1082.) On January 30 and Fe bruary 5, 2018, urine drug screens were positive for methamphetamine and methadone metabolite. (R. at 1089.) From February 7, 2018, through December 11, 2018, Sykes saw Dr. Abrokwah, report ing back, neck, thigh and leg pain; phobia; insomnia; 1378, 1415 , 1424.) Again, Sykes related his anxiety, agitation, anger, lack of concentration and social phobia to his father's legal problems. (R. at 1344.) He reported his pain, depression and insomnia had improved with medication. (R. at 790.) In August 2018 , Sykes complained of panic attacks, night terrors and pain in both hips and thighs, but stated, \"this is the best I have been for a long time....\" (R. at 1340 .) During this time, Dr. Abrokwah assessed Sykes's pain, anxiety , depression and insomnia were control led. (R. at 1343, 1377, 1379, 1416, 1425 .) He suggest ed for exercise. (R. at 1341, 1343, 1377, 1379, 1425.) Dr. Abrokwah added night terrors; social phobia; bilateral hip arthritis; and drug abuse to his diagnose s. (R. at 790, 1341.)

(R. Sykes had multiple relapses,14 which he related to his father being sentenced to prison;15 his girlfriend leaving him; having 13 teeth extracted;16 and increased hip pain. (R. at 1272- 74, 1299, 1319.) During treatment, the counselor worked with Syke s to develop coping skills, but he did not practice them outside of treatment; therefore, he was unsuccessful in decreasing his drug use. (R. at 1398.) He was discharged after advising he planned to transfer to Clinch Valley due to finances. (R. at 1396, 1398.) 12 In July 2018, Sykes had fixed eye contact and pressured speech, (R. at 1298- 1300) ; in August 2018, Sykes's speech was described as muffled, (R. at 1320) ; and, in October and November 2018, his speech was described as mumbled. (R. at 1381, 1383- 84, 1388.) 13 In July and November 2018, Sykes had an anxious or frustrated mood. (R. at 1298 - 1300, 1381, 1384.) 14 Sykes had 27 appropriate drug screens, 17 inappropriate drug screens , and he attempted to falsify a drug screen in June 2018. (R. at 1273, 1398.) 15 Sykes reported his father was sentenced to 120 years for shooting three people. (R. at 1272- 73.) 16 On July 24, 2018, Sykes presented to the emergency department at Norton Community Hospital for complaints of facial pain and swelling after having 13 teeth extracted on July 22, 2018. (R. at 1303- 16.) Sykes was unable to open his eyes during triage and had difficulty finishing sentences. (R. at 1308.) He was given intravenous fluid and medication and diagnosed with oral pain, status -post extraction; dehydration - dry socket; and polysubstance abuse. (R. at 1304, 1310.) -17- Sykes was admitted to Johnson City Medical Center from February 1 8, 2018, through March 1, 2018, for right hip and leg pain and swelling.17 (R. at 906 - 90, 1041 -43.) An echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction; mildly increased interventricular septum wall (R. , 947-48 .) Chest x-rays showed central opacities likely representing pneumonia. (R. at 976.) A CT pulmonary angiography showed abnormalities of the right thigh, right hip a nd right gluteal region with phlegmon18 and inflammation. (R. at 966- 68.) Subsequently, on February 27, 2018, Sykes underwent a CT -guided aspiration of gluteal abscesses . (R. at 945 , 982 -85.) Upon discharge, Sykes was diagnosed with 1041 .) On March 12, 2018, Dr. Abrokwah completed a medical assessment, finding Sykes could occasionally lift and carry items weighing 10 pounds and seven pounds frequently; he could stand and/or walk up to four hours in an eight -hour workday and could do so for up to two hours without interruption; he could sit up to five hours in an eight -hour workday and could do so up to two hours without 17 Sykes was initially seen at the emergency department at Holston Valley for complaints of right lower extremity swelling and pain. (R. at 811- 17.) Upon arrival at the emergency department, Sykes initially reported he was on methadone , but later denied this when the physician began discussing his pain medication. (R. at 894.) Sykes left against medical advice after being denied medication stronger than ibuprofen. (R. at 894, 909.) 18 Phlegmon is an inflammation of soft tiss ue that spreads under the skin or inside the body and is usually caused by an infection.

(R. at 804 -06.) On March 22, 2018, Sykes saw Dr. Adam Myers, M.D., a physician with Quillen College of Medicine, and reported continued discomfort, but stated it was improving. (R. at 1038.) He stated he was able to ambulate without assistance and was becoming more active. (R. at 1038.) Sykes had a slow gait that appeared uncomfortable; he had tenderness over the gluteus muscles on the right; and he had an appropriate mood and affect. (R. at 1040.) Dr. Myers diagnosed myositis and advised Sykes he did not need to return, as he could follow up with his primary care provider . (R. at 1040.) On August 23 and 24, 2018, Sykes presented to two different emergency departments for complaints of swelling in his feet, legs, arms and face. (R. at 1321- 35, 1347- 59.) A CT scan of Sykes's pelvis was normal. (R. at 1347.) He was diagnosed with edema. (R. at 1352.) Chest x- rays showed no acute cardiopulmonary disease. (R. at 1321.) Sykes was diagnosed with edema , and examination did not reveal deep vein thrombosis. (R. at 1331, 1352 .) On September 6, 2018, Dr. Abrokwah completed a mental assessment, finding Sykes had more than a slight limitation, but still could function satisfactor ily, in his ability to maintain personal appearance ; and serious limitations, resulting in an unsatisfactory ability, to follow work rules, to relate to co-workers and to function independently. (R. at 1360- 62.) He opined Sykes had major limitations, resulting in no useful ability, to deal with the public; to use -19- judgment in public; to interact with supervisors; to deal with work stresses; to maintain attention and concentration; to understand, remember and carry out simple, detailed and complex job instructions; to behave in an emotionally stable manner; to relate predictably in social situations; and to demonstrate reliability. (R. at 1360 -61.) Dr. Abrokwah opined Sykes could not manage benefits in his own best interest and would be absent from work more than two days monthly. (R. at 1362.) On September 9, 2018, Sykes was seen at Wellmont Medical Associates with complaints of a cough and shortness of breath. (R. at 1401-10.) Chest x-rays revealed low lung volumes. (R. at 1408.) On October 1, 2018, Dr. John A. Pella, M.D., a medical expert, completed medical interrogatories related to Sykes's physical impairments. 20 (R. at 1364 -66.) Dr. Pella opined Sykes's impairments did not meet or equal any impairment described in the Listing of Impairments. (R. at 1365.) He opined Sykes could occasionally lift and carry items weighing 21 to 50 pounds, 11 to 20 pounds frequently and up to 10 pounds continuously ; he could stand and/or walk up to four hours in an eight- hour workday and could do so for up to one hour without interruption; he could sit up to six hours in an eight -hour workday and could do so up to four hours without interruption; he would need to use a cane \"transiently\" and could use his free hand to carry small objects; he could occasionally climb 20 On June 4, 2019, Dr. Pella submitted additional responses to interrogatories , stating he specialized in internal medicine and pulmonary diseases. (R. at 1447 -48.) He stated he served as a medical expert for the Office of D isability Adjudication and Review, (\"ODAR\"), since 2008, and he had reviewed hundreds of cases involving orthopedic issues and other medical problems.

(R. at 1367 -72.) On January 15, 2019, Sykes saw Dr. Abrokwah, report ing hip, back and right thigh and buttock pain. (R. at 1422.) Dr. Abrokwah reported Sykes had reduced and painful range of motion of both hips. (R. at 1422.) However, he reported Sykes's pain, depression, anxiety and insomnia were contr olled and recommended he walk for exercise. (R. at 14 23.) He noted Sykes was calmer, not agitated and more interactive. (R. at 1422.) Dr. Abrokwah assessed gluteal cellulitis. (R. at 1423.) On February 2, 2019, Sykes presented to the emergency departm ent at Norton Community Hospital for complaints of pain and swelling in both hips. (R. at 1432 -43.) Sykes's gait was steady; he had full range of motion; he had intact circulation, movement and sensation in both the upper and lower extremities; he had eryt hema in his right upper leg and gluteal area; and his mental status examination was normal. (R. at 1433- 35.) A CT scan of Sykes's pelvis revealed either soft tissue calcification or foreign body in the right gluteal muscular region. -21- (R. at 1429.) Sykes was diagnosed with bilateral hip pain and calcifications , and a history of myositis and ossifications was n oted. (R. at 1433.) On March 21, 2019, Sykes saw Dr. Amit Patel, M.D., a physician with Quillen College of Medicine, and reported bilateral hip pain. (R. at 114.) He stated he had difficulty ambulating and felt like he was sitting on a beach ball. (R. at 114.) Sykes appeared uncomfortable; he had an antalgic gait; both hips had tenderness to palpation, but no erythema or induration; his orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of knowledge were normal; and he had an appropriate mood and affect. (R. at 115- 16.) On April 5, 2019, an MRI of Sykes's hip showed scattered faint edema and enhancement in the bilateral gluteal muscles and bilateral quadratus femoris muscles. (R. at 117 -18.) On May 8, 2019, Sykes saw Lawrence Livengood, P.A. -C., a physician's assistant with Appalachian Orthopaedic , and reported muscle aches and weakness ; arthralgias; joint and back pain ; and swelling in his extremities.21 (R. at 128 -31.) Syke s's lumbar spine had tenderness to palpation; he had pain in his back and legs with active extension of his back; he had mild stiffness with rotation of the lumbar spine; he had intact sensation in both lower extremities; his reflexes were absent in the ri ght knee and ankle , and his left knee and ankle had 2+ reflexes; he had positive seated knee extension on the right, negative on the left; manual muscle testing showed weakness of the extensor hallucis longus and plantar flexion of the right foot; he had intact dorsiflexion on the right; and he had an antalgic gait. (R. at 21 Sykes first saw Livengood on February 2, 2017, and he diagnosed cervical radiculopathy a nd ulnar nerve entrapment. (R. at 765.) He next was seen on March 29, 2017, and Livengood diagnosed degeneration of the cervical intervertebral disc and ulnar nerve entrapment. (R. at 760- 62.) -22- 130.) Livengood spinal stenosis of the lumbar region and lumbar radiculopathy. (R. at 130.) On June 13, 2019, an MRI of Sykes's lumbar spine showed mild facet arthropathy at the L2-L3 level, mild bilateral foraminal narrowing at the L 3-L4 and L5-S1 levels and moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing at the L4- L5 level. (R. at 106 -07.) On June 19, 2019, Sykes saw Livengood and reported back pain that radiated down the right lower extremity with weakness, tingling and numbness in the right lower extremity. (R. at 126-28.) Sykes's examination findings remained unchanged. (R. at 128.) Livengood diagnosed lumbar radiculopathy and administer ed an epidural injection. (R. at 128.) On August 21, 2019, Sykes complained of back pain. (R. at 124- 26.) He reported the epidural steroid injection was helpful, but he continued to have back and leg pain. (R. at 125.) Livengood diagnosed lumbar radiculopa thy and administered a repeat epidural. (R. at 125- 26.) III. Analysis The Commissioner uses a five -step process in evaluating DIB and SSI claims. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920 (2020). See also Heckler v. 458, 460- 62 (1983); Hall v . Harris , 658 F.2d 260, 264 -65 (4 th Cir. 1981). This process requires the Commissioner to consider, in order, whether a claimant 1) is working; 2) has a severe impairment; 3) has an impairment that meets or equals the requirements of a listed impairment; 4) can return to his past relevant work; and 5) if not, whether he can perform other work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920. If the Commissioner finds conclusively that a claimant is or is not disabled at any point in this process, review does not proceed to the next step. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4) (2020). -23- Under this analysis, a claimant has the initial burden of showing that he is unable to return to his past relevant work because of his impairments. Once the claimant establishes a p rima facie case of disability, the burden shifts to the Commissioner. To satisfy this burden, the Commissioner must then establish that the claimant has the residual functional capacity, considering the claimant's age, education, work experience and impair ments, to perform alternative jobs that exist in the national economy. See 42 1983); Hall , 658 F.2d at 264 Califano , 617 F.2d 1050, 1053 (4th Cir. 1980). Sykes argues the ALJ erred by improperly determining his residual functional capacity. (Plaintiff's Memorandum In Support Of His Motion For Summary Judgment, (\"Plaintiff's Brief\"), at 5 -6.) Sykes argues the ALJ erred by rejecting the opinions of Dr. Abrokwah and Fields and by relying on the opinions of the state agency physicians. (Plaintiff's Brief at 6 .) Sykes contends the state agency consultants' assessments were \"stale [and] outdated.\" (Plaintiff's Brief at 6.) The ALJ is not required to adopt a residual functional capacity assessment of a treating or examining physician in determining a claimant's residual functional capacity. Instead, the ALJ is solely responsible for determining a claimant's residual functiona l capacity. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (2020) (a claimant's residual functional capacity is an issue reserved exclusively to the Commissioner). The relevant question is whether the ALJ's residual functional capacity assessment is based upon all the relevant evidence, including medical records, medical source -24- opinions and the claimant's subjective allegations and description of his own limitations. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1545 , 416.945 (2020) . A claimant's r esidual functional capacity refers to the most the claimant can still do despite his limitations. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1545(a) , 416.945(a) . The ALJ found Sykes had the residual functional capacity to perform light work, except he could occasionally perform postural activities, but could not crawl or climb ladders, ropes or scaffolds; he could frequently perform reaching, handling, fingering and feeling with the left upper extremity; he should avoid concentrated exposure to industrial hazards; he could understand, remember and carry out simple instructions and perform simple tasks; he could occasionally interact with others; he could adapt to occasional changes in a customary workplace setting; he could not perform a job w ith reading or writing requirements; and he would b expected to be off task less than 10 percent of the workday. (R. at 21.) In making this residual functional capacity finding, the ALJ stated he was giving \" some weight\" to the state agency consultants' assessments and to Fields's opinion. (R. at 26-27.) The ALJ found Carne's opinion was somewhat consistent with the record, in that the record supported his finding that Sykes had moderate limitations in maintaining social functioning and in mai ntaining concentration, persistence or pace. (R. at 26, 140- 41.) Similarly, the ALJ found Dr. Bockner's opinion somewhat consistent with the record, which supported additional limitations based on Sykes's continued mental health treatment and his testimony that he suffered from poor focus, memory and concentration. (R. at 26.) Therefore, the ALJ also found Sykes had moderate limitations in his ability to adapt or manage himself. (R. at 26.) -25- The ALJ found Fields's opinion was consistent with the record, in that Sykes would have limitations in social functioning, handling a stressful work environment and being off task due to experiencing psychological symptoms. (R. at 27, 567- 71.) However, t he ALJ noted Fields's opinion did not specify to what degree Sykes would be limited in these areas. (R. at 27.) The ALJ noted Sykes sought routine treatment through his primary care provider and rehabilitation facilities and experienced occasional relapses. (R. at 25.) Sykes generally had intact memory, concentration, insight, judgment, orientation and thought process. (R. at 26.) In addition, the ALJ noted Sykes reported symptom control with treatment and typically had mild to no findings following objective examinations. (R. at 27.) Dr. Abrokwah noted that Sykes's symptoms were stable, and he presented as more coherent and less agitated. (R. at 2 5.) \"If a symptom can be reasonably controlled by medication or treatment, it is not disabling.\" Gross v. Heckler, 785 F.2d 1163, 1166 (4th Cir. 1986). The ALJ also addressed Dr. Abrokwah's check- box mental assessment, indicating Sykes had marked and extreme limitations in multiple areas of mental functioning . (R. at 28.) As the ALJ explained, he gave \"no weight\" to Dr. Abrokwah's mental assessment becaus e it was inconsistent with his treatment records, which indicated Sykes's mental health symptoms were controlled with treatment. (R. at 28.) Also, as noted above, Sykes often had mild to no abnormalities on multiple examinations, including intact memory, concentration, speech, behavior, insight and judgment. (R. at 28.) The ALJ explained he was giving \"significant\" and \"great\" weight to the opinions of the state agency physicians, who, after reviewing the medical evidence, opined Sykes could perform light work with occ asional postural activities, except -26- he could never crawl or climb ramps and stairs. (R. at 27.) The ALJ found these assessments were consistent with the medical record as a whole , but he modified the assessments slightly to most accurately reflect all new evidence of record, including Sykes's subjective allegations that he testified to at his hearing. (R. at 27.) The ALJ gave \"little weight\" to Dr. Pella's opinion that Sykes would be limited to medium22 work because it was inconsistent with the record. (R. at 28.) The ALJ also gave \"little weight\" to Dr. Abrokwah's medical assessment that Sykes could perform less than sedentary23 work because it appeared to be based on Sykes's subjecti ve allegations rather than the results of an objective examination or review of the record. (R. at 27 -28.) See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c)(3), 416.927(c)(3) (2020) (\"[t]he more a medical source presents relevant evidence to support a medical opinion, particularly me dical signs and laboratory findings, the more weight we will give that medical opinion\"). The ALJ noted the medical evidence did not suggest Sykes was limited as opined by Dr. Abrokwah because Sykes typically had conservative treatment with mild findings. (R. at 28.) Dr. Abrokwah regularly reported Sykes's pain was controlled with medication and recommended he exercise. (R. at 790, 1343, 1377, 1379, 1416, 1425.) See Gross, 785 F.2d at 1166 . 22 Medium work involves lifting items weighing up to 50 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of items weighing up to 25 pounds. If an individual can do medium work, he also can do sedentary and light work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(c), 416.967( c) (2020). 23 Sedentary work involves lifting items weighing up to 10 pounds with occasional lifting or carrying of articles like docket files, ledgers and small tools. Although a sedentary job is defined as one which involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in carrying out job duties. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required occasionally, and other sedentary criteria are met. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(a), -27- In 2017, a CT scan of Sykes's cervical spine showed no evidence of acute cervical spine fracture or subluxation; his thoracic spine CT scan was normal; and his lumbar spine CT scan showed minimal, multi -level degenerative disc disease and mild splenomegaly. (R. at 741- 44.) In January 2018, Sykes's extremities were nontender with normal range of motion and no edema; he had no motor or sensory deficit; and his gait was steady and normal. (R. at 1102.) Sykes reported his pain improved with medication, and in, March 2018, he r eported he was able to ambulate without assistance and was becoming more active. (R. at 790, 1038.) In February 2019, Sykes's gait was steady; he had full range of motion; he had intact circulation, movement and sensation in both the upper and lower extrem ities; and he had erythema in his right upper leg and gluteal area. (R. at 1433- 35.) A CT scan of Sykes's pelvis showed no evidence of recurrence of the right gluteal abscess, but instead showed either a soft tissue calcification or a foreign body. (R. at 1429.) In June 2019, although Sykes's physical exam showed some abnormalities, an MRI of his lumbar spine showed mild facet arthropathy at the L2- L3 level; mild bilateral foraminal narrowing at the L and L5 -S1 levels and moderate bilateral foram inal narrowing at the L4- L5 level. (R. at 106- 07.) In December 20 17, Sykes's case manager provided him with the opportunity to apply for work at Kelly Services , and in January 2018, Sykes requested a work excuse. (R. at 1082, 1238.) Furthermore, Sykes's activities included taking care of beehive stands, preparing meals, hunting, fishing and ginseng hunting. (R. at 568 , 770 .) Sykes argues that the ALJ should have given the state agency consultants' assessments less weight because they were \"stale [and] outdated,\" as they did not have the benefit of reviewing the updated records and opinions from his treating providers. (Plainti ff's Brief at 6.) However, the simple fact that those opinions -28- came later in time than the state agency opinions does not mean that they should be accorded greater weight. As the Third Circuit has noted, \"[B]ecause state agency review precedes ALJ review, there is always some time lapse between the consultant's report and the ALJ hearing and decision. The Social Security regulations impose no limit on how much time may pass between a report and the ALJ's decision in reliance on it.\" Chandler v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec. , 667 F.3d 356, 361 (3d 2011); see also Stricker v. Colvin, 2016 WL 543216, at *3 (N.D. W. Va. Feb. 10, 2016) (\"[A] lapse of time between State agency physician opinions and the ALJ's decision does not render the opinion stale.\") It is apparen t from the ALJ's very thorough decision that he carefully evaluated the whole record before him when weighing the opinion evidence, and he ultimately found the state agency medical opinions finding Sykes could perform light work were consistent with the re cord as a whole. Based on this, I find that substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ's weighing of the medical evidence and his residual functional capacity finding. An appropriate Order and Judgment will be entered. DATED: March 21, 2022 . /s/ Pamela Meade Sargent UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE "}
