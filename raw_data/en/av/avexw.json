Seisa, M.D. Lubna Daraz, Ph.D. -EHC024- EF Octo ber 2019 ii Key Messages Purpose of R eview To evaluate the effectiveness and harms of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Key Messages Antibiotic therapy increase s the clinical cure rate and reduce s the clinical failure rate. Oral and intravenous corticosteroids improve dyspnea and reduce the clinical failure rate . Antibiotics and corticosteroids are not associated with increase in serious adverse events. The evidence is insufficient to support the effect of a minophyllines , magnesium mortality, dyspnea, need for intubation, clinical failure, or hospital admission. Titrated oxygen reduces mortality compared with high flow oxygen. The e vidence suggests benefits of some nonpharmacologic interventions such as c hest physiotherapy using vibration/ percussion/ massage or using breathing technique (on dyspnea ), resistance training (on dyspnea and quality of life ), early pulmonary rehabilitation commenced before hospital discharge during the initial most acute phase of exacerbation rather than the convalescence period (on dyspnea ), and w hole body vibration training (on quality of life ). Vitamin D supplementation may improve quality o f life. The evidence is insufficient for comparative effectiveness of different regimens of antibiotics and corticosteroids based on type of agents , delivery modes, and duration of treatments. The evidence is insufficient for effectiveness of combinations of treatments that are each individually effective . Serious a dverse events were not found to be different between most evaluated interventions . iii This report is based on research conducted by the Mayo Clinic Evidence -based Practice Center (EPC) under contract to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Rockville, MD (Contract No. 290- 2015-00013- I).

DOI: https://doi.org/10.23970/AHRQEPCCER221 . iv Preface The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its Evidence -based Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of systematic reviews to assist public - and private -sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of healthca re in the United States. These reviews provide comprehensive, science- based information on common, costly medical conditions, and new healthcare technologies and strategies. Systematic reviews are the building blocks underlying evidence -based practice; th ey focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention. In the context of developing recommendations for practice, systematic reviews can help clarify whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more information about AHRQ EPC systematic reviews, see www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reference/purpose.cfm . AHRQ expects that these systematic reviews will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, government programs, and the healthcare system as a whole. Transparency and stakeholder input are essential to the Effective Health Care Program.

Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Baltimore, MD viii Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Therapies in Adult Patients With Exacerbation of COPD: A Systematic Review Structured Abstract Objectives . To synthesize existing knowledge about the effectiveness and harms of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for exacerbations of chronic obstructive ). Data . Embase \u00ae, -Process Non -Indexed Citations, MEDLINE\u00ae Daily, MEDLINE, Co chrane Central Registrar of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from database inception to January 2, 2019. Review methods . We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pharmacologic intervention or nonpharmacologic interventions for ECOPD . The strength of evidence (SOE) was graded for critical final health outcomes. Results . We included 98 RCTs ( 13,401 patients , mean treatment duration 9.9 days , mean followup 3.7 months ). Final health outcomes , including mortality, resolution of exacerbation, hospital readmissions , repeat exacerbations , and need for intubation, were infrequently evaluated and often showed no statistically significant differences between groups. A ntibiotic therapy increases the clinical cure rate and reduces the clinical failure rate regardless of the severity of ECOPD ( moderate SOE) . There is insufficient evidence to support a particular antibiotic regimen. O ral and intravenous corticosteroids improve dyspnea and reduce the clinical failure rate ( low SOE) . Despite the ubiquitous use of inhaled bronchodilators in ECOPD, we found only a small number of trials that assessed lung function tests , and not final health outcomes. The evidence is insufficient to support the effect of aminophyllines, magnesium sulfate, mucolytics, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled antibiotics, 5- and statins on final health outcomes . Titrated oxygen reduces mortality compared with high flow oxygen ( low SOE) . Low SOE suggested benef it from s ome nonpharmacologic interventions such as chest physiotherapy using vibration/percussion/massage or breathing technique (on dyspnea), resistance training (on dyspnea and quality of life), early pulmonary rehabilitation commenced before hospital discharge during the initial most acute phase of exacerbation rather than the convalescence period (on dyspnea) and whole body vibration training (on quality of life). Vitamin D supplementation may improve quality of life (low SOE) . Conclusions . Although c hronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common condition, the evidence base for most interventions in ECOPD remains limited . Systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids are associated with improved outcomes in mild and moderate to severe ECOPD. Titrated oxygen reduces mortality . Future research is required to assess the effectiveness of several emerging nonpharmacologic and dietary treatments. ix Contents Evidence Summary .................................................................................................................

Appendix References ES-1 Evidence Summary Background and Objectives Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease characterized by airflow limitation and chronic respiratory symptoms. The global prevalence is estimated to be greater than 10 percent , impacting approximately 380 million people worldwide.1 In the United States, COPD affects approximately 15 million people; chronic lower respiratory diseases, of which COPD is the largest contributing condition, are the fourth leading cause of death;2 and COPD costs more than $32 billion annually.3, 4 Patients with COPD experience chronic respiratory symptoms (including shortness of breath and cough), and have decreased quality of life, and premature mortality. Patients with COPD are at risk of experiencing exacerbations of COPD ( ECOPD). There have been various definitions of what constitutes an ECOPD. The Global Initiative for c hronic obstructive l ung disease (GOLD) defines ECOPD in its 2019 report as \"acute worseni ng of respiratory symptoms that result in additional therapy.\"5 ECOPD is generally characterized by increased dyspnea, increased frequency and severity of cough, and/or increased sputum production.6 ECOPD is a leading independent cause of increased mortality and morbidity among patients with COPD. ECOPD is associated with a higher risk of dying during or shortly after the exacerbation, lower quality of life, more hospital admis sion, depletion of financial resources, and a progressive decline in lung function.7-14 Hospitalizations for ECOPD account for more than half of all costs associated with COPD.10, 15 In recent years, a number of clinical trials of treatments to prevent ECOPD have shown promising results, but the evidence for acute treatments during an episode of ECOPD appears to be surprisingly scarce, given how relatively common the condition is. 16, 17 Goals of management of ECOPD include relieving symptoms and hastening the recovery from ECOPD by addressing precipitating factors (e.g. antibiotic treatment for infections), improving expiratory airflow and gas exchange (and thus improving breathing) by using inhaled bronchodilators, and reducing lung inflammation with corticosteroids. Nonpharmacologic treatments include supplemental oxygen, nutritional support , and others. 18-20 In addition, several new pharmacologic agents with novel mechanisms of action in early stages of development may be of potential benefit to COPD patients including those in acute exacerbation.21 The area of ECOPD management has several uncertainties and necessitates an up to date evidence synthesis. These uncertainties include the benefits and harms of emerging pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, the benefits and harms of treatments for ECOPD that have been found efficacious in stable COPD , the benefits and harms of antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids in mild ECOPD, the benefits and harms of combinations of treatments that have been found to be individually effective, and- for antibiotics and syste mic corticosteroids -the comparative effectiveness of different types of agents (e.g. broad -spectrum versus narrow -spectrum antibiotics), delivery modes (e.g. intravenous, oral), and durations of treatment. Examples of potentially emerging treatments for ECOPD, include immune -modulatory drugs and novel applications of treatments primarily used in stable COPD including mucolytics, aminophyllines, long- acting bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids , and others . Mucolytics may have a small effect on reducing t he frequency of ECOPD. 22, 23 In clinical practice, they are al so used during an ECOPD, where the evidence for their effectiveness appears less clear. ES-2 For nonpharmacological treatments , there are a number of areas in which an update of the evidence is required to inform best practice management of ECOPD. There is incr easing recognition that too much oxygen might do more harm than good, and not just in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory who are at risk of iatrogenic worsening of respiratory failure due to oversupply of oxygen.24, 25 Titrated oxygen with a target saturation rate as opposed to high flow oxygen has therefore been used in patients with ECOPD. 26 Historically, pulmonary rehabilitation programs have focused on enrolling patients with stable COPD or patients who had stabilized after an episode of ECOPD, but in more recent times , a number of trials have explored the role of exercise/early pulmonary rehabilitation during an episode of ECOPD.27, 28 Chest physiotherapy using airway clearance techniques (including breathing technique, vibration/percussion, and autogenic drainage) are used routinely in many patients hospitalized with ECOPD. A Cochrane review published in 2012 found evidence that airway clearance techniques may reduce the need for hospital admission and improve health- related quality of life based on single studies with small study populations.29 An update of this evidence is indicated. Furthermore, many patients with COPD are in a state of hyper -metabolism in which their body consumes more calories per kilogram on calorimetric measures compared with a person without COPD, likely because of the increased work of breathing.30 This hyper -metabolic state is even more pronounced during episodes of ECOPD, posing questions about the optimal nutriti onal support for patients with ECOPD.31, 32 Established treatments for ECOPD, such as antibiotics and syste mic corticosteroids, may not be indicated in every single episode of an ECOPD. One uncertainty relates to the need for antibiotics in mild and moderately severe ECOPD, especially in an outpatient setting. 33 While antibiotics for treatment of severe ECOPD have been shown to be beneficial i n some studies, the need for antibiotics in less severe forms of COPD is unclear.34 Uncertainty remains regarding the use of systemic (oral, intravenous) corticosteroids relate to whether all patients stand to benefit from this treatment of ECOPD.34 These questions are important to address in view of trying to reduce prescriptions of antibiotics, where safely possible, to reduce potential adverse ev ents including development of antibiotic resistance, and to reduce potentially significant adverse events from systemic corticosteroids, in particular hyperglycemia, in patients with glucose intolerance and diabetes.35 Short -acting adrenergic agonists tablished treatments to relieve dyspnea and improve airflow obstruction during ECOPD, but the benefits of combining SABAs and SAMAs compared with using SABAs or SAMAs alone are unclear.36 Long -acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids have historically only be used in stable COPD, but there is emerging evidence that an increase in dosage of inhalation therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long- acting beta agonists (LABAs) may be beneficial in early treatment of ECOPD when patients experience mild to moderate dyspnea and may result in no requirement of systemic corticosteroids in a large proportion of patients presenting with mild -to-moderate worsening of dyspnea. 37 The benefit of using LABAs and long -acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) in the treatment of manifes t ECOPD is unclear. For antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids, the comparative effectiveness of different agents (e.g. broad- spectrum versus narrow -spectrum antibiotics), delivery modes and durations of treatment needs to be established. 38-41 In summary, determining the optimal treatment plan for patients with ECOPD requires 1) a synthesis of existing knowledge regarding the effect iveness of treatment options and 2) a synthesis of existing knowledge regarding the harms of treatment options. Currently, the ES-3 comparative benefits and harms of these varied treatment approaches including the optimal combination of these treatments to mitigate COPD exacerbation are unclear. A systematic review of current evidence assists clinicians in understanding and determining optimal management for ECOPD. This review focuses on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the gold standard desi gn for evaluating a therapeutic intervention. In terms of adverse events , they are also likely to be captured in RCTs because of the acute nature of condition being studied. Scope and Key Questions Scope of Review The systematic review assess ed the effect iveness of systemic antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids and other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies stratified by severity of ECOPD. The study also evaluated the effectiveness of combinations of treatments, and compared different regimens (different agents, routes of administration, and duration of treatment) of antibiotics and corticosteroids. Health service interventions (e.g. hospital in the home as alternative to hospitalization) and interventions during the convalescence period were not included. Key Questions Key Question (KQ) 1.

In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD, what is the comparative effectiveness of different regimens of antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids based on type of agents (e.g. , broad-spectrum v s. narrow - spectrum antibiotics), delivery modes (e.g. , intravenous, oral), and durations of treatment? Methods We developed an analytic framework to guide the process of the systematic review. We followed the established methodologies of systematic reviews as outlined in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Methods Guide for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews. 42 The reporting complies with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews ES-4 and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) statements.43 The study protocol is registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO #: 42018111609) and published on the AHR Q website ( https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/topics/copd/protocol ). The full report details our literature search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, data synthesis , assessments of risk of bias , and strength of evidence (SOE). We graded SOE for final health outcomes deemed to be most important or critical, including mortality, dyspnea, quality of life ( QoL), need for intubation, re peat exacerbation and/or hospital re admissions and ECOPD resolution (clinical cure, failure). SOE was rated as high when we were very confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect (the body of evidence has few or no deficiencies and is judged to be stable). SOE was rated as moderate when we were moderately confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect (the body of evidence has some deficiencies and is judged to be likely stable). SOE was rated as low when we had limited confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect (the body of evid ence has major or numerous deficiencies and is likely unstable). SOE was rated as insufficient when we had no evidence, were unable to estimate an effect, or had no confidence in the estimate of effect. Results The literature search identified 8,916 citations. An additional 36 references were identified through reference mining, grey literature search; and from Key Informants and Technical Experts. There were 9 8 original studies with a total of 13,401 patients that met inclusion criteria and were included i n the systematic review . Most studies were conducted in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COPD. The mean treatment duration was 9.9 days and there was a mean 3.7 months of reported followup. KQ1. In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD, what are the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics compared with placebo or standard care? Systemic Antibiotics Versus Placebo or Management Without Systemic Antibiotics Antibiotics increased clinical cure of ECOPD compared with placebo or management without antibiotics at the end of the intervention and at the longest followup ( moderate SOE). Antibiotics reduced clinical failure rate compared with placebo at the end of the intervention (moderate SOE ), but not at the longest followup (Low SOE). Antibiotics did not change 30- day hospital readmission, repeat exacerbation, and quality of life, compared with placebo ( low SOE). No statistically significant difference in adverse events (AEs) was observed between antibiotics and placebo or m anagement without antibiotics . Systemic Corticosteroids Versus Placebo or Management Without Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids improved dyspnea (Low SOE) and reduced clinical failure rate ( low SOE) at the end of the intervention, compared with placebo. ES-5 No statistically significant difference in serious adverse events was found between systemic corticosteroids and placebo or management without systemic corticosteroids . Systemic corticosteroids were associated with fewer withdrawals but more endocrine related adverse events. KQ2. In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD , what are the benefits and harms of emerging and other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies compared with placebo or standard care? Pharmacologic Therapies Versus Placebo or Management Without Pharmacologic Therapies The evidence was insufficient for the effect of aminophyllines, magnesium sulfate, mucolytics, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled antibiotics, 5- and statins on mortality, dyspnea, need for intubation, clinical failure, or hospital admission. Aminophyllines were associated with more gastrointestinal adverse events than placebo. No other statistically significant difference was found in adverse events b etween the remaining pharmacologic therapies and placebo or management without pharmacologic therapies . Nonpharmacologic Therapies Versus Management Without Nonpharmacologic Therapies Chest physiotherapy using vibration/percussion, breathing technique , or positive expiratory pressure did not improve dyspnea and other symptoms, quality of life, 6- minute walking distance, repeat exacerbations , or mortality ( low SOE). Resistance training improved dyspnea, and quality of life, compared with management without nonpharmacological therapies ( low SOE). Early pulmonary rehabilitation, commenced before hospital discharge during the initial most acute phase of exacerbation rather th an the convalescence period , improved dyspnea, compared with management without rehab ilitation ( low SOE). Whole body vibration training improved QoL compared with management without nonpharmacologic therapies ( low SOE). Titrated oxygen reduced mortality compared with high flow oxygen at the longest followup (low SOE). Vitamin D supplemen tation improved quality of life compared with placebo ( low SOE). Omega- 3 fatty acid enriched diet did not change quality of life, need for intubation, and dyspnea at the end of intervention compared with usual diet ( low SOE). Few adverse events were reported in studies of nonpharmacologic therapies. There was no statistically significant difference found in adverse events between nonpharmacologic therapies and management without nonpharmacologic therapies . KQ3. In adult patient s with exacerbation of COPD, what are the benefits and harms of combinations of treatments that are individually effective (based on empirical evidence in stable COPD)? No statistically significant difference in adverse events was found between any of the combined treatments and individual treatments. ES-6 KQ4. In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD, what is the comparative effectiveness of different regimens of antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids based on type of agents (e.g. , broad-spectrum v s. narrow - spectrum antibiotics), delivery modes (e.g., intravenous, oral), and durations of treatment? Comparative Effectiveness of Different Antibiotics Numerous antibiotics , given as empirical initial therapy for ECOPD (in the absence of pneumonia), were compared against each other, but the evidence was insufficient to estimate an effect on final health outcomes; except that levofloxacin reduced repeat exacerbations at 3 months of followup, compared with prulifloxacin ( low SOE). The only differences in adverse e vents that were statistically significantly were for higher rates of adverse events with amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid compared with telithromycin; and for higher rate of adverse events with imipenem plus cilastatin compared with meropenem. Comparative Effectiveness of Different Dosages o f the Same Antibiotic The evidence comparing different dosages of the same antibiotic was insufficient for mortality, clinical cure and clinical failure. No statistically significant difference in adverse events was foun d between trovafloxacin 200 milligrams (mg) and trovafloxacin 100 mg. Comparative Effectiveness of Different Application Routes for Antibiotics No studies were found. Comparative Effectiveness of Different Durations o f Treatment With Antibiotics The eviden ce was insufficient when comparing 3 day versus 10 day regimens of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. No statistically significant difference of AEs was found between 3 day and 10 day regimens of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. Comparative Effectiveness of Different Corticosteroids The evidence was insufficient when comparing the different corticosteroids for mortality, need for intubation, clinical failures, and dyspnea. There was no statistically significant difference in AEs found between the different systemic corticosteroids. ES-7 Comparative Effectiveness of Different Routes o f Application for Corticosteroids No difference between intravenous methylprednisolone and inhaled budesonide 40 mg was found in quality of life and repeat exacerbations ( low SOE). The evidence was insufficient when comparing the different routes of administration of corticosteroids for mortality, dyspnea, quality of life, re peat exacerbation, clinical failures, hospital admission, and intensive care unit ( ICU) admission. Inhaled B udesonide 40 mg was associated with statistically significantly less endocrine - related AEs than methylprednisolone. Comparative Effectiveness of Different Durations o f Treatment With Corticosteroids The evidence was insufficient when comparing the differ ent durations of corticosteroid treatment for mortality, hospital admission, need for intubation, clinical failure, quality of life, repeat exacerbation, and dyspnea. There was no statistically significant difference found in AEs between the different sys temic corticosteroid durations. Discussion We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies in adults with ECOPD . We assessed the effectiveness of systemic antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids an d emerging and other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies stratified by severity of ECOPD. Further, we assessed the effectiveness of combinations of treatments, and we compared different regimens (different agents, routes of administration, and dur ation of treatment) of antibiotics and corticosteroids. The majority of studies were conducted in hospitalized patients with moderate or severe ECOPD with only a small number of studies conducted in outpatients with mild or mild to moderate ECOPD. Lung function was the most frequently assessed outcome, and often studies did not measure final health outcomes , such as mortality, resolution of exacerbation, hospital readmission etc., to allow for assessment of the correlation between this physiological surr ogate outcome and final health outcome. The findings of the systematic review highlight that in addition to standard therapy with antibiotics, systemic steroids and bronchodilators, some nonpharmacologic interventions hold promise for improving clinically important outcomes, in particular they might improve functional capacity and thus mitigate the deconditioning associated with ECOPD. Findings in Relation to What I s Known This review provides a comprehensive overview of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions in ECOPD. The literature on interventions for COPD and ECOPD has proliferated substantially in recent years with numerous published systematic reviews on different interventions for the management of COPD. For clinicians, health policy makers and other end users of the evidence it has become an almost impossible task to keep up with the ever increasing body of evidence on the management of ECOPD. This review therefore addresses an urgent need ES-8 to provide an up- to-date summary of the current stat e of evidence for the management of ECOPD. One of the main findings of this systematic review is that despite a proliferation of the COPD literature, the evidence base for most interventions in ECOPD remains low. While significant progress has been made in recent years in assessing interventions to prevent ECOPD (during stable COPD) , the same cannot be said for acute interventions used during ECOPD. For the standard therapy of ECOPD with systemic antibiotics, corticosteroids and bronchodilators , many quest ions remain unanswered, based on the findings of our review. While the discussion of COPD phenotypes (and ECOPD phenotypes) has taken center stage on the COPD research agenda, very limited information on ECOPD phenotypes ( e.g. infective versus non-infectiv e, high versus low eosinophil count) has been included in trials of intervention for ECOPD. In particular, whether a response to systemic corticosteroid treatment of ECOPD depends on the blood eosinophil level remains unexplored. Studies on inhaled c ortico steroid (ICS) for prevention of ECOPD in stable COPD suggest that patients with higher blood eosinophil levels might be more likely to benefit from ICS treatment in terms of reducing the risk of ECOPD.44 Despite the ubiquitous use of SABAs and SAMAs in ECOPD, we found only two studies (KQ3) that studied their effectiveness. The role of LABAs and LAMAs in ECOPD remains largely unexplored with only one crossover trial identified in our review that assessed a LAMA versus placebo. An important insight from our systemic review is that some nonpharmacologic interventions (resistance training, early pulmonary rehabilitation, whole body vibration training transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, caloric supplementation, and vitamin D) show promise, but the current evidence is largely based on single, relatively small RCTs. In stable COPD, pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the most effective (though underused) interventions. In recent years, there has been a significant interest in exploring the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients who have recently experienced an ECOPD or even in patients who are in the acute phase of ECOPD (e.g. before hospital discharge). Our review indicated that pulmonary rehabilitation during ECOPD may increase functional capacity (based on 6 -minute walking distance). A potential risk for increased mortality associated with pulmonary rehabilitation commenced during hospitalization for ECOPD has previously been flagged in the guidelines on management of COPD exacerbations by the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society, published in 2017. 45 We did not find a significant association with increased mo rtality for pulmonary rehabilitation or any form of exercise commenced during hospitalization. Our review did not include studies conducted in an ICU, chronic ventilator unit, or respiratory care unit, which might have contributed to the discrepancy in the findings. Also, a trial of rehabilitation commenced within 48 hours of hospital admission in 389 patients with exacerbations of different chronic respiratory conditions found an increase in mortality in the intervention group at one year ( odds ratio: 1.74, 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 2.88). 46 Mortality was, however, not reported in the subgroup of patients with COPD and is therefore not included in our review. Given the potential of exercise programs during hospitalization for ECOP D to ameliorate deconditioning and improve functional status, further research in this area is urgently needed. Other nonpharmacologic interventions during ECOPD that may improve functional capacity included resistance training, whole body vibration training and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. As these findings were based on single, relatively small studies, evidence from well -conducted large RCTs will be ES-9 required to confirm these findings. Similarly, caloric supplementation and vitamin D may improve quality of life in patients with ECOPD, but confirmation from well -conducted large RCTs is required before any definite conclusions can be drawn. Limitations For most interventions, only one RCT was available per outcome (KQ1- 4), which limits inferences from the quantitative synthesis. Failure to detect statistical significance for most of the outcomes may have resulted from type II er ror. There was some heterogeneity in the definition of the severity of ECOPD, although in general mild ECOPD referred to patients that could be treated in an outpatient setting, whereas moderate to severe ECOPD was used for hospitalized patients. A number of studies included patients assessed in an emergency department with a broad range of severity of ECOPD. We used the definition of serious AEs listed by the original studies, which could have varied between studies. Defining resolution of ECOPD and differ entiating poor resolution from re -exacerbation can be challenging. We used outcomes as described in the original studies, which might have resulted in heterogeneity of definitions of ECOPD resolution and overlap between clinical failure and re -exacerbation between studies. Very limited information on ECOPD phenotypes (e.g. infective versus non- infective, high versus low eosinophil count) has been included in trials of intervention. We could therefore not draw any conclusions about interventions for different ECOPD phenotypes. In particular, whether a response to systemic corticosteroids depends on the blood eosinophil levels remains unexplored. Studies were overall at high risk of bias . This, together with the low number of studies per intervention/outcome, makes interpretation of t he body of evidence challenging. We were unable to statistically evaluate publication bias and only included studies published in English. An evaluation of completed clinical trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov showed that 62 percent (24 out of 39) studies were not published. Applicability Most studies were conducted in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe ECOPD, and the results of these studies may not be applicable to patients with milder forms of ECOPD treated in an outpatient setting. KQ1 and KQ2 were stratified by severity of E COPD, which allows determination of the generalizability of the results based on the severity of ECOPD. For KQ2, almost all studies were conducted in hospitalized patients. As we excluded studies conducted in an ICU setting, some of our findings may not be extrapolated to the most severely sick patients who require ICU admission for ECOPD. The results of comparisons of different antibiotic agents/classes are context -specific, as the optimal antibiotic choice depends on local antimicrobial resistance patter ns, which can change over time . The results of these comparisons (KQ4) are therefore not necessarily applicable to patients in different geographic locations and at different points in time. COPD terminology has not been used consistently in the past with some older studies referring to chronic bronchitis without airflow obstruction as COPD. We excluded studies in patients with chronic bronchitis but no evidence of chronic airflow obstruction to increase applicability of the results to patients with chronic airflow obstruction. Not all studies explicitly excluded patients with potential asthma or asthma -COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), and there is therefore a potential for misclassification. ES-10 Pulmonary rehabilitation is a complex (multi- component) intervention, which consists of exercise training, patient education and behavior change. The detailed interventions for pulmonary rehabilitation were reported in the included studies, which should facilitate reproducibility and applicability. While there are publishe d standards for pulmonary rehabilitation programs, 47 these have been developed in the context of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with stable COPD (as opposed to patients with ECOPD). Suggestions for Future Research Lung function ( forced e xpiratory volume in 1 s econd ) was the most commonly assessed outcome in studies of interventions to manage ECOPD, while final health outcomes , such as resolution of ECOPD (clinical cure, clinical failure) a nd re peat exacerbation (with or without hospital admission) , were rarely assessed. Future studies in ECOPD should focus on final health outcomes and include clinical resolution of ECOPD and risk of re peat exacerbation in addition to other final health outcomes , such as dyspnea and quality of life. The response to antibiotic therapy as well as corticosteroid therapy in ECOPD likely differs based on the phenotype of the exacerbation episode. A number of studies that used pro- calcitonin -guided treatment a lgorithms have been conducted on antibiotic therapy versus placebo in ECOPD, 48 but identification of responders to systemic corticosteroid treatment of ECOPD based on blood eosinophils remains unexplored. This contrasts with the increasing recognition of eosinophilic phenotypes in stable COPD patients who appear to be more likely to benefit from long-term ICS.44 Future studies on systemic corticosteroids in ECOPD should assess the treatment effect stratified by blood eosinoph il count. Chest physiotherapy using breathing technique and/or vibration/percussions and/or positive expiratory pressure is commonly prescribed in patients hospitalized for ECOPD , but there was insufficient evidence (from relatively small, low quality tria ls) that these interventions improve outcomes. As these are resource -intensive interventions, large well -designed trials with final health outcomes including clinical resolution of ECOPD and re peat exacerbations should be conducted to assess the role of chest physiotherapy for airway clearance in ECOPD and inform clinical practice. It is currently unclear whether pulmonary rehabilitation commenced during hospitalization for ECOPD is associated with increased mortality. An increased mortality was found in the review conducted for the guidelines on management of COPD exacerbations by the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society but was not found in our systematic review. Given the potential benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation to counteract the deconditioning associated with ECOPD, we believe that conducting high- quality RCTs to answer this question should be a priority. The relatively new treatment options of whole body vibration, t ranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) , dietary interventions with caloric supplements and vitamin D need to be assessed in large high quality RCTs to inform recommendations about these treatments. Such literature (e.g., on vitamin D) is notorio us for contradictory findings over time. Further research is required to determine the optimal route of administration for systemic corticosteroids, i.e. to determine whether oral corticosteroids are generally not inferior to intravenous corticosteroids and to determine a potential role of inhaled corticosteroids (possibly as alternative to systemic corticosteroids) in ECOPD . Patients hospitalized with COPD exacerbations are at high risk for hospital readmissions and death after hospital discharge, which em phasizes the importance of improving the hospital -to- ES-11 home continuum of care. Our systematic review only focused on the acute episode of an exacerbation and did not include health service interventions, but there is an urgent need for research that assesses interventions to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes following hospital discharge. Much of the recent debate on adverse outcomes following hospital discharge has focused on reducing 30- day hospital readmissions in ECOPD, as the Medicare's Hospital Readmis sions Reduction Program (HRRP) lower ed payments to Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with too many readmissions within 30 days . Recent evidence, however, showed that implementation of the HRRP was associated with a significant increase in tren ds in 30- day post-discharge mortality among patients hospitalized for heart failure and pneumonia .49 It is therefore evident that future research that aims to improve post -hospital discharge for any disease with frequent hospital readmissions including ECOPD should not focus on reducing 30 - day hospital admissions in isolation but only in conjunction with final health outcomes such as QoL and mortality. Conclusion Despite a proliferation of the COPD literature, the evidence base for most interventions in ECOPD remains limited . Systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids are associated with improved outcomes in mild and moderate to severe ECOPD. T itrated oxygen reduces mortality . Future research is required to assess the effectiveness of several emerging nonpharmacologic and dietary treatments. ES-12 References 1. Adeloye D, C hua S, Lee C, et al.

PMID: 3057588 1 Introduction Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease characterized by airflow limitation and chronic respiratory symptoms. The global prevalence is estimated to be greater than 10 percent , impacting approximately 380 million people worldwide. 1 In the United States, COPD affects approximately 15 million people ; chronic lower respiratory diseases , of which COPD is the largest cont ributing condition, are the fourth leading cause of death;2 and COPD costs more than $32 billion annually.3, 4 Patients with COPD experience chronic respiratory symptoms (including shortness of breath and cough), have decreased quality of life, and premature mortality. Patients with COPD are at risk of experiencing exacerbations of COPD ( ECOPD). There have been various definitions of what constitutes an ECOPD. T he Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines ECOPD in its 2019 report as \"acute worsening of respiratory symp toms that result in additional therapy.\"5 ECOPD is generally characterized by increased dyspnea, increased frequency and severity of cough, and/or increased sputum production.6 ECOPD is a leading independent cause of increased mortality and morbidity among patients with COPD. ECOPD is associated with a higher risk of dying during or shortly after the exacerbation, lower quality of life, hospital admission, depletion of financia l resources, and a progressive decline in lung function.7-14 Hospitalizations for ECOPD account for more than half of all costs associated with COPD.10, 15 In recent years, a number of clinical trials of treatments to prevent ECOPD have shown promising results, but the evidence for acute treatments during an episode of ECOPD appears to be surprisingly scarce, given how relatively common the condition is.16, 17 Goals of management of ECOPD include relieving symptoms and hastening the recovery from ECOPD by addressing precipitating factors (e.g. antibiotic treatment for infections), improving expiratory airflow and gas exchange (and thus improving breathing) by using inhaled bronchodilators, and reducing lung inflamm ation with corticosteroids. Nonpharmacologic treatments include supplemental oxygen, nutritional support , and others. 18-20 In addition, several new pharmacologic agents with novel mechanisms of action in early stages of development may be of potential benefit to COPD patients including those in acute exacerbation. 21 The area of ECOPD management has several uncertainties and necessitates an up to date evidence s ynthesis. These u ncertainties include the benefits and harms of emerging pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, the benefits and harms of treatments for ECOPD that have been found efficacious in stable COPD , the benefits and harms of antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids in mild ECOPD, the benefits and harms of combinations of treatments that have been found to be individually effective, and for antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids the comparative effectiveness of different types of agents (e .g. broad- spectrum versus narrow -spectrum antibiotics), delivery modes (e.g. intravenous, oral), and durations of treatment. Examples of potentially emerging treatments for ECOPD, include immune -modulatory drugs and novel applications of treatments primari ly used in stable COPD including mucolytics, aminophyllines, bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids , and others . Mucolytics 2 appear to have a small effect on reducing the frequency of ECOPD. 22, 23 In clinical practice, they are also used during an ECOPD, where the evidence for their effectiveness appears less clear. For nonpharmacological treatments there are a number of areas in which an update of the evidence is required to inform best practice management of ECOPD. There is increasing recognition that too much oxygen might do more harm than good, and not just in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory who are at risk of iatrogenic worsening of respiratory failure due to oversupply of oxygen. 24, 25 Titrated oxygen with a target saturation rate as opposed to high flow oxygen has therefore been used in patients w ith ECOPD.26 Historically, pulmonary rehabilitation programs have focused on enrolling patients with stable COPD or patients who had stabilized after an episode of ECOPD, but in more recent times , a number of trials have explored the role of exercise/early pulmonary rehabilitation during an episode of ECOPD.27, 28 Chest physiotherapy using airway clearance techniques (including breathing technique, vibration/percussion, and autogenic drainage) are used routinely in many hospitalized patients with ECOPD. A Cochrane review published in 2012 found evidence that airway clearance techniques may reduce the need f or hospital admission and improve health- related quality of life based on single -center studies with small study populations .29 An update of this evidence is indicated. Furthermore, m any patients with COPD are in a state of hyper -metabolism in which their body consumes more calories per kilogram on calorimetric measures compared with a person without COPD, likely because of the increased work of breathing.30 This hyper -metabolic state is even more pronounced during episodes of ECOPD, posing que stions about the optimal nutritional support for patients with ECOPD.31, 32 Established treatments for ECOP D, such as antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids , may not be indicated in every single episode of an ECOPD. One uncertainty relates to the need for antibiotics in mild and moderately severe ECOPD, especially in an outpatient setting. 33 While antibiotics for treatment of severe ECOPD ha ve been shown to be beneficial in some studies, the need for antibiotics in less severe forms of COPD is unclear.34 Uncertainty remains regarding the use of systemic (oral, intravenous) corticosteroids relate to whether all patients stand to benefit from this treatment of ECOPD.34 These questions are important to address in view of trying to reduce prescriptions of antibiotics, where safely possible, to reduce potential advers e events including development of antibiotic resistance, and to reduce potentially significant adverse events from systemic corticosteroids, in particular hyperglycemia, in patients with glucose intolerance and diabetes. 35 Short -acting beta adrenergic agonists (SABAs) and short -acting muscarinic antagonists are established treatments to relieve dyspnea and improve airflow obstruction during ECOPD, but the benefit s of combining SABAs and SAMAs compared with using SABAs or SAMAs alone are unclear.36 Long -acting bronchodilator s and inhaled corticosteroids have historically only be used in stable COPD, but there is emerging evidence that an increase in dosage of inhalation therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long- acting beta agonists (LABAs) may be beneficial in early treatment of ECOPD when patients experience mild to moderate dyspnea and may result in no requirement of systemic corticosteroids in a large proportion of patients presenting with mild -to-moderate worsening of dyspnea. 37 The benefit of using LABAs and long -acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) in the treatment of manifest ECOPD is unclear. For antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids, the comparative effectivene ss of different agents (e.g. broad- spectrum versus narrow -spectrum antibiotics), delivery modes and durations of treatment needs to be established.38-41 3 In summary, determining the optimal treatment plan for patients with ECOPD requires 1) a synthesis of existing knowledge regarding the effectiveness of treatment options and 2) a synthesis of existing knowledge regarding the harms of t reatment options. Currently, the comparative benefits and harms of these varied treatment approaches including the optimal combination of these treatments to mitigate COPD exacerbation are unclear. A systematic review of current evidence assist s clinicians in understanding and determining optimal management for ECOPD. This review focus es on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the gold standard design for evaluating a therapeutic intervention. In terms of adverse e vents , they are also likely to be captured in RCTs because of the acute nature of condition being studied. Key Questions The following Key Questions (KQs) were determined based on input from multiple key informants, and the public ( drafted KQs were posted for public comment from January 26, 2018,to February 16, 2018. The related PICOTS (population, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, timing, and setting) are listed in Table 1. KQ1. In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD, what are t he benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics compared with placebo or standard care? KQ2. In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD , what are the benefits and harms of emerging and other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies c ompared with placebo or standard care? KQ3. In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD, what are the benefits and harms of combinations of treatments that are individually effective (based on empirical evidence in stable COPD)? KQ4. In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD, what is the comparative effectiveness of different regimens of antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids based on type of agents (e.g. , broad-spectrum v s. narrow - spectrum antibiotics), delivery modes (e.g., intravenous, oral), and durations of treatment? 4 Methods We developed an analytic framework to guide the process of the systematic review (Figure 1). We followed the established methodologies of systematic reviews as outlined in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Methods Guide for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews. 42 The reporting complies with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) statements.43 The study protocol is registered i n the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO #: 42018111609) and published on the AHRQ w ebsite ( https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/topics/copd/protocol ). Figure 1. Analytic framework for Key Questions 1, 2, 3, and 4 COPD: c hronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FEV1 = for ced expiratory value in 1 second; ICU = intensive care unit Literature Search Strategy Search Strategy We conduct ed a comprehensive database search, including Embase, Epub Ahead of Print, In- Process & Other Non -Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Registrar of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from databa se inception to January 2 , 2019. We search ed Food and Drug Administration, ClinicalTrials.gov, Health Canada, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), AHRQ's Horizon Scanning System, conference proceedings, patient advocate group website s, and medical society websites. Reference mining of relevant publication s, completed trials identified through ClinicalTrials.gov , relevant systematic reviews , and meta- analysis was used to identify additional existing and new literature . The search strat egy was developed by an experienced medical librarian and further peer -reviewed by an indepe ndent information 5 specialist. The same librarian conduct ed the literature search. The detailed search strategy is listed in Appendix B. Inclusion and Exclusion Crit eria The eligible studies had to meet all of the following criteria: 1) a dult 18 years and older with exacerbations of c hronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( ECOPD) ; 2) received pharmacologic intervention or nonpharmacologic interventions; 3) compared with placebo, standard care, for antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids : different types of agents , different delivery modes , and different durations of treatments; 4) reported outcomes of interest; 5) conducted in outpatient, inpatients, and emergency department; 6) randomized controlled trials (RCTs); and 7) published in English. We excluded studies conducted in the intensive care unit , or chronic ventilator unit or respiratory care unit ; studies of patients with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis if they did not have any evidence of airflow limitation on spirometry ( at any time, including during a stable state) ; and studies of health service interventions (e.g. hospital in the home as alternative to hospitalization) . We focused only on interventions during the initial acute phase of an exacerbation of COPD and not during the convalescence period. We did not restrict study location or sample size. The detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1. All outcomes were final health outcomes except for the intermediate outcome , \"forced expiratory volume in one second\" ( FEV1) was included because it is a com monly used outcome in COPD studies and has been shown to be highly predictive of final health outcomes during ECOP D (including mortality , need for intubation, or hospital admission for COPD ). 50 6 Table 1.

Studies inc luded by either reviewer were retrieved for full -text screening. Independent reviewer s, working in pairs, screen ed the full -text version of eligible references. Discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved through discussions and consensus. Data Abstraction and Data Management We developed a standardized data extraction form to extract study characteristics (author, study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, patient characteristics, intervention, comparisons, outcomes, and related items for assessing study quality and applicability). The standardized form was pilot -tested by all study team members using five randomly selected studies. Reviewers work ed independently to extract study details. A third reviewer review ed data extraction, and resolve conflicts. Assessment of the Risk of Bias of Individual Studies We evaluated the risk of bias of the included study using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool to assess sequence generation; allocation concealment; p articipant, personnel, and outcome assessor blinding; attrition bias; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. 51 Data Synthesis We summarize d key features/characteristics (e.g. patient characteristics , intervention, comparison, outcomes, and conclusions) of the i ncluded studies and present in the tables by Key Questions ( KQs). Table 2 present s the rules we used to categorize the severity of exacerbation. 8 Table 2. Categories of severity of exacerbation Severity of Exacerbations Rules Mild Outpatient treatment, possibly ED visit, but less likely than for moderate ECOPD OR classification as mild by the authors of the original study Moderate Requiring ED visit or hospitalization, but no mention of ventilatory failure (respiratory acidosis)/subsequent ICU admissions OR classification as moderate by the authors of the original study (including outpatients) Severe Requiring hospitalization, ventilatory failure (respiratory acidosis) and/or substantial rates of subsequent ICU admissi ons and deaths (studies with main location in ICU were, however, excluded) OR classification as severe by the authors of the original study ECOPD = exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ED = emergency department ; ICU = intensive care un it Table 3 lists the categories of adverse events and examples. Mor tality was repor ted as a primary effectiveness outcome and not reported as serious adverse events in this review. We used the definition of serious adverse events listed by the original studies . Table 3. Categories of adverse events Type of Adverse Events Example Allergy and Immunology Adverse Event Dermatitis Cardiovascular Adverse Event Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, palpitations, arrhythmia, symptomatic sinus, tachycardia Dermatological Adverse event Rash, urticaria, exanthema, pruritus Ear, Nose and Throat Adverse Event Transient episode of vocal cord dysfunction Endocrine Adverse Event Hyperglycemia, metabolism and nutrition disorders Gastrointestinal Adverse Event Gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea, nausea, stomachache, epigastric pain, heartburn, vomiting, constipation General Internal Medicine Adverse Event Facial puffiness, dizzin ess, new or worse hypertension, fatigue, chills, insomnia,, flushing, confusion, fever Hepatic Adverse Event Increased aspartate aminotransferase Infectious (Non -Respiratory) Adverse Event Vaginitis, urinary tract infection, influenza Musculoskeletal Adverse Event Muscle cramps, myalgia, tendonitis, rigors, musculoskeletal pain, muscle soreness Neurological Adverse Event Tremor, headache, seizure, rigors Ocular Adverse Event Blurred vision Oncological Adverse Event Classified as malignancy -related AEs by authors of the original study Psychiatric Adverse Event Mood change, psychosis, nervousness Respiratory Adverse Event Shortness of breath, respiratory acidosis, requiring noninvasive mechanical ventilation, dyspnea, Event Hematuria AEs = adverse events; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease For outcome definitions, we defined as a resolution or clinical cure of ECOPD a complete improvement of clinical signs and symptoms, and as a clinical failure the lack of a significant improvement of clinical signs and symptoms and/or the requirement for a dditional or alternate treatment for an ECOPD. A repeat exacerbation (or repeat exacerbation) was defined as a new ECOPD following the initial ECOPD. For dyspnea, we differentiated between dyspnea measured with a numeric scale that represented different severity levels of breathlessness (e.g. visual 9 analogue scale or Borg scale) and dyspnea based on a questionnaire that assessed the functional limitation caused by dyspnea (e.g. medical research council dyspnea scale). For crossover RCTs, we chose to qualita tively synthesize outcomes (i.e., not include d in meta -analyses ), as the included crossover RCTs suffered reporting and methodological issues, such as missing data, failure to control within- individual difference, and inhibited pooling with other studies . 52 For other RCTs, w e conducted meta- analyses to quantitatively summarize study findings. All statistical analyses were based on the intention -to-treat principle. Odds ratio and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals were extracted or calculated for binary outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated standardized mean difference when d ifferent measures for the same outcome were reported (e.g. St. Geor ge's Respiratory Questionnaire and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) for quality of life) and converted the direction of all measures (e.g. higher score represents better outcome). W e calculated wei ghted mean difference when the included studies used the same outcome measure. For adverse events, we calculated rate ratio (i.e. ratio of the incidence rate of events within a given time between the intervention and the comparison). For most of the outcomes, we extracted and pooled effect size by the end of the intervention and at the longest followup. For r epeat exacerbation, we extracted at the end of intervention, 1- month, 3 month, 6- month, 12- month, and longest followup, which were commonly used follo wup time points in studies that measured exacerbations . For hospital admission, we extracted 30 -day admission and at the longest followup. Thirty -day hospital admissions were chosen because hospital admissions within 30 days of an index hospitalization count as a readmission in Medicare's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, which lowers payments to Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with too many readmissions. 53 We use d the DerSimonian and Laird (D -L) random effect method to combine direct comparisons between treatments if the number of studies included in the analysis was larger than 3.54 The D -L meth od was chosen over alternative methods, such as the D -L with the Hartung - Knapp- Sidik -Jonkman variance correction (HKSJ) method and the profile likelihood (PL) method, because, when heterogeneity between the studies are low , the D -L method performs as well as alternative methods and the HKSJ method and PL method suffer methodological issues. 55-62 The HKSJ method and the PL method were used as sensitivity analyses for the D -L method (Appendix T able J.1.) . When the number of studies was 3 or less, we used the fixed effect method based on the Mantel and Haenszel method due to inst ability of between -study variance.63 We evaluated heterogeneity between studies using I2 indicator. We were unable to use statistical methods to evaluate potential publication bias as the number of studies i ncluded in a direct comparison was small (n< 20).64 All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata/SE version 15.1 (StataCorp LL C, College Station, TX). Grading the Strength of Evidence (SOE) for Major Comparisons and Outcomes We graded the strength of evidence (SOE) as per the AHRQ M ethods G uide on assessing SOE.42 We graded SOE for most important or critical health outcomes , including mortality, dyspnea, quality of life ( QoL), need for intubation, re peat exacerbation and/or hospital admissions and ECOPD resolution (clinical cure, failure). These outcomes were chosen because 10 they are clinically important from a patient's perspective and are highly relevant for decision making. RCTs started as high SOE. The domains to be used for all KQs were: the methodological limitations of the studies (i.e., risk of bias); precision (based on the size of the body of evidence, number of events, and confidence intervals); directness of the evidence to the KQs (focusing on whether the outcomes were important to patients vs . surrogates); consistency of results (based on qualitative and statistical approaches to evaluate for heterogeneity); and the likelihood of reporting and publication bias. In most cases, sensitivity analyse s based on risk of bias were not feasible due to the small number of studies per analysis. Based on this assessment, we assigned SOE rating as high, moderate, low, or \"insufficient evidence to estimate an effect\". SOE was rated as high when we were very confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect (the body of evidence has few or no deficiencies and is judged to be stable). SOE was rated as moderate when we were moderately confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect (the body of evidence has some deficiencies and is judged to be likely stable). SOE was rated as low when we had limited confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect (the body of evidence has major or numerous deficiencies and is likely unstable). SOE was rated as insufficient when we had no evidence, were unable to estimate an effect, or had no confidence in the estimate of effect. We produced summary of evidence tables for each comparison and for each outcome: data source, effect size, SOE rating; and rationale for judgments made on each domain of evidence rating. Assessing Applicability We followed the procedures outlined in the AHRQ Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews to assess the applicability of the findings within and across studie s. 42 We focused on whether the populations, interventions, and comparisons in existing studies were representative of current practice. For studies to have good applicability, the interve ntions used in research need to be available, accessible, acceptable and feasible to implement; and patients enrolled in the studies should be similar to typical patients with ECOPD, in particular in relation to underlying severity of COPD and co- morbidities . This congruence between research and practice as it relates to applicability was evaluated qual itatively and reported narratively. We reported limitations of applicability of the whole body of evidence in the discussion. Peer Review and Public Commentary A draft report was posted for peer review between March 29th and May 6th, 2019 and public comments between March 28th and May 6th, 2019. We revised and finalized the draft report in response to comments. However, the findings and conclusions are those of the authors, who are responsible for the contents of the report. 11 Results Literature Searches and Evidence Base The literature search identified 8,916 citations. An additional 36 references were identified through reference mining, grey literature search; and from Key Informants and Technical Experts. There were 98 original stud ies with a total of 13,401 patients that met inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review (Appendix Figure A.1.).

In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD, what are the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics compared with placebo or standard care? Key Points -KQ1 Systemic Antibiotics Versus Placebo or Management Without Systemic Antibiotics Antibiotics increased clinical cure of ECOPD compared with placebo or management without systemic antibiotics at the end of the interve ntion and at the longest follow up (moderate Strength of Evidence ( SOE )). Antibiotics reduced c linical failure rate compared with placebo at the end of the intervention ( moderate SOE ), but not at the longest follow up (low SOE ). Antibiotics improved dyspnea compared with placebo at the end of the intervention ( low SOE) but not at the longest followup ( low SOE). 12 Antibiotics did not change 30-day hospital readmission, repeat exacerbation, and quality of life , compared with placebo (low SOE) . No statistically significant difference in adverse events was observed , including serious adverse events, between antibiotics and placebo or management without antibiotics . Systemic Corticosteroids Versus Placebo or Management Without Systemic Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids improved dyspnea ( low SOE) at the end of the intervention and reduced clinical failure rate ( low SOE) at the end of the intervention, compared with placebo. No statistically significant difference in ser ious adverse events was found between systemic corticosteroids and placebo . Systemic corticosteroids were associated with statistically significantly less withdrawals but more endocrine related adverse events. KQ 1 Results Sixteen studies with 2,762 patients were included for KQ1. The characteristics of the studies are listed in Appendix Table D.1. Eight6, 68 -73, 82 compared systemic antibiotics to placebo or management without systemic antibiotics and eight74-81 compared systemic corticosteroids to placebo or management without systemic corticosteroids .

Details of the interventions used in each study can be found in Appendix Table F.1. Individual s tudies inclusion and exclusion criteria are in Appendix Table I.1. The overall risk of bias is intermediate due to unclear allocation concealment ( 56.25%), unclear and random sequence generation ( 43.75%) (Appendix Table E.1.). Systemic Antibiotics Versus Placebo or Management Without Systemic Antibiotics Seven studies6, 68-73, 82 evaluated the effectiveness of antibiotics versus placebo or management without systemic antibiotics , of which 2 studies were co nducted in patients with mild ,68, 70 4 mild to moderate6, 71, 72, 82 ECOPD and 2 studies69, 73 were conducted in pa tients with moderate to severe COPD. Table 4 and Table 5 provide an overview of all included studies. Tables stratified by the severity of ECOPD can be found in the A ppendix ( Appendix Table G.1 : mild ECOPD, Appendix Table G.2 : moderate to severe COPD). Mortality There was no statistically significant difference found between the antibiotics and placebo or management without antibiotics at the end of followup or at the end of the intervention. When stratifying studies by severity of ECOPD, the re were no statistically significant differences between groups in either mild or moderate to severe ECOPD. One study68 in patients 13 with mild ECOPD did not show a statistically significant difference between antibiotics and placebo in mortality at the longest followup. In patients with moderate or severe ECOPD, there was no statistically significant difference observed between groups in mortality at the end of the intervention or at the end of followup. Symptoms One study showed statistically significantly less dyspnea (measured by numeric scale) at the end of the intervention in the antibiotics group compared with the placebo group73 but not at the longest followup. Another study did not show a statistically significant difference in dyspnea 71(measured by questionnaire) at the longest followup. In patients with mild ECOPD , there was no statistically significant difference observed in dyspnea between groups. Cough was statistically significantly more reduced in the antibiotics groups compared with the placebo group at the end of the intervention but not at the longest followup. Other symptoms were statistically significantly reduced in the anti biotics group compared with placebo or management without ant ibiotics at the end of treatment but not at the longest followup. One study71 was conducted in patients wi th mild ECOPD. The study did not find a statistically significant difference in dyspnea or other symptoms between intervention and placebo . Studies conducted in patients with moderate to severe COPD showed stat istically significantly less dyspnea, cough and other symptoms at the end of the intervention but not at the longest followup in the antibiotics group compared with the placebo or management without antibiotics . 69, 73 Quality of L ife Qual ity of life (QoL) was measured in one study (in patients with mild ECOP D, at the longest followup) .71 There was no statistically significant difference found between antibiotics and placebo . Hospital Admission Thirty -day hospital admissions were measured in one study69 (including patients with moderate to severe ECOPD ) with no statistically significant difference between antibiotics and management without antibiotics . Repeat Exacerbations Repeat exacerbations at the end of the intervention, at 30 days , 6 months , and longest followup did not show a statistically significant difference between the antibiotics and placebo or management without antibiotics . There was no statistically significant difference found in re peat exacerbations when stratifying stu dies by severity of ECOPD. Intubations The need for intubation at the end of the intervention was assessed in one study69 (in patients with moderate to severe COPD) .No statistically significantly differen ce was found between the antibiotics and management without antibiotics . 14 Clinical Resolution of Exacerbation Statistically significantly more patients wer e clinically cured in the antibiotics group compared with placebo or management without antibiotics at the end of the intervention as well as at the longest followup. In patients with mild ECOPD , statistically significantly more patients were clinically cu red at the end of the intervention. Patients with mild ECOPD also had statistically significantly higher cure rates at the longest followup. Statistically significantly less patients on antibiotics compared with patients in the placebo group had clinical failure at the end of the intervention but not at the longest followup. In patients with mild ECOPD , statistically significantly less patients on antibiotics compared with patients in the placebo group had clinical failure at the end of the i ntervention but not at the longest followup. A crossover RCT 6 compared antibiotics to placebo in mild to moderate ECOPD patients. After 3 weeks, p atients in the antibiotic group were found to have statistically significantly more clinical cures (68% vs. 55%) and less clinical failures (10% vs. 19%) than those in the placebo group.

There was no statistical difference on serious AEs. Systemic Corticosteroids Versus Placebo or Management Without Systemic Corticosteroids Nine studies compared the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids versus placebo or management without systemic corticosteroids ,74-82 of which three studies were co nducted in patients with mild ECOPD ,74, 79, 82 four studies in patients with moderate to severe ECOPD,75-78, 100 one study in patients with severe ECOPD81 and one in patients with mild to severe ECOPD.80 Table 6 and Table 7 provide an overview of all included studies. Tables stratified by the severity 17 of ECOPD can be found in the Appendix (Appendix Table G.3 : mild ECOPD , Appendix Table G.4: moderate to severe COPD). Mortality The pooled estimate of three studies (all conducted in patients with moderate to severe ECOPD) did not show any statistically significant difference between the systemic corticosteroids and the placebo or management without systemic corticosteroids group at the end of the intervention or at the end followup. There were no studies measuring mortality in patients with mild ECOPD. Symptoms Dyspnea was statistically significantly better in the systemic corticosteroid group compared with the placebo group at the end of the intervention. There was no statistically significant difference in dyspnea at the end of the intervention when st ratifying studies by severity of ECOPD. Hospital Admission Thirty -day hospital admissions were measured in two studies (including patients with moderate to severe ECOPD ) with no statistically significant difference found between systemic corticosteroid and placebo group. Repeat Exacerbations Repeat exacerbations at the end of the intervention, at 1 month, 3 months , and longest followup did not show a statistically significant difference between systemic corticosteroid and placebo or management without s ystemic corticosteroids . There was no statistically significant difference observed in re peat exacerbations when stratifying studies by severity of ECOPD. Intubations The need for intubation at the end of the intervention and at the longest followup was fo und to be not statistically significantly different between the systemic corticosteroid and placebo group. There were no studies in mild ECOPD that assessed need for intubation as outcome. Clinical Resolution of Exacerbation Statistically significantly less patients on systemic corticosteroids compared with patients in the placebo group had clinical failure at the end of the intervention but not at the longest followup. In patients with mild ECOPD , clinical failure in patients on systemic corticostero ids compared with patients in the placebo group was statistically significantly lower at the end of the intervention. 18 Table 6.

One study76 reported 5 cases of serious AEs (unspecified) in the systemic corticosteroids group. There was no statistical difference on serious AEs or other AEs. 20 KQ2. In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD , what are the benefits and harms of emerging and other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies compared with placebo or standard care? Key Points -KQ2 Pharmacologic Therapies Versus Placebo or Management Without Pharmacologic Therapies The evidence was insufficient for the effect of aminophyllines , magnesi um on mortality, dyspnea, need for intubation, clinical failure, or hospital admission. Aminophyllines were associated with statistically significantly more gastrointestinal adverse events than placebo. No other statistically significant difference was found in adverse events between the remaining pharmacologic therapies and placebo or management without pharmacologic therapies Nonp harmacologic Therapies Versus Placebo or Management Without Nonp harmacologic Therapies Resistance training improved dyspnea, and quality of life compared with management without nonpharmacol ogic therapies (low SOE). Early pulmonary rehabilitation , commenced before hospital disc harge during the initial most acute phase of exacerbation rather than the convalescence period, improved dyspnea compared with management without nonpharmacol ogic therapies ( low SOE). Whole body vibration training improved QoL compared with management without nonpharmacol ogic therapies ( low SOE). Titrated oxygen reduced mortality compared with high flow oxygen at the longest followup ( low SOE). Vitamin D supplementation improved quality of life compared with usual diet (low SOE). Omega- 3 fatty acid enriched diet did not change quality of life, need for intubation, or dyspnea at the end of intervention compared with usual diet ( low SOE). Few adverse events were reported in studies of nonpharmacologic therapies. There was no statistically significant difference found in adverse events between nonpharmacologic therapies and management without nonpharmacol ogic therapies . Results KQ2 There were 51studies 25, 46, 65 -67, 74 -76, 83 -125, with 4, 280 patients included for KQ2. The characteristics of the studies are listed in Appendix Table D.2. Four66, 74, 113, 122 studies had patients with mild ECOPD , 625, 46, 65, 75, 76, 83 -112, 114 -121, 123 -125 studies had patients with moderate to severe ECOPD, and167 study had patients with mild to severe ECOPD .

Details of the interventions in each study can be found in Appendix Table F.2. Individual studies inclusion and e xclusion criteria are in Appendix Table I.1. The overall risk of bias is intermediate to high due to unclear sequence generation (49.02%), unclear allocation concealment (6 6.67%), and high risk or unclear risk of incomplete outcome data ( 56.86%) (Appendix Table E.1.). Pharmacologic Therapies Aminophyllines Versus Placebo studies114, 120, 121 evaluated the effectiveness of intravenous aminophyllines c ompared with placebo (Table 8 and Table 9) . All studies were conducted in patients with moderate to severe ECOPD. There were no statistically significant differences observed between groups in mortality, dyspnea, cough, other symptoms , FEV1 absolute, and need for intubation. Statistically significantly more patients in the aminophyllines group had total number of AEs and gastrointestinal AEs than those in the placebo group 114 (Appendix Table H .3.). No other statistically significant difference on withdrawals, other AEs ( cardiovascular AE, neurological AE, withdrawals due to AEs) were found. Table 8.

All studies were con ducted in patients with moderate to severe ECOPD. There were no statistically significant differences observed in FEV1 percent predicted at the longest follo wup and FEV1 absolute and dyspnea scores at the end of the intervention between intravenous magnesium and placebo. The intravenous magnesium sulfate group had a statistically significantly increased FEV1 absolute at the longest followup. There was no statistically significant difference found in FEV1 absolute at the end of the intervention between nebulized magnesium sulfate and placebo .

One N -Acetylcysteine study was in patients with mild ECOPD ,113 the remaining studies93, 96, 101, 116 were in patients with moderate to severe ECOPD. Tables stratified by the severity of ECOPD can be found in the Appendix (Appendix Table G.5 : mild ECOPD, Appendix Table G.6 : moderate to severe COPD). Erdosteine statistically significantly reduced repeat exacerbations at 3 -month followup but not at 1- month followup compared with management without Erdosteine ( low SOE). Erdosteine was associated with significantly reduced symptoms (based on the breathlessness, cough and sputum scale ) at the end of the intervention but not at the longest followup. FEV1 percent predicted was statistically significantly increased in the erdosteine group compared with the management without Erdosteine group at the end of the intervention but not at the longest followup ( Table 12 and Table 13) . No AEs were rep orted in both groups. Dyspnea and FEV1 absolute at the end of the intervention were not found to have a statistically significantly difference between the N -Acetylcysteine and the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference found in FEV1 absolute at the end of the intervention between the N -Acetylcysteine and the placebo group in patients with mild or moderate to severe ECOPD ( Table 12 and Table 13).

In patients with moderate to severe ECOPD, ICS were associated with a statistically significantly higher FEV1 percent predicted at the end of the int ervention compared with placebo, but there was no statistically significant difference found in dyspnea , 30-day hospital admission, and need for intubation between groups (Appendix Table G. 7). In patients with mod erate to severe ECOPD, a combination of ICS+SABA (budesonide+ terbutaline) was associated with a statistically significantly higher FEV1percent predicted and FEV1 absolute at the end of the intervention compared with placebo ( Appendix Table G. 8.). In patients with mild ECOPD , a combination LABA ) (budesonide+formoterol) was not associated with a statistically significant difference in FEV 1 absolute and clinical failure at the end of the intervention compared with placebo74 (Appendix Table G. 9). No statistically significant difference was found on total number of AEs, number of withdrawals and number of withdrawals due to AEs ( Appendix Table H .5). Eight unspecified serious AEs were reported in the ICS group ( 8 in the ICS group while 9 cases in the placebo group ). 25 Table 14.

In adult patients with exacerbation of COPD, what are the benefits and harms of combinations of treatments that are individually effective (based on empirical evidence in stable COPD)? Key Point -KQ3 No statistically significant difference in adverse events was found between any of the combined treatments and individual treatments. KQ3 Results There were 3 studies126-128 with 149 patients included for KQ3. The characteristics of the studies are listed in Appendix Table D.3. 1 trial was conducted in a hospital setting, 127 1 in the emergency department,126 and 1 in an unclear setting.128 Studies were conducted in Europe (2),127, 128 and in Australia (1).126 The average length of treatment was 14.5 days . Followup was not reported in any study. Details of the interventions used in each study can be found in Appendix Table F.3. Individual studies inclusion and exclusion criteria are in Appendix Table I.1. The overall risk of bias is moderate to high due to unclear risk of bias for most items, including sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, and unknown risk of other bias (Appendix Table E.1.). Three studies 126-128 assessed the comparative effectiveness of different inhalation treatme nts for ECOPD ( Table 51 and Table . Direct (SAMA) versus Salbutamol did not show any statistically significant difference in FEV1 absolute at the end of the intervention. Combination therapy with ipratropium + salbutamol (SAMA+SABA) 126, 127 did not result in a statistically significant change in FEV1 absolute at the end of the intervention compared with salbutamol (SABA) alone126, 127 or ipratropium of beclomethasone + salbutamol (ICS+SABA)128 was not found to have a statistically significant difference in clinical cure, clinical failure and FEV1 percent predicted at the end of the intervention compared with fenoterol (SABA) only.

In adult p atients with exacerbation of COPD, what is the comparative effectiveness of different regimens of antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids based on type of agents (e.g. . broad-spectrum v s. narrow - spectrum antibiotics), delivery modes (e.g., intravenous, oral), and durations of treatment? Key Points -KQ4 Comparative Effectiveness of Different Antibiotics Numerous antibiotics , given as empiric al initial therapy for ECOPD (in the absence of pneumonia) , were compared against each other but the ev idence was insufficient to estimate an effect on final health outcomes; except that l evofloxacin reduced repeat exacerbations at 3 of SOE) clavulanic acid was associated with statisticall y significantly more adverse events than telithromycin . Imipenem plus c ilastatin was associated with statistically significantly more adverse events than m eropenem. Comparative Effectiveness of Different Dosages o f the Same Antibiotic The evidence comparing different dosages of the same antibiotic was insufficient for mortality, clinical cure , and clinical failure. No difference in adverse events was found between t rovafloxacin 200 mg and trovafloxacin 100 mg. Comparative Effectiveness of Different Application Routes for Antibiotics No studies were found. Comparative Effectiveness of Different Durations o f Treatment With Antibiotics The evidence was insufficient comparing 3 day v ersus 10 day regimens of amoxicillin plus c lavulanic acid. No statistically significant difference of AEs was found between 3 day and 10 day regimens of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. Comparative Effectiveness of Different C orticosteroids The evidence was insufficient comparing the different corticosteroids for mortality, need for intubation, clinical failures, and dyspnea. There was no statistically significant difference in AEs found between the different systemic corticosteroids. Comparative Effectiveness of Different Routes o f Administration for Corticosteroids No difference between intravenous methylprednisolone and inhaled budesonide 40 mg was found in quality of life and repeat exacerbations ( low SOE). Inhaled b udesonide 40 mg was associated with statistically significantly less endocrine - related AEs than i ntravenous methylprednisolone . Comparative Effectiveness of Different Durations o f Treatment With Corticosteroids The evidence was insufficient comparing the different durations of corticosteroid treatment for mortality, hospital admission, need for intubation, clinical failure, quality of life, re peat exacerbation, and dyspnea. There was no statistically significant difference in AEs found between the different systemic corticosteroid durations . 45 KQ 4 Results There were 34 studies75-77, 129 -159 with 7,311 patients included for KQ4. The characteristics of the studies are listed in Appendix Table D.4. 14 trials were conducted in a hospital setting,75-77, 129, 130, 133, 140, 142 , 144, 146, 149, 151, 155, 159 3 in the Emergency Department,137, 141, 158 10 in an outpatient setting ,132, 136, 138, 139, 143, 145, 148, 152 -154 one in both outpatients and hospitalized patients ,156 and in 5 the setting was unclear.131, 134, 135, 150, 157 Studies were conducted in the US (4),77, 154, 156, 157 Europe (17),76, 130, 135, 138 -144, 147, 148, 151 -153, 155, 158 Asia ( 11),75, 129, 131 -134, 137, 146, 149, 150, 159 South America (1),145 and 1 study was conducted in 30 countries.136 Mean treatment length was 10. 6 days and mean reported followup was 3 months. Details of the interventions used in each study can be found in Appendix Table F.4. Individual st udies inclusion and exclusion criteria are in Appendix Table I.1. The overall risk of bias is high due to unclear sequence generation (50.00 %), unclear allocation concealment ( 79.41%), high risk or unclear blinding of patients or care providers (58.82%), high risk or unclear blinding of outcome assessors (88.24 %) and high risk or unclear risk of other bias ( 94.12 %) (Appendix Table E.1.).

Summary of comparisons between different antibiotic agents Note: Each arrow ed line represents a comparison between two treatments reported by the literature. 46 Fluoroquinolone Versus Aminopenicillin Plus Beta -Lactamase Inhibitor Three studies136, 150, 152 evaluated the effectiveness of a fluoroquinolone (either moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin , or (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) . There were no statistically significant differences observed between the groups in any of the outcomes ( Table 53 and Table 54) and adverse events ( Appendix Table H .22.). One study136 compared moxifloxacin to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and reported 97 cases of serious unspecified AEs (46 in the moxifloxacin group vs. 51 in the amoxicillin + clavulanic acid group). Four cases in the moxifloxacin gro up were considered as treatment related, including anaphylactic reaction, bronchitis, gastroenteritis, and tachyarrhythmia); while 2 cases (allergic dermatitis and radial nerve palsy) were reported in the amoxicillin + clavulanic acid group.

We assessed the effectiveness of systemic antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids and potentially emerging pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies stratified by severity of ECOPD. Further, w e assessed the effectiveness of combinations of treatments, and we compared different regimens (different agents, routes of administration, and duration of treatment) of antibiotics and corticosteroids. The majority of studies were conducted in hospitaliz ed patients with moderate or severe ECOPD with only a small number of studies conducted in outpatients with mild or mild to moderate ECOPD. Figures 3 and 4 are evidence maps that summarize the distribution of evidence for the effectiveness of interventions compared with placebo or management without intervention treatment. Lung function ( forced e xpiratory volume in one s econd ( FEV1 ) absolute or FEV % predicted) was the most commonly evaluated outcome. For most interventions there was only one randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) per outcome available. Figure 3.

The finding was independent of the severity of an exacerbation episode including in patients with only mild ECOPD treated as outpatients. The review did not identify any antibiotic (group) that was clearly outperforming another. There was low strength of evidence for the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids (oral and intravenous) to reduce clinical failure at the end of the intervention. No significant differences were found between different systemic corticosteroid ag ents or routes of administration. A 5- day course of systemic corticosteroids was not statistically different to a 14- day course based on the final health outcomes mortality, quality of life, re peat exacerbation, and need for intubation. Additional nonpharm acologic treatments showed in general more promising results than pharmacologic treatments. Some pharmacologic interventions had only been assessed for intermediate outcomes (lung function, symptoms) including magnesium sulfate, mucolytics, inhaled c ortico steroid (ICS) beta a drenergic a gonists (SABA ), and inhaled antibiotics. None of the pharmacological interventions that were assessed for final health outcomes (aminophyllines, ICS+ long-acting inhibitor zileuton) showed a significant improvement in any final health outcomes compared with placebo. In addition to intermediate outcomes, many studies on nonpharmacologic interventions assessed exercise capacity (e.g. 6 -minute walking distance) and/or quality of life. For nonpharmacologic interventions, a significant improvement in exercise capacity compared with management without nonpharmacologic was found for resistance training, early pulmonary rehabilitation, whole body vibration training , and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. This suggests that these interventions can potentially successfully address ECOPD- associated deconditioning. An improvement in quality of life was observed for combined chest physiotherapy (using breathing technique) and motion exercises, whole body vibration training, caloric supplements and vitamin D. Evidence from one study indicated that oxygen titration in ECOPD compared with high flow oxygen may reduce mortality. Chest physiotherapy is commonly prescribed in patients hospitalized for ECOPD; however, the evidence -base for chest physiotherapy, as shown in our review, is weak. There was no evidence of improved final health outcomes , other than reduced hospital admission, from relatively sma ll, low quality trials in our review. Inhaled salbutamol (SABA) and (SAMA) ) had comparable effects on lung function and combining the SABA and SAMA did not result in better lung function than either medication alone. Findings in Relation to What I s Known This review provides a comprehensive overview of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions in ECOPD. The literature on interventions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) and ECOPD has proliferated substantially in recent years with numerous published systematic reviews on different interventions for the management of ECOPD. F or clinicians, health policy makers and other end users of the evidence , it has become an almost impossible task to keep up with the ever increasing body of evidence on the management of ECOPD. This review therefore addresses an urgent need to provide an up -to-date summary of the current state of evidence for the management of ECOPD. 72 One of the main findings of this systematic review is that despite a proliferation of the COPD literature, the evidence base for most interventions in ECOPD remains low. While significant progress has been made in recent years in assessing interventions to prevent ECOPD (during stabl e COPD), the same cannot be said for acute interventions used during ECOPD. For the standard therapy of ECOPD with systemic antibiotics, corticosteroids and bronchodilators , many questions remain unanswered. While the discussion of COPD phenotypes (and E COPD phenotypes) has taken center stage on the COPD research agenda, very limited information on ECOPD phenotypes ( e.g. infective versus noninfective, high versus low eosinophil count) has been included in trials of intervention for ECOPD. In particular, w hether a response to systemic corticosteroid treatment of ECOPD depends on the blood eosinophil level remains unexplored. Studies on ICS for prevention of ECOPD in stable COPD suggest that patients with higher blood eosinophil levels might be more likely t o benefit from ICS treatment in terms of reducing the risk of ECOPD. 44 Despite the ubiquitous use of SABAs and SAMAs in ECOPD, we found only two studies (Key Q uestion [KQ] 3) that studied their effectiveness. The role of LABAs and l ong-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs ) in ECOPD remains largely unexplored with only one crossover trial identified in our review that assessed a LAMA versus placebo. Another important insight from our systemic review is that some nonpharmacologic interventions (resistance training, early pulmonary rehabilitation, whole body vibration training transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, caloric supplementation, and vitamin D) show promise, but the current evidence is largely based on single, relatively small RCTs. In stable COPD, pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the most effective (though underused) interventions. In recent years, there has been a significant interest in exploring the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients who have recently experienced an ECOPD or even in patients who are in the acute phase of ECOPD (e.g. before hospital discharge). Our review indicated that pulmonary rehabilitation during ECOPD may increase functional capacity (based on 6 -minute walking distance). A potential risk for increased mortality associated with pulm onary rehabilitation commenced during hospitalization for ECOPD has previously been flagged in the guidelines on management of COPD exacerbations by the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society, published in 2017. 45 We did not find a significant association with increased mortality for pulmonary rehabil itation or any form of exercise commenced during hospitalization. Our review did not include studies conducted in an intensive care unit (ICU) , chronic ventilator unit, or respiratory care unit, which might have contributed to the discrepancy in the findings. Also, a trial of rehabilitation commenced within 48 hours of hospital admission in 389 patients with exacerbations of different chronic respiratory conditions found an increase in mortality in the intervention group at one year ( odds ratio 1.74, 95% co nfidence interval: 1.05 to 2.88) . 46 Mortality was, however, not reported in the subgroup of patients with COPD and is therefore not included in our review. Given the potential of exercise programs during hospitalization for ECOP to ameliorate deconditioning and improve functional status, further research in this area is urgently needed. Other nonpharmacologic interventions during ECOPD that may improve functional capacity included resistance training, whole body vibration training and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. As these findings were based on single, relatively small studies, evidence from well - conducted la rge RCTs will be required to confirm these findings. Similarly, caloric 73 supplementation and vitamin D may improve quality of life in patients with ECOPD, but confirmation from well- conducted large RCTs is required before any definite conclusions can be drawn. Limitations For most interventions, only one RCT was available per outcome (KQ1- 4), which limits inferences from the quantitative synthesis. Failure to detect statistical significance for most of the outcomes may have resulted from type II error. There was some heterogeneity in the definition of the severity of ECOPD, although in general mild ECOPD referred to patients that could be treated in an outpatient setting, whereas moderate to severe ECOPD was used for hospitalized patients. A number of st udies included patients assessed in an emergency department with a broad range of severity of ECOPD. We used the definition of serious AEs listed by the original studies, which could have varied between studies. Defining resolution of ECOPD and differentia ting poor resolution from re -exacerbation can be challenging. We used outcomes as described in the original studies, which might have resulted in heterogeneity of definitions of ECOPD resolution and overlap between clinical failure and re -exacerbation betw een studies. Very limited information on ECOPD phenotypes (e.g. infective versus noninfective, high versus low eosinophil count) has been included in trials of intervention. We could therefore not draw any conclusions about interventions for different ECOP D phenotypes. In particular, whether a response to systemic corticosteroids depends on the blood eosinophil levels remains unexplored. Studies were overall at high risk of bias . This, together with the low number of studies per intervention/outcome, makes interpretation of t he body of evidence challenging. We were unable to statistically evaluate publication bias and only included studies published in English. An evaluation of completed clinical trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov showed that 62 percent (24 out of 39) studies were not published. Applicability Most studies were conducted in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe ECOPD, and the results of these studies may not be applicable to patients with milder forms of ECOPD treated in an outpa tient setting. KQ1 and KQ2 were stratified by severity of ECOPD , which allows determination of the generalizability of the results based on the severity of ECOPD. For KQ2 , almost all studies were conducted in hospitalized patients. As we excluded studies c onducted in an ICU setting, some of our findings may not be extrapolated to the most severely sick patients who require ICU admission for ECOPD. The results of comparisons of different antibiotic agents/classes a re context -specific, as the optimal antibiotic choice depends on local antimicrobial resistance patterns , which can change over time . The results of these comparisons (KQ4) are therefore not necessarily applicable to patients in different geographic locations and at different points in time. COPD terminology has not been used consistently in the past with some older studies referring to chronic bronchitis without airflow obstruction as COPD. We excluded studies with patients who had chronic bronchitis but no evidence of chronic airflow obstruction to increase applicability of the results to patients with chronic airflow obstruction. 74 Not all studies explicitly excluded patients with potential asthma or asthma -COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), and there is therefore a potential for misclassification. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a complex (multi- component) intervention, which consists of exercise training , patient education , and behavior change. The detailed interventions for pulmonary rehabilitation were reported in the included studies, which should facilitate reproducibility and applicability. While there are published standards for pulmonary rehabilitation programs , 47 these have been developed in the context of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with stable COPD (as opposed to patients with ECOPD) . Suggestions for Future Research Lung function (FEV1) was the most commonly assessed outcome in studies of int erventions to manage ECOPD, while final health outcomes, such as resolution of ECOPD (clinical cure, clinical failure) , and re peat exacerbation (with or without hospital admission) were rarely assessed. Future studies in ECOPD should focus on final health outcomes and include clinical resolution of ECOPD and risk of re peat exacerbation in addition to other final health outcomes such as dyspnea and quality of life. The response to antibiotic therapy as well as corticosteroid therapy in ECOPD likely differs based on the phenotype of the exacerbation episode. A number of st udies that used pro- calcitonin -guided treatment algorithms have been conducted on antibiotic therapy versus placebo in ECOPD,48 but identification of responders to systemic corticosteroid treatment of ECOPD based on blood eosinophils remains unexplored. This contrasts with the increasing recognition of eosinophili c phenotypes in stable COPD which appear to be more likely to benefit from long - term inhaled corticosteroids .44 Future studies on systemic corticosteroids in ECOPD should assess the treatment effect stratified by blood eosinophil count. Chest physiotherapy using breathing technique and/or vibration/percussions and/or positive expiratory pressure (PEP) is commonly prescribed in patients hospitalized for ECOPD, but there was insufficient evidence that these interventions improve outcomes. As these are resource - intensive interventions, large well -designed trials with final health outcomes including clinical resolution of ECOPD and repeat exacerbations should be conducted to assess the role of chest physiotherapy for airway clearance in ECOPD and inform clinical practice. It is currently unclear whether pulmonary rehabilitation com menced during hospitalization for ECOPD is associated with increased mortality. An increased mortality was found in the review conducted for the guidelines on management of COPD exacerbations by the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic So ciety but was not found in our systematic review. Given the potential benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation to counteract the deconditioning associated with ECOPD, we believe that conducting high- quality RCTs to answer this question should be a priority. The relatively new treatment options of whole body vibration and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and dietary interventions with caloric supplements and vitamin D need to be assessed in large high quality RCTs to inform recommendations about these treatments. Such literature (e.g., on vitamin D) is notorious for contradictory findings over time. Further research is required to determine the optimal route of administration for systemic corticosteroids, i.e. to determine whether oral corticoste roids are generally not inferior to intravenous corticosteroids and to determine a potential role of inhaled corticosteroids (possibly as alternative to systemic corticosteroids) in ECOPD . 75 Patients hospitalized with COPD exacerbations are at high risk for hospital readmissions and death after hospital discharge, which emphasizes the importance of improving the hospital -to- home continuum of care. Our systematic review only focused on the acute episode of an exacerbation and did not include health service int erventions, but there is an urgent need for research that assesses interventions to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes following hospital discharge. Much of the recent debate on adverse outcomes following hospital discharge has focused on reducing 30- day hospital readmissions in ECOPD, as the Medicare's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) lower ed payments to Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with too many readmissions within 30 days . Recent evidence, however, showed that implementation of the HRRP was associated with a significant increase in trends in 30- day post-discharge mortality among patients hospitalized for heart failure and pneumonia . 49 It is therefore evident that future research that aims to improve outcomes post -hospital discharge for any dise ase with frequent hospital readmissions including ECOPD should not focus on reducing 30-day hospital admissions in isolation but only in conjunction with final health outcomes such as QoL and mortality. Conclusion Despite a proliferation of the COPD litera ture, the evidence base for most interventions in ECOPD remains limited. Systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids are associated with improved outcomes in mild and moderate to severe ECOPD. T itrated oxygen reduces mortality . Future research is required to assess the effectiveness of several emerging nonpharmacological and dietary treatments. 76 References 1. Adeloye D, Chua S, Lee C, et al.
