Dr Vinod Paul stated that the country is richer in its knowledge of management of COVID19. He underlined the continued importance of COVID Appropriate behavior, avoiding large gatherings and ramping up vaccination.

States have been advised to ramp up the pace and coverage of COVID19 vaccination. DG, ICMR informed that the OMICRON Variant doesn't escape RTPCR and RAT. Hence, States were advised to ramp up testing for prompt and early identification of any cases. States were advised for target/prioritized testing of passengers from countries not \"at-risk\", as part of the ramped up testing by the states. Continued need for further vaccination coverage, adherence to COVID appropriate behavior and need to avoid mass gatherings was stressed. **** MV/AL HFW/Omicron Review Meeting with States/30thNovember2021/5 (Release ID: 1776404) Visitor 1788 "}
