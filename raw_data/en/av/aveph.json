There are many ways to channel your negative energy into positivity. We can fill our hearts with love and warmth! How do we do that? Through healing modalities, of course. What are healing modalities? Energy, also known as qi, prana, or force, surrounds us everywhere. All living things\u2014birds, flowers, trees, even us humans\u2014are expressions of energy. We live in a world of energy, and we can use a variety of energy healing techniques to heal ourselves and others. All matter in the physical world is, at its most basic level, various forms of energy expression. Everything in the universe is made up of energy that vibrates at different frequencies. Solid objects are composed of ever-changing, shifting energy fields at the quantum level. Even the life force of our ancestors lingers within us, for better or worse, as some find out. Feng Shui, or geomancy, is an ancient Chinese art of harmonizing human energy with the environment. Knowing how to use the energy of the environment is necessary for an optimal life as it increases your chances of success in a variety of endeavors, including business ventures, careers, relationships, and health and wellness. In the world of ancient Egypt, people acquired the knowledge of using cosmic energy for a variety of purposes, such as healing, agriculture, or even channeling rain through the lands. Besides these, there are many shamans and energy healers who can heal people through their bare hands! [All healing is self-healing](https://iamsahararose.com/single-post/highest-self-podcast-146-ultimate-way-to-heal-yourself-by-sahara-rose-d97/). Our bodies have amazing self-healing abilities. We are energy, therefore we can heal ourselves and others. If you are healing right now, this is for you: Products vs. Mind and Body Practices A lot of people often hoax people by offering magic cures in the form of products. They peddle magic drinks, chakra aligning headpieces, or even feathers to channel your chakra. These devices do nothing on their own. Whether it be crystals or feathers, anything can be used to harness spiritual energy. The problem arises when it is channeled into the wrong thing. Expert healing modality practitioners use these products as tools to accumulate and disperse energy. They are instruments and are only part of a system that requires a change in every aspect of our life. Yoga alone will not make a difference if you do not apply its principles to your everyday life. The mind and the body, together, are the foundation for any healing modality. For one to heal the other, both sides of your being must work in spiritual harmony. When the vessel is truly prepared, divine energy fills us all.

And different people will resonate with different types. Here are a few that I would recommend personally! 1. Acupuncture A very fine thread-like needle is inserted through the skin at a specific point on the body to manipulate qi. These needles are usually made of stainless steel, but gold or silver can also be used. These can be great for releasing negative energy from your life. Acupuncture sessions can cost anywhere between 30$ to 100$ per session. 2. Aromatherapy Many people think that \"aromatherapy\" means anything that smells good, like scented candles, potpourri, and perfume. Aromatherapy is the therapeutic application of plant essential oils (usually diluted in a solution) by qualified Aromatherapists. Different scents work on activating different chakras within our bodies. This helps immensely with setting the tone for our daily life. A consultation session with an aromatherapist can cost under 100$. 3. Aura Healing Being around a negative or angry person can cause those feelings to be absorbed into your aura. These foreign energies can significantly change your aura, leaving you feeling drained. There's a reason why the last three years of the pandemic saw us cutting off so many toxic people from our lives. They were affecting your energy, sunbeing!babes. Aura healing is achieved through meditation and visualization. Crystals work for this too! Different aura healers charge differently, depending upon the specifics of their practice as well as their experience. It may cost you anywhere between 100$ to 300$ per session. 4. Ayurveda The word Ayurveda in Sanskrit means \"the science of life\". Ayurvedic medicine originated in India. It is probably the oldest medical system in the world. Ayurvedic medicine is completely holistic. People who use it in their work create a harmony of body, mind, and spirit. The Ayurvedic belief is that maintaining this balance can prevent disease, treat acute illness, and promote long and healthy lives. This may include eating according to Ayurvedic dietary principles, practicing traditional medicine, or with the help of a well-trained practitioner in Ayurveda. In the Western world, Ayurveda is widely known as a form of complementary medicine. Many Westerners now use and enjoy Ayurveda in the form of massages, meditations, and cleansing/detoxification treatments. The costs will vary from practitioner to practitioner and can be upward of 500$ for a seven-day treatment session. 5. Breathwork When we feel panic and emphasize, our immediate (and often the potential ceremony) reaction is smaller and short breathing. This is less oxygen that leads to blood that is reduced by blood and makes our muscles intense to make us make it smaller. This includes some unique methods for breathing, which are commonly used in other areas such as Qigong, Tai Chi, and Yoga.

If you focus on breathing, your mind can easily work on your problems. These breathing exercises are generally safe for most people of all ages and all fitness levels and ages. The charges vary depending on the practitioner. Recommended for you: [Healing trauma through Breathwork] 6. Chakra Healing We have hundreds of chakras present in our body, but seven of them are considered to be the most important. Each chakra is associated with a specific part of the body and potential disease in that area. The higher chakras have to do with our spiritual side. If a chakra is out of balance, it can lead to major emotional, physical, and mental instability in all that the chakra controls. It also works in reverse. We can create disorder through our actions and emotions. You need to practice balancing the chakras so that energy can flow freely. This can be done through visualization of chakras and chakra colors, chakra meditation, chakra modifications, working with chakra stones, sounds, or with the help of a therapist. Many people like to wear a chakra bracelet or chakra necklace to remind them of the chakras and the importance of maintaining balance and health. Chakra Healing through practices such as Reiki can be anywhere between 100$ to 500$. 7. Reiki Founded by Mikao Usui, the word \"Reiki\" consists of two Japanese words: \"Rei\" meaning \"divine wisdom or higher power\", and \"Ki\" force energy\". Thus, Reiki means \"spiritually guided life-force energy.\" The Reiki method involves the delivery of universal life energy to stimulate mind/body/spirit integration to enhance natural healing mechanisms. Reiki practices can be more expensive, and sessions guided by expert Reiki healers can cost anywhere upwards of 200$. Ultimately, healing is a lifelong process that begins with you deciding to choose a better life for yourself. You are destined for greatness, little one. There is so much more to life than being stuck in an unaligned job that brings you no joy, or taking care of others while ignoring your own needs. Go out there and decide for yourself. It is not selfish to want to heal. Working on your wounds will not only usher joy into your life, but it will also help those around you. When you start living a life filled with purpose and joy, you show others the way to the light! You are a divine being, made of light and happiness! The universe did not craft you to spend your time lingering in the darkness. And remember, you are not alone.
