The principles are simple: - Support the body's natural healing (self-corrective) mechanisms. - Work with the body rather than working on the body. - Less is more (Work smarter, not harder.) - No judgments. These are not only the principles of my healing work but they are the principles that I choose to live by. Why try to \"fix\" the body when it can \"heal\" itself with a little support? Why use outdated methods that are invasive, painful, and providing only temporary relief, when we could harness the power of the nervous system to produce lasting results? My Story To be an expert in pain and healing does not come without costs. From birth, I was faced with health challenges, setbacks and traumas. I was born in Israel with a urinary tract dysfunction and structural deformities that required me to wear full-length casts on both legs for my first few months of life. After my family moved to Brooklyn, I had my first surgery when I was three, to repair my urinary tract. I had a similar surgery five years later. From ages 18 to 21, my favorite form of self-medication was escaping in the all-night dance parties of the underground rave and nightclub scene. While I dabbled and experimented with various drugs during this period, my drug of choice was and still is music, dance, and radical self-expression. In my early twenties, I was ridden with a rare and severe neurological pain condition known as cluster headaches, a debilitating head pain that sent me to the ER on numerous occasions. This illness is considered to be one of the most painful conditions known to medical science, and I can attest to that. After trying almost every treatment in western, eastern, and holistic medicine, from Imitrex injections to bodywork to spending time in hyperbaric oxygen chambers, I found relief from micro-dosing with plant medicine. After about a year of attending weekly bodywork-based psychotherapy sessions called 'Open Orgonomy', along with designing and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, I was finally able to achieve a state of harmony and balance in my life. In 2007, while lying in bed after a complete rupture to my Achilles tendon during a dance performance, I realized that it was time to make some changes. I decided to become trained in manual therapy and to obtain a degree in health sciences, so I could share my healing gifts with the world through my intuitive and caring quality of touch, heightened empathic listening abilities, and experiences with pain and suffering. I have made it my mission to serve others so they too can heal from physical pain and mental, emotional, and spiritual disharmonies. Over the years, I have become deeply passionate about various somatic healing and movement modalities that are based in subtle mind body consciousness work. These healing and movement methods translate in the effectiveness of our everyday life, our work, and our relationships, but also keep us profoundly connected to our higher selves. I love helping people become free from all their pain so they can perform at their peak, becoming supple and resilient as children and animals. Professional Career Edan is a pioneer in shifting paradigms around healing and wellness. He is an authority and educator in the world of health and healing. As a therapeutic artist and gifted healing facilitator, his sensitive touch, heightened awareness and intuitive abilities allow him to truly listen to the subtle messages of his clients' bodies. Edan's past experiences with debilitating illnesses, diseases and dysfunctions have given him the experience and capacity to work with anyone who suffers from pain. His life and practice completely transformed when he discovered the potent healing wisdom of Ortho-Bionomy and John Barnes Myofascial Release (MFR). Edan believes that the more modalities that the healing facilitator is trained in, the more tools he has to choose from during his clients' sessions. In addition to the above methods, he will sometimes incorporate partner acrobatic therapeutic work, which he calls AcroKinetic Mobilization (similar to AcroYoga) to help create space within the body and to incite the benefits of inversion therapy for the spine and fluids. In his free time, you can catch him dancing both on stages and at events, practicing some form of other movement art (such as the Ido Portal Method), in-line skating, skateboarding and long-boarding, slacklining, biking, snowboarding, surfing, traveling and spending time in nature.
