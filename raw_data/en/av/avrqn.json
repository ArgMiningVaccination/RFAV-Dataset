Reactions can happen right after taking a medicine, or over a longer period. Sometimes problems can happen even after a child stops taking a drug. These can include issues with blood cells, kidney inflammation and joint pain. We have vast experience in pediatric allergies. Drug allergies can look like other allergies or conditions. We listen to you and your child, ask the right questions and do testing to understand your child's symptoms. We provide a variety of allergy tests. We may recommend an oral challenge. In this test we watch your child after taking the drug by mouth. We may also use skin testing, blood testing and more. We create a customized care plan. We personalize treatment to your child. We'll help you understand the drug allergy, how to avoid triggers, and create an emergency plan. We offer drug allergy desensitization. In some cases, if your child needs a certain drug and there are no suitable alternatives, we may recommend desensitization. We safely introduce a medicine in small amounts over time, under medical supervision. "}
