I am content and happy I did.\" - Hans D. Ochs, MD, is attending physician at Seattle Children's Hospital. He earned his MD summa cum laude from the University of Freiburg, Germany. He completed his residency in pediatrics at the University of Washington. The focus of his research is the molecular definition of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD) and the investigation of new techniques to confirm the diagnosis. He and his collaborators contributed significantly to the identification of a number of genes associated with PIDD located on the X chromosome (CD40L, Wiskott-Aldrich STAT3 responsible for AD-HIES). Ochs started the Immunodeficiency Clinic at Seattle Children's in 1985, providing evaluation and care for both pediatric and adult patients with immunodeficiency disorders. He has initiated clinical trials for new immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous and subcutaneous infusions and has collaborated with the bone marrow transplant team in the design of new protocols for stem cell transplant and gene therapy. He was principal investigator for U.S. Immune Deficiency Network (USIDnet) and is co-founder and member of the summer school faculty devoted to primary immune deficiencies. He is principal editor for the medical textbook Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases: A Molecular and Genetic Approach and co-editor for Immunological Disorders in Infants and Children. - - I still remember the call I received while in my infants hospital room from a man with a thick accent telling me he believed my son had been misdiagnosed and there was a treatment available he would like to discuss. I had just been told my son would not live another year. We are celebrating his 18th birthday in two weeks and my only complaint is that beard of his. He is beautiful and perfect. And we owe every good thing to the amazing Hans Ochs. If he is an option for you, seek him out at all costs. You will be grateful you did - Dr. Ochs treated my two immune-deficient sons years ago when we lived in Washington. He was very helpful and straightforward in giving my sons what they needed and introducing us to IVIG. He has been a trusted resource I could call over the years even when we lived in other states. He is an excellent researcher. I would highly recommend him. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date Clinical Immunology Society President's Award Clinical Immunology Society Jan 1, 2009 - Other and neutrophil gene distinguishes SARS-CoV-2-infected patients by sex and age. 34027897 JCI insight, 2021 May 24 Ochs HDClass Switch Recombination Defects: impact on B cell maturation and antibody responses. 33276124 Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.), 2021 Jan. : 222108638 H, Bashashati M, Ghavami S, Orange JS, Ochs HD, Rezaei NCoronavirus: Pure Infectious Disease or Genetic Predisposition. 33973174 Advances in experimental medicine and biology, 2021 : 131891-107 -

Overview - Board Certification(s) - Allergy & Immunology - Universitat Freiburg, D-79110 Freiburg Im Breisgau - Residency - University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA - Fellowship - University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA - Research Description - Dr. Ochs' research focuses on the molecular basis of Primary Immune Deficiency Diseases with special interest in the genes that have been linked to the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome, Hyper IgM syndromes, X-linked Agammaglobulinemia, IPEX syndrome, autosomal recessive Hyper IgE syndrome. To improve the long-term outcome of these disorders, he has actively participated in clinical trials to develop immunoglobulin replacement, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and gene therapy. Dr. Ochs' clinical interests focus on the use of intravenous and subcutaneous immunoglobulin and the in vivo analysis of antibody production using Bacteriophage FX174. He and his collaborators contributed to the identification of several genes associated with PIDD located on the X chromosome, including CD40L, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein, BTK, and FOXP3. Recently, he focused on the gene Uracil-DNA Glycosulase, causing a rare form of autosomal recessive hyper IgM syndrome and on STAT3, the gene causing autosomal dominant Hyper IgE Syndrome if mutated. In 1995, he moved the immunodeficiency clinic from the University to Children's Hospital, providing diagnostic evaluations and clinical care for both pediatric and adult patients with PIDD. He initiated and maintained a successful cooperation with the bone marrow transplant unit since the early 70s and participated in the design of protocols related to stem cell transplantation for patients with SCID, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, GGD, and Hyper IgM Syndrome. He is a PI for the NIH contract supporting the United States Immune Deficiency Network (USIDNet) and member of the U.S. Summer School Faculty devoted to teaching fellows interested in primary immunodeficiency diseases. As co-editor of the textbooks Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases, A Molecular and Genetic Approach, 2nd Edition and for Immunologic Disorders in Infants and Children, 3rd Edition. The Ochs/Torgerson Lab focuses on: 1) The molecular basis of primary immunodeficiency disorders 2) Autoimmunity and Immune dysregulation 3) Regulatory T cells and mutations of FOXP3 4) Eventual consequences of heterozygous hypermorphic STAT3 mutations and their relationship to autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome. - Research Focus "}
