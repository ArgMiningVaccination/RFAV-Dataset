On top of that, many of our foods are deficient in vital minerals and nutrients. Nutrition IV Therapy can improve overall health, performance, and chronic illnesses. You may have heard of Nutritional Intravenous (IV) Therapy. Recently, they have become very popular. Many clinics in the greater Phoenix area are offering IV Therapies to meet the public demand and they are offered in some spas and gyms. But why all the hype and demand for nutritional IV Therapy, what are they and how do they work? What is Nutrition IV Therapy? Nutrition IV Therapy is \"nutrition in a bag\" given intravenously into the bloodstream. A needle or catheter is inserted into the vein and medical tubing connects to a bag of IV fluid. IV therapy is typically administered by an RN or doctor. However, a doctor should authorize its use. When it comes to [IV therapy](https://naturalmedicineanddetox.com/services-at-natural-medicine-detox/services-iv-therapies/) there are options, the most popular nutritional IVs are Hydration, [Myers Cocktail](https://naturalmedicineanddetox.com/services-at-natural-medicine-detox/services-iv-therapies/services-iv-therapies-myers-cocktail/), Vitamin C, and [NAD](https://naturalmedicineanddetox.com/services-at-natural-medicine-detox/services-iv-therapies/services-iv-therapies-nad/). They all have different health benefits, so it is important to gain a basic understanding to point you in the right direction. A diagnosis provided by a doctor will make sure you are receiving the right IV with the right amount of ingredients for your individual needs. The decision point depends on many factors such as your age, current medical condition, severity, and medical history. Types of Nutritional IV Therapies Hydration IV Therapy given in hospitals consists of saline solution, which is a combination of sterile water and sodium chloride (salt); in some cases, sugar which is not healthy. However, in clinics, spas, and gyms it's common to add electrolytes; these could include magnesium, potassium, B vitamins, sulfate, and calcium for hydration. Also known as the hangover cure, [Myers Cocktail IV Therapy](https://naturalmedicineanddetox.com/services-at-natural-medicine-detox/services-iv-therapies/services-iv-therapies-myers-cocktail/) is popular to do before an athletic event or just to re-energize. The late John Myers, MD designed the formula for conditions such as fatigue, fibromyalgia, muscle spasms, upper respiratory infections, seasonal allergies, Etc. Today there are many different formulas but typically they include Vitamin C, B-Complex, Calcium, and Magnesium. However, other ingredients may be added like Potassium B5, B6, B12, Glutathione, and Zinc based on your medical needs. Vitamin C IV Therapy helps boost the immune system and improve overall wellness. Additionally, it can increase one's energy and reduce stress. High-dose Vitamin C is also available in clinics typically for more severe conditions and the dose given depends upon the person's body and what it can absorb. A doctor should determine this. [NAD IV Therapy](https://naturalmedicineanddetox.com/services-at-natural-medicine-detox/services-iv-therapies/services-iv-therapies-nad/) (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is known to improve brain function and has anti-aging properties. It can also help improve mental clarity, and quality of sleep, reduce depression, lower stress levels, and boost energy. Often used with addiction recovery, NAD can drastically reduce withdrawal symptoms in people detoxing from drugs or alcohol. As an amino acid, NAD plays a critical role in cellular mitochondrial function. NAD is a naturally occurring coenzyme found in every cell, giving the body the energy it needs to survive. NAD levels decrease with age, and this can potentially damage DNA. In addition, NAD Therapy costs may vary depending upon the amount used and what other ingredients are added. NAD amounts vary but typically can be anywhere from 250 mg to 1000 mg. Depending on your particular health needs, we can also add electrolytes, B complex, B12, Vitamin C, Magnesium, Glutathione, and Zinc.
