It contains roots of Aconitum ferox, Solanum indicum, fruits Sodium Metaborate. As per traditional literature (Bhaishjaya Ratnavali), some raw materials need purification (Shodhana) before incorporation in the formulation. This work presents a comprehensive physicochemical characterization of raw materials, intermediates and the final product obtained during purification, using modern analytical techniques. The Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopic analysis of the alkaloidal extracts of Aconitum ferox showed loss of an ester group with shift in the peaks from 1720 cm -1 (C=O stretching of esters) to 1676 cm-1 (LD50-0.08 mg/kg) to benzoylaconine (LD50-24 mg/kg) The analysis of sulphur by X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimeter showed that purification brought about transformation of orthorhombic sulphur into monoclinic sulphur and it reverted back to original form with higher purity. The treatments given to sulphur and cinnabar with organic compounds made them homologous to the body tissues. Analysis of purified sodium metaborate showed that the processing led to loss of water and slight change in the crystal structure with the shift in the endothermic peak from 110.6 \u00b0C to 104.2 \u00b0C. Thus, the present study provides a scientific backing to the methodologies used by Ayurvedic practitioners. The study also provides physicochemical fingerprints for the standardization as well as characterization of raw materials and forms a technical platform for manufacturers to develop quality control standards.
