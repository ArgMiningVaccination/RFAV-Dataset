Please keep us informed if any new problems develop - even if you don't think it is related the reason you came to us for treatment. Changing symptoms can mean different things and only your homeopath is going to be able to assess how the changes relate to the homeopathic treatment and what to do about it. REMEDY ADMINISTRATION One dose of a homeopathic remedy usually consists of 1 to 6 pellets (depending on the size of pellet), the instructions on the container will give you the target dose. However, the exact amount is not important. Simply tap the container and take the amount that falls out. When taking homeopathic remedies follow these rules: - Never touch the pellets with your hands. - Carefully tap or shake the pellets out into the cap of the container or a clean dry spoon. If extra pellets spill out, do not put them back into the container. Use or discard them. - Place the pellets in the mouth and under the tongue (be careful not to contaminate the cap). - Let the pellets dissolve in the mouth for at least 30 seconds. Tell a child to suck on them until gone. - Do not take anything with the remedy or take anything else in the mouth at least 15 minutes before and after taking a remedy. This includes water. - Do not expose the open container to any strong odors (such as perfumes, cooking smells, fresh paint or camphor) or to other open remedies. - Take as directed on the container. WHAT TO DO IF: - Old symptoms reoccur: If not severe this is often a positive sign - wait a few days to see if they resolve. If they don't resolve or are severe, call the office. - New symptoms occur: If minor, wait a few days to see if they resolve. If they concern you, call the office. Once on a homeopathic remedy anything that you are experiencing is part of your homeopathic case. If you are sufficiently concerned, you may stop the remedy for a day or two while waiting for the call back from the office. - There is no immediate improvement: It often takes a while for improvements to appear this is why follow-up appointments are usually scheduled around four weeks. - You are getting worse: Call the office and stop the remedy. Usually this means the remedy is doing nothing and you need a different one. - An acute illness occurs (i.e., a cold, flu or other infection): Refer to our handouts or the website (i.e., Acute Infection Treatments, Cold Sock Treatment, Fever Therapy) or call the office. Continue to take your remedy. STORAGE - Be careful not to contaminate the pellets, container or cap. - Always keep the lid on tight (but not too tight). If the cap breaks or the seal comes out, contact us for a replacement. - Always leave the remedy in its original container. - Store it in a cool, dry dark place (not the refrigerator). If it is too hot for you, it is too hot for the remedy. - Store it away from strong odors such as food and cooking smells, mothballs, perfumes, camphor and strong smelling medicines. FACTORS THAT INTERFERE WITH HOMEOPATHY - Avoid strong aromatic oils such as tea tree oil (Melaleuca), eucalyptus and especially camphor, as well as any particularly strong essential oils or strong aromatherapy. Camphor is found in such products as Blistex, Carmex, Vic's Vapor Rub, and some liniments. Essential oil defusers are popular now and we are seeing problems from them interfering with the remedy. - Cut down if you are a heavy coffee drinker. - Avoid electric blankets. Waterbed heaters and the occasional use of heating pads are fine. - Whenever possible avoid adding other new types of treatment or medicines unless you have discussed them with your homeopath. It helps to have a stable \"baseline\" to evaluate the effects of the remedy at follow-up. However, if you must use another medicine or therapy and you do not have the opportunity to discuss it with your homeopath, do not stop taking the remedy. - Do not use any other homeopathic remedies unless using a first aid or acute remedy in an emergency situation.
