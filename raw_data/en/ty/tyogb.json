It is hypothesized that AK002 is more effective than placebo control (alternative hypothesis) in reducing the number of eosinophils per high power field (HPF) in gastric and/or duodenal biopsies before and after receiving AK002 or placebo versus no difference between AK002 and placebo control (null hypothesis). Recruitment Criteria | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |No| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Interventional| |Eligible Ages||18 Years - 80 Years| |Gender||All| Inclusion Criteria:1. Male or female aged 18 and 80 years at the time of signing ICF. 2. Average weekly score of 3 (on a scale from 0-10, recorded for either abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or nausea on the PRO questionnaire during at least 2 out of 3 weeks of PRO collection. A minimum of four questionnaires must be completed each qualifying week. 3. Eosinophilia of the gastric mucosa 30 eosinophils/HPF in 5 HPFs and/or eosinophilia of the duodenal mucosa 30 eosinophils/HPF in 3 HPFs from the EGD performed during the screening period, without any other cause for the gastric eosinophilia (e.g., parasitic or other infection or malignancy). 4. Subjects must have failed or not be adequately controlled on standard-of-care treatments for EG or EGE symptoms (which could include PPIs, systemic or topical corticosteroids, and/or diet, among others). 5. If on other treatments for EG, EGE, or EoE at enrollment, stable dose for at least 5 half-lives prior to screening and willingness to continue on that dose for the duration of the study. 6. If subject is on pre-existing dietary restrictions, willingness to maintain dietary restrictions throughout the study, as much as possible. 7. Able and willing to comply with all study procedures. 8. Female subjects must be either post-menopausal for at least 1 year with FSH level >40 mIU/mL at screening or surgically sterile (tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) for at least 3 months, or if of childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use dual methods of contraception, or abstain from sexual activity from screening until the end of the study, or for 120 days following the last dose of study drug, whichever is longer. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception from screening until the end of the study or for 120 days following the last dose of study drug, whichever is longer. All fertile men with female partners of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect their partner might be pregnant at any time during study participation. Exclusion Criteria:1. Known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the study drug. 2. Diagnosis of celiac disease or H. pylori infection as determined by screening EGD or a history of celiac disease diagnosed by prior EGD. 3. Presence of abnormal laboratory values considered by the Investigator to be clinically significant. 4. Grade 2 or higher lymphopenia (<0.8 \u00d7 109/L lymphocytes). 5. Any disease or condition (medical or surgical) or cardiac abnormality, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the subject at increased risk. 6. History of malignancy; except carcinoma in situ in the cervix, early stage prostate cancer, or non-melanoma skin cancers. However, cancers that have been in remission for more than 5 years and are considered cured, can be enrolled (with the exception of breast cancer). All history of malignancy (including diagnosis, dates, and compliance with cancer screening recommendations) must be documented and certified by the Investigator, along with the statement that in their clinical judgment the tissue eosinophilia is attributable to EGID, rather than recurrence of malignancy. 7. Treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the preceding 6 months. 8. Treatment for a clinically significant helminthic parasitic infection within 6 months of screening and/or a positive helminthic test at screening. 9. Use of any medications that may interfere with the study such as immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory with a daily dose >10 mg of prednisone or equivalent, during 5 half-lives prior to screening or during the screening period, except for omalizumab taken in asthma and/or urticaria patients where their asthma and/or urticaria cannot be controlled on other medications. In such cases, the dose of omalizumab should remain stable during screening and throughout the study. 10. Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to initiation of treatment in the study, during the treatment period, or vaccination expected within 5 half-lives of the study drug administration. 11. Known history of alcohol, drug, or other substance abuse or dependence. 12. Participation in a concurrent interventional study with the last intervention occurring within 30 days prior to administration of study drug (or 90 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, for biologic products). 13. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while participating in the study. 14. Any other reason that in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor makes the patient unsuitable for enrollment.

Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use.
