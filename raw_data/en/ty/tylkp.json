Just want to know how long these effects typically last.Also, don't have much appetite, just nervous eating. All my doctors tell me they have never seen this happen before. ( I really don't believe them) Also, should I go to cardiologist or neurologist ? ( having some chest pain and numbness in left arm) I don't want to take much of the Xanax, says it may be addictive, and don't need more side effects. Help Corisone shot injection side effects, how long do they last? 9 days now? Question posted by eice on 7 Sep 2011 Last updated on 7 September 2023 126 Answers Page 2 I never go t a bad reaction to it from food but others might. Doctor put me on Vitamin D3 and it works for me. If I stop taking it I start to feel weak again. I take 1 a day. I hope this helps. Also you could try magnisium. Ive heard that is good if you feel tired all the time. Ive started doing weights again so definitely the D3 tablets have helped me. Take care everyone and dont give up. Thanks so much for your reply, Matt. I have bought some magnesium tablets after some research and I've been just taking half a tablet every other day because I didn't want to introduce something new into my body that it might struggle with! Thanks for recommending D3 - I'll look into it. It's really really hard at times, but I just keep telling myself this is just temporary and my body's natural reaction to a foreign drug. It will get out of my system and my body will be ok again! I didn't think the injection had worked because my shoulder was still so painful. But now, 4 weeks on, I can feel my shoulder has actually improved. So it wasn't a complete waste afterall! Matt, I'm glad you've started doing weights again and I hope you continue to improve. Hi Lou. Glad you have some relief from your shoulder pain. Hope you keep improving. Ive found having enough water every day also helps. It will get better. It just takes time. Im glad the shakyness and twitching has stopped for me and aspecially the weakness. My doctor subscribed me Desunin 800iu tablets to take 4 once a day. I then bought some D3 (cholecalciferol) called Health4All on ebay 5000iu and I either take 1 a day now or a couple a day. All the best. Matt I had a 40mg. cortizone shot for poison ivy. 6 days later I was in the ER with a heart arrhythmia, and hyperglycemia. The MD said it was directly related to the cortizone shot. I'm scheduled to see a cardio MD. Told it will stay in my system for 3 months. Learn about this before you just take it. Afternoon. My Dad had a cortisone injection 6 weeks ago for trigger finger. It was depo medrone and lidocaine. 2 days after the injection he started not feeling right and since he has had extreme anxiety. Could this be from the injection and how long will it take for these affects to subside? He said it's ruining his life. Please help. Thanks Hi! Two days after my injection i got the same thing. I was hospitalized 6-9 times in one month and lost 11 pounds in two days. I have had severe anxiety for almost four months and ive felt disconnected/like im going to die (from anxiety?) Its derealization/depersonalization. I feel like my head is full of fluff/cotton and like i cant \"feel my thoughts\" and like nothing is real. I get tunnel vision and now have severe health anxiety. I feel high all the time and the not feeling my thoughts is awful. My breathing also is bad and i had hugh bp and heart rate, but im starting to get better with therapy. they say i have \"trauma\" which i do, but i also have the effects! Has anyone suffered the mental? does it ever go away? ill tell you the physical does but does the mental? With the disassociation/disconnected you feel like your head is above you. seriously, does it go away? i hate feeling like im not real. my thoughts dont feel mine and my head feels empty/static like an old tv. ugh Hi Emma, sorry your dad is going through this horror. It does get better, how long depends on his dosage. I am three months out and the insane anxiety has let up to about 6 hours a day instead of 24/7. Still have other symptoms though. (Try to avoid any med such as a Benzo or antidepressant to cope as these will have to be tapered if taken for a long time, and that in itself is horrific.) Best wishes. Thanks for the reply. They gave his some diazepan originally, just 4-6mg a day which wasn't doing anything. He's now been put on to Risperidone which he doesn't really understand why as this is to treat bi polar and schizophrenia! He's had this for 3 days and hasn't noticed an improvement yet. I think they should just increase the diazepan a bit. The doctors just say they can't rule it out but they don't believe it's the cortisone injection. I think he feels more anxiety as they are due to fly to Thailand in less than 3 weeks and he's worried he won't be able to get on the plane. Hope you're feeling better soon too. Also what causes the cortisone to give these sort of reactions? Is it where it gets into the bloodstream by mistake? My dad has had blood tests and they've not mentioned about cortisone being in his blood Hi all ,Im 3 and a half years out post shot,the side effects of this poison do let up ,everyone is different some heal sooner than others ,as far as PTSD yes i will forever have it and it did cause some residual side effects ,but i have come along ways in my healing ,The anxiety and other side effects will let up just have to give it time ,It angers me that these doctors dont tell the patients that this can happen ,Yes the mental part will heal My thoughts and prayers with all in healing Lost in AZ, thanks for keeping updating. What dosage of steroid were you on? It is very disheartening to see someone take years to feel better. But I am glad you are doing well. Take care. Hey lost in AZ, its been five months and I have PTSD. the physical went away but the anxiety and the disassociation stayed. does the disassociation/not feeling real ever go away? im afraid, and sad. i cant gain weight. please help. 118742 - Is what you're experiencing Depersonalization/Derealization? I've had that happen in the past from a reaction to something, and I've experienced it a couple times over the last few weeks (my cortisone shots were 2 months ago). It's pretty horrific and terrifying the first time. I got over it in time. For the anxiety, try L-Theanine supplements, as others here have recommended. It's been great for me. Oh sorry, didn't read your comment above where you said that's what it was. It took me about 6 months for DP/DR to go away. The best things were being around people and staying busy. Going to work and seeing people talk to me and react to me when I would talk to them sort of reminded me that I was a human. It was a long existential crisis for me, but I knew that my bizarre and troubling perspective wouldn't stop me from living. It just slowly faded away as time went on. After that 6 months, and since then, I returned mentally to exactly who I was before. The times DP/DR has happened recently wore off as fast as it came. I knew it was a sensation that goes away so it didn't bother me. I was more concerned at the time with spiraling down into depression again and the other mental effects cortisone has had on me. Hi! ive had it for ALMOST six months and its still really strong. its awful. will it eventually ever let up? Yeah, it will. Try not to think about it, keep going forward in life, and be around people you care for as much as possible. My dog's company has been the biggest help since I started getting my side effects. I've had it a couple times since I posted above (I'm the \"Inactive\" one - re-registered to pick a more discrete username), but the sensation hasn't lasted more than a day. I'm guessing it's tied to the shots, and as all your side effects fade, this sensation will too. My mind has been in some weird, weird places, but I'm 10 weeks out now and things have improved. I'm so sorry you've had it worse than others here. But remember that everyone has recovered in time. It was a great relief to read the comments because the symptoms that I am having after a cortisone injection were entirely unexpected because I had had an injection before with no ill effects. I had the injection into the joint of my right shoulder for impingement 3 weeks ago and I have not been able to sleep properly since, have no appetite, anxiety and depressive episodes all of which are uncharacteristic. I am going to start to take some herbal remedies to help me sleep because the [insomnia](/health-guide/insomnia.html) is making me feel very disoriented. I agree, it is so comforting to know that I am not alone on this journey of hell. I had 2 cortisone injections in my knees about 5 weeks ago. I am now on high blood pressure medication (which I have never had to be on), and am reaching for the xanax as needed... thank God for that drug. I am very prone to being anxious and have needed it in the past (the xanax), but have not had to use it for years. Now I can't leave the house without it. I'm also going through menopause, so I was already a hot mess. Why on earth don't the doctors inform you of the potential side effects the cortisone??? Anxiety, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, depression, no appetite, pain in my back and chest, tingling, waking up every day not knowing what the day will bring. I pray it will diminish soon. Helpful things: 1/2 xanax, yoga/deep breathing, giving yourself a break. This is exactly what I'm experiencing now. Just had the shot, thought it was my stress level but I'm so shaky making everything worse. Does the relaxation and anti anxiety med help? I've had terrible arthritis and bursitis and back pain and knee pain. I've had quite a lot of Cortizone injections over the last few years. Just this year I've developed weird symptoms to the shots right hip swelling at the site, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, and loss of potassium. We just connected that I am allergic to The preservative that is in the Cortizone injection. Has anyone else had this happen? And any advice on how to read myself of the preservative in my body? ksvan identified every single one of my symptoms... i thought i was going crazy. Just an update: So it's been almost 3 months since my 2 cortisone shots in my knees. My knees felt pain-free for about 6 weeks, but I'm still dealing with the aftermath of anxiety. Just because the cortisone is out of my system, does not mean the anxiety has left. It's like it triggered something in me, which I am still working on. I'm still on high blood pressure medicine form this (due to the anxiety), I am seeing a therapist (for the anxiety) and I am still on xanax, unfortunately, on a regular basis. After waiting a long period of time to get into a psychologist (it can take months), I will hopefully get on something that can even out my anxiousness (and now depression after dealing with this for 3 months). It is better than it was, but it is still there and has affected my quality of life. If you want to help others who probably won't read these blogs until after the fact (like most of us), write your physician who injected the cortisone. I did. I also printed of pages of this website with these testimonies so he wouldn't think I was imagining this or overreacting. I want him to know this can happen, and don't want it to happen to anyone else. He actually called me and we talked about what had happened to me. He said I was the first person with this type of reaction. (or maybe there are others who have, but haven't reported it). Prayer has helped me through this. I had two cortisone injections in my shoulder last Monday, ten days ago and spent the week with horribly strange depression and anxiety of some nebulous kind of doom feeling. I had a shot in the hand over a year ago but do not remember feeling like this but maybe I didn't notice it as much then... The past week I felt like I was going to just sink into a big hole and never come out or face anything. I am glad I am not alone. So, it must just be the cortisone. I am very tall and underweight so it makes sense that it could be this since I had two shots the same day. It is good to know it probably was the drug... Thank you everyone... I have had horrible emotional reactions to my recent cervical facet injections. I have had these before, and this is the first time I have had this reaction. I am very irritable, angry, teary, and depressed. It's awful. Does anyone know if there are any herbal or natural concoctions to help purge the steroid out of your system? The pain was terrible, but this is MUCH worse! I came upon this forum and wanted to add yet issues with cortisone injections that we find out about only after the injection is administered. I recently had severe pain in my shoulder and after being X-rayed turned out to be calcified tendonitis. The day after I was feeling very unwell... dizzy, weak, and had a stiff neck.. half my siblings are diabetics but I have been spared, so far; so my first thought was to check my glucose.. it was high, 188. I watched, very closely what I consumed for the next few days and monitored by glucose. This was a side affect I wasn't aware of. About a week after I started getting sudden blurry vision, feeling tired eyes, and waking up with headaches.. went to the optometrist to check my eyes... I was due a checkup anyway. My IOP (intra-ocular pressure) was very high (26, normal is 14-21), optometrist sent me to an ophthalmologist to check for glaucoma. After three visits with the pressure creeping all the way to 30 on the last visit, I was diagnosed with mild glaucoma (corticoid-steroid induced).. Now I have to put drops daily which also have negative effects - Worst part is, I don't know if will ever go away, I read the injections take a long time to dissipate from the body. Nowhere can I find how long they stay; I'm trying to find a natural way to flush it out.. Any information would be appreciated. I had a cortisone shot on 10/5/2018 for bursitis in my hip due to bone spurs. A week after the shot, I was in the ER with a BP of 230/100. I also had chest pressure and headaches. Question of heart attack, also a stroke? These were ruled out after a 24 hr hospital admission. So went home with BP meds 3x/day. I checked my BP often. I counted my pulse by just hearing it in my ears. When anxiety attacked, my heart felt like it would beat out of my chest, felt hot and cold, no appetite. My scalp hurt like my hair follicles were inflamed. My head felt like it was stuffed with cotton. Xanax helped me sleep so I'd forget my high BP. I prayed that I'd wake with no signs of stroke. It was horrible. I missed the holidays. I'm into my 4th month now and feeling better. [Anxiety attacks](/condition/anxiety.html) are less frequent and last a minute or so. BP is finally under control. Tinnitus is still quite loud. My scalp still hurts. Cold packs help relieve the pain. But I'm losing my hair. I haven't seen this mentioned here at all. But apparently it happens. There's a site about dogs losing their hair after cortisone shots for arthritis. I was so glad and relieved to see I'm not the only one in this situation. I hope and keep praying this will be over soon. I still have hip pain. I will limp along with my cane BUT never have cortisone shots again. I'm still here. 16 er visits in 4 months. Like u unsay Glen I wake every morning checking signs for a stroke or wandering what my blood pressure was today. My b.p. spikes came along about the 3rd month and these stress blisters on my fingers tips sides and palms. I was already on xanax before the Sept 19 shot 125 mg solu medral and get some relief but I noticed it seems to not help most of the time. Now I'm getting 3-4 hours of sleep with the insomnia with also came later also. My blood sugar dipped at the beginning and has gotten better. What a ride 14 ekgs, 2 CT scans of my head, a stressful tests, 13 blood lab panels.all showing nothing. Their so sick of seeing me they prescribed me clonidine 0.1 mg to take for the b.p. spikes but the symptoms u go through is crap 199/122 and within 3 hours I'm 110/80 then it rebounds when the clonidine wears off. Some days at a time it's 120/82 on its own then bam. I think like not knowing what the next day is gonna bring is what keeps me in turmoil. Tremors in hands come and go and facial twitches. It's like all the stress is in my chest area now. Still bein positive and trying to hold it together Thanx to these posts like yours. Thanks everyone. Just curious. How many of Ya including me became obsessed with their blood pressure. Checking it daily or several times a day. I've found that sometimes not knowing or checking it were my better days. It's like someone. Commented. The power of fear and paranoia it has on Ya. It's like a chemical cocktail on the nervous system. Oh no! I got a steroid shot last week and have felt absolutely horrid for the last few days. Symptoms include shakiness, heart palpitations, feeling weak, and feeling like I'm going to pass out when I stand up. And can't forget the increase in sugar level and blood pressure. I had an RA flare in my hand and instead of going to my rheumatologist (takes too long to get in), I went to my PCP. My pain level was at a 10 and pretty unbearable. My rheumatologist said she would never give me steroids because of my diabetes but my PCP gave me a shot and oral steroids (didn't take the oral meds because I was afraid). The good news is my pain level is very manageable. The bad news is I can't stand how awful I feel. Next time I will just go to my rheumatologist and bypass these steroids. Good luck to us all. Hope we all feel a little less horrible as each day passes. Going to doctors is pointless because every single one will tell you it's \"in your head\". None of them are willing to admit that something they themselves inject into patients could cause this much torture. I have been given these injections numerous times over the last 20 years. They work for rhumatiod as far as getting inflammation down.. Problem is that they also cause serious insomnia, paranoia, and anxiety. In my case that is part in parcel of the roll of the dice. Can I suggest that to combat these terrible side effects you try [cannabis](/illicit/marijuana.html) infused eatables. It does not guarantee a sleep but will reduce the \"speedy\" feeling considerably and let you function more like a normal person. I I usually find the worst symptoms ( sleep deprivation, restlessness, irritated, nervous, on edge) subside after around 3 to 4 weeks. To be honest I could not have the quality of life I have without these injections but the side effects are severe so its purley a matter of what suits you. Hi all Just checking in and wishing all a Merry Christmas .Aurthor 1970 ,never again will I ever get these shots , its not worth the side effects I would rather live with Pain then the Hell this caused,The number 1 problem is the Doctors not informing the patients of the severe side effects that can happen if i would of been informed I would of declined ,Anyways Hoping all is well as can be and Hang in there all,it does get better Lost in Az Hey lost in AZ, its been six months and I have PTSD. the physical went away but the anxiety and the disassociation stayed. does the disassociation/not feeling real ever go away? im afraid, and sad. i cant gain weight. please help. I have severe anxiety and depression from this and I feel ill never truly be myself again. it feels like there is cotton i. and around my head and like i cant feel my thoughts. I dont know. im numb. 118742,Hang in there,if you feel that you need help,seek it, I did and it did help ,this poison takes time to get rid of and yes things will get back to as normal as can be ,will you have residuals ,maybe maybe not ,but you go on and dont let it take anything else from you than it already has. Thinking of you Lost in AZ Hi 118742 and LostinAZ, I'm in the same boat. Most of the physical symptoms and chemical-induced anxiety/depression have stopped at 3 1/2 month mark. I thought I was free... until i realized that the trauma of it all really messed up my fight-or flight response. I can barely drive because I'm so nervous when doing so. Also, when I go places by myself I feel very nervous or experience DP. I started to become agoraphobic. I have to temporarily separate from my husband and live with my parents while I recover. By recovering, I mean teach my brain how not to panic while driving, etc. The good news is we WILL recover... it just takes work on our end and time. I've been pushing myself and driving further and further (2 months before all this i drove a 15-person van all around CA for a 2 week roadtrip. I was the only driver, so no, I never had this fear before). My period also has been non-stop. So that one hasn't gone away. Has anyone else had this issue? Is there another support forum we can go to? HopefulforHealing - Regarding the messed up fight or flight response, I've experienced the same thing. I'm at 3 1/2 months now and can feel very calm at times and free of anxiety, but I get easily stressed and when I do it's like getting hit by a train - blood pressure and heart rate spike and stay that way until I can retreat to a \"safe space\" (hate to use that term). I still feel way off from normal. My unnatural depression also ended sometime in the past month thankfully, like you. I have been researching anxiety and my other symptoms and it has lead me to thinking that the cause of this all lies with the Parasympathetic Nervous System, and possibly the Vagus Nerve to be more specific. Not positive, but worth looking into. Unfortunately, I haven't found another forum where this has been discussed. Hello everyone! I received my 3rd cortisone shot in my knee 3 weeks ago. The next day started with an extreme facial flush and continued to get them everyday for a week. Since then I get them every few days and now my bp is elevated, light headed, tingling, shaky hands, headache and combination of hot and cold flashes. Ugh, this has been miserable and Dr's keep telling me its bot possible to still be the shot. So frustrating because I did not have these extreme symptoms before the shot. I did have occasional dizziness and headaches but I had received 2 shots before this so maybe those were causing those symptoms. I feel maybe this 3rd shot sent my body into chaos. I have health anxiety and this has caused MAJOR anxiety that I have never felt. Please tell me this will get better and let me know if you had similar symptoms. Thanks! My symptoms are starting to get better, sometimes they seem to go for a few days but then reoccur however i do feel like they aren't as intense as they were, my main symptom still is the shakiness in my left arm plus the muscle twitches all over my body, I also had the tingling and light headiness but that has passed now, my bp was also elevated when the symptoms were at their worst but now that has returned to normal, I also suffered with anxiety as my doctor was saying that the symptoms were not connected to the injection however I believe they were, I have an appointment with a neurologist in a couple of weeks so hoping that could give me some answers, try to do things to distract yourself which is what others told me and was the best advice, the more you think about it the worse you feel, I wouldn't have thought a month or so ago that I would be feeling much better but I do, I think we just need to ride out the symptoms, I hope you start to feel better soon...

Thank you so much for the reply! All of the responses on here have helped so much knowing I'm not alone. Everything I read and every Dr said this isn't possible to still be having side effects when I clearly am. I'm just passed the 3 week mark so I'm hoping I feel a difference soon. Thanks again!

Praying for you and that you feel better also. Hoping your neurologist can give you some answers. Huge update for everyone here. After doing a lot of research I found out that Activated Charcoal removes corticosteroids from the body. My first dose was 24 hours ago and the cortisone side effects literally feel half as strong now. I don't want to get to optimistic because this seems too good to be true. I received a cortisone shot in my foot back on 6/13 & another one on 6/27. About a week and a half after the first shot I started having [severe anxiety](/condition/anxiety.html) where I felt as though I had been plugged into an electrical outlet. It felt as though my adrenaline had been turned on full blast 24/7. All I could do was pace around my house.I had no appetite and I got horrible insomnia. The first 2 weeks were the worst. Nothing I took would put me to sleep. I am 9 weeks out from the 1st shot and 7 weeks out from the 2nd. The anxiety is better. I still get it a little but nothing like it was. My main issue still is the insomnia. I can sleep if I take something but still cannot fall asleep on my own. I slept great before this and it is extremely frustrating that I can't sleep now. I have been rotating through different medications each night since they stop working if I take it too many nights in a row. I thought it would start to improve by now. I'm getting concerned that it won't get better. Anyone else have the insomnia issue? Did your sleep ever get back to normal? Hi Sj1234 it took me a year before things started becoming somewhat normal again.Hang tight .it will get better ,i know its hard to not stress about it , I had horrible insomnia it did get better,Healing thoughts your way , Lost in AZ I'm glad that I have found this thread... just wish that I had found it before my cortisone shot. I had my one and only last week in my left hip for an labral tear and a FAI. I was told that I received Marcaine and Betamethosone. Immediately when I got up from the table, I felt a terrible burning running up my GI tract. Later at home, I had the most horrible pain in my right chest and over my should to my back. I couldn't move my arm. I also felt like I had a terrible case of heartburn and a horrible headache. I could barely sleep from all the pain and discomfort. The next morning it was still bad. And added to it was a hot sensation running up my back into the base of my head. My voice was extremely strained and I couldn't speak well. I called the Ortho's office and was told to get home to 50 mg of Benadryl and Excedrine Migraine with a Mountain Dew. If I didn't feel better in 24 hours, I was suppose to go to the ER. Six days later now, my symptoms are better but still present. I am not sleeping well, feel loopy, trouble concentrating and more tired than usual. The headache is still nagging and the tightness in my voice/chest is still there. Do these adverse reactions last as long as the cortisone is still working in your body? I just fee like a slug. I haven't been taking the Benadryl daily because I need to go to work. In my opinion, yes the symptoms do persist until the steroid is out of your system. I'm at 5 1/2 months and most of the symptoms are gone, except for tinnitus and occasional mild anxiety which I never had before. I also had shakiness, heart palpitations, insomnia, hot flashes and depersonalization. It is the worst thing I have ever experienced. Gracefully, most of the symptoms have subsided. Can anything be done to help the symptoms? My chest tightness is very bad this morning. I went to several doctors, including a cardiologist after going to the ER. The response was always the same, the steroids will just need to get out of your system. For me that was almost 5 1/2 months. Have you been checked out by your dr? yes in my experience im stilling having side effects 1 1/2 years later ,Yes I still have tinnitus and i still have Anxiety which I never had before the steroid shot ,Hang in there it does get better ,It did change my life as i know it I now wear a Medical Bracelet that says NO STEROIDS they are not a cure for anything and I have autoimmune problems so It attacked alot more than normal Prayers with you ! Lost in AZ. I hope you are doing better. I prayed for you many times when I was going through my own difficulties. I hung onto words from another member who said it got better little by little and the symptoms subsided. Thank you everyone. It's just reassuring to know that I'm not \"crazy\". I have not followed up in person with my doctor... just the call the day after the shot when it was bad. I had a colon resection done in 2008 after two perforations in 11 months. I have been in pain since that surgery and I know the doctors think I am nuts. Come to find out... this FAI was clearly visible in an xray 4 years ago, but the radiologist didn't mention it. Now I have the labrel tear and an orthopedic telling me \"at my age, the repair surgery is difficult\". I'm only 54. I'm sitting here now after being at work for almost 9 hours and don't even have the energy to get up and go home. My head feels like it weighs 50 pounds. Thank you for the prayers.This was one evil drug ,I pray for everyone that has had to go thru what we all have . I am a 44 y o male. I had an injection 20 days ago in the base of my thumb joint and I am feeling shaky and twitchy with weak legs and dry skin on parts of my body. Has anyone else had weak legs? I went to the doctors about my symptoms 4 days ago and forgot to mention about the injection I had and he didn't mention it either or check my past medical notes. He asked if I took protein powder or injected but I don't. I had blood tests and will get the results in 3 days. mark1972 ,i had weak everything ,it is the steroid , it sucks, like the rest of us Im sure the doctor did not tell you what the possible adverse side effects could be . Hang in there and know your not alone Prayers to you sorry Matt1972 not Mark 1972 Lost in AZ, That you have had anxiety for over a year and a half is concerning to me. It's been a year since I had a shot of kenelog and I'm still having headaches, severe anxiety, and weakness/shakiness. Are you still experiencing symptoms as of now? Have you found that your symptoms are gradually going away month by month? Moon9, I know you addressed your question to Lost in AZ, but I wanted to encourage you. I had a severe reaction. It was terrible, including severe anxiety, shakiness, hot flashes, insomnia, heart palpitations, etc. I went to several doctors and tried everything including a vegan, gluten-free, sugar-free, dairy free and caffeine free diet. I lost 45 pounds and ultimately it just took time. After 8 months I would say 99 % of the symptoms were gone. I did walk a lot up to several times a day to help flush the steroids out of my system. I also drank herbal tea and water as much as possible. I wish you the very best, it does get better. I read Bible verses especially Psalms for encouragement. Much love! T I have not commented on this site for quite some time. I have reread some of the recent posts and my heart goes out to all those who are going through this nightmare. Quickly, my story: 2 corts. shots in both knees Nov. 2016. I have been prone to anxiety in the past, but have not been on anything for several years. After corts. shots, all hell broke lose... extreme anxiety, depression, weakness, chest pain, dizziness, heart palpitations, rapid heart rate, double vision, feeling \"out of it\", no concentration (most caused by anxiety, which makes you more anxious). Made 3 trips to the emergency room as I thought I was having a heart attack. Blood pressure spiked. Today I must tell you I am much better. I am taking the minimum amount of Lexapro. It has helped me immensely. During this cort. episode, I was taking 2 xanax daily. That small dose is not addictive. Trust me. It will help you. Take it. Yoga on you-tube for anxiety... do it. Exercise, walk, swim, anything you can, whether you feel like it or not. Stay away from caffeine. Take care of yourself. Read up on anxiety. The more you are aware, the better you will feel. Doctors don't tell you anything. See a therapist. My long term solution was Lexapro, as I am prone to anxiety (and menopause). I do not take xanax any more and I was not addicted. I took it for 5 months and weaned myself off, with no side affects. Incredible how ortho surgeon and my doctor were unaware of these reactions to cort. and not much help with anxiety other than take xanax. I printed off pages of this site to show them. Praying for all of you. Hang in there, it will get better, but it is hell, I know. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. Just be proactive and your own advocate. Knowledge is powerful. Do your research. This too shall pass. oh my word. I am done. I've been through the mill with drs and chiropractors. Months and months of treatment for lower back pain and muscle migraines from shoulder blades to eyeballs. They finally did an x-ray, so I have a 6 lumbar vertebrae and SI joint inflammation and grinding. Orthopedic doc decided I need cortisone shots, it's been 7 days of absolute insanity. I'm a previous diagnosis of PTSD bi-polar (2) generalized [anxiety disorder](/condition/anxiety.html) and spectrum mal adaptive. I had the actual flu back in Feb of this year had steroids then .. they made me feel like I was on the Iron man competition and was winning. Lol this time, I sleep 15 minutes then up 45 ... 15... 45. pain increase in knees (both) hips(both) hungry, angry, rapid cycling with intense emotions, quick responsive anger, frustration, confusion, combative. Cleaning, organizing, crying, Plus I stopped smoking last week, so I'm a darn hot mess. I do believe the not sleeping is from the shots as well as intensified feelings. Good question. Trust me the insomnia is definitely from the shots, this is a common side effect. The first month I could barely sleep at all and I was near delirious. I do understand what you are going thru I have the same exact symptoms and this premature ventricular contractions didn't start until after I had the cortisone injection back here in February 2016 I do know if you already have stress the injections will make it worst I know my body and I've had these injections in my foot in the past and it has never given me heart palpitations I had a EKG a week ago and that's when they told me I had PVC I had a EKG in 2015 when I had foot surgery and my heart was fine I do know the cortisone injection will slow down your metabolism which affects hormone imbalance which can cause anxiety my doctor confirmed this because I had heard the injections causes [weight gain](/article/weight-gain.html) but it slows your metabolism down. I had to get on Xanax as well and I'm not into taking medicine because of all the known side effects that they can cause I started taking turmeric a natural Herb and it gets rid of pain when you get a chance Google the benefits of turmeric, also potassium and magnesium will help with the premature ventricular contractions (PVC ) along with CoQ10. I researched PVC and it's harmless and can be cured with proper diet and some lifestyle changes.. Hope this was helpful I had a cortisone injection in my hand 2 days ago and am very jittery, anxious and just feel generally \"yucky\". This is a typical reaction for me with steroids. I can never sleep with prednisone at all and am hoping I don't have the same problem with this recent injection. Staying away from caffeine and drinking plenty of fluids may help some. Chest pain and numbness is not typical and I would definitely call your doctor. I had a cortisone injection 10 weeks ago for seasonal allergies. I have had massive anxiety, sleep issues, and [IBS](/condition/irritable-bowel-syndrome.html) like symptoms. I am now on Lexapro (5mg) and take Ativan when things get really rough. Although by any definition I still feel bad 8-10 weeks ago I was barely holding it together. I guess that is very very slow improvement. The weekends are the worse when I have to stay busy to distract myself from the horrible anxiety. I actually feel better working most days. I look forward to getting past this and actually relaxing doing nothing. Not there yet. Oh by the way the shot worked wonders for my seasonal allergies, but obviously steroids are poison to me so that will be my last shot. I know exactly how you are feeling. When i first started feeling this was I was really scared. It wasn't until I spoke to my pharmacist and a chiropractor who confirmed my feelings could be from the epidural. Of course the doctor is denying it. I had the shot in my back and I will never have one again. I've been terrible anxious, depressed and have trouble sleeping. Update to my Jan post. I am now 4 1/2 months out after my 80 mg cortisone injection for seasonal allergies. My anxiety, insomnia, and IBS like symptoms are finally improving. I notice the difference with the anxiety especially in the AM. My sleep although not 100% is slowly becoming tolerable. Still take Ativan 1-2 X/week and a low dose 5 mg of Lexapro. Not sure if the Lexapro ever even helped. Will never ever get a cortisone shot under any circumstances. Hope this helps someone. Im so sorry this is happening to you, I am now going on 8 months still having side effects ,the anxiety is still an issue I am on Ativan now this is POISON ,Reading on Mental health daily they say give it a year and your body should recover, I have under lying problems ,Immune System ones so this attacked me bad ,If you can go to an Endocrinoligist do it check your Cortisol levels,Still having sleep issues also What kind of side effects do you have? Are you feeling better Still having issues almost nine months ,Im Hashimoto so thus steroid has affected my hormone system bad the tinnitus and anxiety and depression are still happening The did just do a vit blood panel my d was very low so supplementing now 3 day can take 8 weeks to see any improvement this drug is POISON Relieved yet sorry to know that I am not alone in my discomfort/disorientation after receiving a Cortisone shot- my first - to my hip joint almost 48 hrs. ago. After reading a minimal amt. of info re: expected side effects which were for the most part glossed over and described as being minimal at worst, I am finding myself overly anxious, unable to remain asleep, nauseous, drowsy and very uncoordinated. I would e hoped by now this would dissipate however the discomfort is continuous and hasn't diminished in the least. Any recommendations from anyone out there as to how to minimize this experience. I'm considering purchasing some high grade fish oil capsules + nutritional yeast due to all the available amino acids present however at the moment feel rather lost. Any input at all would be consider as valuable to me. Thanks for any help offered. Sincerely, Roberti\u00f1o I hope I can offer some help to everyone on here. I will briefly explain my experience but understand this has been the worst 3.5 yrs of my life. I have zero history of anxiety or panic. I received a series of 3 cortisone injections into my hand with the last one being January 2020. Zero relief from any of them and no side effects until the 3rd shot. After the third shot I did not feel right. I did not sleep for 3 straight days and then started years of constant anxiety and panic attacks daily. Doctors dismissed me as developing anxiety overnight which was nonsense. I'm not going to go thru every symptom I had because everyone here knows how bad this is. I couldn't have anything at all food, drink, medication because every change in my physiology would cause a panic attack. This also screwed up my cortisol levels and my blood sugar. I am finally healing. This is what I did and I hope it helps someone out there. Find a natural medicine doctor who will order you a neurotransmitter test. I did mine thru ZRT and they were great. It doesn't matter who you use. All my neurotransmitters were bottomed out. They gave me a list of natural supplements and a diet to eat. Problem was I couldn't take any supplements at all because they would cause panic attacks. A lot of this also has to do with your gut microbiome. These shots destroy your gut bacteria. I started slowly taking a probiotic and worked my way up to Renew Life 80 billion. I also increased my protein intake as much as I could handle. Protein is the building block to build neurotransmitters thru amino acids. If you can handle supplements start taking an amino acid supplement. I couldn't so I only started with Taurine, Glycine and Inositol. Start taking magnesium and Vitamin D religiously. I took 400 mg of magnesium twice a day. I took Magnesium L-Threonate in the morning and Magnesium Glycinate in the evening along with Vitamin D 5000 IU 3 times a day. I also started taking a vitamin B complex. This took me a long time because my body couldn't handle those doses for a year. Hopefully everyone isn't like that but I truly believe these supplements are why I am getting better everyday. I've been thru hell but I have never given up on myself and neither should you. This is real. The shot did cause it. You will recover. Hang in there. I fully understand. I'll never get another shot again in my life. Very similar story. Was the most frightening experience. Mine was two years. Doing much better but nobody understands you. I lost 20 pounds immediately after. Couldn't eat. Complete panic. I had four injections in one day. Within hours I was in emergency with heart palpitations and panic. You will be better. It's not an easy road tho. Be well and know it does get better Hang in there. I fully understand. I'll never get another shot again in my life. Very similar story. Was the most frightening experience. Mine was two years. Doing much better but nobody understands you. I lost 20 pounds immediately after. Couldn't eat. Complete panic. I had four injections in one day. Within hours I was in emergency with heart palpitations and panic. You will be better. It's not an easy road tho. Be well and know it does get better I'm only 4 weeks past last set of injections. I like most others, was totally healthy before this and was on no meds. The shaking all the time is the worst and some panic attacks. The anxiety has eased up a bit. I now have started with insomnia. Three to four hours sleep a night. Right now I'm on a low dose of Valium to control the shakes but I hate taking meds and especially benzos. I just started the vitamin D/calcium/ magnesium but in low doses because my stomach can't tolerate it. My blood tests show my sugar and cortisol levels are normal. I started with a natural path and will ask about the neurotransmitter test. I'm sorry you have suffered so long. I hope and pray my recovery is much shorter and that you are back to normal soon! I had an injection in my hip Tuesday 10/25/16 at 0900. I had a steroid flare with excrutiating pain by 4pm,and couldmt walk. anxiety set in the next day along with heart palpitations. pain finally resolved Friday sometime after noon. still feel heart race occasionally. last night (10/29) I had abdominal cramps (charlie horse-like) while sitting in a chair studying, then insomnia ALL night even after [melatonin](/melatonin.html) and later a pain pill. I strongly believe it's related to the steroid injection. I had an injection this morning and now I'm in so much pain back and excruciating cramps. Should have read all these comments first. I would never have gotten the shot. Anxiety is very high not good for my blood pressure. My poor pets I'm sure think I have gone totally bonkers. Thank you all for your input. It gets better with time. I'm at a 100 days and still have symptoms, but they are better. Hang in there. It's not you, it's the drug. Keep telling yourself this. It will get better. How are my out doing? It will get better. I am have similar effects central nervous system can't sleep, anxiety, headache,. my nerves are tingling in my feet and hands. I just wanted to know how long this last? I am not feeling right. Unfortunately it takes time, and how much time is a mystery :( I've been on these forums for years now. I've seen anywhere from just a few months, to as long as 4+ years (I'm at 4+ years) but I'm the longest case I've seen. Seems most people are feeling back to normal within a year or two at most. My advice to you is... take it easy on yourself. Don't starve yourself, it makes it worse. Don't eat too little but don't eat too much. Try to focus on eating healthy foods that nourish your body. Don't do cardio or hard exercise, stick to yoga or even Pilates. I wish I had these tips when I first had all this happening because I accidentally made it worse by doing all the wrong things, like working out too hard and eating too little to lose the weight it caused. I was actually gaining more weight that way. Yoga saved my life, I can't recommend that enough. Also it might be helpful to talk to a therapist. My therapist helped a lot and actually believed me that the shots messed me up so badly. She said she's known people who got those shots and had awful side effects. You're not alone and it does get better. Just remember to take it a day at a time and take it easy on yourself. And drink lots of water! Thorne94 Have you tried donating blood? I'm at almost 3 years and have donated whole blood twice now recently, it makes somewhat of a difference. I presume because it directly removes some of the drug from the body in the blood. Interesting I went to the emergency room for heart palpitations it's was causing my nervousness and anxiety! They said my heart was ok but they could not get the Steroid out of my body! I've finally had the results of my mri back on my brain and all ok thank goodness, I still have muscle twitches and the internal tremor but it's getting better all the time and I'm around 19 months out from my steroid injection. Just feel better knowing neurologically I am all ok, I'm hoping one day this tremor and twitches will be gone. I am not able to get this cortisone type again the Dr told me I am allergic to this by getting the side effects! I have pinched nerves C5-6 and have to live with it I am exercising and going do physical therapy to help it. Very disappointing not to be able to get get the nerve block done! But I don't want to go through those side effects again it took almost 4 months to stop the medication reaction I am not able to get this cortisone type again the Dr told me I am allergic to this by getting the side effects!
