Reports/Comments: Provost Administrative Report James Holloway, Provost & Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Student Wellness & Student Mental Health update: On the side of prevention, the following are highlights of Health Promotions activities: Mindful Mondays Series (Wellness Journals) Stress Management series w/ Counseling Services providers for Resource Centers Mental Health Awareness Day/Month on October 10 -Bloom into your Best Self (collaboration with Dean of Students Office and Student Activities) Development of Podcast Series (Developing Confidence, Resilience, Toxic Positivity) Development of partnership with ASUNM for broader outreach to students We received funding from the State to move this program forward. I would like to particularly highlight an event this coming Monday, Bloom Into Your Best Self . This is an event being held to bring awareness to mental health, p roviding information to students about the resources available to them. UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING October 6, 2022 - 1:00 p.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 2 of 12 One of the many resources is TAO an online mental health support system. One of the goals for SHAC this year is to increase the utilization of the TAO system. We have had the system for a number of years, and it is not heavily used. Through the use of promotions, we hope to get the word out to students to increase use of the resources we have in place. Regent & Chair Rael: Can you tell us a little more about TAO? Provost Holloway: TAO provides a set of online modules that students, or anyone can go to. It is designed by mental health professionals as a self -guided system to take you through modules that help you identify anxiety or other specific mental health conditions and provide tools for managing those kinds of mental health issues. It is a self -paced set of modules. They are customizable by the user in the tool. This program has been in place prior to my coming to UNM but has not been publicized well. We are working to let people know that this program is available. SHAC has been making progress on the hiring of new positions. A new psychologist has started. A Mental Health Specialist will be staring very soon . An administrative position has been filled. Filling this position is a way to increase capacity. Right now, we have counselors doing administrative work. By filling administrative positions, the counselors are able to spend more time work ing with stu dents. There are benchmarks in place to improve services and access by students. The work to coordinate care continues. We have all of the direct service units across campus involved, meeting monthly. The mental health team meets every other week in an effort to move things forward. I believe SHAC has been pleased with the increased collaboration with psychiatry, better hand-offs in both directions. We also continue to have conversations with SHAC and HSC to look at increased integration in larger way s. A final point I will make is increasing publicity. Letting students know about mental health issues, destigmatizing mental health issues and making them aware of the existing resources available for treating mental health issues. I mentioned a couple of the new hires at SHAC. The difficult part has been hiring clinical providers, counselors . That search is continuing and has been expanded out of state. We are offering moving expense reimbursement. We are looking at hiring a search firm to help with this search. The plan is to go out and proactively recruit people to apply rather than passively receive applica tions . There is a change to the strategy and how we go after candidates. As mentioned, this is the most difficult piece. Therefore, I empha size that hiring of the administrative positions is an immediate way to increase capacity as it moves the administrative workload off the provider's plate. Person in Audience : Have we looked into the possibility to utilize master counseling students if they have to do clinical hours? Could they fill some of these rolls? Provost Holloway: We do currently use students in the Psychology clinic as well the Manzanita clinic in the College of E ducation and Human Sciences. Those clinics are actually used by students. They do represent one of those resources that we need to promote more. We have also looked at other kinds of online provider support that are getting a great deal of online marke ting pushes. The challenges with them is that the contract amount is of such a scale that the State would require us to go out to bid, which would require an RFP process. The other is that they are not quick to set up. They are long term investments. T hey customize what they are doing per campus. They have to hire new providers when they get new clients. Simply going to online does not give us a quick turn-key solution. The other issue that SHAC is very sensitive too is having counselors that are intimately tied in with student affairs so they can connect students with student affairs resources. We UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING October 6, 2022 - 1:00 p.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 3 of 12 have students that go to providers outside of SHAC, but those providers are not always aware of what is available in student affairs, that may be helpful in addressing the student's needs. The iss ues are never simply depression, anxiety, or a mental health condition it is always coupled with the totality of that student 's life. SHAC feels strongly that the counselors in SHAC, because of their connection with student affairs, have a leg up on supporting students. So that is another challenge with some of the alternatives. We have done a little over 400 trainings, since the start of the term, for faculty and staff to address crisis points for students and things that lead to students experiencing or expressing mental health challenges. The trainings covered: Academic Dishonesty and managing these incidents CARE Process Overview -How to complete a care report and why How to troubleshoot and solve student Issues Student Discipline Procedures Working with Difficult and Disruptive Students Regent Ko: Going back to TAO, how much does TAO cost to service and utilize? Provost Holloway: I don't know the answer to that, but we can get that to you. Ian May, ASUNM President: Do you have usage rates on TAO? You mentioned it was underutilized. Provost Holloway: I don't, but that is one of the metrics that SHAC has and wants to track and increase. We can include that in a subsequent report. Ian May, ASUNM President: As a follow up, as someone who has used the TAO portal and SHAC counseling, it is a supplement no t a replacement. I want to say that out loud. I know that is not the philosophy, but from a top down perspective it is worth saying. Provost Holloway: None of these is a replacement for the others. This has got to be a holistic system. Thank you for the question. Faculty Compensation Study: I have previewed this a few times and would like to start presenting results. This report is the first presentation of results from our faculty co mpensation study. Part of my goal here is for us to best learn how to talk about the results and what we can do with them. We have been exploring our faculty salaries in comparison to peers. We want to find the best practices we can develop to distribute resources that become available and increase salaries. The focus for today's presentation will be the Academic Affairs units in Albuquerque. We are looking at all tenured, tenured track, and lecturer ranks. We are looking at all disciplines. It should be noted, however, that some disciplines have special approaches to salary . For example, every business school is accredited by the AAC SB and they are required to submit their salary data. They then to national comparisons. Our school, Anders on School of Business has identified 47 peers and they are doing a salary study separate from this one, using the AACSB data. There may be some disciplines where it may make sense to do that type of targeted study. We have settled on utilizing the OSU s alary data. We aren't using CUPA as their data is not comprehensive for our needs. They do not include lecturers and there is not a consistent set of R1 universities . There is a lot of fluctuation with CUPA data when we look at R1 universities. We had previously used the CUPA data that included R2 universities. The data was less noisy, but also less comparable. This is why we settled on the OSU salary data. Several institutions in the Mountain West UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING October 6, 2022 - 1:00 p.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 4 of 12 use the OSU data . The difference is that the OSU data is gathered and submitted by institutional researchers at the participating universities and is very consistent . Our analysis looks at salary from a school/college le vel: how much do we differ from the average salary spend? What fraction of faculty earn less than average? How does this vary by group? Regent Rael-Sanchez: How is size defined in this context? Provost Holloway: For each school or college, in each discipline, how many full professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and lecturers for one of the comparative groups , all R1 universities, what is the average salary for each of these categories per faculty member , what is the average salary. We take that number times the number of our faculty in each of the categories and that gives us what we might expect to spend. We can also look at what fraction of faculty earn less than average and look at this across the school or department as well as by gender and/or racial identity. It is not the goal that everyone should make average. Some will be below. Some will be above, but it is a helpful comparator . If 100% of faculty are above average, that is in teresting. If 100% of faculty are below average, that is also interesting. This analysis will give us an idea of where we are skewed in terms of our distribution of faculty salaries. I would also like to say, we should not over analyze. We have to rem ember that one -half of the R1 schools are below average. Our funding streams are not necessarily average. We need to be cognizant of this as well. The analysis could give us spending targets hence, revenue goals but equally help us decide how to spend what we have. Every year funding is set aside for faculty equity, retention, etc. There has been no clear mechanism to help define the amount and for which unit. The ana lysis will assist me with that. It is impor tant to not that our salaries are not uniformly below average. There are some that are below average, but not uniformly unit to unit. It is worth noting that we are talking about base salary. Not all faculty make a base salary. Some faculty make above their base salary through a mechanism, base plus. There are faculty that make above base because they have a professorship that , in some schools, adds to their salary. We are only looking at base salaries and why other salaries might be different from that base. If we compare ourselves to R1 universities in the data set, 79% of tenured/tenure track faculty and 44% of lecturers are below average . If we look at the OSU region, which is all R1s in the southwest region, those numbers are 64% and 34% respectively. There are a lot of confounding factors that affect salary: experience, performance, etc. Comparing college by college is also important. In A&S 36% of lecturers below average while SOE has 71% below average. Looking at data at the aggrega te level doesn't tell the full story. We can estimate average salary per faculty by discipline in a comparison group. We can then compare average salary spend to UNM 's salary spend and see which unites have the greatest discrepancy. Salary spend is not uniformly distributed. Examples are shown on attached presentation. T. Constantinidis : Are we taking into account the cost of living in different areas? Provost Holloway: It does not. T. Constant inidis: In a way it does, when you are saying cost of living in the southwest region is probably more comparable than if you include a Berkley or Columbia. Provost Holloway: to some extent, although I wouldn't to much into that. It includes Colorado, which is not a low cost of living state. Another way that cost of living is , in some sense, accounted for is that we are averaging across a lot of schools and a lot of different cost of living rates. UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING October 6, 2022 - 1:00 p.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 5 of 12 I think the a verage of R1s is a good place to work towards. The next steps include refining how we present this data, discuss with Deans how they would like to approach adjusting faculty salaries in alignment with this data . I do not want nor do I have the visibility to stipulate what faculty should earn in a particular college or school. Deans have visibility and knowledge of other factors that go into determining salary. What we need is the systematic way for Deans to look at their faculty relative to the data that we have and make appropriate judgements on where adjustments need to be made. Finnie Coleman: It makes sense that Provost would not specify faculty salary in a specific college/school, but we do have priorities, I imagine that you would share with the Deans. I'm thinking in terms of studies we have done that identify the pay gap in terms of gender, for example. Are you setting priori ties in that way? Provost Holloway : That is part of the conversation with the Deans. In the data here, 79% of the tenured/tenure track faculty compared to the R1s are below average, 81% of women are below average. That is a gap that we might want to think about. I will say that the differences between units is greater than the differences between identity groups, gender, and race. Christos Christodoulou: I think the idea of having a strategy is very important. F aculty salary increases should not be without merit. Provost Holloway : I agree. Deans have the visibility in to performance and retention needs. What we need is for units to have clear performance metrics and measures so that is consistency and fairness into how that's done. We have some unites piloting structures like that, but there is no one- size fits all. Finnie Coleman: I want to be careful that we don't dismiss the notion of equity. Equity is fundamental fairne ss. I have members that don't do their fair share, but I don't believe that is an equity issue. Equity comes when we can see groups of faculty that are systematically underpaid for the exact same work. Provost Holloway: Thank you Finnie. I don't think that is what Christos meant. It is important to note, we really have two kinds of faculty equity issues. We have issues between UNM and other institutions, which is what today's discussion has mainly been about. We also have our internal equity issue. We have to be mindful about both. We have different revenue resources we need to marshal to try and address this. From the central level, my office, trying to figure out how to set aside significant I&G funds to continue to lower this difference between what we might expect to spend on salaries and what we actually spend on salaries is clearly an important priority. College of Education and Health Sciences There was a no confidence vote on the Dean in the College of Education and Health Sciences. I wanted to report the vote to this committee. There were 85 faculty invited to vote on the resolution of no-confidence. Sixty-four of those faculty voted in favor of the resolution of no-confidence. Th e remaining fifteen voted that they do not support the resolution. There were six that did not vote. At this time, I wanted to provide the notice of the vote as it is an important item within Academic Affairs . This happened during my absence. I've not had conversations with some of the key players as such I am reporting this without comment on what will or will not happen. Member Comments: Regent Schwartz : I appreciate you allowing me to be here today to attend this meeting. I would like to express my appreciation to the administration for their interest in and support of the basic need's UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING October 6, 2022 - 1:00 p.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 6 of 12 initiative , which has become an important part of what the administration is doing now. I think we all recognize that students cannot succeed unless they have adequate housing, adequate nutrition, adequate childcare, if they need it , and healthcare to include mental health care. This has all become so clear now and I appreciate the President's comments in this regard and her willingness to speak at the New Mexico Basic N eeds Research Summit held on campus last week. The summit brought together one hundred research ers from universities in New Mexico working on this very issue. The commitment is one that is extraordinary. I am also appreciative of what the university has done to move ahead on the mental health front, t o provide mental healthcare and substance abuse care to students at the university. There is a plan of action that is in place and being implemented. We have stumbled a little on finding counselors. There are 3.5 counselors. As we have heard , we can't staff our way out of this, however, those 3.5 counselors are fundamental . They are the pivot point for providing mental health care in the system we are developing. I appreciate the monumental work that Drs Zerai and McIver have done in this effort. I know we are working to fill the n ecessary positions and feel confident it will happen. I want to make sure we stay on schedule. I appreciate the weekly reports we are receiving and look forward to that continuing, providing just where we are in those positions that are still outstanding. I am hopeful that the positions will be filled, and we will have adequate care for our students by the next semester. Provost Holloway: Regent Schwartz, thank you for the comments and confidence. An additional project that Dr. Zerai is spearheading is development of a special allocation request to the State that will include, not quite, $2M to support student mental health and about $1M t o support basic needs, in particular housing and food insecurity Regent Schwartz: I hope that we will ask the legislature to be very generous in this area , because it is a year that I think they are very capable of being generous. I think that there are a lot of legislators that deeply understand the need in this area. Again, I appreciate everything that is being done in this arena. Regent Brown: I want to applaud the work on salaries and the effort to remedy some of the deficien cies. It produces fairness which helps us to recruit and helps us retain. It also mitigates the reaction we have from salary authors elsewhere. Regent Ko: I would like to echo the work that wa s done regarding basic needs and the announcement in partnership with the department of higher education. I would like to go back to TAO. I'd like to hear more about what we would find as a successful metric for this program. I would like to see if we could continue to be innovative on our delivery of mental health care basic needs to the university. One solution would be T imelyMD, which is a parent company of T imely Care, which is an experienced company addressing mental health needs of students . Along with that they offer care navigation and basic needs as well ; it encompasses a package in which those providers will survey our community and point students to services that are available at the university and in our community. I would like to have more conversation on how we can accomplish a more comprehensive, universal, preventative strategy on campus well -being at a future SSTAR meeting.

VI. Information Items: A. Research Update TAB H Ellen Fisher, Ph.D., Vice President for Research & Economic Development The OVPR's office has developed a Strategic Goals plan . There are five major goals and we are thinking about this over a 5- year time period , 2022-2027. This is a multi-page document. The goals are: Advance UNM's Stature as a World Renown Research University Create Transformational Educational Experiences for all students Enhance Customer -Focused Research Administration Establish Robust Partnerships with External Stakeholders Create and Employ Effective Communication Strategies Regent & Chair Rael: Who are the customers in the goal mentioned? Ellen Fisher: We have all kinds of customers. In terms of Research Administration, the primary customers we think about a lot are our funding agencies as well as our faculty and researchers on campus. I would also say there is the State of New Mexico community. Customer can be just about anybody, but it is about how we are helping to facilitate the research enterprise at large. As we look at the UNM 2040 Goals, we find that research has a connection to each one of them, as shown in the presentation. We are working really hard to be in alignment and support the 2040 Plan. During FY2022 we received just over 1600 awards . Research activity in dollars for FY2022 was just over $ 390M. Research expenditures were $309M , generating $60M in F&A. For FY2023 on main campus, we are on track and showing double digit increases over last year in terms of our research expenditures to date. We are on an upward trend.

For my perspective, I am really impressed by the capacity building in the research enterprise at UNM. On the Grand Challenges, I am particularly excited to see the substance use leveling up. We have talked about this for years. I think we have an opportunity to be a global leader in solutions in this category. Ellen Fisher: I would like to mention that we have an RPSP from CASSA going forward and will be presented tomorrow. This is one step in what we can do to level up in that area. Regent Brown : Excellent presentation. Regent Ko: To echo Regent Brown, excellent presentation. I think it would be helpful for the board to understand how many recent proposals are submitted and how many of those are awarded. I know we typically submit over a few thousand in past fiscal years. In FY2 022 we were awarded an impressive $390M in this FY , but in the future if we could break the information down from FY19 to present , doe that make sense? Ellen Fisher: It does make sense and we can provide all those numbers. I think the big caveat in looking at all th e proposals submitted, and proposals awarded is that we often submit proposals in one fiscal year, and they are awarded in another fiscal year. So , if we are reporting on a specific fiscal year, the numbers ca n look really confusing. This round, we chose not to show the breakdown because it does take a lot more effort to explain the numbers and talk about them to where everybody can understand the differences in all those things. UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING October 6, 2022 - 1:00 p.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 10 of 12 We can certainly provide the numbers, presenting the numbers as I've done here is the clearest and most direct way . As a function of fiscal year, this is the best way to do this. One other caveat on the proposals submitted and the awards received is that due to the variances of funding agencies, there is not always a 1:1 correlation between what is submitted and what we actually receive, even if it is the same project. Again, this can cause confusion. So, when we report the numbers like that it tends to be confusing because it doesn't report the numbers as a function of FY. Regen t Ko: I appreciate the explanation. Based on your caveats, I defer to your expertise. In a way that we can still analyze the data and see that we are progressing for the number of awards that we receive in research activity would be appreciated. Ellen Fisher: Regent K o. Another thing I will mention, is that I would like to understand what our \"hit\" rate is. What fraction of the proposals we submit are funded? This is another thing that is challenging. It sounds like it would be easy, but it isn't. Taking a deep dive into the analytics would provide us with baseline numbers that we can compare that are not skewed by things out of our control. Award dollars feel the same way at times. Clin ical trials for example , are f unded based on people e nrolled in the trial. You may get $1M awarded, but payment for cost (fee for service) are based on that patient and ultimately the dollars received on that patient may not be part of that award. The number go down in terms of expenditures . If we have larger awards, we tend to have fewer submissions because people have a lot more money. There are a lot of nuances in research dollars, but I appreciate the questions. Regent Ko: I think further breakdown is important. When proposals are awarded, a br eakdown of which campus and maybe a breakdown of the faculty. What we can further do to support faculty and students, those who are submitting proposals. I appreciate all the work on this. Finnie Coleman: Echoing the comments of others. This is a fabulo us presentation. I am so proud of what you and your office are accomplishing for the university. I think it is a watershed moment in our universities research history . Again, I'm very proud. I do have a question. I see many of the research opportunities in STEM. I am wondering what can we do to begin to provide opportunities for students who are not STEM students? Not just the undergraduates, but graduate students as well. I think it is important for undergrads to be exposed to research earlier in their careers . Ellen Fisher: I believe that research is education and people find their passion through doing their discipline. Our office does directly support Tim Schroeder' s office in terms of the undergraduate research artistry and design network that is being developed. Secondly, I think the FRESH program, although it is focused on faculty, it is focused on getting faculty extramural funding so they can support students. Although this is not directly for students, we have been working on structures in Dean's offices can apply for programmatic support for things they are doing that involve students. We are working on ways to do this so that it does not overtax the resources that we have. The CERT program supported a lot of students in liberal arts. We don't currently have a program s pecifically aimed at undergraduate or graduate in liberal arts, but we are thinking about how we can support efforts in those areas. I am working with the Associate Deans for research. Provost Holloway : We have talked about CERT program in this group before. We have talked about distribution and it is even across humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Like many liberal arts universities, there are opportunities for liberal arts students that are hard to find. That is one reason we created the Undergraduate Arts and Design Network. If students are looking for opportunities, I would certainly send them to that group. There are opportunities. We have supported students through the McNa ir program. It is not to say we have everything that we should, but we have more than what may be apparent. Greg Trejo: I am the A ssociate Director of Finance in Ellen's office. I always come back to numbers. While I agree with Ellen that we don't have any specific programs that support students in these areas, we do financially support various programs that then do that; like UROC and URA D. We also provide seed f unding to the College of Fine Arts . These are research dollars provided to schools that don't see much in research funding that will hopefully help them engage students in research . Ellen Fisher: If I had a magic wand, every student on this campus would have a research experience or scholarship. Some kind of discovery base learning experience to go with their degree. I feel strongly that that is how we keep students in school, and it is how we help them find their passion; w hat they want to be when they leave us. UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING October 6, 2022 - 1:00 p.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 11 of 12 B. Enrollment Update TAB I Dan Garcia, Vice President for Enrollment Management There are positive enrollment numbers to share with you. We have the third largest freshman class that we have seen in the history of the university. It is the first time we have been above 3500 since 2013. There are a lot of people across the university that work really hard to make this happen. The Regents, President, and Provost leadership allow us to do what we do. This is celebratory for everyone. Contributing to our increased diversity are our admits of first year students. We have substantially increased the offer of admission, particularly to students of color , in our first year admits. This is part of our plan to further increase diversity of our campus and be a better reflection of our communit ies. We have had a 14.1% increase 2021 -2022 Fall freshman first year students. Of this, 20.5% are from out of state and 1.4% are coming from other countries. Last year, we had about 25% coming from other states. We dropped a bit in percentage, but the overall number increased. New transfer students has gone up 26% this F all. Over the last 10 years, we have had a decrease in the number of new transfer students . At CNM, our largest feeder of transfer students saw a decrease of 35% overall enrollment. New graduate enrollment was down this year. However, it is at a numbe r that we were consistently seeing over a number of years. Overall enrollment, including HSC , is about 1.5% increase. First note of increase since 2012. However, we are not at the level we saw in 2020. It is a positive direction. When we break it down among AOP (accelerated online programs) has increased. Regent & Chair Rael: Are the increase s in AOP a result of more AOP programs or more students in existing programs? Provost Holloway: It is both. There are new AOP programs as well as increased enrollment in existing programs. Dan Garcia: Opportunity Scholarship - over 11,000 students across all campuses received Opportunity Scholarship money, in excess of $37M. This is just for the Fall semester. The recipient 's ratio, men to women, mirrors the total enrollment 60/40. The monies were very evenly distributed, mirroring our student populations. Student Persistence - In 2020 first year students, due to the pandemic, struggled. It was very unexpected. The good news is that we have rebounded a bit. We have a way to go, but we are improving. Regent & Chair Rael: If I understand the persistence data correctly, we are saying about \u00bc of our students do not show up for the third semester. Dan Garcia: Yes. The cohort we are looking at are first- time, full- time. There are those that are goi ng part- time and if we included those, you could see a different percentage. Regent & Chair Rael: What data do you have to access what happened to that group? What's the intervention plan? Dan Garcia: There are a lot of programs around campus. Within enrollment management, we have a Director of Retention initiative . She has 5 peer leaders that reach out to the cohort, they do this with first year and second year cohort to encourage and support them. To encourage them , remind them of upcoming dates. There are a lot of efforts across campus. We know the advising model has changed over the years , that resulted in a significant increase is student persistence and increased graduation rates. We can also go to the national student clearing house. They track students and we can see if they went somewhere else. They may have gone into the workforce. We can always survey students, although we don't always get a great response. Regent & Chair Rael: What is our target goal; our aspirational goal for persistence numbers? Our rational goal? Dan Garcia: I think it is 78 -80%. Those are our goals. I think that nationally for public universities it is probably it is probably 67- 70%. Four -year publics is going to vary depending on the school. If you look at University of Michigan, their persistence rate is going to be 95%. That is because they are very highly selective and can select students with 3.9-4.0 GPAs. We are providing access to students and maybe we need to provide a better assessment of their needs while they are here. Regent & Chair Rael : Do you have any data to what difference the opportunity scholarship made? Dan Gar cia: We use a financial aid scholarship modeling process . We work with a third-party vendor, which has experience working with hundreds of universities. We have identified the variables that impact the greatest on student's decision to attend. We modeled next year off similar mode ls we used this year. If we didn't package students with the opportunity scholarship, we probably would have had 400+ fewer New Mexico residents. New Mexico State saw an increase of 15% and it is likely due to the opportunity scholarship as well. I thin k the financial UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING October 6, 2022 - 1:00 p.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 12 of 12 incentive has been very important. I think that when they come for the new student orientation and they get advising and they see classes and meet others, if they are not a good fit, they won't come. Finnie Coleman: Do we have a way to get access to the data set that the numbers are drawn from? Dan Garcia: the good news, the office of institutional an alytics has uploaded all the data onto their website. You have to be careful when selecting variables, but there is a lot of date you can access. Provost Holloway : One of the things that Dan has done is to increase the speed of the process. When the student gets the offer early, admission early, and the offer of scholarship early, it influences their decision. Regent Ko: C an you comment on 3rd semester persistence based off race, gender, family income. Also, persistence rates for international, in -state, and out of state students? Dan Garcia: We do have that data. I didn't bring it with me. We can make it ava ilable in some mechanism to the Provost and he can send that out. Regent & Chair Rael: Is there anything in that data that would be particularly insightful? Dan Garcia: My recollection is that there were wide variances, based on race and ethnicity, in particular. Regent Ko: It would be helpful to look at that data . In the context of student wellness, basic needs, and mental health, do you have any thoughts on additiona l policies that could increase student retention? Dan Garcia: We h ave the Vice President for Student Affairs here with us. He is much more connected to student body. I think this is an ongoing discussion. Regent & Chair Rael: I think we could have a preliminary discussion, about what the data says about student retention . Dan Garcia: We co uld also pro vide a catalog of some of the retention related efforts Dr. Cheek put together previously. I could include some of what I have included in our strategic enrollment plan. I think that would give the board an opportunity to review in advance. VII. Public Comment VIII.

Reports/Comments: Provost Administrative Report James Holloway, Provost & Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Update set of killings in Albuquerque and the impact on campus: Today at 2:00pm, via Zoom, Chief Joe Silva and other UNM administration will conduct a UNM community forum to provide updates on where things stand and to hear questions and concerns. This will be an opportunity for us to learn the concerns of our faculty, staff, and students to see where we can address those concerns. The UNM PD is working closely with the Albuquerque PD and the FBI. We are as informed as we can be in the midst of an ongoing investigation. The Governor has also tasked State Police to work with APD in addressing the situation as well. UNM and APD are doing extra patrols. UNM Police are patrolling South to Gibson as some of these murders have occurred south of campus. UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING Special Meeting August 8, 2022 - 11:00 a.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 2 of 8 The City is prioritizing safety officers in the Muslim community . These are social workers who can work within the communities to provide support and information. The City is starting a meal delivery service for people in the community that are concerned about going out, particularly at night. On campus, we want to emphasize and reeducate our own community about some of the tools we have on campus. Including the service, we have to provide escorts from one end of campus to the other. We are surprised that there has not been an increase in requests for the escort service over the past week and think that people may have forgotten about that service. We would like to remind our UN M community to download and use the guardian app which provides on- campus and off campus safety tools. We have done a fair amount of safety messaging this past week and will continue to do so. We want to remind people of the blue light phones on campus that go straight to the UNM PD. We are hearing from impacted students about academic adjustments. We are working on a plan to accommodate that. More may be said this afternoon on that. Associate Provost Cheek: We are creating messaging to both faculty and student to make them aware that there are adjustments that can be made, prioritizing evening courses. Provost Holloway : Our primary approach to this is going to be a case by case basis. We are also looking at the impacts on staff and faculty and hope to hear more at the forum today. Faculty & Faculty Actions: UNM has 145 new faculty -95 in health sciences and 50 outside health. This is inclusive of HSC, central and branch campuses. I am very proud to report that number across all our campuses. We are getting better at inclusivity within the campuses as we are one university. o Half of the new faculty are persons of color and over half are female We completed 118 faculty promotions New Leadership: o Chancellors: Mike Holtzclaw is the new Chancellor at UNM Los Alamos, and Sam Dosumu is the new Chancellor at UNM Valencia o Eric Scott is the New VP for Student Affairs Research Metrics We are experiencing 5 -year highs Total expenditures through Office of Sponsored Projects (OSP) is up 16% Seeing a lot of growth in the research enterprise: 11% increase in awards through OSP and a 12% increase in awards at HSC EPSCoR (Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) This is a national science foundation program targeted at certain regions of the country to increase research productivity in those regions.

Associate Provost Cheek: I would like to give credit to Cindy Pierard with the library, Liz Amador with Associate Director of Financial aid, and Jenna Crabb, Director of Career Services. I just started the conversation and these individuals have been key in starting this initiative. Retention Data: Retention rate for the Fall 2020 -2021 cohort is +2.84. It is not up to where we want it to be, nor is it up to where we were right up to the pandemic. We know the pandemic had a real UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING Special Meeting August 8, 2022 - 11:00 a.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 4 of 8 negative impact on retention and we are starting to reverse that. The message I want to send is that we are starting to recover and reverse some of our retention challenges we've seen since the pandemic and we have a way to go. Retention percentage prior to pandemic was 77%. Regent & Chair Rael : Before we proceed to the informational items, I would like to move the member and advisor comments to the end for the informational items so that everyone has the opportunity to hear all the updates. I would also like to acknowledge that we have an honorary Co- Chair today, Regent Robert Schwartz. One of the important topics we will hear about today is mental health and wellness support for UNM students. There is some overlap with the SSTAR committee and the HSC committee which Regent Schwartz Chairs. Really, we are one Board of Regents and it doesn't matter what committee a topic falls under. We are all here to do what is best for our students and the community. Thank you for your work Regent Schwartz on this topic of mental health. Regent & Co-Chair Schwartz: Thank you for having me here today. I appreciate the SSTAR committee taking on this issue and pursuing it with such vigor. I have been pleased wit the way the University has been developing the mental health and wellness program to suppor t UNM students. VI. Information Items: A. Mental Health and Wellness Support for UNM Students: an TAB B Integrated Approach Assata Zerai, Ph.D., Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Stephanie McIver, Ph.D., Interim Executive Director, Student Health and Counseling A.Zerai , PhD : Introduced Dr. McIver. The goal for today's presentation is to report on our progress. Dr. McIver has been working on this for about 3 years, pulling everyone together and creating this integrated approach. Covid has had a huge impact on all of this. We have worked on this over the summer and want to provide an update on our progress in terms of strengthening UNM's delivery for mental health services to our students. Our goals today are to report on our progress. decreasing wait times at Student Health and Counseling (SHAC) providing greater support to students with substance use disorder , Dr. Tohen, in Psychiatry has contributed greatly to that effort designing an integrated approach across healthcare, student affairs, academic affairs, and other relevant units In an effort to prepare for the semester, w e are calling this the acute phase of this plan, which consists of: ramping up provider access-Kathy Agnew in HR has been especially helpful in this endeavor. o We have requests and received approval for 7 new positions at SHAC. The hires are in process. Integrated approach: making visible the bridges Dr. McIver has built across direct service and support units: UNM HSC School of Medicine , Dept of Psychiatry, and Behavioral Sciences . They provide specialty and subspecialty services including psychiatric e mergency services, inpatient care, and outpatient services for substance use disorder. We are rolling all of this into one package and hope to publicize on SHAC's website, the new mental health website at UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING Special Meeting August 8, 2022 - 11:00 a.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 5 of 8 https://mentalhealth.unm.edu/ . When students have an issue or faculty, or staff want to support a student that has an issue they can use the website as a way finder for mental health. S. McIver, PhD : T he effort is a convergence of a lot of bodies with an interest in mental health care on campus. In terms of college students and their mental health, Healthy minds network, which functions out of the University of Michigan and is associated with the Jed foundation collected data from a number of campuses. In 2020-21, >60% of students met criteria for one or more mental health diagnosis Mental health worsened , by self -report American Indian //Indigenous students have a significant increase in suicidal ideation All s tudents of color groups across all campuses still present to services less than the rate of white students. Here on our campuses, we have a CARE team which functions out of the Dean of Students office. It is a multidisciplinary team across specialties, and it receives reports from fa culty, staff, students, and even some parents about students in distress. The CARE team would lay eyes and evaluate what is the best approach for the student. The CARE team saw 200+ students last Fall between the start of term and the middle of October. The key issue is stress and coping with difficulty. Secondarily are roommate issues. We are being thoughtful in our approach as to how we can imbed mental health care in housing and residential life. This is where the majority of our cases originate. After hours with students in distress is our main issue on this campus. There is a new metric to determine how many clinical staff members are needed on campus. We know you can't hire your way out of a mental health crisis issue. We are trying to determine how many counselors we need to provide the type of service for the number of students that come through our doors. This metric is the clinical load index. We can develop a score to determine where we stand in comparison to our colle agues. Based on the metrics, the plan for hiring as recommended by the SHAC- Health System t ask force will includ e (per FTE): 1 .0 Psychologist, .50 Law School, 2.0 Counseling positions with .50 embed ded in African American Student services , 1.0 Counselor embedded in student housing, 1.0 training and development specialist/ social worker, 2.5 admi nistrative support, and 1.0 for a business analyst. New counselors (positions posted in July) will be hired by start of the semester. They will begin to engage with residence life, student services units, and the campus community more broadly by September. And the newly hired counselors should all be credentialed by October 2022, the time in the semester during which wait times from triage to assessment, typically begin to increase. We will have a new psychologist beginning in August. We expect that our new Mental Health Training and Development Specialist will begin by start of the semester (interviews taking place week of August 1 st). Further, crucial staff positions are expected to be filled by start of the semester (Admin 3 and Business Analyst). The UNM campus mental health team and direct services units (DSU) team will begin to meet monthly once again. We will have set benchmarks for improvement in services and increased student usage of those services due to increased staffing, and we wil l track those. Work will continue on an integrated approach to student mental health across Albuquerque, Br anch campuses, Heath Sci ences, and Athletics. B. Student Health and Counseling (SHAC) Fees and Revenues TAB C James P. Holloway, Ph.D., Provost & EVP for Academic Affairs UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING Special Meeting August 8, 2022 - 11:00 a.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 6 of 8 What we are think ing about is how we are going to pay for th is effort . I wanted to provide some inform ation about the funding of these efforts. This is focused on SHAC revenues where a large amount of this work is resid ing. The goal is to provide an update on what the finances in SHAC look like and describe what are possible sources of revenue to pay for these important services. It will be the work of the President 's leadership t eam with input from others to figure out what paths are we pursuing to address this. Prior to the current work on funding these 7.5 positions, there was a shortfall in SHAC legend. This year we are filling in about $500K this year using a com bination of leftover HEERF funds and re serves. SHAC 's main source of funds is student fees. Approxima tely a year ag o, we went to a per headcount model. Each student is charge d a certain amount and th at money goes directly to SHAC. Fiscal year 22 is the first year that is reflec ted. Based on the attached graph there is a drop in student fees. This is due to Covid. The university took a cut, enrollments were down, there was a large drop in SHAC student fee revenue. We u tilized HEERF money to fill in that gap. We also receive monies from billing insurance companies and service costs collected , i.e. co- pays. Overtime we have systematically added I&G funds. Revenue is al so received from sa les, i.e. pharmacy. Student s currently pay $107.00 per term, if they are taking 4 credit hours or more and $72 in the summer. Units that do not participate in SHAC , particularly the branch campuses, students can choose to pay that fee and receive ser vices through SHAC . The analysis shows that if we were to rai se the fees to $128 per term and $85 in summer, that would generate the money to cover the additional mental health services. Total recurring need in SHAC is ~$1.3M. We are currently fine. We do need to think long term. We can increase net clinical revenue, increase number of patients, find ways to build bet ter (work with insurance comp anies to pay for treatments), increase sales (SHAC looking into a possible Optical shop). There is also a con sideration of a legis lative ask around mental health support. We don't know what that looks like, but it is an idea. These are the ideas we are looking at. Some of these may naturally occur as we are back in-person and fe es may naturally go up. Increasing the student fees would be covered by opportunity scholarship. C. Enrollment Update TAB D Dan Garcia, Vice Provost for Enrollment Management Jose Villar, Director Student Services Dan Garcia : At our last meeting we talked about the development of a comprehensive strategic enrollment recruiting plan . We undertook this effort in 2019 and we finalized it, operationalized it, and it is ongoing work. It takes into consideration the university stra tegic plan; the mission and values of the institution and it reflects work across campus and bey ond enrollment ma nagement. Provost Holloway : T he State s tarted requiring us to submit a formal enrollment plan to them. We have done this for all of our campuses, and they have all been approved by the state. D an G arcia: This year, over all, our first -year applications were do wn, more substantially for non- residents than reside nts. However, we have made more offers to f irst-year st udents than we ha d in the previous year . These offers are critical and are ofte n accompanied by a s cholarship offer or a financial aid offer. Additional ly, it is important to note that we have made more offers to African Am erican, Hispanic , and American Indian students. Over the years we have modi fied the c riteria for scholarships allowing more opportunity for first generation, low income, rural, and students of color. Scholarships are vitally important. The o pportunity scholarship is this middle dollar, meaning that y ou can use both the lottery and opportunity to cover tuition and fees. It means that you can use your Pell grant and institutional scholarship for housing, meal plans, books, and other living expense s. We are very optimistic when we look the increase in applications this year . Transfer student app lications are up. We have more transfer students signed up for new student orientation than at an y point going back to 2015. The same holds true for first time students. It looks to be a very good year for new students coming t o UNM . Over the last 2 years we have seen a 1 9% to 20% increase in Graduate enrollmen ts. That trend dropped a bit back in the Spring, we are back to where we have been th e last couple of year s. UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUD ENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RE SEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING Special Meeting August 8, 2022 - 11:00 a.m. Scholes Hall, Roberts Room Page 7 of 8 Jose Villar : New students as well as their parents are introduced to SHAC as well as all the ot her servi ces availabl e to them during orientation . Students that have been away from the university for 3 semesters are expected to complete an online or ientation . The y are re -introduced to the services available at the university. We've offered 11 first year orientations, 11 family connection or ientations , 7 transfer orientations, and some \" NSO to Go \" which are v irtual orientations for students' safety as we ll. Out of state students must complete the online orientation before th ey can register for classes. Based on the numbers we are seeing at orientation we are expecti ng an incoming class of a pproximately 3400. For the incoming first year class, 46.97 % identify as first -generation for college. UNM was just designated as a first -generation forward institution by NASPA, the National Associat ion of Student Professional s. This is a tribute to the recruiting effor ts and shows that we are cl osing the gap on access to education for those underrepresented families. Member Comments: Provost Holloway: I wo uld like to say thank you to Dan and his team , Jose , and his team. They have done some amazing work. Wh en you see, over the last couple years, universities across the country have seen significa nt drops in enrollments and we are seeing growth with numbers higher than we' ve seen since 2016, 2017 is really remarkable . Regent & Chair Rael : At a future meeting, I w ould like to see a deeper dive into where we see graduate enrollment going and w hat we are doing about the decline. Provost Holloway: One of the things we are starti ng to do with graduate student enrollment is taking an enrollment man agement approach. Graduate student admission and enrollment is usu ally a very distributive. Departments and units do their own graduate admissions and recruiting. W e are starting by looking at the p ipeline. We do n't usually monitor the same retention data that we do for undergraduates. We are starting to do that . We are working on this. Student Regent Ko: Does the first- year convo cation include transfer and graduate students? If it doesn't, could we increase sen se of b elonging by including them? Jose Villar: It is not inclusive of tr ansfer students; however, all of the e vents are adver tised to transfer students . The office of advisement strategies recently hired a transfer coordinator. We are hosting a transfer week. We roll out the red carpet for our students. It is our tr ansfer st udents that are our livelihood. We are going to do a much better job as a university and work with our branch campuses to make sure they have that support. Prov ost Holloway : I would like to c larify what a tra nsfer student is. These are students that could be simultaneously enrolled at a branch campus, CNM, and main campus, students that will go to CNM for a term, UNM for a term, and Hobbs for a term. I call them multi -institution students. There is this group of students that do not identify with a particular univer sity in the traditional way of thinking. I appreciate the concern for how we build identity and community for those students. W e are working on way to support the multi- institu tion student. Advisor Comments: ASUNM President May : I am excited for all of the strides we talked about today. I would like to highlight the importance of having stu dent voices in these rooms. Thank you, Dr. McIver , for inviting ASUNM to be involved. I would als o like us to explore other ways of funding the mental health initiative before we rai se the fee that students pay . VI.

As at the UNM -Taos branch,1 this proposed Certificate degree in Community Health is intended to prepare current and prospective frontline public health workers, commonly known as Community Health Workers (CHWs), with a foundational set of skills and knowledge to enable them to assist individuals, families, groups, and communities to enhance their health, especially in underserved communities. CHWs have been at the forefront of advancing community- level prevention, facilitating access to preventative services, improving health outcomes, and enabling the expansion and efficacy of team -based health care. The program meets New Mexico Department of Health (NM- DOH) standards for state certification of CHWs for direct entry into the field, builds on those standards by aligning with the indus try-recognized national CHW Common Core (C3), integrates feedback and priorities from local frontline health workers and their employers, and also serves as an educational and professional gateway to associate's and bachelor's degrees in community and popu lation health. The proposed Certificate in Community Health meets these training needs in New Mexico, where we experience some of the worst health indicators, outcomes, and disparities in the nation. Branch mission alignment . A key component of UNM -Gallup 's vision/ mission is to support students in pursuing \"community focused, regionally specific, and culturally vibrant education.\" By preparing students for employment opportunities in the local health sector, and as knowledgeable advocates for the wellbeing of their communities, this proposed Certificate program supports that mission. UNM mission & strategic plan alignment. The fourth goal of UNM's most recent strategic plan is, in part, to work \"with community partners\" to \"ensure that all populations in New Mexico have access to the highest quality health care.\" The creation of this Certificate program would help to build a \"grassroots\" workforce of frontline healthcare workers in and around Gallup, New Mexico - a community that is chronically underserved and understaffed by healthcare professionals. Other branch campuses. UNM -Gallup supported UNM -Taos's development of this program. We now would like to be the first branch campus to adopt UNM -Taos's program. Employer involvement. This Certificate program, when developed by UNM -Taos, took into account CHW employers throughout the state, over a period of at least twenty years. The program was also drafted in consultation with the U NM-Health Sciences Center (HSC) and the UNM College of Population Health. Locally, at UNM -Gallup, this program would rely on involvement from our two hospitals (Gallup- Indian Medical Center & Rehoboth McKinley Christian Hospital), as well as a variety of clinics located in town and throughout McKinley County. Timeline. Assuming approval, we would like to see the program begin with a cohort of students during the fall 2023 semester. Evidence of Need Demand. The health industry is the fastest- growing sector of the U.S. economy. CHW jobs are expected to grow 17% (\"much faster than average\") over the next ten years. Health Care and Social Services, as a sector of Gallup's economy, is the largest local industry . Two of the top-five employers in Gallup are in the medical field (see Appendix A for detailed info) . As the CHW program at UNM -Taos has 1 And, to be clear, huge chunks of this proposal have been shamelessly appropriated from the proposal submitted to the Provost's Office by UNM -Taos in 2016. shown over the last few years, there is demand for this program among students, as well as demand for CHWs in the workforce. Recruitment. Targeted re cruitment efforts will include outreach and engagement with students who have expressed an interest in health careers. Similar offerings in NM. Dona Ana Community College, Santa Fe Community College, and UNM -Taos all offer similar Certificate programs in C ommunity Health. Formal Needs Assessment. McKinley County has been designated an area of \"health professional shortage\" by the federal government. It is surrounded by counties with the same designation. McKinley is the poorest county in NM (which is one of the poorest states in the nation). Its healthcare outcomes are abysmal , and its rates of suicide, diabetes, and alcohol -related deaths are some of the worst in the country . A more detailed assessment (see Appendix A ) reflects these facts, as well as a willingness among local healthcare institutions/employers to help train and hire CHWs. See Appendix 2- d-2 for a discussion of the program's relationship to workforce development. Program Content and Quality Curriculum Standards. The curriculum for this Certificate program would be based entirely on the curriculum already used at UNM- Taos. It is a curriculum that is based on state certification standards and national standards. The Certificate would require 10 credit -hours in areas of advanced -practice training and careers in community, public, and population health. Those courses include: PH 103: Introduction to Community Health Work (1cr). History and introduction to the profession; scope of practice, roles, competencies; attributes and qualities. Professional conduct; ethics and boundaries; confidentiality and informed consent. Professional organizations and development; state certifi cation. PH 202: Community Health Work: Frameworks, Principles and Practices for Direct Service (1cr). Introduction to Public Health; ecological model, health equity, healthcare systems. Interpersonal and communication skills, cultural humility, client- centered, strengths -based approaches. Managing and resolving conflict. Strategies for delivering health literate, trauma - informed care. Working on a care team. PH 203: Health Coaching & Health Promotion (3cr). Health promotion in clinical/community setting s. Coaching models; action planning, motivational approaches to change and self - management. Principles, practices of risk/harm reduction. Promoting health literacy; digital health information, health data sources; assessing for authority, bias, currency. PH 204: Health Navigation & Service Coordination (1cr). Conducting client -centered interviews, care coordination, system navigation, client advocacy; building client self -efficacy. Meaningful and effective referrals. Case- finding and recruitment. Health/ social service programs; services, eligibility, enrollment. Documentation, service plans. Building relationships with referral sources and agencies. PH 205: Health Education & Facilitation (2cr). Planning, delivering, evaluating health education session s for groups in diverse settings. Principles of adult learning, critical pedagogy; instructional strategies for diverse learning styles. Indications for, planning, facilitating, evaluating health - related groups and group work. PH 206: Health Outreach, As sessment & Advocacy (2cr). Building relationships, trust. Home visiting. Methods, strategies for health outreach; ethics, safety. Conducting community health assessments, surveys, focus groups, canvassing. Advocating for communities; surfacing community- identified priorities, building self -efficacy and leadership for change, policy solutions; PhotoVoice for policy advocacy. Student Learning Outcomes . Upon completion of this Certificate program, students will be able to: - Analyze health issues and inequalit ies from biomedical, public health, and cultural perspectives - Describe and discuss the history, role, and impact of the CHW profession on health improvement efforts globally and in New Mexico, as well as the CHW scope of practice, certification, ethics, pr ofessional boundaries, professional membership organizations, and role of the multidisciplinary healthcare team - Utilize a range of communication and educational skills to promote and support the health literacy , activation, self -efficacy, and self -advocacy of clients - Describe and demonstrate mastery of cultural humility principles and practice in working with diverse clients and communities - Describe and apply motivational models for health behavior change and chronic disease self - management to develop and revise action plans with individuals utilizing stages of change analysis, interpersonal skills, cultural humility, and a strengths -based approach - Discuss and demonstrate mastery of core competency skills of nonclinical health assessment, advising, service coordination planning, systems navigation, and client -centered counseling in health settings, incorporating strategies and practices of health literate, stigma -free, and trauma - informed care - Evaluate healthcare delivery systems including eligibility requir ements and community resources in order to provide appropriate linkages for clients - Design, prepare, facilitate, and evaluate a group health education training or presentation demonstrating effective group- level teamwork and conflict resolution skills - Assess the need for, design, and conduct community health assessments and outreach initiatives, incorporating knowledge and skills for outreach to underserved and marginalized groups - Self-assess and demonstrate job readiness, including ability to work as part of a healthcare team, to practice self -care, to develop a resume, and to construct a professional portfolio Instructional Models. The instructional approach will aim to model the best practice of community competences; it will value and honor participants as collaborators who form a local knowledge network and community of practice; it will aim to maintain a respectful balance between safety and challenge; and it will contain spaces and opportunities for multidirectional feedback. It will draw from partici pants' own experiences and implicit knowledge of health and health concerns in their communities in order to bring context, relevance, immediacy, application, and transferability to the course content. Instructors will utilize an array of classroom activit ies, including didactic presentations with discussion, role plays, case studies, audiovisual presentations with discussion or reflective writing activities, small group activities with large group debriefs, etc. Accreditation. When the CHW program at UNM- Taos applied for accreditation through the New Mexico Department of Health, it submitted an application on behalf of all UNM branch campuses. UNM - Gallup's program would be accredited, presumably, as soon as we adopt UNM -Taos's curriculum. Evaluation and As sessment Measuring SLOs. Assessments would include learner self -assessments, peer assessments, and assessments by instructors, including quizzes, case studies, reflective writing and other assignments, portfolios, and performance -based assessments using standardized rubrics that crosscut, integrate, and apply the core competencies into real -world scenarios and client encounters. Program Effectiveness and Plan to Assess Learning Outcomes. Students will complete a comprehensive, qualitative course evaluation, along with the standard UNM student evaluations. Periodic consultations with local employers and working CHWs will also provide feedback to inform curricular refinement. Required Resources This program will require a single full -time hire ($62- 67k/yea r), and (potentially) two adjunct hires ($3k/course) . Initially, a grant from our Center for Career and Technical Education will cover 30% of these costs, while remaining costs will be absorbed by the UNM- Gallup Education Health, and Human Services (EHHS) Division. All instructors will be approved by the UNM -Gallup EHHS Division, will hold (at minimum) a master's degree, and will have experience as fulltime professionals in the field of healthcare or human services. Classroom and simulation training will be supported by the UNM -Gallup Health Careers and Nursing facilities. Projected Enrollment & Costs The enrollment at UNM- Taos, depending on the semester, hovers around ten students. We anticipate that level of interest at UNM- Gallup. UNM -Taos has capped enr ollment at practice UNM -Gallup plans to emulate. UNM -Gallup, in partnership with Gallup- McKinley County Schools also plans to create a parallel Community Health program for concurrently -enrolled high school students. Tuition (or financial aid), t he CCTE grant, and the EHHS instructional budget will cover the costs of instructors and materials.

More about percentile wages. (1) Estimates for detailed occupations do not sum to the totals because the totals include occupations not shown separately. Estimates do not include self-employed workers. (2) Annual wages have been calculated by multiplying the hourly mean wage by a \"year-round, full- time\" hours figure of 2,080 hours; for those occupations where there is not an hourly wage published, the annual wage has been directly calculated from the reported survey data. (3) The relative standard error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a survey statistic. The smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate.

Along with those new roles comes the need for expanded education and training opportunities, professionalization and continuing education, and articulation of community health worker training and competencies with advanced pathways of educational preparation and practice. As New Mexico's population expands and becomes proportionally older, the state can expect even greater healthcare demands and access problems. Expanded allied health education, health and healthcare service delivery, and availability of place- based, well-trained, culturally -compet ent allied healthcare providers will be needed to meet the current, near-term, and anticipated long -term demand. As frontline public health workers, Community Health Workers have been at the forefront of advancing community -level prevention, facilitating access to preventative services, and enabling the expansion and efficacy of team -based healthcare. Training and deploying Community Health Workers throughout New Mexico is, and will continue to be, an essential strategy for meeting the complex health needs of the state. New Mexico is the 5 th largest state in the country, with a small population of 2,117,522 according to the 2020 U.S. Census. The state covers over 100,000 square miles, and unpaved roads, expanses of mountains and deserts, and long distances between communities limits healthcare access. According to U.S. Census statistics, New Mexico experiences higher poverty rates (18.2%, as of 2019) , especially among children (24.9%) , and a lower median household income ($49,754) than United States averages (13.4% poverty rate, 16% child poverty rate, $69,560 median household income) . Educational attainments in the state is also lower , with fewer New Mexicans completing high school and/or four -year degree programs than other Americans . These economic and education data are regarded by public health professionals as critical health indicators, in that the transdisciplinary science of population health has established that early childhood experiences, along with educational attainment, are the strongest single predictors of life-long health. Furthermore, because of its cultural/ethnic diversity, there are a greater number of non- English speakers in New Mexico than nationally, requiring special cultural and linguistic healthcare considerations and accommodations. McKinley County - the area UNM -Gallup primarily serves - is in even more dire straits than much of the rest of New Mexico. The poverty rate, as of 2019, is over 32% (that's 1.5x the statewide poverty rate), with a median household income of $37,153 (or, 3 /5 of the national average). Nearly a full quarter of county residents fail to complete high school, and only 11% of county residents have a bachelor's degree or above. Over half of the population speaks a language other than English in their household (us ually Navajo or Spanish). If we accept the importance of alleviating \"critical health indicators\", then McKinley County should be a priority for a degree -pathway for CHWs. 1 Copied, almost verbatim, from a Needs Assessment by UNM -Taos.

This proposed Certificate program in Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Customer Service is intended to help students build or expand their skills in the hospitality and tourism industry . This Certificate is primarily meant to serve students who are looking to increase their employability and leverage what they learn from their coursework in the labor market. Right now, most of the degree programs and pathways offered at UNM-Gallup focus on helping students transfer to four- year institutions. This is important and admirable, but there is a potential pool of prospective students who could benef it from degree programs and pathways focused, instead, on developing skills and knowledge that could help them earn promotions, job offers, or higher salaries in already -established sectors of their local economy. Branch mission alignment. A Certificate i n Office Specialist will help students \"achieve their . . . professional goals,\" which is an important part of the UNM- Gallup Mission statement. UNM mission & strategic plan alignment. This program could help fulfill chunks of two of the goals outlined in UNM's 2020 Strategic Plan. That plan's second goal is, in part, to prepare \"students to meet their long- term goals as lifelong learners in academic and personal achievement, career and leadership.\" The seventh goal of that same plan is, in part, to \"stren gthen the state's economy through . . . . .\" and prepare students \"to become the next generation of entrepreneurs.\" By helping students (especially, in regards to this program, working students who often have families) successfully earn a 15 -credit credential in becoming an Office Specialist , UNM -Gallup can help them (in the words of the UNM mission) \"contribute to the state and national [economy], and . . . lead satisfying lives.\" UNM -Taos offers a 31 -credit -hour Certificate program in Hospitality Management . While UNM -Gallup hopes to eventually offer a 30- credit -hour Certificate in Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Management (and, hopefully, a 60- credit -hour AAS in Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Management as well), we would like to create a 15 - credit -hour Certificate initially to gauge student interest. UNM -Los Alamos and UNM- Valencia do not offer anything comparable to what we are proposing here. Employer involvement. If this proposal is allowed to move forwa rd, we will seek advise, feedback, and direction from several business-related local organizations, including the Gallup Business Improvement District, the Gallup MainStreet Arts & Culture District, the Gallup -McKinley County Chamber of Commerce, and the G reater Gallup Economic Development Corporation. Timeline. Assuming approval, we would like to see the program begin during the Fall 2023 semester. Evidence of Need Demand. According to the most recent data available from New Mexico State University's Arrowhead Center (as of July 2020), \"Accommodation and Food Services\" is a \"basic economic activity for McKinley County\" and currently accounts for over 3100 jobs ( see APPENDIX B ). This industry area makes up nearly 11% of the private- sector economy and has seen consistent growth over the past five years. This would be an excellent potential program for members of that labor pool who are not interested in leaving the local area and who struggle to complete college -level general education requirements, but who want to increase their employability with new skills and credentials. Recruitment. Targeted recruitment efforts will include outreach and engagement wit h students who have expressed an interest in a business credential, but who struggle to complete college-level general education requirements, or who are currently working and/or caring for family members. Courses would be scheduled primarily online, in the evenings, or on weekends. Similar Offerings in NM. Clovis Community College has a 16.5- credit -hour Certificate program in Food Safety and Quality. Santa Fe Community College has an 18-credit -hour Certificate in Hospitality and Tourism. Central New Mexico Community College h as a 28- credit -hour Certificate in Hospitality and Tourism. As mentioned already, UNM -T aos has a 31 - credit -hour Certificate in Hospitality Management. Formal Needs Assessment . Jobs in \"Accommodation and Food Services\" are projected to increase by 0. 8 9% from 2018 -2028 in New Mexico . According to New Mexico Workforce Connections, this sector of the economy will see the second -largest growth in the raw number of jobs available throughout the state (second only to \"Health Care and Social Assistance\"). A gain, though, this program will primarily attempt to attract people who are alrea dy working in some of the largest sectors of our local economy. Program Content and Qualit y Curriculum Standards. The curriculum for this program will be made up of the following five courses: BCIS 1115: Introduction to Computers (3 credits). This is a lecture and hands-on course which focuses on different technologies commonly used in various occupations. This course will provide students with an overview of computer hardware, operating software, and the MS Office suite of applications. The class will also include an overview of the history of technology and its future, and will also provide a fundamental introduction to industry-standard application software for word processing, database management, and graphics. Basic computer use, files and file structure, Windows, the internet, programming, ethics, and security will also be addressed. Course cannot apply to major or minor in Computer Science. BUSA 1130: Business Professionalism (3 credits). Focuses on developing professional behavior appropriate for the business environment. Topics include: Life Management, goal setting, workplace etiquette, job search skills, interviewing, teamwork and team building, motivation, leadership, business communication and workplace interaction. HRTM 1120: Introduction to Tourism (3 credits). Survey of travel and tourism development and operating characteristics. HRTM 2110: Safety, Sanitation, and Health in the Hospitality Industry (3 credits). Addresses public health, HACCP, and food safety responsibilities in the hospitality industry. Sanitation certification test allows students to receive national ServSafe Food Protection Manager Certification. HRTM 1140: Introduction to Food Preparation (1 credit ). The fundamental concepts, skills, and techniques involved in basic cookery are covered in this course. Special emphasis is given to the study of ingredients, cooking theories, and the preparation of stocks, broth, glazes, and soups, thickening agents, the grand sauces and emulsion sauces. Lectures and demonstrations teach organization skills in the kitchen, work coordination, and knife skills. The basics of vegetable cookery, starch cookery, meat and poultry are covered. Emphasis is given to basic cooking techniques such as saut\u00e9ing, roasting, poaching, braising and frying. Students must successfully pass a practical cooking examination covering a variety of cooking techniques. HRTM 2130: Hotel Operations I (2 credits). Analysis of hotel operations to include: guest services, reservations, reception, guest/city ledger and the night audit. Of these courses, one (BCIS 1115) is going through the approval process of being added to the UNM catalog. The remaining transfer to UNM, but are adopted from the New Mexico HED common course catalog. We hope to eventually expand this program into a 30- credit Certificate in Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Management and a 60 -credit AAS in Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Management, so all of these courses would be \"stackable\" into any degree pathways developed later in this area of study. Student Learning Outcomes. Upon completion of this Certificate program, students will be able t o: - Understand the basics of computer concepts and different technologies used by home users, small office/home office users, mobile users, power users, and enterprise users - Operate and name different components of a computer - Access the web and utilize the resources and explain the evolution of the internet - Understand the importance of digital safety and security - Communicate and interact in various office settings using professional etiquette - Identify the skills needed to provide exceptional customer service - Identify and explain the basic concepts related to tourism, and its socio-cultural, economic, and environmental impacts - Describe basic tourism planning and development principles - Identify basic kitchen utensils and equipment associated with the culinary p rofession - List and describe the method of preparation for stocks, Grand Sauces, clear soups, puree and cream soups, specialty soups, basic vegetables, and starches - Identity the hazards to safe food and the foods at risk in a foodservice operation - Demonstrate knowledge of how to protect food during purchasing, receiving, storing, preparing, holding, and serving - Discuss the procedures for ensuring sanitary equipment, facilities, and food-handling practices - Outline the organization and structure of a hotel and resort - Describe and calculate the components and processes of room reservation forecasting, pricing, and revenue management Instructional Models. Instruction will primarily be presented through lectures, discussion, and case studies. Accreditatio n. UNM -Gallup will seek accreditation for this program through the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP). Accreditation requires membership in the ACBSP, which costs roughly $3000/year, along with a one-time fee of $2500 to establish candidacy for Certificate accreditation. Each Certificate accredited requires a $400 annual fee. If only this Certificate program was accredited through the ACBSP, it would cost UNM -Gallup a total of $5900 for initial accreditation, and a total of $3400 each year to remain accredited. Evaluation and Assessment Measuring SLOs. Assessments will include learner self -assessments, peer assessments, and assessments by instructors, including quizzes, case studies, reflective writing and other assignments, portfolios, and performance-based assessments using standardized rubrics that crosscut, integrate, and apply the core competencies into real -world scenarios and customer encounters. Program Effectiveness and Plan to Assess Learning Outcomes. Students will complete a comprehensive, qualitative course evaluation, along with the standard UNM student evaluations. Periodic consultation with local employers and businesspeople will also provide feedback to inform curricular refin ement. Required Resources Our campus already routinely offers one of the courses required in this program (the non- transferable equivalent of BCIS 1115, IT 101). This program will require the potential addition of five adjunct hires, each teaching one section a semester, at roughly $1k/c redit-hour (for a total of 12 credit hours). The Business and Applied Technology Division at UNM-Gallup will absorb that, roughly, $12,000 annual cost . These adjunct faculty will be requ ired to have at least 18 graduate -level credit hours (and, preferably, a Master's degree) in the ir area of instruction , or comparable work experience. No additional instructional space, additional faculty/student support, or additional equipment is needed to offer the courses required in this program. Projected Enrollment & Costs We plan to heavily market this program to working people not currently enrolled at any higher education institution. Program costs , over a one-year period, would be - again - rou ghly $12,000/year . We hope to recruit 15 students, enrolled in these 15 credits ($80.50/credit) each semester , which would produce roughly $18,112.50 in tuition dollars. Presumably, many students will complete the required course sequence within a semester , while others will attend courses part-time. In any case, we believe that the Business and Applied Technology Division can cover the costs of this program. Two of the courses in this program are shared with at least one other program being proposed for approval, so the costs discussed in this paragraph are a high estimate. Fall 2023 Spring 2024 Fall 2024 Spring 2025 Fall 2025 Spring 2026 15 students 15 students 15 students 15 students 15 students 15 students Detailed Program Budget: Revenue 15 students, enrolled in 15 credits/year @ $80.50/credit (our tuition rate) = Total potential revenue of $18,112.50/year Expenses Five adjunct faculty salaries Salary @ $1,000/credit hour, for twelve credit hours Potential maximum = $12,000/year Program costs would be covered by tuition.

Of the 35 reports, 33 describe the economic base of New Mexico's counties. There are separate reports for the State of New Mexico and for the Albuquerque Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). New Mexico has three additional MSAs (Las Cruces, Santa Fe, and Farmington), all of which are single county MSAs; separate reports for these MSAs were not prepared. All 35 reports may be found at http://arrowheadcenter.nmsu.edu/economic -and-policy -studies /. The reports have been prepared under the direction of James Peach. Erin Sumner, a graduate student in the NM SU Doctorate of Economic Development program, did much of the work on the updates. Comments and suggestions are welcome and are to be sent to jpeach@nmsu.edu . Our intent is to update these reports on an annual basis. An economic base study is a descriptive tool used to analyze the composition of local economic activity. Economic base studies are often conducted to help guide local economic development activities and to help economic development officials make decis ions such as what type of firms they should attempt to attract to local areas. Economic base studies can also help local and regional businesses better understand local and export product markets. The specific purposes of economic base studies include: Understand regional economic growth Make short and long -term forecasts Identify potential growth sectors Identify potential problem areas According to economic base theory, any local economy may be divided into basic and non-basic industries. This theory also suggests that economic growth depends on sectors that export goods and services out of the region (basic industries), as opposed to those businesses whose services remain local, (non -basic industries). Basic industries promote local economic growth by bringing jobs and income into the local economy. Non -basic industries serve local residents and provide support to basic industries. 2 An industry classified as basic in one region may be identified as non -basic in another region. One common means of identifying local basic activity is through the use of location quotients (LQs). LQs are calculated as a single industry's percent of total local employment divided by that industry's percent of total state or national employment. For example, an LQ for a single New Mexico industry (industry j) may be calculated as follows: LQ = (Employment in industry j in NM / total employment in NM) (Employment in industry j in US / total employment in US) The LQ serves to illustrate the relative importance in the level of the local employment of that sector with respect to the benchmark economy, state or national. A n LQ greater than 1.0 indicates that a particular industry employs proportionately more workers locally than it does at the state or national level. Conversely, an LQ of less than 1.0 indicates that the industry of note employs fewer workers locally as compared to the state or national average. For additional information on LQs, see http://arrowheadcenter.nmsu.edu/wp - content/uploads/2015/06/WhatisaLocationQuotient.pdf . In this report, LQs are calculated for industries within McKinley County with the national employment as the basis for comparison (see Table 1). Additionally, LQs using employment for the state of New Mexico as the benchmark are included (see Table 2). In this report, basic industries are identified utilizing general knowledge about the structure of the local ec onomy combined with LQs greater than 1.0. LQs are described for the most recent year for which data were available and for the four preceding years (201 4-2018). The data used in this report are from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Anal ysis (BEA) which can be found at www.bea.gov . 3 McKinley County, New Mexico McKinley County is located in the north weste rn section of New Mexico and con tains 5,449.81 square miles, or 4.49 percent of the land area in the state . The population for McKinley County in 201 8 was 72,290 , or 3.45 percent of the state total , ranking 7th in terms of population. The C ity of Gallup had a population of 22,105 and represented 30.58 percent of total population for McKinley County in 201 8. Between 2014 and 201 8, the population of McKinley County decreased by 0.71 percent. During the same period, New Mexico's population increased by 0.24 percent and the United States population increased by 2.76 percent . Figure 1. Per Capita Personal Income: McKinley County (201 8) Per capita personal income in McKinley County in 201 8 was $ 27,771. Per capita income for McKinley County in 201 8 represented 6 6.74 percent correspo nding state figure of $41,609 and 51 .01 percent of the national average of $54,446 (see Figure 2 ). Despite its low per capita income, the percentage growth for McKinley's per capita income between 2014 and 201 8 was 11.15 percent. The percentage g rowth for the state b etween 2014 and 201 8 was 11.91 percent and 15.70 2. Per Capita Income of McKinley County as a Percent of U.S. and New Mexico (2014 - 2018 ) Tota l employment in McKinley County was 28,710 in 201 8. Between 2014 and 201 8, total employment for McKinley County decreased by 4.55 percent, compared to the increase of New Mexico's 2. 93 percent growth rate and the nation's 7.79 percent growth rate. The employment to population ratio for McKinley County was 0.40 , significantly lower compared to the st ate's ratio of 0.53 and nation's ratio of 0.61. This ratio represents a low rate of population being employed. In 201 8, 67.63 percent of al l workers in McKinley County were employed in t he P rivate sector , while G overnment and Government Enterprises accounted for 25.06 percent and Farm employment accounted for 7.31 percent of total employment . Industries with the highest percentages of total employment included : Healthcare and Social Assistance (14.7 9), Retail Trade (12.63), Accommodation and Food Services (10.92) , and Wholesale Trade (4.60). In the public sector, L ocal government and F ederal /civilian employment were the largest employers in the public sector with 13.56 and 8. 50 percent of total employment , respectively . State governm ent employment accounted for 2. 37 percent and M ilitary for 0.6 3 percent . Employment for McKinley County by sector is displayed in Table 1. 53.1 52.6 52.851.3 51.067.2 5 Basic and Non -Basic Industries in McKinley County, New Mexico Table 2 contains LQs for McKinley County from 201 4 and 201 8 calculated using data for the United States as basis for comparison. Table 3 contains LQs for McKinley County from 201 4 and 201 8 calculated with respect to the state of New Mexico. For the purposes of this report, an LQ greater than 1.0 with respect to U.S. employment is considered as a basic industry. Sectors with LQ s greater than 1.0 have been shaded. The importance of the agricu ltural sector to the economic base of McKinley County is reflected in a large LQ for the county under F arm employment , with a n LQ of 5. 63. This industry has experien ced consistent growth during the years considered, with LQs steadily increasing . Wholesale Trade with a n LQ of 1. 44 is also considered a basic industry for McKinley County, which implies that the county economy is dependent on its wholesale trade specialty. Accommodation and Food Services is also to be considered a basic economic activity for McKinley County, with a n LQ of 1 .45. Gallup's location on I -40 between Albuquerque and the State of Arizona, as well as its historical hotels , make s it a common stop -over for travelers. Healthcare and Social Assistance is also considered a basic s ector with a n LQ of 1. 31 in 2018. This LQ reflects the large employment base from the two main medical centers of McKinley County, Rehoboth McKinley Christian Hospital and Gallup Indian Medical Center, both located in Gallup. Though Healthcare and Social Assistance is often categorized a s non -basic industry, considering the importance of these hospitals in serving neighboring areas \u2014especially Native American reservations at th e Gallup Indian Medical Center, this sector has been included as part of the economic base of McKinley County. Retail Trade wi th an LQ of 1. 31 is also considered a basic industry for McKinley County. Although Mining has historically been a basic industry in McKinley County, employment data for Mining was undisclosed by the BEA between 201 4 and 201 8. The Ut ilities sect or with an LQ of 1. 84 in 201 8 is considered a non -basic or a support industr y for McKinley County. Government and Government Enterprises entry is the aggregate figure of all government levels listed as government categories. In 201 8, one public sector industr y with an LQ greater than 1.0 was Federal /civilian employment with a n LQ of 5. 99. This was considered a basic industry for McKinley County . This large LQ reflects the employment base of the Gallup 6 Indian Medical Center, part of the Indian Health Service. Local government had a n LQ of 1.89. Even when local government is greater than 1.0, local government is generally categorized as non-basic given that local governments collect taxes from residents to provide for the services to the community, including employment. Following this practice, local government for McKinley County will be considered as non -basic industry. The data for 2018 suggest that in McKinley County , the following industries are to be considered basic: 1. Agricultural sector with Farm employment, accounted for 2,098 jobs. 2. Wholesale Trade , accounted for 1,322 jobs. 3. Accommodation and Food Services, accounted for 3,136 jobs. 4. Healthcare and Social Assistance, accounted for 4,247 jobs. 5. Retail Trade, accounted for 3,627 jobs. 6. Federal /civilian employment, accounted for 2,441 jobs. It is common in economic base studies to calculate an export -base employment multiplier. This employment multiplier is obtained by dividing total employment in McKinley County by total employment in the basic sectors. In the case of McKinley County, the mu ltiplier is equal to 1.70 (28,710 / 16,871 ). This ratio suggests that the addition of each basic sector job in McKinley County would be associated with additional 1.70 non-basic sector jobs. The export base multiplier (1 .70) calculated above reinforces the importance of basic (exporting) industries to the economy of McKinley County. This employment multiplier is not to be compared to employment multipliers included in economic impact analysis tools including RIMS, REMI, and IMPLAN. In the case of McKinley County, potential double counting occupation may result in an upward bias of the multiplier given that farm proprietors often have more than one occupation. Local economic development policy actions such as the creation of industrial parks, tax abatement and financing, and workforce development projects are often used by local communities to expand an area's economic base. The development of a community economic development plan is to include the appropriate combination of p olicies, which often result from public and private sector interaction. 7 Changes from Prior Year This document has been revised to reflect data figures obtained from the BEA for economic data and the U.S. Census for population data.

Pamela Cheek, Associate Provost for Student Success To: Dr. Matthew Mingus, Dean Dan Primozic Re: Certificate s to AAS in HRTM Date: April 6, 2022 ______________________________________________________________________________ On behalf of Office of the Provost and EVP for Academic Affairs, I have reviewed the initial proposal for the Certificate in Hotel, Restaurant , and Tourism Customer Service, th e Certificate in Hotel, Restaurant and Tourism Management, and the AAS in Hotel, Restaurant and Tourism Management and support moving forward with the next stages of the proposal . The rationale presented for the set of stackable certificates is clear. As you move forward with completion of the proposal s for the certificates, please consider the following: Providing clear information in course proposals and course catalog entries that will ultimately allow students to understand which courses may count fo r academic credit and which courses are career and technical education courses, so that students will not be misinformed about potential transfer of credits. Providing clear information of eligibility of certificates for financial aid. Recognizing that C TE and Academic programs at all UNM campuses are subject to cyclical Academic Program Review . Providing separate certificate and AAS submissions, to which this single letter can be appended as support for movement beyond the pre -proposal phase. Thank you for your work on these curricula. As you may know, new curricula cannot be submitted to Curriculum Workflow until August, 2022 due to the platform transition that is underwa y. CERTIFICATE IN BUSINESS PRINCIPLES @ UNM -GallupRATIONALE UNM -Gallup is interested in building short- term Certificate programs that can help non -traditional students increase their employability and leverage newly- learned skills in the labor market A 15 -credit Certificate program is a low -risk way of gauging potential interest, and we hope to expand this into . . . A 30 -credit Certificate in Business Administration, and A 60 -credit AAS program in Business AdministrationPOTENTIAL STUDENTS / WORKFORCE OUTCOMES This program will be marketed to students who are already working and are looking to develop new skills for potential promotions, future job offers, and/or higher salaries Jobs that require customer service skills and basic business knowledge are projected to grow by 7% over the next ten years This industry currently makes up 28% of the private -sector economy in McKinley County (that's nearly 10,000 jobs)FACULTY/RESOURCE NEEDS Current facilities are adequate Expenses will include four adjunct faculty members Potential maximum cost $12,000/year We hope to enroll 18 students/year 15 students, enrolled in 15 credits/year @ $80.50/credit = $21,735/year in potential revenue Tuition would hopefully cover all expenses If this program fails, it's easy to stop offering Once established, we will seek accreditation through the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs Annual cost = $4200/year (combined for Office Specialist, HRT Customer Service, and Business Principles)Certificate in Business Principles Executive Summary University of New Mexico -Gallup Program Description Goals . This proposed Certificate program in Business Principles is intended to help students build or expand their skills in business. This Certificate is primarily meant to serve students who are looking to increase their employability and leverage what they learn from their coursework in the labor market. Right now, most of the degree programs and pathways offered at UNM -Gallup focus on helping students transfer to four- year institutions. This is important and admirable, but there is a potential pool of prospective students who could benefit from degree programs and pathways focused, instead, on developing skills and knowledge that could help them earn promotions, job offers, or higher salaries in already- established sectors of their local economy. Branch mission alignment. A Certificate in Business Principles will help students \"achieve their . . . professional goals,\" which is an important part of the UNM-Gallup Mission statement. UNM mission & strategic plan alignment. This program could help fulfill chunks of two of the goals outlined in UNM's 2020 Strategic Plan. That plan's second goal is, in part, to prepare \"students to meet their lon g-term goals as lifelong learners in academic and personal achievement, career and leadership.\" The seventh goal of that same plan is, in part, to \"strengthen the state's economy through . . . workforce development . . .\" and prepare students \"to become th e next generation of entrepreneurs.\" By helping students (especially, in regards to this program, working students who often have families) successfully earn a 15- credit credential in Business Principles, UNM-Gallup can help them (in the words of the UNM mission) \"contribute to the state and national [economy], and . . . lead satisfying lives.\" Other branch campuses. While other UNM branch campuses offer Business and/or Entrepreneurship degrees, those programs all require quite a bit of general education. This particular program, at the UNM-Gallup campus, would not. There are no comparable 15 -credit - hour Business Certificate programs at the other UNM branches. Employer involvement. If this proposal is allowed to move forward, we will seek advise, feedback, and direction from several business-related local organizations, including the Gallup Business Improvement District, the Gallup MainStreet Arts & Culture District, the Gallup -McKinley County Chamber of Commerce, and the Greater Gallup Economic Development Corporation. Timeline. Assuming approval, we would like to see the program begin during the Fall 2023 semester. Evidence of Need Demand. According to the most recent data available from New Mexico State University's Arrowhead Center (as of July 2020), wholesale trade, retail trade, and accommodation/food services are all \"basic\" industries that are overrepresented and continuously growing in McKinley County, New Mexico (see APPENDIX B). Combined, those industries make up over 28% of the jobs available in the county. This would be an excellent potential program for members of that labor pool who are not interested in leaving the local area and who struggle to complete college-level general education requirements, but who want to increase their employability with new skills and credentials. Recruitment. Targeted recruitment efforts will include outreach and engagement with students who have expressed an interest in a business credential, but who struggle to complete college-level general education requirements, or who are currently working and/or caring for family members. Courses would be scheduled primarily online, in the evenings, or on weekends. Simila r Offerings in NM. There is a similar 18- credit Business Management Certificate at Luna Community College. San Juan College has a 15-credit Business Foundations Certificate. Dona Ana Community College has a 16-credit Certificate in Business Fundamentals. Clovis Community College has an 18-credit Business Intern Certificate. Santa Fe Community College has a 16-credit Business Administration Certificate. Formal Needs Assessment. Jobs that require customer service skills and basic business knowledge are projected to grow in New Mexico, and are projected to grow at a higher rate in the northwestern part of the state ( see APPENDIX A). And, again, this program will primarily attempt to attract people who are already working in some of the largest sectors of our local private economy. Program Content and Qualit y Curricul um Standards. The curriculum for this program will be made up of the following five courses: BCIS 1115: Introduction to Computers (3 credits). This is a lecture and hands-on course which focuses on different technologies commonly used in various occupations. This course will provide students with an overview of computer hardware, operating software, and the MS Office suite of applications. The class will also include an overview of the history of technology and its future, and will also provide a fundament al introduction to industry-standard application software for word processing, database management, and graphics. Basic computer use, files and file structure, Windows, the internet, programming, ethics, and security will also be addressed. Course cannot apply to major or minor in Computer Science. BUSA 1110: Introduction to Business (3 credits). Fundamental concepts and terminology of business including areas such as management, marketing, accounting, economics, personnel, and finance; and the global environment in which they operate. ACCT 2110: Principles of Accounting (3 credits) . An introduction to financial accounting concepts emphasizing the analysis of business transactions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the effect of these transactions on the financial statements, financial analysis, and t he interrelationships of the financial statements. BUSA 1130: Business Professionalism (3 credits). Focuses on developing professional behavior appropriate for the business environment. Topics include: Life Management, goal setting, workplace etiquette, job search skills, interviewing, teamwork and team building, motivation, leadership, business communication and workplace interaction. BUSA 2240: Customer Service in Business (3 credits). Established concepts of service quality in relationship to business success and maximization of returns to the organization. Explores techniques for delivering quality and service in a variety of business settings. Of these courses, one (BCIS 1115) is going through the approval process of being added to the UNM catalog, w hile two (BUSA 1110 and ACCT 2110) are already a part of that catalog. The other two courses (BUSA 1130 and BUSA 2240) would not transfer to UNM, but are adopted from the New Mexico HED common course catalog. We hope to eventually expand this program into a 30 -credit Certificate in Business Management and a 60 -credit AAS in Business Administration, so all of these courses would be \"stackable\" into any degree pathways developed later in this area of study. Student Learning Outcomes. Upon completion of this Certificate program, students will be able to: - Understand and articulate how businesses function - Understand how small businesses are financed and managed - Recognize the importance of employee motivation in the workplace - Compare and discuss various disciplines within a business environment - Communicate clearly and effectively, both orally and in writing, using appropriate office technologies - Demonstrate employability and workplace skills Instructional Models. Instruction will primarily be presented through lectures, discussion, and case studies. Accreditation. UNM -Gallup will seek accreditation for this program through the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP). Accreditation requires membership in the ACBSP, which costs roughly $3000/year, along with a one-time fee of $2500 to establish candidacy for Certificate accreditation. Each Certificate accredited requires a $400 annual fee. If only this Certificate program was accredited through the ACBSP, it would cost UNM -Gallup a total of $5900 for initial accreditation, and a total of $3400 each year to remain accredited. Evaluation and Assessment Measuring SLOs. Assessments will include learner self -assessments, peer assessments, and assessments by instructors, including quizzes, case studies, reflective writing and other assignments, portfolios, and performance-based assessments using standardized rubrics that crosscut, integrate, and apply the core competencies into real -world scenarios and customer encounters. Program Effectiveness and Plan to Assess Learning Outcomes. Students will complete a comprehensive, qualitative course evaluation, along with the standard UNM student evaluations. Periodic consultation with local employers and businesspeople will also provide feedback to inform curricular refinement. Required Resources Our campus already routinely offers three of the courses required in this program (BU SA 1110, ACCT 2110, and the non-transferable equivalent of BCIS 1115, IT 101). This program will require the potential addition of two adjunct hires, each teaching one section a semester, at $3k/course. The Business and Applied Technology Division at UNM-Gallup will absorb that, roughly, $12,000 annual cost . These adjunct faculty will be required to have at least 18 graduate -level credit hours (and, preferably, a Master's degree) in their area of instruction. No additional instructional space, additional faculty/student support, or additional equipment is needed to offer the courses required in this program. Projected Enrollment & Costs We believe that roughly one-quarter of the students in our AA in Business Administration will be interested in this progr am (so, about 18 students). We also plan to heavily market this program to working people not currently enrolled at any higher education institution. Program costs , over a one-year period, would be - again - roughly $12,000/year . 18 students, enrolled in these 15 credits ($80.50/credit), would produce roughly $21,735 in tuition dollars. Presumably, many students will complete the required course sequence within a semester, while others will attend courses part- time. In any case, we believe that the Business and Applied Technology Division can easily cover the costs of this program. Fall 2023 Spring 2024 Fall 2024 Spring 2025 Fall 2025 Spring 2026 18 students 18 students 18 students 18 students 18 students 18 students Detailed Program Budget: Revenue 18 students, enrolled in 15 credits/year @ $80.50/credit (our tuition rate) = Total potential revenue of $21,735/year Expenses Two adjunct faculty salaries Salary @ $3000/course, for four courses Potential maximum = $12,000/year Program costs would be covered by tuition.

Virtual One Stop - SapphireThe Economic Base of McKinley County, NM PREPARED BY: Arrowhead Center, New Mexico State University DATE: July 2020 1 The Economic Base of McKinley County, New Mexico Introduction This report is one of 35 economic base studies prepared by New Mexico State University's (NMSU) Arrowhead Center. Of the 35 reports, 33 describe the economic base of New Mexico's counties. There are separate reports for the State of New Mexico and for the Albuquerque Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). New Mexico has three additional MSAs (Las Cruces, Santa Fe, and Farmington), all of which are single county MSAs; separate reports for these MSAs were not prepared. All 35 reports may be found at http://arrowheadcenter.nmsu.edu/economic -and-policy -studies /. The reports have been prepared under the direction of James Peach. Erin Sumner, a graduate student in the NM SU Doctorate of Economic Development program, did much of the work on the updates. Comments and suggestions are welcome and are to be sent to jpeach@nmsu.edu . Our intent is to update these reports on an annual basis. An economic base study is a descriptive tool used to analyze the composition of local economic activity. Economic base studies are often conducted to help guide local economic development activities and to help economic development officials make decis ions such as what type of firms they should attempt to attract to local areas. Economic base studies can also help local and regional businesses better understand local and export product markets. The specific purposes of economic base studies include: Understand regional economic growth Make short and long -term forecasts Identify potential growth sectors Identify potential problem areas According to economic base theory, any local economy may be divided into basic and non-basic industries. This theory also suggests that economic growth depends on sectors that export goods and services out of the region (basic industries), as opposed to those businesses whose services remain local, (non -basic industries). Basic industries promote local economic growth by bringing jobs and income into the local economy. Non -basic industries serve local residents and provide support to basic industries. 2 An industry classified as basic in one region may be identified as non -basic in another region. One common means of identifying local basic activity is through the use of location quotients (LQs). LQs are calculated as a single industry's percent of total local employment divided by that industry's percent of total state or national employment. For example, an LQ for a single New Mexico industry (industry j) may be calculated as follows: LQ = (Employment in industry j in NM / total employment in NM) (Employment in industry j in US / total employment in US) The LQ serves to illustrate the relative importance in the level of the local employment of that sector with respect to the benchmark economy, state or national. A n LQ greater than 1.0 indicates that a particular industry employs proportionately more workers locally than it does at the state or national level. Conversely, an LQ of less than 1.0 indicates that the industry of note employs fewer workers locally as compared to the state or national average. For additional information on LQs, see http://arrowheadcenter.nmsu.edu/wp - content/uploads/2015/06/WhatisaLocationQuotient.pdf . In this report, LQs are calculated for industries within McKinley County with the national employment as the basis for comparison (see Table 1). Additionally, LQs using employment for the state of New Mexico as the benchmark are included (see Table 2). In this report, basic industries are identified utilizing general knowledge about the structure of the local ec onomy combined with LQs greater than 1.0. LQs are described for the most recent year for which data were available and for the four preceding years (201 4-2018). The data used in this report are from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Anal ysis (BEA) which can be found at www.bea.gov . 3 McKinley County, New Mexico McKinley County is located in the north weste rn section of New Mexico and con tains 5,449.81 square miles, or 4.49 percent of the land area in the state . The population for McKinley County in 201 8 was 72,290 , or 3.45 percent of the state total , ranking 7th in terms of population. The C ity of Gallup had a population of 22,105 and represented 30.58 percent of total population for McKinley County in 201 8. Between 2014 and 201 8, the population of McKinley County decreased by 0.71 percent. During the same period, New Mexico's population increased by 0.24 percent and the United States population increased by 2.76 percent . Figure 1. Per Capita Personal Income: McKinley County (201 8) Per capita personal income in McKinley County in 201 8 was $ 27,771. Per capita income for McKinley County in 201 8 represented 6 6.74 percent correspo nding state figure of $41,609 and 51 .01 percent of the national average of $54,446 (see Figure 2 ). Despite its low per capita income, the percentage growth for McKinley's per capita income between 2014 and 201 8 was 11.15 percent. The percentage g rowth for the state b etween 2014 and 201 8 was 11.91 percent and 15.70 2. Per Capita Income of McKinley County as a Percent of U.S. and New Mexico (2014 - 2018 ) Tota l employment in McKinley County was 28,710 in 201 8. Between 2014 and 201 8, total employment for McKinley County decreased by 4.55 percent, compared to the increase of New Mexico's 2. 93 percent growth rate and the nation's 7.79 percent growth rate. The employment to population ratio for McKinley County was 0.40 , significantly lower compared to the st ate's ratio of 0.53 and nation's ratio of 0.61. This ratio represents a low rate of population being employed. In 201 8, 67.63 percent of al l workers in McKinley County were employed in t he P rivate sector , while G overnment and Government Enterprises accounted for 25.06 percent and Farm employment accounted for 7.31 percent of total employment . Industries with the highest percentages of total employment included : Healthcare and Social Assistance (14.7 9), Retail Trade (12.63), Accommodation and Food Services (10.92) , and Wholesale Trade (4.60). In the public sector, L ocal government and F ederal /civilian employment were the largest employers in the public sector with 13.56 and 8. 50 percent of total employment , respectively . State governm ent employment accounted for 2. 37 percent and M ilitary for 0.6 3 percent . Employment for McKinley County by sector is displayed in Table 1. 53.1 52.6 52.851.3 51.067.2 5 Basic and Non -Basic Industries in McKinley County, New Mexico Table 2 contains LQs for McKinley County from 201 4 and 201 8 calculated using data for the United States as basis for comparison. Table 3 contains LQs for McKinley County from 201 4 and 201 8 calculated with respect to the state of New Mexico. For the purposes of this report, an LQ greater than 1.0 with respect to U.S. employment is considered as a basic industry. Sectors with LQ s greater than 1.0 have been shaded. The importance of the agricu ltural sector to the economic base of McKinley County is reflected in a large LQ for the county under F arm employment , with a n LQ of 5. 63. This industry has experien ced consistent growth during the years considered, with LQs steadily increasing . Wholesale Trade with a n LQ of 1. 44 is also considered a basic industry for McKinley County, which implies that the county economy is dependent on its wholesale trade specialty. Accommodation and Food Services is also to be considered a basic economic activity for McKinley County, with a n LQ of 1 .45. Gallup's location on I -40 between Albuquerque and the State of Arizona, as well as its historical hotels , make s it a common stop -over for travelers. Healthcare and Social Assistance is also considered a basic s ector with a n LQ of 1. 31 in 2018. This LQ reflects the large employment base from the two main medical centers of McKinley County, Rehoboth McKinley Christian Hospital and Gallup Indian Medical Center, both located in Gallup. Though Healthcare and Social Assistance is often categorized a s non -basic industry, considering the importance of these hospitals in serving neighboring areas \u2014especially Native American reservations at th e Gallup Indian Medical Center, this sector has been included as part of the economic base of McKinley County. Retail Trade wi th an LQ of 1. 31 is also considered a basic industry for McKinley County. Although Mining has historically been a basic industry in McKinley County, employment data for Mining was undisclosed by the BEA between 201 4 and 201 8. The Ut ilities sect or with an LQ of 1. 84 in 201 8 is considered a non -basic or a support industr y for McKinley County. Government and Government Enterprises entry is the aggregate figure of all government levels listed as government categories. In 201 8, one public sector industr y with an LQ greater than 1.0 was Federal /civilian employment with a n LQ of 5. 99. This was considered a basic industry for McKinley County . This large LQ reflects the employment base of the Gallup 6 Indian Medical Center, part of the Indian Health Service. Local government had a n LQ of 1.89. Even when local government is greater than 1.0, local government is generally categorized as non-basic given that local governments collect taxes from residents to provide for the services to the community, including employment. Following this practice, local government for McKinley County will be considered as non -basic industry. The data for 2018 suggest that in McKinley County , the following industries are to be considered basic: 1. Agricultural sector with Farm employment, accounted for 2,098 jobs. 2. Wholesale Trade , accounted for 1,322 jobs. 3. Accommodation and Food Services, accounted for 3,136 jobs. 4. Healthcare and Social Assistance, accounted for 4,247 jobs. 5. Retail Trade, accounted for 3,627 jobs. 6. Federal /civilian employment, accounted for 2,441 jobs. It is common in economic base studies to calculate an export -base employment multiplier. This employment multiplier is obtained by dividing total employment in McKinley County by total employment in the basic sectors. In the case of McKinley County, the mu ltiplier is equal to 1.70 (28,710 / 16,871 ). This ratio suggests that the addition of each basic sector job in McKinley County would be associated with additional 1.70 non-basic sector jobs. The export base multiplier (1 .70) calculated above reinforces the importance of basic (exporting) industries to the economy of McKinley County. This employment multiplier is not to be compared to employment multipliers included in economic impact analysis tools including RIMS, REMI, and IMPLAN. In the case of McKinley County, potential double counting occupation may result in an upward bias of the multiplier given that farm proprietors often have more than one occupation. Local economic development policy actions such as the creation of industrial parks, tax abatement and financing, and workforce development projects are often used by local communities to expand an area's economic base. The development of a community economic development plan is to include the appropriate combination of p olicies, which often result from public and private sector interaction. 7 Changes from Prior Year This document has been revised to reflect data figures obtained from the BEA for economic data and the U.S. Census for population data.

The rationale presented for the set of stackable certificates is clear and the relationship with an accrediting body is appropriate. As you move forward with completion of the proposal s for the certificates, please consider the following: Providing clear information in course proposals and course catalog entries that will ultimately allow students to understand which courses may count for academic credit and which courses are career and technical education courses, so that students will not be misinformed about potential transfer of credits. Providing clear information of eligibility of certificates for financial aid. Recognizing that CT E and Academic programs at all UNM campuses are subject to cyclical Academic Program Review, even if they are also evaluated by an external accreditor. Providing separate certificate and AAS submissions, to which this single letter can be appended as supp ort for movement beyond the pre -proposal phase. Thank you for your work on these curricula.

CERTIFICATE IN OFFICE SPECIALIST @ UNM -GallupRATIONALE UNM -Gallup is interested in building short- term Certificate programs that can help non -traditional students increase their employability and leverage newly- learned skills in the labor market A 15 -credit Certificate program is a low -risk way of gauging potential interest, and we hope to expand this into . . . A 30 -credit Certificate in Office Administration, and A 60 -credit AAS program in Office AdministrationPOTENTIAL STUDENTS / WORKFORCE OUTCOMES This program will be marketed to students who are already working and are looking to develop new skills for potential promotions, future job offers, and/or higher salaries Four of the top five employers in McKinley County rely heavily on office personnel Gallup Indian Medical Center Gallup -McKinley County Schools Rehoboth McKinley Christian Hospital City of Gallup Demand for these jobs is expected to remain staticFACULTY/RESOURCE NEEDS Current facilities are adequate Expenses will include four adjunct faculty members Potential maximum cost $12,000/year We hope to enroll 15 students/year 15 students, enrolled in 15 credits/year @ $80/50/credit = $18,112.50/year in potential revenue Tuition would hopefully cover all expenses If this program fails, it's easy to stop offering Once established, we will seek accreditation through the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs Annual cost = $4200/year (combined for Office Specialist, HRT Customer Service, and Business Principles)Certificate in Office Specialist Executive Summary University of New Mexico -Gallup Program Description Goals . This proposed Certificate program in Office Specialist is intended to help students build or expand their skills in general office operations and procedures . This Certificate is primarily meant to serve students who are looking to increase their employability and leverage what they learn from their coursework in the labor market. Right now, most of the degree programs and pathways offered at UNM-Gallup focus on helping students transfer to four- year institutions. This is important and admirable, but there is a potential pool of prospective students who could benefit from degree programs and pathways focused, instead, on developing skills and knowledge that could help them earn promotions, job offers, or higher salaries in already-established sectors of their local economy. Branch mission alignment. A Certificate in Office Specialist will help students \"achieve their . . . professional goals,\" which is an important part of the UNM- Gallup Mission statement. UNM mission & strategic plan alignment. This program could help fulfill chunks of two of the goals outlined in UNM's 2020 Strategic Plan. That plan's second goal is, in part, to prepare \"student s to meet their long -term goals as lifelong learners in academic and personal achievement, career and leadership.\" The seventh goal of that same plan is, in part, to \"strengthen the state's economy through . . . workforce development . . .\" and prepare students \"to become the next generation of entrepreneurs.\" By helping students (especially, in regards to this program, working students who often have families) successfully earn a 15- credit credential in becoming an Office Specialist , UNM -Gallup can help them (in the words of the UNM mission) \"contribute to the state and national [economy], and . . . lead satisfying lives.\" UNM -Taos offers a 31 -credit -hour Certificate program in Office Technology. While UNM -Gallup hopes to eventually offer a 30 -credit -hour Certificate in Office Administration (and, hopefully, a 60- credit -hour AAS in Office Administration as well), we would like to create a 15- credit -hour Certificate initially to gauge student interest. UNM -Los Alamos and UNM -Valencia d o not offer anything comparable to what we are proposing here. Employer involvement. If this proposal is allowed to move forward, we will seek advise, feedback, and direction from several business-related local organizations, including the Gallup Business Improvement District, the Gallup MainStreet Arts & Culture District, the Gallup -McKinley County Chamber of Commerce, and the Greater Gallup Economic Development Corporation. Timeline. Assuming approval, we would like to see the program begin during the F all 2023 semester. Evidence of Need Demand. According to the most recent data available from New Mexico State University's Arrowhead Center (as of July 2 020), sectors of the McKinley County economy that rely on white-collar office jobs - \"Information\", \"Administrative and Waste Management Services\", and, most notably, \"Government\" jobs - make up a significant percentage of the county's overall employment ( see APPENDIX B ). The two largest employers in the county - the Gallup -McKinley County School district and the Gallup Indian Medical Center - employee hundreds of administrative office staff. This would be an excellent potential program for members of that labor pool who are not interested in leaving the local area and who struggle to complete college -level general education requirements, but who want to increase their employability with new skills and credentials. Recruitment. Targeted recruitment efforts will include outreach and engagement with students who have expressed an interest in a business credential, but who struggle to complete college-level general education requirements, or who are currently working and/or caring for family members. Courses would be scheduled primarily online, in the evenings, or on weekends. Similar Offerings in NM. San Juan College, Clovis Community College, and the New Mexico State University branch campuses offer similar Certificate programs that range from 24 - 28 credit-hours. Santa Fe Community College offers a 15- credit Law Office Administrative Assistant Certificate. Formal Needs Assessment. Jobs that require customer service skills and basic knowledge about office management are projected to decrease by 0.29% from 2018-2028 in New Mexico (see APPENDIX A). In the northwestern part of the s tate, demand for these jobs will remain static. A gain, though, this program will primarily attempt to attract people who are already working in some of the largest sectors of our local economy. Program Content and Qualit y Curriculum Standards. The curri culum for this program will be made up of the following five courses: BCIS 1115: Introduction to Computers (3 credits). This is a lecture and hands-on course which focuses on different technologies commonly used in various occupations. This course will provide students with an overview of computer hardware, operating software, and the MS Office suite of applications. The class will also include an overview of the history of technology and its future, and will also provide a fundamental introduction to industry -standard application software for word processing, database management, and graphics. Basic computer use, files and file structure, Windows, the internet, programming, ethics, and security will also be addressed. Course cannot apply to major or minor in Computer Science. BUSA 1 210: Records Management (3 credits). Principles, methods and procedures for the selection, operation and control of manual and automated records systems. OTEC 1101: Beginning Keyboarding (3 credits). Develops proper keyboarding technique to achieve speed and accuracy. A minimum average of 25 words- per-minute (wpm) on three five- minute timings is required. This course will integrate keyboarding instruction with file management. BUSA 1130: Business Professionalism (3 credits). Focuses on developing professional behavior appropriate for the business environment. Topics include: Life Management, goal setting, workplace etiquette, job search skills, interviewing, teamwork and team building, motivation, leadership, business communication and workplace interaction. BUSA 2240: Customer Service in Business (3 credits). Established concepts of service quality in relationship to business success and maximization of returns to the organization. Explores techniques for delivering quality and service in a variety of business settings. Of these courses, one (BCIS 1115) is going through the approval process of being added to the UNM catalog. The remaining four transfer to UNM, but are adopted from the New Mexico HED common course catalog. We hope to eventually expand this program into a 30- credit Certificate in Office Administration and a 60- credit AAS in Office Administration , so all of these courses would be \"stackable\" into any degree pathways developed later in this area of study. Student Learning Outcomes. Upon completion of this Certificate program, students will be able to: - Understand the basics of computer concepts and different technologies used by home users , small office/home office users, mobile users, power users, and enterprise users - Operate and name different components of a computer - Access the web and utilize the resources and explain the evolution of the internet - Understand the importance of digital safety and security - Recognize Records Control and Management systems - Recognize the importance of using organized, efficient records management systems - Understand and discuss the records retention cycle, including control procedures for transferring, storin g, and destruction of files - Demonstrate proper keyboarding techniques - Communicate and interact in various office settings using professional etiquette - Identify the skills needed to provide exceptional customer service Instructional Models. Instruction will primarily be presented through lectures, discussion, and case studies. Accreditation. UNM -Gallup will seek accreditation for this program through the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Progra ms (ACBSP). Accreditation requires membership in the ACBSP, which costs roughly $3000/year, along with a one-time fee of $2500 to establish candidacy for Certificate accreditation. Each Certificate accredited requires a $400 annual fee. If only this Certif icate program was accredited through the ACBSP, it would cost UNM -Gallup a total of $5900 for initial accreditation, and a total of $3400 each year to remain accredited. Evaluation and Assessment Measuring SLOs. Assessments will include learner self -assessments, peer assessments, and assessments by instructors, including quizzes, case studies, reflective writing and other assignments, portfolios, and performance-based assessments using standardized rubrics that crosscut, integrate, and apply the core com petencies into real -world scenarios and customer encounters. Program Effectiveness and Plan to Assess Learning Outcomes. Students will complete a comprehensive, qualitative course evaluation, along with the standard UNM student evaluations. Periodic consultation with local employers and businesspeople will also provide feedback to inform curricular refinement. Required Resources Our campus already routinely offers one of the courses required in this program (the non- transferable equivalent of BCIS 1115, IT 101). This program will require the potential addition of four adjunct hires, each teaching one section a semester, at roughly $3k/course. The Business and Applied Technology Division at UNM-Gallup will absorb that, roughly, $12,000 annual cost. These adjunct faculty will be required to have at least 18 graduate- level credit hours (and, preferably, a Master's degree) in the ir area of instruction , or comparable work experience. No additional instructional space, additional faculty/student support, or addi tional equipment is needed to offer the courses required in this program. Projected Enrollment & Costs We plan to heavily market this program to working people not currently enrolled at any higher education institution. Program costs , over a one- year per iod, would be - again - roughly $12,000/year . We hope to recruit 15 students, enrolled in these 15 credits ($80.50/credit) each semester , which would produce roughly $18,112.50 in tuition dollars. Presumably, many students will complete the required course sequence within a semester, while others will attend courses part-time. In any case, we believe that the Business and Applied Technology Division can cover the costs of this program. Three of the courses in this program are shared with at least one other program being proposed for approval, so the costs discussed in this paragraph are a high estimate. Fall 2023 Spring 2024 Fall 2024 Spring 2025 Fall 2025 Spring 2026 15 students 15 students 15 students 15 students 15 students 15 students Detailed Program Budget: Revenue 15 students, enrolled in 15 credits/year @ $80.50/credit (our tuition rate) = Total potential revenue of $18,112.50/year Expenses Four adjunct faculty salaries Salary @ $1,000/credit hour, for twelve credit hours Potent ial maximum = $12,000/year Program costs would be covered by tuition.

Periodic consultation with local employers and businesspeople will also provide feedback to inform curricular refinement. Required Resources Our campus already routinely offers one of the courses required in this program (the non-transferable equivalent of BCIS 1115, IT 101). This program will require the potential addition of four adjunct hires, each teaching one section a semester, at roughly $3k/course. The Business and Applied Technology Division at UNM-Gallup will absorb that, roughly, $12,000 annual cost. These adjunct faculty will be required to have at least 18 graduate- level credit hours (and, preferably, a Master's degree) in the ir area of instruction , or comparable work experience . No additional instructional space, additional faculty/student support, or addi tional equipment is needed to offer the courses required in this program. Projected Enrollment & Costs We plan to heavily market this program to working people not currently enrolled at any higher education institution. Program costs , over a one- year per iod, would be - again - roughly $12,000/year . We hope to recruit 15 students, enrolled in these 15 credits ($80.50/credit) each semester , which would produce roughly $18,112.50 in tuition dollars. Presumably, many students will complete the required course sequence within a semester, while others will attend courses part-time. In any case, we believe that the Business and Applied Technology Division can cover the costs of this program. Three of the courses in this program are shared with at l east one other program being proposed for approval, so the costs discussed in this paragraph are a high estimate.

The CAA profession is continuing to grow rapidly causing a need forincreased numbers of graduates from these programs each year. A 2021 study on anesthesiology supply and demandconducted by Merritt Hawkins displayed a need for anesthesia providers nationwide due to an aging population in providersand increased demand of anesthesia from delayed surgeries due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Merritt Hawkins, 2021). The needfor anesthesiologist assistants is directly related to the shortages of physician anesthesiologists and certied registered nurseanesthetists (CRNAs). The excess of over 130 open anesthesia jobs within the State of New Mexico provides evidence of adire need for increased anesthesia providers regionally (Gasworks, 2022). Due to the 28-month intense curriculum, a UNM AAprogram can aid in providing a quicker supply of competent anesthesia providers to ll the current and future gaps inanesthesia personnel within New Mexico and the Southwest region while also maximizing the abilities of the physiciananesthesiologists on the anesthesia care team. CMS reimbursement for anesthesiologist assistants as non-physiciananesthesia providers also allows for a greater pool of qualied anesthesia providers to be utilized while ensuring decreasedcosts in healthcare but maintained prots from surgical procedures (CMS, 2022).Association of Anesthesiologist Assistant Education Programs, AAAEP .

Richardson Professorship in Nursing Endowment. Dr. Zychowski is an Assistant Professor in the University of New Mexico College of Nursing, where she is simultaneously building her independent research career as well as leading the new surge of momentum to bring basic science research into our College of Nursing. Dr. Zychowski's research spans the gamut from fundamental mechanistic toxicology to community-based research, which is especially focused on the underserved Native American communities of New Mexico. Dr. Zychowski trained at Texas A&M in Dr. Tim Phillips' lab prior to joining my program in 2014. Her contributions in my group, as a postdoc and then Research Assistant Professor led to 20 publications (so far) in very strong journals such as Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, Particle and Fibre Toxicology, Atherosclerosis, Toxicological Sciences., and Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology. She was fundamental to the orchestration of one of the most complex on-site field research operations I have ever seen, using a 53' mobile laboratory (loaned from Michigan State University) to study toxicity of uranium mine site-derived particulate matter on Navajo Nation, 4 hours away from the UNM research facilities. She developed and implemented novel translational assays leading to clinical manuscripts related to coronary artery disease and sleep apnea, in addition to the more typical preclinical work in my lab. Dr. Zychowski came to UNM as a postdoc and was awarded a fellowship through our Academic Science Education & Research Training (ASERT) K12 program, focused on research and science education. She excelled in this program and is routinely recognized as one of the major program successes. She built a \"Transition to Independence\" K99/R00 application to the National Institutes of Health around her early research, which was awarded on her first submission. This K99/R00 award brought over $850,000 to the UNM College of Nursing to support Dr. Zychowski and her team over the past three years. This award has helped to launch Dean Christine Kasper's vision towards the development of a more basic research enterprise that can feed the clinical and community care questions in the field of nursing. So far, with the addition of Drs. Zychowski and Xiaozhong Yu, this effort has been paying off extremely well, with new NIH and CDC funding. The independent research in Dr. Zychowski's lab is largely focused on understanding novel biomolecular responses in the lung following inhaled pollutant exposures, and how such 505.925.7778 | UNM College of Pharmacy | 1 University of New Mexico | MSC09 5360 | Albuquerque, NM 87131 goto.unm.edu/pharmacy responses can lead to systemic effects. Currently, she is focused on the formation of exosomes and microRNA, and she is also pursuing research on NETosis and extracellular traps from neutrophils. These novel directions positioned her nicely as independent from the studies in my program, and she has been successfully publishing and garnering new funding (e.g., a new 2-year, $415,000 grant from the NIH) on these topics. Notably, she has also transitioned nicely to implementing team science, with her colleague Dr. Roghanchi, on a new CDC/NIOSH study of silica and mine dust. Dr. Zychowski naturally has a high intellect, as is essential to succeed in our competitive funding environment. But was truly separates her from her peers is persistence. She has shown the ability to fight, and bounce back, to create better ideas, better grant proposals, better study designs. Her persistence is also inherent to her success at UNM and a huge benefit to the College of Nursing. It is this level of determination that makes her successful, and admirable, as well. I therefore think she is an ideal candidate for the Terry and Alyce J. Richardson Professorship in Nursing Endowment. Your consideration of her candidacy is greatly appreciated! Sincerely, Matthew J. Campen, Ph.D., M.S.P.H.

C oncurrently she teaches research and methods courses in the Honors Undergraduate P rogram and PhD program . Dr. Zychowski' s research focuses on the consequences of environmental pollutants such as inhaled dust from the mines in New Mexico at the cellular level. Dr . Zychowski is currently working on the cardiovascular effect of inhalational ura nium mine dust exposure in humans utilizing the New Mexico - based Mining dust in the United States (MiDUS) cohort . Dr. Zychowski is conducting her translation research with a team of scientists including Dr. Sood, Endowed C hair in Mining- Related Lung Diseases and the Medical Director, Miners' Wellness Tele- ECHOs Clinic which builds upon her previous foundational work with rodent models. Dr. Zychowski is a rising star and receiving the Richardson P rofessorship would facilitate and recognize her continued stellar work in the field of toxicology and position her academic career . She has been previously recognized by the Society of Toxicology by receiving the Donald E . Gardner Education Award and the 2016 Cardiovascular Specialty Section Travel Ward. R ecent ly she was invited to present her work at the CDC /NIOSH sponsored workshop on Silica Exposure and Lung Disease in the Mining industry. She serves as an NIH reviewer and was a previous Women in Toxicology awards reviewer . She receives excellent student teaching evaluations from her Undergraduate Honors Program and PhD doctoral students, and they often site her as a role model and someone who inspire s them . In conclusion, Dr. Zychowski is a promising scientist, leader, and educator and this recognition will further ensure her success as she develops into top notch scientist and leader in the field of toxicology. It is my pleasure to strongly support without reservation Dr. Zychowski for this prestigious professorship. Please feel free to contact me with questions. Sincerely, Patricia Watts Kelley, PhD, FNP -BC, GNP -BC, FAANP, FAAN Professor and Associate Dean for Research & Scholarship Patricia Higgins Endowed Professor pwattskelley@salud.unm.edu October 13, 2022 Dean Kasper and President Stokes, I am writing a letter of support for Assistant Professor, Dr. Katherine Zychowski in the UNM College of Nursing for the Richardson Professorship in Nursing. Dr. Zychowski has been at the UNM College of Nursing for over two years, and she has brought a depth and breadth of environmental health knowledge and research in toxicology to the Health Sciences. She has been participating in important cross disciplinary research studies with other investigators in the School of Medicine and the College of Pharmacy on Inhalation toxicology. She is primarily focused on pre-clinical studies involving biological mechanisms of inhaled toxicants impacting the blood brain barrier (which is novel and extremely important). She and her colleagues are exploring critical information involving uranium (U)-driven biomarkers, which have a direct, translational impact for clinicians and public health professionals. She has been an active participant in the Interprofessional Project ECHO Miners Wellness Telemedicine program and her research is supporting the work of rural clinicians with former uranium miners on health impacts from occupational exposures. Dr. Zychowski is also leading studies to assess the inflammatory response/ impact of inhaled wood smoke (from wildfires), to quantify and characterize some of the health impacts from wildfire exposure, which will guide protection measures for smoke-exposed individuals. In addition to her research, Dr. Zychowski has been an educator and mentor to several nursing students and is joining the work of Health Sciences faculty (including myself) to prepare the next generation of nurses and health professionals with the environmental health and planetary health information they need to address the health issues that our patients and populations will continue to experience at a greater pace in the future. With the support of the Richardson Endowment, Dr. Zychowski plans to work more closely with nursing students to engage them in environmental health practices and policies. She is also hoping to take the research that she has been collaborating on into rural New Mexico communities. This funding will help to support some of the logistics and time for that work. Dr. Zychowski is a light! Her work is unique, timely and relevant, and she brings important experience in environmental health to the Health Sciences Programs and the College of Nursing. I am in full support of her receiving the Richardson Endowed Chair position. Thank you for your consideration of this appointment, Heidi Honegger Rogers DNP, FNP-C, APHN-BC She/Her/Hers Director, UNM Health Sciences Interprofessional Education Program Associate Professor, UNM College of NursingHrogers1@Salud.UNM.edu Kidney Institute of New Mexico 505-272-0407 | 1 University of New Mexico | MSC04 2785 | Albuquerque, NM 87131 medicine.unm.edu October 12, 2022 To the Members of the Terry and Alyce J. Richardson Professorship in Nursing Committee, I recommend Dr. Katherine E. Zychowski, Ph.D., for the Richardson Endowed Professorship. Her resume attests that she is an exceptional candidate for the Endowed Professorship. She has firm priorities consonant with the University of New Mexico's missions. Regent's Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dr. Matthew J. Campen, Ph.D., M.S.P.H. provided an introduction half-way through the coronavirus pandemic. Personally, her tone and demeanor convey the confidence of a leader. In total, she has a record and personality that contribute significantly to the over-arching objectives of our institution. Background. My grandmother migrated to eastern New Mexico before it became an established state. My father and his brothers were born and raised in Portales and Clovis. Thanks to the GI Bill, my father, and his twin brother graduated from the University of New Mexico. He, his twin, and a younger brother served Albuquerque as dentists for approximately six decades. I am a native of Albuquerque and a graduate of the University of New Mexico (1990, 1992), the University of New Mexico Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program (1995), and the University of New Mexico School of Medicine (1999). My clinical residency and fellowship in nephrology were via the American Board of Internal Medicine Research Investigator Pathway, with research funding from the National Kidney Foundation. This line of research\u2014the role of platelet-derived growth factor receptor b in embryonic kidney development\u2014was funded by an American Heart Association Fellow to Faculty Transition Award. I spent 20 years in Texas, climbing the academic medicine ladder, and obtained the rank of tenured Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Texas Health System. In 2018, I returned to Albuquerque to direct the Kidney Institute of New Mexico and serve as the Renal Section Chief of the New Mexico Veterans Administration Health Care System. My research expertise centers on complications from magnetic resonance contrast agents. Magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents rely on the properties of a physiologically alien rare earth metal, gadolinium. When gadolinium triggers a complication, these are often fatal. Our research team is globally renowned for investigating the biological effects of these widely-used diagnostic agents. Since returning to Albuquerque in 2018, I have partnered with many investigators within the University of New Mexico/Health Sciences Center and advanced the science. Many Dr. Zychowski is an exemplary faculty member. She epitomizes a 'triple threat' faculty member: research, teaching, and service. Faculty members and students were fortunate to have recruited Dr. Zychowski to the College of Nursing at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. She has brought a large number of extramural research funds to the University. She teaches at the University of New Mexico and other campuses, such as Central New Mexico College. Her discoveries are impactful for the residents and laborers within New Mexico. Google Scholar metrics attest to this, showing a high number and rate of citations since her terminal degree. 505-272-0407 | 1 University of New Mexico | MSC04 2785 | Albuquerque, NM 87131 medicine.unm.edu My recommendation is with qualifications. My experience with academic medicine began with entering an experimental physiology laboratory led by the late Dr. William Galey, Jr., Ph.D., in 1992 as a graduate student. I was recruited to the University of New Mexico Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program by Dr. Robert Glew, Ph.D. After medical school, I am among the few in the nation to choose the American Board of Internal Medicine Research Investigator Pathway (with support from the NIH Loan Repayment Program). I served on many committees ranging from admissions to promotion and tenure. As one with a professional career within academic medicine, I know grand cru faculty members. Dr. Zychowski easily passes this bar.

Kasper, PhD, RN, FAAN, FACS and Professo r Crenshaw Endowed Chai r UNM College of Nursin g Dear Dean Kasper As the Miners' Colfax Medical Center Endowed Chair for Mining-Related Lung Diseases, the Medical Director of the Miners' Wellness Tele-ECHO Clinic, Assistant Dean , Distinguis hed Professor, and a current NIH-funded investigator, it is with the greatest enthusiasm that I recom mend Dr. Katherine Zychowski for the inaugural holder of the Terry and Alyce J. Richardson Endowed Professorship at UNM College of Nursing for her significant contributions to the field of toxicology. I have had over 20 years of experience as a pulmonary and critical care physician and researcher in the areas of lung and occupational -related diseases, as well as extensive experience in community and patient advocacy, minorit y and rural health and clinical and translational science. I am therefore in a n excellent position to review the scientific potential of Dr. Zychowski. As a tenure track Assistant Professor at the UNM College of Nursing, she is a junior faculty , and this award will further strengthen her academic career . She has previously been recognized with the Donald E. Gardner Educa tion Award and the 2016 Cardiovascular Specialty Section Travel Award . She is funded by multiple NIH grants ( K99, R00, R21, P42, and BAA Contract). Her research involves the health consequences of inhaled dusts from mining operations and other air pollution sources on serum -derived inflammatory mechanisms, including systemic inflammatory potential and exosomes. I have worked with Dr. Katherine Zychowski on the cardiovascular effect o f inhalational uranium mine dust exposure in humans for the last four years, utilizing the New Mexico -based Mining Dust in the United States (MiDUS) cohort. Our translational work expands upon her years of similar research in mice. She was invited to present her work at the recent workshop on Silica Exposure and Lung Disease in the Mining Industry, sponsored by the CDC/NIOSH. The significance of the work relates to the health impact of the occupational and environmental exposures to uranium dust that disproportionately impacts Navajo communities in New Mexico. She has already demonstrated leadership skills, including mentoring students in toxicology. She was the editor for the Women in Toxicology newsletter and the Women in Toxicology Awards Committee. In addition, she serves as a reviewer for multiple toxicology -related NIH study sections and teaches toxicology courses at the College of Pharmacy. The field of toxicology is going through a radical transformation, and technological advances and emphasis on underserved affected communities are changing the field. Young, dynamic leaders like Dr. Zychowski would play a vital role in this transformation, and recognition at this stage of her career would serve the future goal of the College of Nu rsing. There fore, I strongly recommend this award to Dr. Katherine Zychowski without any reservation. Please contact me with any questions at asood@salud.unm.edu.

Role: PI and Respirable Crystalline Silica (RCS) Physicochemistry and Toxicity Outcomes in an Occupational Risk Assessment Model Agency: National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (CDC/NIOSH) Goal: The inhalation and consequential deposition of respirable coal mine dust (RCMD) and respirable crystalline silica dust (RCS) in the different regions of miners' respiratory tracts could lead to detrimental biological responses and adverse health effects such as silicosis. It is, however, crucial to understand the level of dust particle toxicity based on the dose of exposure and dust particle characteristics to accurately assess miners' exposure dose and health effects. Establishment of a valid model that risk stratifies miners for coal workers' pneumoconiosis based on mine-, dust-, and health-specific measures could help identify high-risk mines for early intervention.

Richardson Professorship in Nursing Endowment. Dr. Zychowski is an Assistant Professor in the University of New Mexico College of Nursing, where she is simultaneously building her independent research career as well as leading the new surge of momentum to bring basic science research into our College of Nursing. Dr. Zychowski's research spans the gamut from fundamental mechanistic toxicology to community-based research, which is especially focused on the underserved Native American communities of New Mexico. Dr. Zychowski trained at Texas A&M in Dr. Tim Phillips' lab prior to joining my program in 2014. Her contributions in my group, as a postdoc and then Research Assistant Professor led to 20 publications (so far) in very strong journals such as Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, Particle and Fibre Toxicology, Atherosclerosis, Toxicological Sciences., and Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology. She was fundamental to the orchestration of one of the most complex on-site field research operations I have ever seen, using a 53' mobile laboratory (loaned from Michigan State University) to study toxicity of uranium mine site-derived particulate matter on Navajo Nation, 4 hours away from the UNM research facilities. She developed and implemented novel translational assays leading to clinical manuscripts related to coronary artery disease and sleep apnea, in addition to the more typical preclinical work in my lab. Dr. Zychowski came to UNM as a postdoc and was awarded a fellowship through our Academic Science Education & Research Training (ASERT) K12 program, focused on research and science education. She excelled in this program and is routinely recognized as one of the major program successes. She built a \"Transition to Independence\" K99/R00 application to the National Institutes of Health around her early research, which was awarded on her first submission. This K99/R00 award brought over $850,000 to the UNM College of Nursing to support Dr. Zychowski and her team over the past three years. This award has helped to launch Dean Christine Kasper's vision towards the development of a more basic research enterprise that can feed the clinical and community care questions in the field of nursing. So far, with the addition of Drs. Zychowski and Xiaozhong Yu, this effort has been paying off extremely well, with new NIH and CDC funding. The independent research in Dr. Zychowski's lab is largely focused on understanding novel biomolecular responses in the lung following inhaled pollutant exposures, and how such 505.925.7778 | UNM College of Pharmacy | 1 University of New Mexico | MSC09 5360 | Albuquerque, NM 87131 goto.unm.edu/pharmacy responses can lead to systemic effects. Currently, she is focused on the formation of exosomes and microRNA, and she is also pursuing research on NETosis and extracellular traps from neutrophils. These novel directions positioned her nicely as independent from the studies in my program, and she has been successfully publishing and garnering new funding (e.g., a new 2-year, $415,000 grant from the NIH) on these topics. Notably, she has also transitioned nicely to implementing team science, with her colleague Dr. Roghanchi, on a new CDC/NIOSH study of silica and mine dust. Dr. Zychowski naturally has a high intellect, as is essential to succeed in our competitive funding environment. But was truly separates her from her peers is persistence. She has shown the ability to fight, and bounce back, to create better ideas, better grant proposals, better study designs. Her persistence is also inherent to her success at UNM and a huge benefit to the College of Nursing. It is this level of determination that makes her successful, and admirable, as well.

Sincerely, Patricia Watts Kelley, PhD, FNP -BC, GNP -BC, FAANP, FAAN Professor and Associate Dean for Research & Scholarship Patricia Higgins Endowed Professor pwattskelley@salud.unm.edu October 13, 2022 Dean Kasper and President Stokes, I am writing a letter of support for Assistant Professor, Dr. Katherine Zychowski in the UNM College of Nursing for the Richardson Professorship in Nursing. Dr. Zychowski has been at the UNM College of Nursing for over two years, and she has brought a depth and breadth of environmental health knowledge and research in toxicology to the Health Sciences. She has been participating in important cross disciplinary research studies with other investigators in the School of Medicine and the College of Pharmacy on Inhalation toxicology. She is primarily focused on pre-clinical studies involving biological mechanisms of inhaled toxicants impacting the blood brain barrier (which is novel and extremely important). She and her colleagues are exploring critical information involving uranium (U)-driven biomarkers, which have a direct, translational impact for clinicians and public health professionals. She has been an active participant in the Interprofessional Project ECHO Miners Wellness Telemedicine program and her research is supporting the work of rural clinicians with former uranium miners on health impacts from occupational exposures. Dr. Zychowski is also leading studies to assess the inflammatory response/ impact of inhaled wood smoke (from wildfires), to quantify and characterize some of the health impacts from wildfire exposure, which will guide protection measures for smoke-exposed individuals. In addition to her research, Dr. Zychowski has been an educator and mentor to several nursing students and is joining the work of Health Sciences faculty (including myself) to prepare the next generation of nurses and health professionals with the environmental health and planetary health information they need to address the health issues that our patients and populations will continue to experience at a greater pace in the future. With the support of the Richardson Endowment, Dr. Zychowski plans to work more closely with nursing students to engage them in environmental health practices and policies. She is also hoping to take the research that she has been collaborating on into rural New Mexico communities. This funding will help to support some of the logistics and time for that work. Dr. Zychowski is a light! Her work is unique, timely and relevant, and she brings important experience in environmental health to the Health Sciences Programs and the College of Nursing. I am in full support of her receiving the Richardson Endowed Chair position. Thank you for your consideration of this appointment, Heidi Honegger Rogers DNP, FNP-C, APHN-BC She/Her/Hers Director, UNM Health Sciences Interprofessional Education Program Associate Professor, UNM College of NursingHrogers1@Salud.UNM.edu Kidney Institute of New Mexico 505-272-0407 | 1 University of New Mexico | MSC04 2785 | Albuquerque, NM 87131 medicine.unm.edu October 12, 2022 To the Members of the Terry and Alyce J. Richardson Professorship in Nursing Committee, I recommend Dr. Katherine E. Zychowski, Ph.D., for the Richardson Endowed Professorship. Her resume attests that she is an exceptional candidate for the Endowed Professorship. She has firm priorities consonant with the University of New Mexico's missions. Regent's Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dr. Matthew J. Campen, Ph.D., M.S.P.H. provided an introduction half-way through the coronavirus pandemic. Personally, her tone and demeanor convey the confidence of a leader. In total, she has a record and personality that contribute significantly to the over-arching objectives of our institution. Background. My grandmother migrated to eastern New Mexico before it became an established state. My father and his brothers were born and raised in Portales and Clovis. Thanks to the GI Bill, my father, and his twin brother graduated from the University of New Mexico. He, his twin, and a younger brother served Albuquerque as dentists for approximately six decades. I am a native of Albuquerque and a graduate of the University of New Mexico (1990, 1992), the University of New Mexico Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program (1995), and the University of New Mexico School of Medicine (1999). My clinical residency and fellowship in nephrology were via the American Board of Internal Medicine Research Investigator Pathway, with research funding from the National Kidney Foundation. This line of research\u2014the role of platelet-derived growth factor receptor b in embryonic kidney development\u2014was funded by an American Heart Association Fellow to Faculty Transition Award. I spent 20 years in Texas, climbing the academic medicine ladder, and obtained the rank of tenured Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Texas Health System. In 2018, I returned to Albuquerque to direct the Kidney Institute of New Mexico and serve as the Renal Section Chief of the New Mexico Veterans Administration Health Care System. My research expertise centers on complications from magnetic resonance contrast agents. Magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents rely on the properties of a physiologically alien rare earth metal, gadolinium. When gadolinium triggers a complication, these are often fatal. Our research team is globally renowned for investigating the biological effects of these widely-used diagnostic agents. Since returning to Albuquerque in 2018, I have partnered with many investigators within the University of New Mexico/Health Sciences Center and advanced the science. Many Dr. Zychowski is an exemplary faculty member. She epitomizes a 'triple threat' faculty member: research, teaching, and service. Faculty members and students were fortunate to have recruited Dr. Zychowski to the College of Nursing at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. She has brought a large number of extramural research funds to the University. She teaches at the University of New Mexico and other campuses, such as Central New Mexico College. Her discoveries are impactful for the residents and laborers within New Mexico. Google Scholar metrics attest to this, showing a high number and rate of citations since her terminal degree. 505-272-0407 | 1 University of New Mexico | MSC04 2785 | Albuquerque, NM 87131 medicine.unm.edu My recommendation is with qualifications. My experience with academic medicine began with entering an experimental physiology laboratory led by the late Dr. William Galey, Jr., Ph.D., in 1992 as a graduate student. I was recruited to the University of New Mexico Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program by Dr. Robert Glew, Ph.D. After medical school, I am among the few in the nation to choose the American Board of Internal Medicine Research Investigator Pathway (with support from the NIH Loan Repayment Program). I served on many committees ranging from admissions to promotion and tenure. As one with a professional career within academic medicine, I know grand cru faculty members. Dr. Zychowski easily passes this bar.

Kasper, PhD, RN, FAAN, FACS and Professo r Crenshaw Endowed Chai r UNM College of Nursin g Dear Dean Kasper As the Miners' Colfax Medical Center Endowed Chair for Mining-Related Lung Diseases, the Medical Director of the Miners' Wellness Tele-ECHO Clinic, Assistant Dean , Distinguis hed Professor, and a current NIH-funded investigator, it is with the greatest enthusiasm that I recom mend Dr. Katherine Zychowski for the inaugural holder of the Terry and Alyce J. Richardson Endowed Professorship at UNM College of Nursing for her significant contributions to the field of toxicology. I have had over 20 years of experience as a pulmonary and critical care physician and researcher in the areas of lung and occupational -related diseases, as well as extensive experience in community and patient advocacy, minorit y and rural health and clinical and translational science. I am therefore in a n excellent position to review the scientific potential of Dr. Zychowski. As a tenure track Assistant Professor at the UNM College of Nursing, she is a junior faculty , and this award will further strengthen her academic career . She has previously been recognized with the Donald E. Gardner Educa tion Award and the 2016 Cardiovascular Specialty Section Travel Award . She is funded by multiple NIH grants ( K99, R00, R21, P42, and BAA Contract). Her research involves the health consequences of inhaled dusts from mining operations and other air pollution sources on serum -derived inflammatory mechanisms, including systemic inflammatory potential and exosomes. I have worked with Dr. Katherine Zychowski on the cardiovascular effect o f inhalational uranium mine dust exposure in humans for the last four years, utilizing the New Mexico -based Mining Dust in the United States (MiDUS) cohort. Our translational work expands upon her years of similar research in mice. She was invited to present her work at the recent workshop on Silica Exposure and Lung Disease in the Mining Industry, sponsored by the CDC/NIOSH. The significance of the work relates to the health impact of the occupational and environmental exposures to uranium dust that disproportionately impacts Navajo communities in New Mexico. She has already demonstrated leadership skills, including mentoring students in toxicology. She was the editor for the Women in Toxicology newsletter and the Women in Toxicology Awards Committee. In addition, she serves as a reviewer for multiple toxicology -related NIH study sections and teaches toxicology courses at the College of Pharmacy. The field of toxicology is going through a radical transformation, and technological advances and emphasis on underserved affected communities are changing the field. Young, dynamic leaders like Dr. Zychowski would play a vital role in this transformation, and recognition at this stage of her career would serve the future goal of the College of Nu rsing. There fore, I strongly recommend this award to Dr. Katherine Zychowski without any reservation. Please contact me with any questions at asood@salud.unm.edu.

She is an Associate Professor (tenured) in the College of Nursing (CON) , University of New Mexico . She has consistently advanced the science in the area of care for women and children. In the CON our leadership structure is unique in that all the tenure track and tenure d faculty report to the Associate Dean of Research and Scholarship, therefore I have direct knowledge of Dr. Ruyak' s expertise. I will address her contributions to teac hing, research and scholarship below. Dr. Ruyak teaches in the undergraduate and graduate nursing programs . The courses she teaches are in the areas of obstetrics, honors study in nursing, mixed methods research, genetic literacy, theoretical in nursing, and theory. Dr Ruyak's teaching performance has been evaluated by both students and her peers as being highly effective as evidenced by her student evaluation scores (SES) and peer evaluations. Her mean SESs have been consistently above those in the CON. H er student evaluations reflect her attention to providing effectiveness in teaching; she is an approachable professor and encourages student engagement. . Dr. Ruyak's research and scholarship concentration is in the biobehavioral mechanisms of adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes, especially in disadvantaged populations including mothers and infants affected by substance use disorders. Current funded research projects examine the intersection of maternal diverse forms of early life psychobiological stress and trauma across the lifespan and prenatal substance use as it relates to placenta function and neurobehavioral development of the fetus and infant. Dr. Ruyak's research has recently expanded beyond clinical assessment of at -risk pregnant women and infa nts to the area of translational research, specifically maternal -placental -fetal axis, and placenta programming of immune and serotonin functions. This new direction already resulted in a manuscript evaluating the effect of prenatal opioid and alcohol exposures on key placental immune and serotonin signaling factors. She has establish ed successful collaborations with investigators across different disciplines and departments at the UNM Health Sciences Center (College of Pharmacy, Department of Neurosciences, Department of Pediatrics) . Dr. Ruyak has submitted NIH K08 and R01 application to further develop her repertoire of skills in clinical/translational research. She identified a highly translational project, which will expand her skills in both clinical laboratory approaches and working with vulnerable populations. Dr. Ruyak is a respected scholar with publications in the Journal of Obstetric, Gynecological, and Neonatal Nursing, Nursing Forum, Western Journal of Nursing Research, Journal of Midwifery and Women's H ealth, Journal of Pediatrics and Neonatal Medicine, and Current Pathology Reports. At present she is the first author on multiple peer reviewed publications and book chapters. She has consistently disseminated her scholarship at numerous international, national, and regional meetings as an invited and peer r eview ed. In recognition of her women and neonatal advocacy and program of research, she received the prestigious Rosenblum -Weiss Endowment for Excellence in Women's and Children's Health from the UNM Foundation in 2021 (one-year award) .

I have been collaborating with Sharon for almost 5 years on a research project related to the impact of prenatal opioid and/or alcohol exposure on the fetal -placental neuroimmune interface. As faculty in the Dept of Neuroscience here at UNM -HSC conducting research on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on central nervo us system function using preclinical rodent models, I have learned the value of the clinical perspective from Sharon. Through our collaboration, my research has been enriched by addressing relevant questions not only with regard to the impact of alcohol's effects on the young child, but also its impact on mother. In fact, from insightful discussions with Sharon, I have incorporated new ideas and hypotheses that address both mother and child. For example, Sharon has worked extensively on examining the role of the placenta following opioid and/or alcohol exposure that is affected by , and effects the developing fetus. She found that in the human placenta, components of the serotonin signaling pathway may impact critical proinflammatory cytokine expression, and while speculative, may underlie some aspects of adverse fetal brain development. The results of her research inspired a set of experiments in my research program that examines the effects of stress hormones on the placenta that can contribute to adverse in utero conditions resulting central nervous system cognitive deficits in my preclinical animal rodent mode. The impact of this research will identify potential new targets for developing therapeutics to mitigate the impact of prenatal alcohol on the developing brain, and may additionally identify novel biomarkers of adverse placental -fetal conditions whereby early intervention strategies for young children can be employed to reduce potential developmental delays. I have observed Sharon's outs tanding professionalism, collaborative nature, and scientific intellectual development through our efforts in team science of the past 5 years. It has been very clear that Sharon is entirely committed to research focused on improving the lives of mom and baby during a nd after pregnancy . Through her compassion, I believe her research project s have been impressively in -depth and broad in scope; signs of a person who is very serious about developing an independent research program through extramural scientific research awards. Importantly , cutting edge work at UNM requires a multidisciplinary approach, and Sharon has mastered the skill of building bridges and establishing new collaborations here at UNM . In summary, f rom my persona l observations, Sharon is an outstanding and talented research scientist well-poised to establish impactful and significant research in the coming years. Sincerely.

Albers Professorship in Midwifery. I have known Dr. Ruyak since she began her tenure at the UNM College of Nursing (CON) in 2013. Shortly after arriving at UNM, Dr. Ruyak established a collaborative relationship with the Midwifery Division in the Department of OBGYN. The Midwifery Division has had a long, successful history of collaborative research work, beginning with Dr. Leah Albers. The Midwifery Division subsequently has had the pleasure of working with Dr. Ruyak on recruiting participants and gathering data for two of her research projects, Embodiment of maternal distress: links in the maternal, placental and fetal environment and Psychosocial and genetic predictors of postpartum depression: the search for clinical intervention points during pregnancy. 'U\u0011\u00035X\\DN\u00b6V meticulous work on these projects resulted in valuable contributions to the science and highlighted the excellence and relevance of midwifery-led research. As detailed in her curriculum vitae, Dr. Ruyak has demonstrated her commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of pregnant people and newborns by pursuing research examining, among other things, links between maternal stress and trauma and fetal and newborn development. Her expertise in the areas of maternal mental health and the impact of substance use disorder on pregnancy and fetal and newborn development has proven invaluable in advancing the science in areas that are so relevant to providing holistic healthcare today. Because Dr. Albers mentored me in my early career, I can say with confidence WKDW\u0003'U\u0011\u00035X\\DN\u00b6V\u0003SURYHQ\u0003H[FHOOHQFH\u0003LQ\u0003FROODERUWLYH\u000f\u0003PLGZLIHU\\-led research make her the ideal candidate to assume the mantle of the Albers Professorship.

Nearly half of the Native American population of the United States lives in 13 western states in proximity of an estimated 161,000 abandoned hardrock mines, with more than 4,000 being abandoned uranium mines. Because of their reliance on natural resources to maintain traditional diets, lifestyles, customs and languages, these tribal communities have direct and frequent contact with metal mixtures from abandoned mine sites, creating exposures through multiple pathways including inhalation, drinking water, and ingestion of foods either directly or indirectly contaminated by migration of the wastes. The goal of this project is to develop fine- scale predictive models, ground -truthed through monitoring, and the integration of multiple exposure streams will provide a resource to not only inform policy, but aid clinicians in identifying early risks to develop prevention strategies as well.

Legend for highlights: Text from current policy shown in black ; recommended changes to address current practice are shown in red, underlined . Revisions to the Policy Rationale, Policy Statement, and Applicability sections of this document must be appr oved by the full Faculty Senate POLICY RATIONAL E Although UNM maintains a variety of information applicable to faculty members, it is important to differentiate between information that is placed in a faculty member 's \"Faculty Personnel Files\" and files maintained by components of UNM for reporting and/or documentati on purposes. Additional files may exist containing information pertaining to individual faculty members that are maintained by administrative offices, units, subunits, and branches under the ultimate authority of the President of UNM. Such files are not F aculty Personnel Files under this Policy, whether in written or electronic form. Designated Faculty Personnel Files must contain include , and are limited to, any written information used to any degree in making a decision concerning the employment, rank , or status of a faculty member. This Policy identifies the type of information that may be placed in Faculty Personnel File s, the location of those files, confidentiality of the information, and rights and responsibilities pertaining to the Faculty Personnel Files. This Policy also discusses how faculty information that is subject to the Inspection of Public Records Act is handled. POLICY STATEMENT Collectively, these documents are referred to in this Policy as Faculty Personnel Files concerning UNM faculty of the University of New Mexico shall be gathered, retained, disclosed, and used by academic or administrative units of the University subject to the following rules stated in this Policy. Agreements reached by collective bargaining will hold precedence over any element of this Policy for faculty members covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 1. Collection and Retention of Information 1.1 No more than one (1) personnel file shall be maintained in each of the following locations: (1) the faculty member's department (or other primary academic unit), (2) the faculty member's college, Policy C70 \"Confidentiality of Faculty Records \" 11/8 /21 Page 2 of 6 (3) and/or in the office of the Provost or Executive Vice President for Health Sciences (EVPHS ). Faculty Personnel Files shall be compiled or retained by UNM academic or administrative units of the Univer sity solely for the purposes of administering the UNM University personnel system, including the consideration of promotion, tenure , and separation from employment. 1.2 An item of information may be introduced into a faculty personnel file only if accompanied by written identification of the source of the information subject to the right of peer or student evaluators to keep their identities confidential from the faculty member evaluated as provided in section 2.2 herein . However, if a complaint of misconduct is made against a faculty member and a determination is made that no misconduct occurred, the faculty member retains the right to decide what information , if any, is documented in their Faculty P ersonnel Files or any component thereof. NOTE: This language attempts to address the C07 concern raised. 1.3 Administrators with responsibility for the creation of Faculty Personnel Files identified in section 1.1 herein above are responsible to maintain the file and its security during the faculty member's employment at UNM the University and at least five (5) years thereafter (files of emeritus faculty shall be maintained during the faculty member's lifetime a nd at least two (2) years thereafter). 1.4 The administrative officer responsible for maintaining Faculty Personnel Files shall notify faculty in writing of any material deleted from their Faculty Personnel Files, the nature of the material and the reason for the action. In a similar manner, faculty shall be notified in writing of any material added to their file(s) with respect to which they have not been copied. Faculty members have the right to know and the responsibility to examine their Faculty Personnel Files. Information 1.5 With the exception of the faculty member's Dossier as described in Section B policies of the Faculty Handbook , other information outside of the Faculty Personnel Files may not be used for making a decision regarding faculty promotion, tenure, and separation from employment . 1.6 Information that is maintained by UNM administration is subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations. 2. Access to Information by the Faculty Member 2.1 Each faculty member has the right to inspect and review within ten (10) days without unreasonable delay by UNM the University (normally within two weeks) their Faculty Personnel Files and any record or file maintained on the faculty member him or her by UNM the University subject to the provisions of this Policy and any limitations imposed by law. If additional time is needed to produce a record for inspection, the faculty member shall be informed in writing of the reason for the delay and the date such record will be available. Each faculty member has the right to challe nge the accuracy of any item of information in their her or his Faculty Personnel Files, including the right to introduce rebuttal statements or evidence into the files. The faculty member may request the administrative officer of the unit maintaining the file to amend or delete any item of information contained in the file. The administrative officer shall respond to a faculty member's request within two (2) weeks, and if the request is denied, shall state in Policy C70 \"Confidentiality of Faculty Records \" 11/8 /21 Page 3 of 6 writing the reasons for the denial. The decisio n of the administrative officer must be approved by the dean and the Provost's Office/ EVPHS Vice President for Health Sciences . The administrative review process delineated herein does not replace the right to appeal such action if it is within the purview of the Academic Freedom and Tenure Committee (AF&T) . 2.2 UNM the University respects the desire of many authors of faculty evaluations to keep their identities confidential, including from the faculty member being evaluated. Such matters of opinion include letters of reference for employment, internal peer evaluations of a faculty member, student evaluations, letters received from peer reviewers outside the University, as well as those portions of the recommendations of the faculty member's chair or dean or the Senior Vice Provost Associate Provost that may reveal the identities of peer or student evaluations. a. If a faculty member makes a request to review and/or copy such evaluations, an academic administrator, prior to permitting such review or copying, shall redact material that may reveal the identity of the author. If it does not appear feasible to protect the identity of the author through redaction, the document may be accurately summarized in writing for the faculty member instead . If the author of an evaluation submits a written waiver of confidentiality, the evaluation may be reviewed or copied by the faculty member without redaction. If requested by the faculty member, a member of the Provost/ EVPHS office and a member of the Com mittee on Academic Freedom and Tenure designated by the Chair of the Committee shall verify the accuracy of the redacted or summarized documents. b. If such information is requested by a third party, the faculty member shall be advised of the request prior to the release of the information. 2.3 To the extent information is confidential under this Policy, or privileged under law (for example, materials subject to attorney -client privilege), it shall not be available for inspection by the faculty member. Such information shall be retained separately and shall be available for inspection only by UNM University officials granted access, by virtue of their assigned whose duties make it necessary for them to know the particular information requested . In the case of privileged information, the administrative officer of the academic or administrative unit maintaining the files shall introduce a memorandum that states the nature of the privileged information, its date and source and the type of privilege asserted. 2.4. Any confidential medical information maintained by UNM shall be protected in a manner consistent with applicable state and federal laws. 2.5. Consistent with UAP Policy 3710, faculty information shall be made available only to those member s of the Administration who have a legitimate business reason to view the information. 2.6 The Academic Freedom and Tenure Committee and the University Secretary may have access to Faculty Personnel Files when an issue is appealed to AF&T in accordance with Section B of the Faculty Handbook . Policy C70 \"Confidentiality of Faculty Records \" 11/8 /21 Page 4 of 6 3. Public Access to Information about Faculty Members 3.1 Any person is entitled to the following public information maintai ned by UNM the University concerning a faculty member: present position, department, salary, dates of employment, and curriculum vitae, including educational qualifications, past employment, progress at UNM the University (initial employment, promotions, attainment of tenure, sabba ticals), publications, news items, awards and achievements . A faculty member may give written authority for the release of other information, said letter to be maintained in the faculty member's faculty personnel file. 3.2 Other than as provided in section 3.1 herein , records or information concerning a faculty member shall be made available by the custodian of a file of record only to those members of UNM the University who have an official role in the evaluation of that faculty member for purposes of empl oyment, rank, status, salary, or other such decisions and whose role makes it necessary for them to know the contents of that faculty member's Faculty Personnel Files. 3.3 All requests for information from persons who are not members of UNM the University shall be referred to UNM the University Custodian of Public Records, which will coordinate a proper response with the appropriate Academic Affairs Faculty Contracts Office. The Custodian shall attempt to advise the faculty member by email and phone his or her telephone number of the request for the release prior to the release of any records. In coordination with the Custodian, the appropriate Academic Affairs Facult y Contracts Office shall make available for inspection upon request the releasable information concerning a faculty member. A record of the name and address of any member of the public making such request shall be kept in the faculty member's faculty perso nnel file at the appropriate A cademic Affairs Provost/VPHS office and be available for inspection by the faculty member. APPLICABILITY All UNM faculty including the Health Sciences and branch community colleges . DEFINITIONS No specific definitions are required for the Policy Statement.
