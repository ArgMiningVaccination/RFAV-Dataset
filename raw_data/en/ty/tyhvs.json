E-mail: francesco.chirico@unicatt.it Abstract Spirituality refers to a set of values of connectedness with the self, others and the entire universe that is gui- ded by a connection with the Transcendent and Superior. In today's times of the COVID-19 pandemic, spi- ritual skills can be a resource to address mental health issues, both among the general population, especially the most vulnerable, including the elderly, sick, marginalised and those affected by psychiatric conditions, and certain categories of workers, including healthcare professionals. All of these mentioned are at a high risk of mental health disorders, such as anxiety, depression, burnout and post-traumatic stress disorders. During the current pandemic, higher levels of spiritual distress have been associated with lower mental health levels in the population. Therefore, to address the spiritual needs and religious beliefs of patients and families, public health stakeholders should ensure the continuity of spiritual and religious activities during the pandemic as well as the training of healthcare professionals on this topic. At the global level, spiritual resources and values could be decisive skills for coping with the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in the short and long term, for example, the socioeconomic inequalities generated by the current pandemic. However, they could also be important in addressing post-COVID-19 pandemic climate change and other emerging challenges, such as advancing global health security and reaching sustainable develop- ment goals.Journal of Health and Social Sciences 2021; 6,2:151-158 The Italian Journal for Interdisciplinary Health and Social Development152INTRODUCTION During the COVID-19 pandemic, govern- ments and policymakers have faced unpre- cedented challenges regarding public heal- th because social and economic disruption caused by lockdown measures have produ- ced devastating effects on the physical and psychological well-being of the population at a global level [1]. There is growing interest in the scientific community regarding reli- giousness and spirituality, as they have been found to be resources and coping skills that may positively impact physical and mental health worldwide [2]. Spirituality refers to a morality-oriented intellectual connected- ness with the self, others and the entire uni- verse that is guided by a connection with the Transcendent and Superior [3]. It includes the concepts of meaningfulness, comple- teness and connectedness, which provide coherent meaning, love and happiness [3]. There is no universally accepted definition of spirituality, but spirituality and religiou- sness are considered two different concepts [4]. Religiousness has been defined as a set of beliefs and practices associated with a re- ligious tradition [5]. Spirituality, however, is a larger construct, without confessional constraints, which encompasses concepts such as transcendence, connection, whole- ness and compassion [6]. Even though it is possible to be religious without being spi- ritual and spiritual without being religious [7], they are interconnected and difficult to separate. In the literature, they are both considered personal resources or coping strategies that are suitable for handling cri- sis situations, such as the death of a child for parents [8] or long-term stress [9]. Reli- giosity and spirituality have positive effects on an individual's mental and physical heal- th and promote higher levels of well-being, life satisfaction, sense of purpose, meaning of life, hope and optimism and lower rates of anxiety, depression and substance abuse [10]. In this commentary, therefore, I di- scuss the role of spirituality before and du- ring the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as in the post-pandemic era, when hu- mankind will face climate change and other future global challenges.

Received: 15/05/2021 Accepted: 29/05/2021 Published Sciences 2021; 6,2:151-158 The Italian Journal for Interdisciplinary Health and Social Development153DISCUSSION Spirituality before the COVID-19 pandemic Religion can influence all social phenomena. For this reason, pathological religiosity has been considered a major feature in some hi- storical and recent conflicts and has played a central role in modern terrorism [11]. It has been argued that r adicalism, malignant na- tionalism, pathological religiosity and violent extremism and terrorism, along with war con- flicts, can produce and perpetuate huge men- tal health problems in populations around the world. In contrast, healthy spirituality and sound religiosity may contribute significantly to public and global mental health and pro- motion of an empathic civilization [12]. In my opinion, the deviant use of religion has been triggered by the violent separation of re- ligion and spirituality, characterised by lower expressions of a belief in God among young adults and a higher engagement in extreme forms of spirituality outside of the framework of religion [13]. In this technological and glo- balised world, little attention has been given by some governments to global public health issues, such as global warming and climate change, which has played a role in increa- singly frequent worldwide natural disasters, such as devastating earthquakes, wind and ice storms, floods, draught and famine, which in turn have contributed to ongoing confli- cts and wars between and within countries. The emergence of new forms of contagious and deadly infectious diseases, such as HIV/ AIDS, the 2003 SARS epidemic, pandemic strains of influenza (e.g. the 2009 H1N1 in- fluenza), the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Zika virus and the 2014 Middle East respiratory syndrome corona- virus (MERS CoV) outbreak, are likely the result of the abusive power of man over natu- re. Anthroponoses (i.e. diseases transmissible from human to human), zoonoses (diseases transmissible from living animals to humans) and sapronoses (human diseases transmissi- ble from abiotic environments to humans) are new emerging infectious diseases [14] which are impacting natural ecosystems at unprece-dented rates in response to increases in hu- man mobility, climate change and the crea- tion of new habitat conditions [15]. Religion has been found to possibly influence people's attitudes and behaviour towards climate change [16] and is helpful for institutions in constructing the meanings of climate chan- ge [17]. Climate change, indeed, is primarily a cultural issue [18]. However, research on how spirituality may impact climate change has been overlooked by scholars. It is likely no coincidence that a society with little or no attention to spiritual values has facilitated the acceleration of the climate change phenome- non. Climate change is reducing natural re- sources and biodiversity. The suffering of the Earth is likely to affect our way of life and our spiritual needs. Spirituality during the COVID-19 pande- mic: Tackling socioeconomic and psychologi- cal issues The COVID-19 pandemic is having and will have in the near future important con- sequences on the population's physical and mental health [18, 19]. According to Rogers et al, COVID-19 will have both short- and long-term psychiatric implications, with an increasing prevalence of anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia and post-traumatic stress [20]. Lockdown measures, which, in absen- ce of vaccination and effective therapies, were the only weapons against the pandemic, seem to increase mental health problems [21]. Cer- tain categories of workers, such as healthcare professionals, have suffered disproportiona- tely during the pandemic, as many became infected and sick and reported high work burdens and huge emotional loads resulting from watching people die without the sup- port of their loved ones. This led to increased levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia and burnout [22-29]. Among the population, the interruption of funeral rituals and practices due to lockdown and social-restriction mea- sures has aggravated the experience of grief because the ability to connect with the dece- ased was compromised [30]. This threatened the mental well-being of the bereaved [31]. Journal of Health and Social Sciences 2021; 6,2:151-158 The Italian Journal for Interdisciplinary Health and Social Development154The experience of social isolation, fear of de- ath, socioeconomic difficulty and uncertainty of the future have all been conditions capable of intensifying the grief experience, thus in- creasing the risk of complicated grief [32]. Lower mental health levels of the population have been, therefore, associated with higher levels of spiritual distress, which is a condi- tion characterised by a sufferance connected with the impossibility of feeling meaning in life [31]. In a time when regular religious participa- tion, which is normally associated with better emotional health outcomes, has been prohi- bited for safety reasons, faith and spirituality have nonetheless represented the main strate- gy of emotional survival in the face of death and fear of death. This has been confirmed by studies carried out among the Catholic popu- lation [33] and healthcare professionals [34, 35]. Religious and spiritual beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic have also been asso- ciated with higher levels of hopefulness and lower levels of fear, worry and sadness [9], which suggests that spiritual and religious coping can be used by individuals in a positi- ve (i.e. finding meaning, spiritual connection and benevolent religious reappraisals) and not in a negative (i.e. religious struggle, punish- ment and reappraisal of God's power) way [36]. Therefore, to address the spiritual needs and religious beliefs of patients and families, public health stakeholders should ensure the continuity of spiritual and religious activities during the pandemic as well as the training of healthcare professionals on this topic [10]. In particular, special attention should be given to the most vulnerable, namely the elderly, the sick and the marginalised, who have to deal with this sudden major stressor event along with other pre-existing major life stressors [37]. A 'new' spirituality in the post-COVID-19 era to combat new global challenges According to findings presented by an inde- pendent panel of international scientists de- signated by the World Health Organization [38], division and inequality between and within countries have been exacerbated by the current COVID-19 pandemic, and their impact has been more severe on people who are already marginalised and disadvantaged. As of 28 April 2021, 148 million people were confirmed infected by the SARS-COV-2, and more than 3 million have died in 223 countries, territories and areas. It is the worst combined health and socioeconomic crisis in living memory, with 115-125 million people being pushed into extreme poverty\u2014the de- epest shock to the global economy since the Second World War. A great reason for con- cern is the persistent transmission of SARS- CoV2 due to the development of new virus variants and the uneven access to vaccina- tion at the global level. Developing countries are also more disadvantaged in this fight, as inequal resources for tackling the pandemic have left those working in the informal sector, migrants, refugees and displaced people with little or no access to testing services and heal- th facilities [38]. At the individual level, spirituality is a reco- gnised source of comfort, support and mea- ning [39]. Spiritual well-being has been as- sociated with higher levels of physical and mental health [40, 41]. Therefore, spiritual re- sources can be an effective source of resilience to manage and cope with the consequences of stressful events like this pandemic [41, 42], particularly in older people [43], who are also the most involved in religious and spiritual activities [44], but also in the most vulnerable. Spiritual initiatives could be implemented at the workplace [45-47]. However, everyone should receive spiritual care and assistance in times of a pandemic, atheists and believers alike, to avoid spiritual distress that may have implications on mental well-being. Nevertheless, at the global level, spiritual re- sources are not less important. To tackle this and new pandemics, international cooperation and better coordination among countries are essential to ensure more economic resour- ces, better healthcare facilities for developing countries and equal opportunity to get vacci- nated and receive effective treatments against COVID-19 infections in all countries [38]. Journal of Health and Social Sciences 2021; 6,2:151-158 The Italian Journal for Interdisciplinary Health and Social Development155Health inequity and socioeconomic inequality between developed and developing countries are likely the main challenges that global heal- th stakeholders must address in the near future. In a broader sense, an individual's spiritual well-being does depend upon the Earth's state of well-being. However, as suggested by the 'One Health' Initiative, an important yet complex concept to understand is that we, and thus our health, are 'one' with the Earth, as this interconnection encompasses physical, psychological, social, economic and spiritual aspects of our well-being [48, 49]. Spiritual resources are a requisite for better cooperation among the human, animal and environmental sciences and suggest new cul- tural and philosophical principles to combat climate change and other emerging public health threats [50]. Only this new deeper un-derstanding will allow us to effectively tackle COVID-19 as well as future challenges in a changing world. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to find new ways of living. The moment is decisive for creating more inter- national cooperation and coordination to end the current COVID-19 pandemic. Spiritual resources are decisive skills for coping with the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in the short and long term. Spiri- tuality encompasses philosophical and cultural aspects that may contribute to tackling clima- te change and other emerging challenges, such as the migrant emergency, wars and conflicts, advancing global health security and reaching the Sustainable Development Goals [51].
