The second objective was to examine whether therisk of autism differs between use of MMR and the single measles vaccine.Design: Case-control study. Study Population: The 96 cases with childhood or atypical autism, aged 2 to 15, were included into the study group. Controls consisted of 192children individually matched to cases by year of birth, sex, and generalpractitioners.Methods: Data on autism diagnosis and vaccination history were from physicians. Data on the other probable autism risk factors were collectedfrom mothers. Logistic conditional regression was used to assess the risk ofautism resulting from vaccination. Assessment was made for childrenvaccinated (1) Before diagnosis of autism, and (2) Before rst symptomsof autism onset. Odds ratios were adjusted to mother's age, medicationduring pregnancy, gestation time, perinatal injury and Apgar score.Results: For children vaccinated before diagnosis, autism risk was lower in children vaccinated with MMR than in the nonvaccinated (OR: 0.17, 95%CI: 0.06-0.52) as well as single measles vaccine (OR:0.44, 95% CI: 0.22-0.91). The risk for vaccinated nonvaccinated(independent vaccine type) was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.10-0.76). The riskconnected with being vaccinated before onset of rst symptoms wassignicantly lower only for MMR versus single vaccine (OR: 0.47, 95%CI: 0.22-0.99).Conclusions: The study provides evidence against the association of autism with either MMR or a single measles vaccine. Key Words: MMR vaccine, autism, children (Pediatr Infect Dis J 2010;29: 397-400) Agreat deal of speculation exists concerning the possible associations of certain vaccines, particularly the measles- mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, with autism. Wakeeld et al1 were the rst to propose that the MMR vaccine might be causallylinked to autism. It was suggested that gastrointestinal and devel-opmental symptoms constituted a syndrome that might be trig-gered by this vaccine. Their study was widely criticized butgenerated immense media attention, leading to a fall in MMRcoverage in some European countries. 2-5Since that report, a number of other studies have found no evidence to support a link between MMR vaccination and autism.6-9Although Poland continues to report high MMR vaccination coverage, questions concerning the safety of this vaccine, boostedby periodic antivaccination campaigns, persist. The MMR vaccinewas introduced in Poland later than in most other Europeancountries. For the past 10 years, the MMR vaccine has beengradually replacing the single-antigen measles variety. When itwas rst introduced, MMR was not covered by the national healthservice of Poland. Parents who wished to vaccinate their childrenwith MMR, as opposed to the single mandatory measles vaccine,had to pay extra. For this reason, few children were immunizedwith MMR. The Polish mandatory vaccinations schedule did notinclude MMR for all children until 2004. Since then, already highlevels of immunization against measles have slightly grown. 10 Poland's heterogeneous population (ie, vaccinated with MMR,vaccinated against measles only, nonvaccinated) serves as aunique sample group for studying the debated association ofthese vaccines with autism in children. Although a wide varietyof published studies fail to nd any such influence or relation-ship, the association between MMR and autism remains in theminds of some medical workers and parents. This way ofthinking threatens to undermine the implementation of measleselimination programs. 11-13 The rst objective of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between MMR vaccination and autism in chil-dren. The second objective was to examine whether the risk ofautism differs between MMR and the single measles vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Population Subjects were identied using general practitioner records in the Lesser Poland (Maopolska) Voivodeship in Poland. Thesample population of this study included children aged 2 to 15years diagnosed with childhood or atypical autism, classiedaccording to ICD 10-criteria as F84.0 or F84.1, respectively. Everydiagnosis of autism was made by child psychiatrist. Dates of thesediagnoses were recorded in general practitioners les. Cases withuncertain diagnosis of autism, secondary to disease state or trauma,were excluded. Two controls were selected for each affected child,individually matched by year of birth, gender, and physician'spractice. The rst 2 children visited the physician after the time ofthe autistic child visit who met entry criteria served as controls. Questionnaire to the Parents of Affected Children and Controls Parents were interviewed by trained nurses using a stan- dardized questionnaire. Questions for all children included infor-mation about prenatal and postnatal development, mental andphysical development, chronic diseases, malformations and inju-ries, history of bowel disturbances, birth order, family size, andparents' socioeconomic status. Parents of children with autism were additionally asked about the date of onset of symptom, the period when parents rstAccepted for publication October 1, 2009.

Thisquestionnaire did not contain any questions concerning the child'svaccination history so as to not bias the parent's answers (ie,insinuate a relationship with autism). Autism Diagnosis and Vaccination History The date of the child's autism diagnosis as well as his or her vaccination history was extracted directly from the physician'srecords. Data Analysis Cases of autism were considered as vaccinated if vaccina- tion preceded the onset of symptoms. Controls were consideredvaccinated if they received their vaccination before age of symp-toms onset of their matched case subject. Conditional logisticregression analysis was used to examine the association betweenMMR vaccination and autism in the matched case-control analysis.The odds ratios were calculated for vaccinated versus nonvacci-nated children, vaccinated with the single measles vaccine versusnonvaccinated, vaccinated with MMR versus nonvaccinated, andvaccinated with MMR versus the single measles vaccine. Thisprocedure was repeated for vaccination preceding the time ofautism diagnosis. Other potential risk factors of autism (mother's age, moth- er's education, gestation time, medication during pregnancy, peri-natal injury, and Apgar scale score) were examined and those thatappeared to be associated with autism ( P/H110210.2) were carried forward into multivariate models. The statistical signicance wasdened as P/H110210.05. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 8.0. RESULTS The study population consisted of 96 cases and 192 con- trols, with a mean age 7.5 /H110062.6 years, 81.2% boys and 19.8% girls. Approximately 13% of case-group mothers were aged /H1135035 years at time of delivery compared with 7.2% of control-groupmothers. This represented a statistically signicant difference (Ta-ble 1). Gestation time /H1134938 weeks was also signicantly more frequent in cases than controls. The mothers of autistic childrensignicantly more often took medication during pregnancy(mostly antibiotics and antihypertensive drugs). Case-groupsubjects signicantly more often suffered from some form ofperinatal injury. Although the difference was not signicant,5-minute Apgar scores were often less than 9 in autistic chil-dren. These 5 factors were taken as potential confounders andincluded in multivariate analysis.Case-group parents recognized abnormal behavior by age 1 year in 40% of their children. This number rose to 69.8% by age2 years. A diagnosis of autism was conrmed in 45.8% of childrenby age 2 years, in 22.9% by age 3 years, 21.9% by age 4 years, and9.4% were diagnosed at age /H110224 years. Most children (64.6% of cases and 76.6% of controls) were vaccinated at age 12 to 18 months. Across both groups, there were9 children not vaccinated against measles (Table 2). The percent-age of nonvaccinated children was signicantly higher ( P/H110050.001) in cases than in controls. The MMR vaccine was used in 44.3% ofvaccinated cases and 55.0% of vaccinated controls. This differencewas not statistically signicant. Odds ratios of having autism, based on vaccination status and type of vaccine used, are presented in Table 3.

Analyzing vaccination statusbefore diagnosis demonstrated a very low odds ratio for vaccinatedversus nonvaccinated. This tendency was slightly stronger forthose vaccinated with MMR versus nonvaccinated, then the singlemeasles variety versus nonvaccinated. Also, children vaccinatedwith MMR had a risk equal to half of those vaccinated with thesingle measles variety. The only signicant association for beingvaccinated before the onset of symptoms was found for thedifference between MMR vaccination and nonvaccination. Odds ratios did not change substantially after adjusting for potential confounders (eg, mother's age, medication during preg-nancy, gestation time, perinatal injury, and 5-minute Apgar scalescores) (Table 4). Vaccination before diagnosis, regardless ofvaccine variety used, signicantly decreased the probability ofbeing diagnosed with autism. Children vaccinated with MMR hada lower odds ratio of having autism than nonvaccinated children aswell as those vaccinated with the single measles vaccine. Afteradjusting for potential confounders, the association between beingvaccinated before the onset of symptoms and type of vaccine usedbecame signicant. The risk of having autism in children vacci-nated with MMR was only 44% comparing to children vaccinatedonly against measles. All models t the data (likelihood ratio /H92732,Pvalues mostly /H110210.0001, the larger one equals 0.0013). DISCUSSION Our study revealed that MMR vaccination was not signi- cantly associated with an increased risk of autism in children. In aseparate analysis, a similar result was achieved for the single-antigen measles vaccine. An unexpected nding was that oddsratios associated with MMR were lower than with the singlemeasles vaccine. Our results argue against the Wakeeld et al hypothesis, 1 which suggested that developmental symptoms in children withautism may be triggered by the presence of the measles virus in the bowels of children vaccinated with MMR. He stated that thesimultaneous administration of 3 types of live viruses in the MMRvaccine was too great a burden for a child's immunologic system,increasing the chance of measles virus persistence, subsequentlyleading to the development of autistic symptoms. Therefore inmany countries, the increased incidence of childhood autism wasinitially linked with the launching of MMR vaccination cam- paigns. This study was unable to conrm the Wakeeld et alhypothesis, nding a lower risk of developing autism forchildren vaccinated against measles, with the lowest risk beingfound for children vaccinated with MMR. Our study partici-pants were not evaluated for the presence of the measles virusin their gastrointestinal tracts. Other previously published studyfound strong evidence against the association of autism withpersistent measles virus RNA in gastrointestinal tracts exposedto the MMR vaccine. 14 The ndings of our study concerning the single-antigen measles vaccine cannot be compared with other reports, as nosimilar study has been previously published. Other studies exam-ined sample populations vaccinated exclusively with MMR, as thetriple vaccine program was launched much earlier in those coun-tries, than in Poland. Yet this study was still able to reachconclusions similar to previously published studies, conrmingthat MMR is not associated with an increased risk of autism. Oddsratios obtained in this study were similar to those obtained by otherauthors. 15-17 The decreased risk of autism among vaccinated children may be due to some other confounding factors in their healthstatus. For example, healthcare workers or parents may havenoticed signs of developmental delay or disease before the actualautism diagnosis and for this reason have avoided vaccination. A heterogeneous population of children vaccinated with MMR or exclusively against measles is a strength of our study.First, such a study population offers the opportunity to evaluatethose vaccinated with MMR and the single measles variety for therisk of autism. Second, it allowed for examining whether the risk of being diagnosed with autism differed between these 2 vaccines. Participants' vaccination histories were taken directly from physician's records, eliminating the potential for recall bias. Be-cause they are surveyed by independent public health workers atleast twice per year, Polish vaccination records are very reliable. Introducing the MMR vaccine as a replacement for the single-antigen measles vaccine in the mandatory vaccinationschedule improved vaccination coverage against measles in Po-land. This serves as evidence that, despite extensive media cover-age of the debated association between MMR and autism, publicacceptance of this vaccine remains very high. The situation inPoland is different to that of many European countries, whereMMR vaccinations by age 2 years fell more than 10% and werefollowed by measles outbreaks. In this time, Poland's already highrate of measles immunization even slightly increased. 10 We were able to control many potential confounding fac- tors, known to be associated with vaccination practices and pos-sibly serving as risk factors for autism. We included 2 index datesto assess previous vaccination: the onset of symptoms and ofdiagnosis of autism. Parental concern in regards to symptoms andsymptom etiology, reported retrospectively, can be biased byconfounding factors. Date of diagnosis based on physician'srecords is not affected by recall bias, serving as a better index datethan the onset of symptoms. One limitation of this study included omitting other perva- sive developmental disorders. The decision was made to restrictthe study population to cases of autism in the interest of betterTABLE 4.

Still, this studyhad the possibility of comparing its ndings with the results ofother authors, who assessed the risk of autism in addition to otherautistic spectrum disorders. 18-20 The ndings in this study may be useful in discussing the potential risks and benets of vaccination programs which use thesingle versus triple MMR vaccine. These ndings suggest that bothvaccines are characterized by a similar level of safety with respectto the risk of autism in children. REFERENCES 1. Wakeeld A, Murch S, Anthony A, et al.

Leggiadro, MD Imported Case of Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever\u2014Colorado, 2008 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. MMWR. 2009;58:1377-1380. A 44-year-old woman was hospitalized with an unexpected febrile illness in Colorado in January 2008 after returning to the United States from a2-week safari in Uganda. Her hospital course was characterized by hepa-titis, renal failure, pancytopenia, coagulopathy, myositis, hemor-rhagic fever (MHF). In July 2008, the patient requested repeat testing after she learned of the fatal case of MHF in a Dutch tourist who recently had visited the same caveshe had visited in Uganda, the Python Cave. Serum collected 6 months after the Colorado patient's illness tested positive for anti-Marburg virus IgG by ELISA,prompting additional testing of archived day 10 serum. Nested RT-PCR conrmedthe presence of Marburg virus RNA fragments in the day 10 sample.Comment: Before the case described in this report, the only human cases of VHF imported into the US were single cases of Lassafever in Chicago in 1989, and in Trenton in 2004. No previous cases ofimported lovirus (Marburg or Ebola virus) have been reported in theUS, making this the rst imported case of a loviral hemorrhagic feverin the US. Growing evidence demonstrates that fruit bats are the natural reservoir of Marburg virus. The patient may have acquired Marburg virusinfection through exposure to bat secretions or excretions while visiting the Python Cave. Although the Python Cave is closed and no additional MHFcases have been reported, travelers should be aware of the risk foracquiring MHF in endemic areas in Africa and should avoid entering cavesor mines inhabited by bats in these areas. Health-care providers should have a low threshold of suspicion for VHF among travelers returning from endemic areas, promptly implementappropriate infection control measures, and rapidly report suspected cases,which are nationally notiable.Current Abstracts The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal \u007f Volume 29, Number 5, May 2010 \u00a9 2010 Lippincott "}
