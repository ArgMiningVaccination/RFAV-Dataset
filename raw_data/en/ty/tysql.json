DO NOT PLACE DIRECTLY ON SKIN. - If you were given crutches upon discharge, use as directed. Bracing - If you are placed in a brace after surgery, it must be worn at all times (even sleep) until instructed otherwise by your therapist or physician. Bathing - The splint must stay clean and dry. - Bathing recommendations if splint in place: - Wrap splint with a durable trash bag and tape to skin above the level of the splint. - Do not immerse splint in bath. Hold splint outside of the tub. - Showers are not recommended. - If the cast gets wet, dry the inside as much as possible with a hairdryer on COOL air setting. DO NOT USE HEAT. Medications - Norco 7.5/325mg (Hydrocodone/Tylenol). Take 1-2 tabs every 4-6 hours as needed for pain. - We recommend an over-the-counter stool softener (Colace) as directed while on narcotics to prevent constipation. - Aspirin 81mg twice daily for 6 weeks to decrease the risk of deep vein thrombosis (blood clots). - If at increased risk for DVT, you may be prescribed Aspirin 325 mg twice daily for 6 weeks. - Zofran 4mg. Take 1 tab every 4 hours as needed for nausea. Local Nerve Block - You may have received an injection into your leg to numb the leg prior to surgery that should relieve much of your pain for about 8-12 hours but may NOT completely eliminate your pain. - While your leg/foot is numb, do not place objects directly under your heel for support - this may cause pressure sores or infection.
