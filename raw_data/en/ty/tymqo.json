What is Chinese medicine? Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is over 3,500 years old. It is an ancient system of health and wellness that has changed little over the centuries. The underlying principle is that a vital force of life, called Qi, surges through the body. The slightest imbalance in Qi can result in disease and illness. In TCM, an imbalance is an alteration in the opposite and complementary forces that make up the Qi. These are called yin and yang. Ancient Chinese constructed the idea that humans are microcosms of the macrocosm, the universal existence, and interconnect with nature and subject to its forces. The balance between health and disease is a crucial concept. TCM treatment seeks to revitalize this balance through treatment specific to the individual. To reclaim balance, you must achieve the balance between the internal body organs and the external elements of earth, fire, water, wood, and metal. TCM Treatment Options: - Acupuncture & Electrical stimulation - Injection Therapy - Moxibustion - Cupping - Tuina Massage - Herbal remedies - Tai chi/Qigong - Gua sha Acupuncture Acupuncture is a family of procedures involving the stimulation of specific points on the body using various techniques. An initial evaluation and treatment may last 60 minutes, and subsequent appointments usually take approximately a half-hour. A standard treatment plan for a chronic condition would typically involve one or two treatments a week, and the number of treatments depend on the illness and its severity. In general, it's common to receive treatments for six to eight weeks or longer for chronic conditions. During an acupuncture treatment, your acupuncturist inserts very thin, solid, and metal needles into specific points on your body; they are stimulated either by hand or electrical stimulation, which may cause little discomfort. After an acupuncture treatment, you may feel relaxed or energized. However, it is essential to note that not everyone responds to acupuncture. If your symptoms don't begin to improve within a few weeks, acupuncture may not be right for you. Electro Acupuncture Electroacupuncture is similar to Acupuncture. It involves the insertion of thin needles to stimulate specific pressure points related to the symptoms. In electroacupuncture, we attach two needles to the electrodes in which a mild electric current passes between these needles during treatment. This current generally applies more stimulation to acupoints than needle twirling or other hand manipulation techniques an acupuncturist might use.

Pain Management with Injection Therapy (Homeopathic Injection) Injection Therapy Acu-Point Injection Therapy involves the injection of sterile solutions into acupuncture points. Traditionally, the use of Chinese Herbs was used for this type of therapy to enhance acupuncture treatment overall effectiveness. We use mostly sterile FDA- approved homeopathic solutions like B12, arnica, trameel, saline. Injection therapy strongly stimulates the acupoint with a lasting result of up to 48 hours as the solution gets absorbed. Trigger Point Injection Therapy Trigger point injection therapy is a treatment used to treat both acute or chronic pain. We inject sterile solutions into trigger or ashi points to relieve pain. It is a procedure used to treat tenderness and pain along the channel or meridian or the tight band/knot of the muscle causing pain and inflammation. Trigger points/Ashi points are commonly associated with musculoskeletal disorders, including neck, upper/low back pain, and myofascial pain syndrome, headaches, and fibromyalgia. The treatment aims to inactivate the trigger or Ashi point/tight muscle band, while simultaneously providing the nutrients and hydration to the tissues for healing and recovering. After a trigger point injection, the injected area may be tender. It is encouraged to remain active after the trigger point injection to allow the affected muscle to return to its full range of motion approximately a week after the injection. However, it is advised to refrain from strenuous activity, particularly for the first three to four days after the injection. B-12 Shots We use cyanocobalamin injectable. The benefits of vitamin B-12 injections include treating or preventing symptoms, like fatigue, heart problems, neurological damage, mood changes, muscle weakness, and hormone imbalance. Vitamin B-12 is found naturally in animal protein with the highest amount in red meat or fortified foods. People who are vegetarian or vegan usually need to supplement with the vitamin to avoid deficiency. Those who suffer from any inflammatory bowel disease can have B-12 deficiency due to the lack of absorption of the vitamin. B-12 Injections Also help soothe nerve pain from a shingles outbreak. Cupping Therapy Acupuncturists use cupping therapy to treat a wide variety of conditions causing aches and pains. The cups are heated with fire and then applied to the skin on acupuncture points to create suction. The suction helps facilitate healing and promote the flow of Qi and blood flow in the body. Proponents also claim the suction helps facilitate the flow of \"qi\" in the body to reduce pain. After evaluation, the physician decides the cupping needed. Researchers conducted many studies on cupping and concluded that cupping therapy may help with the following conditions: lumbar disc herniation, cervical spondylosis, shingles, cough, facial paralysis, pain management, dyspnea, acne, and more. The risk involved may include scarring of the skin and bruising (hematoma). There are two types of cupping performed: - Dry cupping is a suction-only method. - Wet cupping may involve both suction and controlled medicinal bleeding. Moxibustion Moxibustion is an alternative therapy that involves burning herbs or Mugwort known as moxa sticks and applying the resulting heat to specific points on the body. A technique used in TCM traditional Chinese medicine and Tibetan medicine, Moxibustion is typically administered in conjunction with acupuncture. It is a commonly used treatment to stimulate the uterus and turn a breech baby to the vertex position. Researchers reported in a study conducted in 2009. Out of fifty-one post-menopausal women with hot flashes, 14 sessions of Moxibustion reduced the frequency and severity of hot flashes. They also support the use of Moxibustion in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and breech presentation. Herbal Therapies The use of herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine comes from a system that relies on herbal therapies and dietary therapy to treat illnesses, to maintain proper health, balance, and prevention of diseases. TCM uses thousands of medicinal substances of plants, animals, and minerals to treat various illnesses. TCM medicinal books on substances consist of information on actions and interactions, indications, dosages, and contra-indications for each substance, as well as any available information on drug interactions./p> TCM medicinal substances are prescribed based on their effects on the zang fu organ systems, the channels of the jing luo system into which substances enter, and the pathogenic factors and patterns of disharmony that the substance is known to address. TCM formulations may comprise of: - Herbal decoction is the most used method of preparing herbal formula. - Herbal powder can be mixed with hot water for tea. - Formulations in pill or tablet are the most used outside of China. - Syrups are preparations used to administer herbal formula to children for cough and sore throat. It is a convenient way to administer herbal formulations to children. - Liniments, salves, compresses, and plasters are for external application. Gua sha Gua sha means to rub or create friction, a procedure used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat musculoskeletal disorders and tension. Its mechanism of action is to move energy, known as qi or chi, around the body. The treatment involves using a blunt tool to rub or scrape the skin in long repetitive strokes, applying enough pressure to stimulate the skin and create petechia or minor bruising called \"sha\", representing extravasation of blood in the subcutis. This therapy is a simple and effective way to release toxins, break down scar and connective tissue, relieve muscle tension and knots, improve circulation and joints movement, reduce inflammation, and benefit the immune system. Bruising caused by gua sha is known as microtrauma, busting of capillaries near the surface of the skin; that creates a reaction in the body to break up scar tissue. The bruises usually take a few days to a week to heal and can be tender while healing. Analgesics can help reduce pain and swelling. Ice packs can also reduce inflammation and ease any pain after Gua sha therapy. Gua sha has no severe side effects; however, gua sha is not suitable for people with skin or vein conditions like deep vein thrombosis, those on a blood thinner, and those with infection, tumors, open or non- healing wounds, a pacemaker "}
