Animal Health Component 100% Research Effort Categories Basic 90% Applied 10% Developmental (N/A) Goals / Objectives The goal is to determine if sow vaccination for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) increases reproductive and weaning outcomes while at the same time allowing for effective long-term vaccine-induced protection of pigs when vaccinated at the time of weaning. Project Methods Farms and Sampling. The conclusions from this study will by most useful if performed in a commercial setting typical of US farms, which also allows for the direct translation of the knowledge gained to the field. Thus, a commercial, PCV2 positive farm, free of PCVAD, will be used (Holden Farms, Matthew Allerson (veterinarian) in conjunction with Swine Vet Center). A limitation of this design is the inability to challenge animals on a commercial farm which would allow for controlled challenge to test vaccine efficacy, and we do not have the monetary resources to move pigs to a farm setting in which challenge would be possible. However, typically between 10-15 weeks of age, pigs become infected with PCV2 and, in previous studies, this has resulted in a challenge response observable by an increase in the PCV2 antibody response21,28. Prior to vaccinating sows, we will confirm the observation of an increase in PCV2 positive animals on this farm at the 10-15 week time point by testing oral fluids for viral presence using our qPCR assay. If PCV2 positive animals are identified, the experiment will proceed on this farm, if not, other farms in this system will be examined. Two groups of 8 sows of similar parity (2 or greater) will be (1) vaccinated or (2) not vaccinated pre-farrow. The higher parity animals will be used to decrease any breeding problems associated with gilts. Sows will be vaccinated at 8 and 12 weeks of gestation with Circovac (Merial), which is licensed for breeding age sows, following the manufacturer's recommendations. Since it is common practice to vaccinate replacement gilts at 3 weeks of age with a boost later in life, the vaccination history for these sows will be acquired. Litters will be vaccinated at 3-4 weeks of age (weaning), as is common practice, following farm vaccination procedures. From each of the 16 sows, 6-8 piglets will be ear tagged and followed for the duration of the study for a total of 96-128 piglets. Serum and oral fluid samples will be obtained at the time of vaccination (weaning), 7, 11, 17, and 24 (market age) weeks of age to examine PCV2 antibody and viral levels. Whole blood samples will be obtained at vaccination and 4 weeks post-vaccination to assess cell mediated immunity by IFN gamma ELISPOT10,32,33. Clinical outcomes will be examined from farm records and each piglet will be weighed at weaning, 11, and 24 weeks of age (market) to determine ADG, a major production parameter. To determine the number of animals needed to detect a difference between piglets from vaccinated and non-vaccinated sows, a power calculation with an 80% power and a significance of 0.05 was used based on our previous data and that observed in the literature. Our choice of over 40 piglets per group is more than enough animals to determine significance between groups for all of the different measures examined. Blood samples will be obtained from all sows and piglets in clot tubes from the jugular vein according to University of Minnesota IACUC protocols for on farm blood sampling from pigs. Serum will be isolated, aliquoted, and frozen at -20\u00b0C until examination by ELISA and serum neutralization. For IFN gamma ELISPOT, blood samples will be refrigerated, PBMCs isolated, and used for ELISPOT analysis. Oral fluids will be obtained by placing a polyester tip applicator between cheek and gum for 5-10 seconds according to UMN IACUC protocols for on farm oral fluid sampling from pigs. Swabs will be placed in 500 ml of PBS for 12-24h, the fluid will then be spun out and frozen at -20\u00b0C for analysis of PCV2 viral DNA levels by qPCR34. ELISA. Serum samples will be examined for PCV2-specific antibodies using a direct ELISA9,16. Briefly, ELISA wells coated with 200 ng PCV2 capsid protein will be incubated for 1h at room temperature with serum samples (diluted 1:50), detected with swine anti-IgG-HRP (Bethyl Laboratories) using TMB peroxidase substrate solutions (KPL, Inc.) to develop color. Plates will be read at 450 nm using a ThermoMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Serum neutralization. VR1BL cells will be plated in 96-well cell culture plates and grown until 70-80% confluent. Serum samples, heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min., will be 3-fold serially diluted and mixed with infectious PCV2b virus (Genbank ID JF290418) for 1h at 37\u00b0C at concentration 3x104 TCID50/ml. Cell monolayers will be incubated with serum/virus samples for 1h, washed, and incubated with complete media for 40h. Cells will then be fixed with methanol, stained with a PCV2 monoclonal antibody (Rural Technologies), then an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen), and the nuclei stained with bisbenzimide. Cells will be visualized on an Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope at the UMN Imaging Center. Ninety- and 50% neutralization titers will be determined by least-squares fit curves, using the number of uninfected cells (~1x105) as 100% neutralization and the number of infected cells in negative serum (~5000, ~5%) as 0% neutralization (Dvorak, unpublished data). Samples will be tested in triplicate and positive and negative serum samples will be included on each plate. Negative serum is from known negative sows, extensively tested by PCR and ELISA, from a herd maintained for islet xenotransplantation research by the Spring Point Project (www.springpointproject.org). ELISPOT. ELISPOT will be performed according to Martelli et al 10,32. Briefly, isolated PBMCs (2x105 cells/well) will be cultured with 1mg/well anti-pig IFN-g mAb (BD Biosciences). The recall antigen, infectious PCV2b (GB ID JF290418) at an MOI of 0.1, will be added for stimulation, plates will be incubated with 0.5 mg/ml anti-pig will be visualized by incubation with a BCIP/NBT solution. Plates will be read and counted using a CTL ImmunoSpot analyzer (CTL) with positive and negative controls on each plate. Quantitative PCR. Oral fluid samples (140ml) will be used for isolation of PCV2 DNA using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen) and DNA will be stored at -20\u00b0C until use. Serum samples can also be used for PCR, but are less sensitive. DNA copies will be quantitated using an in-house quantitative PCV2 real-time PCR assay as described, using melting curve analysis to differentiate PCV2a and PCV2b genotypes34. A standard curve and positive and negative controls for both PCV2a and PCV2b will be run on each plate. The sensitivity of the assay is 250 viral copies per swab. Real-time PCR data will be quantitated using the standard curve and nonparametric statistical methods. Data analysis. Statistical analysis will be performed using ANOVA and t-test for pairwise comparisons to identify significant differences between treatments. Correlation will be performed to analyze for co-variation of variables, particularly with respect to viremia, antibody levels, and production outcomes. Coefficients of variation will be examined to determine the variability between animals. "}
