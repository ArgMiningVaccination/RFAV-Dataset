Immunosenescence and inflammaging contribute to the increased risk of chronic non-communicable and acute infectious diseases. Frailty is highly prevalent in the elderly and is associated with an impaired immune response, a higher propensity to infection, and a lower response to vaccines. Additionally, the presence of uncontrolled comorbid diseases in the elderly also contributes to sarcopenia and frailty. Vaccine-preventable diseases that threaten the elderly include influenza, pneumococcal infection, herpes zoster, and COVID-19, which contribute to significant disability-adjusted life years lost. Previous studies had shown that conventional vaccines only yielded suboptimal protection that wanes rapidly in a shorter time. This article reviews published papers on several vaccination strategies that were developed for the elderly to solve these problems: more immunogenic vaccine formulations using larger doses of antigen, stronger vaccine adjuvants, recombinant subunit or protein conjugated vaccines, newly developed mRNA vaccines, giving booster shots, and exploring alternative routes of administration. Included also are several publications on senolytic medications under investigation to boost the immune system and vaccine response in the elderly.

Introduction [1](#B1-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. At that time, one in six people in the world will be elderly. The increased number of elderly in the population provides many opportunities but also poses many health challenges that must be anticipated. In developed countries, the main health problems are chronic non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease), while in low-income countries, the elderly also face the threat of non-communicable and infectious diseases [ [1](#B1-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [2](#B2-pathophysiology-30-00014), [3](#B3-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Chronic antigen exposure throughout life results in a chronic low-grade inflammation referred to as inflammaging [ [4](#B4-pathophysiology-30-00014), [5](#B5-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. A natural consequence of inflammaging is a decrease in the immune function (immune paralysis) or tolerance of the natural immune system [ [6](#B6-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The relationship between immunosenescence and inflammaging is two-way. Immunosenescence causes inflammaging and vice versa [ [7](#B7-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Both contribute to an increased risk of chronic non-communicable diseases, acute infectious diseases [ [8](#B8-pathophysiology-30-00014)], and frailty. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that plays a role in increasing a person's vulnerability to infection [ [9](#B9-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Immunosenescence, infection, and frailty are involved in a pathophysiological relationship that influences each other in a vicious cycle of recurring degenerative illness [ [10](#B10-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [11](#B11-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Immunosenescence and uncontrolled comorbid diseases trigger susceptibility to infection. Infections in the elderly often show atypical clinical symptoms that delay diagnosis. In addition, changes in the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics can result in the ineffectiveness of the antibiotic therapy given. Some infectious diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and herpes zoster often pose a serious threat to the elderly. Other infections that need to be mentioned are malaria, dengue, and COVID-19, which have been shown to cause higher mortality rates in the elderly population. Those diseases can be prevented with vaccination [ [11](#B11-pathophysiology-30-00014), [12](#B12-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. However, vaccinations in the elderly present their own challenges due to uncontrolled immunosenescence, inflammaging, and comorbid diseases, which will cause a low response to vaccines [ [13](#B13-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [14](#B14-pathophysiology-30-00014), [15](#B15-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. This article aimed to review the published papers which describe several aspects of vaccination in the elderly including frailty, immunosenescence, and inflammaging; decreased immune response and the threat of infections that can be prevented with vaccination; suitable vaccine formulations; and various strategies that can be performed to improve the response to vaccination among the elderly [ [16](#B16-pathophysiology-30-00014), [17](#B17-pathophysiology-30-00014), [18](#B18-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Based on these descriptions and studies, vaccine recommendations for the elderly population will be delivered. 2. Frailty, Immunosenescence, and Inflammaging in the Elderly [9](#B9-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [19](#B19-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Both are caused by defects and the failure of repair processes at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels, which are involved in the pathobiology of aging and can lead to chronic disease, multimorbidity, and frailty. 1](#pathophysiology-30-00014-f001)). [10](#B10-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Declined immune function can be seen in the components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages have decreased chemotactic and phagocytic functions in the response to pathogens as well as in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines. Dendritic cells lose their ability to present antigens and evoke a T lymphocyte response. The response to toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist stimulation is also slowed. The thymus gland undergoes an involution process, and changes in the population and capability of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow result in a decrease in naive lymphocytes, an increase in memory cells, and a decrease in lymphocyte receptors diversity and antibody production. The immune system in the elderly is unable to respond normally to exposure to new antigens and vaccines, making the elderly more susceptible to infections and other health problems, including cancer [ [2](#B2-pathophysiology-30-00014), [4](#B4-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [20](#B20-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Immune cells in the elderly tend to produce many inflammatory mediators, which weaken their immune function, such as in the case of COVID-19 in the elderly [ [21](#B21-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. In immunosenescence, there is an accumulation of senescent cells and a decreased ability to eliminate proteins or defective cells due to the accumulation of cellular debris from cellular damage or death (DAMP). All of these conditions tend to trigger the immune system to produce proinflammatory cytokines, contributing to the inflammatory state. For these reasons, some experts consider inflammaging as the \"dark side\" of immunosenescence [ inflammaging are important in the pathogenesis of frailty. The elderly who experience frailty with impaired physical and cognitive function are more susceptible to infection with a prolonged clinical course and complications. The infection causes an accumulation of irreparably damaged cells or tissues, which in turn can lead to impaired physical and cognitive functions that lead back to frailty. This interconnection places immunosenescence, inflammaging, infection, and frailty in a pathophysiological pathway that forms a vicious cycle of degenerative disease [ [10](#B10-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. It remains a formidable question whether interventions such as vaccinations for the elderly will be able to break this vicious cycle of aging and illness. 3. Infection Threat in the Elderly [11](#B11-pathophysiology-30-00014), [22](#B22-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. In terms of the possibility to prevent infection, data from several developed countries such as Australia, Europe, and Canada show that the three most dominant infectious diseases that can be prevented with vaccinations are pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, and herpes zoster [ [23](#B23-pathophysiology-30-00014), [24](#B24-pathophysiology-30-00014), [25](#B25-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Experience during the pandemic necessitates that COVID-19 must also be added to the list [ [26](#B26-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [24](#B24-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. According to a survey from Australia in 2015, it was reported that the three diseases with the largest DALYs were pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, and herpes zoster, especially in the elderly over 65 years [ [23](#B23-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. It seems that each country or region has different types of disease burden, which are influenced by its national budget for healthcare financing, different resources, and infrastructures between low-income and middle- or high-income countries, as shown by the results of global studies [ [27](#B27-pathophysiology-30-00014), [28](#B28-pathophysiology-30-00014), [29](#B29-pathophysiology-30-00014)] as well as local studies in India [ [30](#B30-pathophysiology-30-00014)] and China [ [31](#B31-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. As mentioned above, the impact caused by COVID-19 during the pandemic cannot be overlooked [ [30](#B30-pathophysiology-30-00014), [32](#B32-pathophysiology-30-00014), [33](#B33-pathophysiology-30-00014), [34](#B34-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 3.1. more than 100 serotypes, which are classified by their capsule polysaccharide composition. The distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae varies depending on the geographical location and the period of the study. 3.2. Influenza [36](#B36-pathophysiology-30-00014), [37](#B37-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 3.3. Herpes Zoster [38](#B38-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 3.4. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [39](#B39-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Globally, as of 29 March 2023, a total number of 761,402,282 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 6,887,000 deaths, have been reported to the WHO [ [40](#B40-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Since the beginning, collected and reported cases in China have shown that the death rate from COVID-19 increases exponentially with increasing patient age, a tendency that has also been demonstrated in several other regions in the world [ [41](#B41-pathophysiology-30-00014), [42](#B42-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. COVID-19 in the elderly often causes more severe disease and consequently, higher mortality, with a case fatality rate of around 3% in the 50-59 years age group, around 4-5% in the 60-69 years age group, around 8-11% in the 70-79 years age group, and up to 13-16% in 80 years and older age group [ [42](#B42-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Apart from being caused by the high proportion of elderly subjects who previously had several underlying diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [ [43](#B43-pathophysiology-30-00014)], several observations showed that the immune system of elderly individuals has a higher inflammatory response and a lower ability to overcome infection [ [44](#B44-pathophysiology-30-00014), [45](#B45-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Weaker and slower response to antigen exposure paradoxically triggers increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, a cytokine storm [ [45](#B45-pathophysiology-30-00014), [46](#B46-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The consequences can be an ARDS and multi-organ failure, which can end fatally and therefore increase mortality [ [47](#B47-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 4. Decreased Response to Vaccines among the Elderly [48](#B48-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [13](#B13-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. In addition to developing an increased risk of infection, immunosenescence also lowers the protection after vaccination. Immunosenescence affects the function of innate and adaptive immune cells which include preventing the effective induction of memory lymphocytes and reducing the effect of booster vaccinations. This lowers the antibody response in the elderly and causes the antibody titers to wane more rapidly. Therefore, the protective effect of vaccination cannot be fully guaranteed in the elderly [ [13](#B13-pathophysiology-30-00014), [16](#B16-pathophysiology-30-00014), [49](#B49-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Changes in the response to vaccines in the elderly are summarized in [Figure 3](#pathophysiology-30-00014-f003)[ [49](#B49-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [49](#B49-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [50](#B50-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Following influenza vaccination, antibody titers in young adults were consistently higher than in the elderly. The risk of being infected with influenza after vaccination occurs in the elderly who do not show humoral or cellular immune response [ [51](#B51-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. In a study evaluating changes in the repertoire of B cells and IgM and IgA antibodies after pneumonia vaccine administration, IgA and IgM responses were found to be significantly lower in the elderly [ [52](#B52-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The quality of the antibodies produced was also inferior to the group of young subjects [ [53](#B53-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The efficacy of the herpes zoster vaccine also significantly decreased in the elderly group, reaching 41% in the >70-year age group and only 18% in the >80-year age group [ [54](#B54-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Thus, appropriate strategies are needed so that the elderly can obtain higher and more effective vaccine protection. 5. Strategies to Increase the Vaccine Response in the Elderly [55](#B55-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 5.1. The Use of Higher Antigen Doses [56](#B56-pathophysiology-30-00014)] and quadrivalent [ [57](#B57-pathophysiology-30-00014)] influenza vaccines. However, the same results cannot be expected for all types of vaccines. The number of antigens per virion contained in the vaccine is more decisive than the total number of virions. 5.2. The Use of More Immunogenic Adjuvants [58](#B58-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Some promising candidates include oil-in-water emulsion [ [59](#B59-pathophysiology-30-00014)] and AS03 for influenza vaccine, AS04 for hepatitis B, and AS01 for Varicella-Zoster vaccine [ [60](#B60-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Several other types of adjuvants that are being developed and investigated include QS21, CpG and flagellin Herpes-Zoster adjuvant, Shingrix\u00ae, has been shown to exhibit high immunogenicity and efficacy in the elderly and provides protection for up to 9 years [ [62](#B62-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 5.3. Delivering Booster Injections [50](#B50-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Animal studies also support these findings. The antibody response to the primary vaccine was significantly decreased in old rhesus macaques; however, giving booster injections at an interval of one month after the primary vaccine achieved a response equivalent to that in young adult macaques [ [63](#B63-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. This kind of booster strategy has never before been applied to other types of vaccines that exist. The annual influenza vaccine is given only once a year. The booster for the Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine is also only given once after 1 year or 5 years. It is necessary to conduct research on whether giving a second booster (especially for inactivated vaccines) will be able to increase the antibody response in the elderly. [64](#B64-pathophysiology-30-00014)] has led experts who are members of The European Technical Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (ETAGE) to recommend additional booster injections for susceptible immunocompromised groups, including the elderly [ [65](#B65-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The same step was taken by the UK government [ [66](#B66-pathophysiology-30-00014)] at an interval of 6 months after the previous injection of the COVID-19 vaccine. Giving booster vaccine injections appears to be necessary for long-term protection in the elderly, and its efficacy is also determined by the presence of plasma cells and memory B cells produced by the primary vaccination [ [67](#B67-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Primary vaccinations should be scheduled and completed at a young age to obtain a better response to booster injections. 5.4. Exploration of Alternative Routes of Vaccine Administration [68](#B68-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. In the skin, there are many immune cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) that can act as antigen-presenting cells. These cells will migrate to nearby lymphoid glands, activate antigen-specific T cells, and stimulate the differentiation of follicular helper T cells in the lymphoid glands. Follicular helper T cells will in turn induce antigen-specific B cells and their differentiation into antibody-producing cells. Intradermal administration of vaccines theoretically would facilitate antigen uptake by Langerhans cells, thus allowing the use of lower doses of antigen to induce a protective immune response in the elderly [ [69](#B69-pathophysiology-30-00014), [70](#B70-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Vaccines given with the intradermal route give rise to higher immunogenicity and seroconversion rates compared to the intramuscular route, although they also cause more local reactogenicity at the injection site [ [71](#B71-pathophysiology-30-00014), [72](#B72-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Problems that must be considered when using intradermal vaccinations in the elderly are changes in physiology, vascularity, and skin integrity, including a decreased number of antigen-presenting cells in the elderly skin. [73](#B73-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The number of antigen-presenting cells in the mucosal tissue will increase the response to the antigen. Antigen exposure through the mucosa will trigger antigen-specific T cells and IgA+ B cells, which then will migrate to lymphoid glands, enter the blood circulation, and finally fill up the mucosal tissue. Entering the mucosal tissue, lymphocytes will differentiate into effector cells and memory cells. Administration of the vaccine through the nasal mucosa will produce an IgA response in the mucosa and an IgG response systemically [ [74](#B74-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Research on mucosal vaccines, specifically for the elderly, is still very limited. 5.5. Vaccine Injection Time [75](#B75-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Several studies using influenza vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines have shown that the administration of a vaccine in the morning triggers better antibody titer than the administration in the afternoon [ [76](#B76-pathophysiology-30-00014), [77](#B77-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 5.6. The Use of Senolytic Quercetin, Fisetin, and Navitoclax [ [81](#B81-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 6. Recommended Vaccines for the Elderly 6.1. Influenza Vaccine [82](#B82-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The addition of MF59\u00ae adjuvants has been shown to increase antibody production (13-14% relative antibody increase, with Geometric Mean Titre (GMT) ratio of 1.43 (p < 0.001)), increase seroconversion and seroprotection (8-14% relative increase in the percentage of subjects with HI titer 160), and increase antibody binding affinity, causing wider diversity of antibody epitopes and wider serological protection against mutated strains. The high-dose Fluzone\u00ae quadrivalent vaccine contains four times the antigen as a standard-dose vaccine and has been shown to have better immunogenicity in the elderly. In a large, randomized, phase IIIb-IV, multicenter study involving around 32,000 subjects aged 65 years or older in the USA and Canada, the high-dose vaccine showed an advantage in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza (relative efficacy of 24.2% (95% standard-dose comparator High-dose influenza vaccines, adjuvant vaccines, and rHA vaccines generally have a good safety profile and are well-tolerated. In a randomized controlled trial study comparing head-to-head the four types of influenza vaccine available to the elderly: the standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine, trivalent vaccine trivalent vaccine, and recombinant hemagglutinin quadrivalent vaccine, it was found that elderly people receiving the \"enhanced vaccines\" had better humoral and cellular immune responses compared to the elderly who received standard-dose vaccines [ [85](#B85-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [86](#B86-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 6.2. Pneumococcal Vaccine [87](#B87-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [88](#B88-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The PCV-13 vaccine was later introduced and is currently the first choice for the elderly in many countries. This vaccine has better immunogenicity than the polysaccharide vaccine. Conjugation with protein makes it able to stimulate CD4+ helper T cells, which trigger the emergence of polysaccharide-specific memory B cells [ [89](#B89-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [90](#B90-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. In the CAPITA study involving 84,496 elderly people aged 65 years, PCV-13 was shown to reduce the need for hospital care due to vaccine-type strains of community-acquired pneumonia by 45.6% and the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease by 75% [ [91](#B91-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. PCV-13 activates a stronger and longer-lasting immune response than PPV-23, but PPV-23 contains more viral serotypes. Each country publishes different vaccination guidelines for the elderly. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) provides the following recommendations [ [92](#B92-pathophysiology-30-00014)]: - For elderly 65 years who have previously received the PPSV-23 vaccine, it is recommended to receive one dose of the PCV-15 or PCV-20 vaccine at least a year after the previous PPSV-23 injection. There is no longer a need for a booster shot with PPSV-23. - For elderly 65 years who have previously received the PCV-13 vaccine, it is recommended to get the PPSV-23 or PCV-20 vaccine (if PPSV-23 is not available) - For immunocompromised adults that reach 65 years and have previously received the PCV-13 vaccine followed by the PPSV-23 vaccine before 65 years, it is recommended to get a PPSV-23 booster vaccine with an interval of at least 5 years from the previous PPSV-23 injection. 6.3. COVID-19 Vaccine [93](#B93-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. An unprecedented convergence of effort from scientists, governments, financing resources, and pharmaceutical companies on one viral infection, and the use of technology previously aimed at developing vaccines for HIV, MERS, or Ebola, such as reverse genetic technology, has made it possible to construct a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 mRNA sequence that encodes the spike protein [ [94](#B94-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. This technique greatly accelerates the manufacture of vaccines and induces a more robust immune response. [95](#B95-pathophysiology-30-00014)]; (ii) antibodies from vaccination (regardless of the vaccine platform) only last for a short time period and on average decrease after 5-6 months [ [96](#B96-pathophysiology-30-00014), [97](#B97-pathophysiology-30-00014)], so giving booster injections is considered necessary; (iii) the constantly changing circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, due to its tendency of mutations with the ability to escape the antibody response, necessitates revaccination with a suitable vaccine [ [98](#B98-pathophysiology-30-00014), [99](#B99-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [42](#B42-pathophysiology-30-00014), [43](#B43-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The preferred platform is one that is proven to have a high vaccine efficacy such as the mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccine). Most of the primary doses of available vaccines were given in two shots with variable intervals [ [100](#B100-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. With regards to the booster vaccine, some studies indicated that heterologous regimens significantly induced stronger immunogenicity and reactogenicity compared to homologous regimens with tolerable adverse effects [ [101](#B101-pathophysiology-30-00014), [102](#B102-pathophysiology-30-00014), [103](#B103-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Levels of neutralizing antibodies were also higher in the heterologous booster participants who received the m-RNA vaccine as booster [ [103](#B103-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Adenovirus-vectored vaccines are known to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses, while mRNA-based vaccines tend to induce higher levels of antibody to spike protein [ [100](#B100-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. This tendency might be related to the difference in antigen presentation and modes of action of both vaccine types [ [104](#B104-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. More importantly, according to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, giving multiple COVID-19 vaccinations to the elderly is considered effective and safe [ [105](#B105-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [106](#B106-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 6.4. Herpes Zoster Vaccine [54](#B54-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. This vaccine should not be given to patients with HIV/AIDS or other immunodeficient conditions. [107](#B107-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. With this formulation, the vaccine enhances vaccine immunogenicity by stimulating the innate immune system at the injection site and enhancing antigen presentation. This stimulation induces strong Th2 humoral and Th1 cellular immune responses and cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells triggering an early IFN- response [ [108](#B108-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Evidence for the efficacy of recombinant vaccines with adjuvants was obtained from two phase III clinical trials, in which two doses of vaccine resulted in protection against herpes zoster by 97% in adults 50 years of age [ [109](#B109-pathophysiology-30-00014)] and by 89.8% in the elderly 70 years [ [110](#B110-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. A strong antibody and CD4+ T cell response were maintained up to 3 years after vaccination [ [111](#B111-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The recombinant subunit of the vaccine with adjuvants has been shown to be superior to the live attenuated VZV vaccine despite the greater risk of an adverse reaction at the injection site [ [112](#B112-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. Another advantage of this vaccine is that it can also be used in immunocompromised or immunodeficient patients, such as patients with HIV [ [113](#B113-pathophysiology-30-00014)] and transplant patients [ [114](#B114-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 6.5. Diphtheria and Tetanus Vaccine [115](#B115-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. A cross-sectional study in the USA showed that only 47% of adults aged 20 years had resistance to both diseases, and only 63% of adults with tetanus immunity also had protective antibodies against diphtheria [ [116](#B116-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. [117](#B117-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. 6.6. Other Vaccines [118](#B118-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. The same is true for the malaria vaccine. The first malaria vaccine recommended by the WHO is RTS,S/AS01, which is marketed as Mosquirix\u00ae, and for now, it is only intended for children in sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission; it is not intended for the elderly [ [119](#B119-pathophysiology-30-00014)]. It will take some time before we can develop a similar vaccine that is safe and effective for the elderly in the future. 7.
