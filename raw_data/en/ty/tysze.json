Stout Hall of Asian Peoples The Gardner D. Stout Hall of Asian Peoples\u2014the Museum's largest cultural hall\u2014showcases some of the finest collections in Asian ethnology in the Western Hemisphere. Some 3,000 artifacts, which represent about 5 percent of the Museum's considerable holdings, are displayed in the hall. Asia contains more than one-third of the land surface of the world and some of the world's most populous countries, including India and China. The hall explores the continent's history and cultural diversity, highlighting regions such as India, China, Japan, Korea, Siberia, and Armenia, and exploring topics that include trade and the rise of Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Confucianism. Sections of the hall are arranged roughly as if on a map, and it is possible to walk through the hall following either a northern or southern trade route. Detailed dioramas include depictions of a wedding in a rural Hindu village in central India; a faithful re-creation of a late 19th-century healing ceremony of the Sakha of Eastern Siberia; and an ornate wedding chair, which would have carried a traditional Chinese bride to her new life with her husband's family. View more than 55,000 ethnographic objects from Asia in the [online collection database](http://anthro.amnh.org/asia). This hall is included with any admission. Enjoy free tickets for General Admission, special exhibitions, giant-screen movies, planetarium shows, and more!
