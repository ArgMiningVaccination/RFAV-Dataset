Travelers from other big countries like Russia, Brazil and India willalso miss out. As Europe's economies reel from the impact of the coronavirus, southern EU countries like Greece, Italy and Spain are desperate to entice back sun-loving visitors and breathe life into their dam- aged tourism industries. Citizens from the following countries will be allowed into the EU's 27 mem- bers and four other nations in Europe's = a Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. The EU said China is \"subject to confirmation of reciprocity,\" European citizens entering China before it will allow Chinese citizens back in. Countries considered for the safe list are also expected to lift any bans they might have in place on European trav- days, with new countries being added and some even dropping off depending on the disease under control. European Union countries hastily slapped restrictions on who could cross their borders in February as the virus spread in Italy. Then in mid-March the Europeans limited all non-essential trav- el to the 27 EU member states plus Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Non-EU citizens who are already living in Europe are not included in the ban. The EU list does not apply to travel to Britain, which left the EU in January.

Excerpts from an interview with DR SUDHIR KUMAR RAWAL, Medical Director and Chief of Genito-Uro Surgical Oncology at Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre (RGCIRC) in which he also answered queries pertaining to Covid and special precautions to be taken by cancer patients How has cancer care scenario changed in the last one decade? Cancer care has undergone a metamorphosis of sorts in the last few years. A large number of dedicated cancer centres have come up. Multi-specialty hospitals are also expanding cancer care facilities. More number of young doctors are taking up cancer as a specialty and even going for sub specialty like Uro oncology, Gyneae oncology, GI oncology, Breast surgery, thoracic surgery, Head & Neck surgery etc. RGCIRC is the leading centre for cancer care in the country since we have 13 sub specialties in surgery, 6 in medical oncology and 5 in radiation oncology. Also cancer care is getting more affordable with a significant percentage of cancer medicines cheaper today by 30-40% than a few years ago. Technologically also cancer treatment has taken a big leap. There is much more hope today for cancer cure than it was 10 years ago. So, wider availability of cancer care, its affordability and the efficacy of treatment through new advancements are three key aspects of characterizing cancer care in the country in the last one decade. Can you throw some light on the new technologies/ advancements in cancer care? Cancer care has witnessed massive advancements. Traditionally, cancer treatment has three important modes- Radiation, Surgery and Medicine. Super-specialty hospitals such as RGCIRC are incorporating new cutting-edge technologies in all the three domains. In surgery, we have increasing role of Robotic surgery today. The advancement in robotic surgery is the precision it offers in treatment of cancer so that organs are preserved and healthy tissues are not harmed. Especially in urological cancer, lung cancer and head & neck cancer, Robotic surgery has revolutionized the treatment. New techniques in Radiation therapy help protect normal tissues while providing high dose of radiation to the tumour. Technologies like IMRT, IGRT and Proton therapy have led toa sea change in cancer treatment. The radiation related toxicity/ morbidity which used to be very high earlier has come down since a selective high dose of radiation can be given to specific areas and avoiding toxicity to others. Tomotherapy and Cyber knife, two key robotic radio therapy devices will soon be available at RGCIRC. In fact RGCIRC will be amongst the first few centres in India to have it. In Medical oncology, traditional chemotherapy is being increasingly replaced by Immunotherapy and Targeted therapy. Targetted therapy drugs look for targets at the cancer sites and are given in addition to conventional chemotherapy drugs to increase the killing of cancer cells and thereby increase survival rates. In case of Immunotherapy, which is state-of-the-art therapy, the immune system of the body is charged to such Dr. Sudhir Kumar Rawal an extent that the body itself fights against the cancer cells and pushes them out of the circulation. Immunotherapy and Targeted therapy have changed the course of treatment in cancers like lung and breast cancer. Being a pioneer in Robotic surgery, how do you think the Robotic surgery has led to change of outcome in cancer surgeries? Robotic surgery has revolutionized the cancer surgery especially for the cancers of prostate and urinary bladder. RGCIRC has the distinction of having undertaken maximum no of cancer surgeries through robotics in South Asia. Robotic surgery has unique advantages over traditional surgeries as incision is very small, it causes less blood loss, less pain, leads to early recovery, entails less hospital stay and less amount of analgesic (pain killer) drug requirement post operation. Not only in prostate, Robotic surgery is method of choice in several other cancers where surgery requires complex steps for instance GI surgery, Head & neck surgery, thoracic surgery etc. In gynecology it is being used for uterine cancer and cervix cancer. Higher expense has been a deterrent in wider application of robotics in cancer surgeries. However, now the technology is becoming cheaper. Many new companies are entering the fray. One Indian surgeon has \u00a2 G Robotic surgery has transformed the cancer treatment especially for the cancers of prostate and urinary bladder. RGCIRC has the distinction of having undertaken maximum number of cancer surgeries through robotics in South Asia. developed a robot which will soon be introduced. What could be helpful in preventing the cancer? We need to emphasize on screening and early detection of cancer. If you get treatment for any problem for a period of 3-4 weeks and the situation doesn't come under control, one needs to get investigations done very swiftly. If there is a sore, fever, lump, bleeding or altered bowel habits which don't settle down, investigations are a must. If we are able to catch the cancer at an early state the success rate of cure is very high.Maintaining good health through diet and exercise, avoiding tobacco in all forms and avoiding excessive alcohol could help in preventing a large number of cancers. Coming to ongoing pandemic, what precautions cancer patients should take during Covid-19 outbreak? Cancer patients are generally immune-compromised (have low immunity) and may experience more serious complications if they acquire Covid-19. Accordingly cancer patients should strictly observe social distancing, avoid outings as far as possible, take balanced diet and remain positive. During Covid, one needs to consult with treating oncologists so that the visits to the hospital could be minimized without compromis ing with the cancer Dr. (Prof.) Sudhir Kumar Rawal Medical Director and Chief of Genito-Uro Surgical Oncology Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre (RGCIRC) Rohini, Delhi \\ treatment. For instance in case of cancer survivors, the routine surveillance visits can be easily postponed/ minimised . If cancer patients have symptoms associated with Covid-19, they need to consult the treating oncologist on phone and not just turn up at the hospital without calling. Treatment of cancer can't be postponed but precautions should be taken. For instance chemotherapy and surgery needs to be postponed till the patient is cured of the infection. Even treatments such as Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) can't take place till infection is cured. What about the fear of contracting Covid in the hospitals and hence avoiding treatment? Super specialty hospitals such as RGCIRC are taking all precautions to prevent the spread of infection. At RGCIRC, each person is screened properly and social distancing is maintained. Moreover the hospital has strengthened the system of tele- consultancy which cancer patients could use for consultation sitting at home. What can help improve immunity and fight off infections such as Covid-19 better? Eating a well-balanced diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, maintaining personal hygiene, frequent and proper hand washing, maintaining social distance and shunning tobacco in all forms can help one improve immunity.
