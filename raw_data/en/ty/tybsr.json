Residents in the departments of Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Neurology, Obstetrics and Gynecology and Anesthesia are also exposed to the tenets of integrative medicine in both didactic and clinical settings. OHSU has offered massage and yoga training programs specifically for those working with people with chronic pain. Continuing medical education in integrative medicine and health is offered through Portland-wide integrative medicine grand rounds in collaboration with the Oregon Collaborative for Integrative Medicine (OCIM).
