Our criteria also included CBD brands going above and beyond in their dog CBD oil for arthritis formulas, adding natural botanicals, essential vitamins, and key minerals to organic CBD oil extract in order to support overall physical and emotional well-being for the best quality of life. Additional essential factors included brand reputation, customer reviews, and manufacturing processes. Ultimately, the five dog arthritis CBD oil products above stood out for their excellence in these and many other determining factors, making them the best options for relieving arthritis pain in dogs of all ages and sizes. How to Pick the Best CBD Oil for Your Dog Understanding what the [best CBD for dogs](https://www.pdxmonthly.com/sponsored/2023/06/best-cbd-for-dogs-top-5-pet-cbd-oils-treats-more) looks like is different from knowing how to find one by yourself in the endless sea of pet wellness products. But just because your dog's specific needs may be difficult to shop for doesn't mean you can't find the best CBD oil option to soothe their arthritis symptoms. Choose easy consumption over flavor Dogs of all ages can take CBD oil for their arthritis pain, mood, and even coat health. However, not all dogs have the ability to experience the benefits of CBD with the same ease. For this reason, the right CBD oil for dogs with arthritis should always match your pup's ability to consume the product and not the flavor. If you have a young or old dog, then CBD soft chews may be the best for relieving joint pain, promoting healthy development, and boosting mobility. Compared to liquid CBD oils or crunchy [CBD dog treats](https://www.pdxmonthly.com/sponsored/2023/01/cbd-dog-treats-of-2023-top-8-picks-for-optimal-wellness-of-your-furry-friend), soft chews offer an easy-to-chew and swallow consistency that is soft on the gums, teeth, and stomach. Read ALL the ingredients before you buy Because of their sensitive biology, dogs can have allergies to common supplement ingredients that humans don't have. From digestive issues to skin irritations, feeding your dog the wrong CBD oil formula can lead to a world of hurt, so you always want to make sure to go the extra mile and read all the ingredients. Dogs are most commonly allergic to eggs, soy, wheat, and gluten, so if you have a pet with high [food sensitivities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4710035/), look for grain-free vegan CBD treats or simple CBD oils specifically designed for pets. Additionally, with dogs typically allergic to essential oils and artificial ingredients, it's best to avoid formulas with synthetic flavorings or fragrances. Long-Lasting vs. Arthritis Pain Relief How your dog experiences arthritis will be a critical factor in which pet CBD oil product is right for you. Some CBD oils for dogs with arthritis are designed to work fast, supporting acute pain needs triggered by intense physical activity, changes in temperature, or unexpected emotional stressors. Other CBD oils are formulated to extend the effects, benefiting dogs with chronic arthritic pain or aging pets. If fast-acting formulas that support acute pain needs are what you're after, consider purchasing liquid CBD oil tinctures. The fast effects of [sublingual absorption](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/sublingual-administration) ensure your dog feels pain-free in as little as 20 minutes. For more extended effects that support all-day or night relief from inflammation and swelling, opt for CBD edibles that slowly break down in the digestive tract to provide long-lasting CBD benefits. How to Give a Dog with Arthritis CBD Oil The question \"How much CBD should I give my dog?\" is probably the most asked on Google, yet answers are often vague and conflicting. While it would be great to lock down the exact amount of CBD oil you need to give your pup for optimal relief, the truth is that CBD dosing depends on a variety of factors, including size, age, and overall level of discomfort. But just because there is no one-size-fits-all answer doesn't mean you aren't able to give your pup just the right amount of CBD oil for their needs. Advice from satisfied dog CBD oil users and industry experts says that pet parents should start with a dose of around 0.2mg per pound of body weight, not exceeding 3mg per 10 lbs. If you've given your pet CBD oil drops sublingually or in their food, you might have to wait 20 minutes to an hour to see if the effects take hold. If they don't, you can increase the dose slightly, stopping administration once noticeable effects are observed and never exceeding 5mg of CBD per 10 lbs. of body weight. If you are feeding your pet CBD treats for joint pain or mobility issues, you might have to wait two or three hours for noticeable effects. Unlike dog CBD oil tinctures, edible effects can come on much stronger and too much in the system at once could overshadow the potential for CBD benefits. Starting with one treat is recommended and gradually increasing every day or two until you find the best CBD dosage. As for dosing times and frequency, daily or as-needed CBD oil consumption is fine for dogs, provided that you give it to them at the same time or for the same reason. Not only does regular regimented dosing help you to track your pup's progress more accurately, but it also helps them get excited about supplementation time - a benefit for those with picky eaters or a finicky demeanor. Other Types of CBD for Dogs While CBD oils and treats are ideal for promoting better joint health, mobility, and overall well-being, they may not be the best for every dog. If you're still unsure how to manage your pet's arthritis pain best, here are some additional CBD products that can help. CBD dog topicals CBD creams and balms have long been popular in the human wellness industry, adding a touch of luxury to self-care. But now, you can also give your pup the same kind of skin support with CBD-infused balms and creams specifically designed for dogs. The targeted application of these CBD topicals makes them great for relieving localized joint pain and discomfort. Plus, because you can apply them directly to the area in need, topicals are considered one of the fastest ways to get relief - perfect for those arthritis flare-ups that just can't wait. When used with liquid CBD oils or the [best CBD dog treats](https://www.postandcourier.com/sponsored/top-5-cbd-dog-treats-of-2023-healthy-and-delicious-treats-for-your-pup/article_7376a33c-c289-11ed-979b-ff6ac0c82712.html), topical products ensure that your pup feels the full benefits of CBD supplementation their whole body over. And because CBD products designed for topical use don't absorb into the bloodstream, you don't have to worry as much about overdoing your dog's system with CBD oil. CBD dog shampoos Like topical pain management solutions, CBD shampoo for dogs works to promote better external health, but with a slightly different approach. CBD shampoo is formulated to soothe and condition the skin, restoring natural balance to the coat and reducing irritation caused by pests, [allergies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165159/), and microbiome imbalances. Shampoos can also promote better joint health through repeated, direct application of CBD and essential vitamins, making these CBD products an excellent option for long-term health and wellness support for pain, swelling, and stiffness. Potential Side Effects of CBD Oil for Dogs There is a lot of misinformation about CBD on the internet, especially when it comes to dogs. Many myths come from a lack of regulatory guidance on products made with CBD oils, but also from disreputable brands out to make a buck off your dog's serious pain condition. Fortunately, the advancement of cannabinoid science in animals and humans has exposed a widespread opinion that, with more concrete research, could ultimately become a fact: [CBD for dogs](https://www.phillymag.com/sponsor-content/best-cbd-for-dogs-dog-treats-and-cbd-oil-tinctures/) is safe provided it's made with high-quality hemp plant extracts, supporting ingredients, and manufacturing processes. If all three of these criteria are met, then your pet should not experience any extreme side effects when taking CBD oil. They may, however, experience common, mild side effects of consuming cannabinoids, which may or may not include: - Changes in appetite - Increased digestive activity - Dry mouth or increased thirst - Hyper-relaxed state of being The intensity of these side effects usually subsides after a few doses or when lowering the total amount given in a day. You can also manage any potential risk of uncomfortable side effects by dosing CBD with meals and providing plenty of fresh water before and after administration. Frequently Asked Questions 1. How much CBD oil should I give my 25 lb. dog? The recommended amount of CBD oil for a 25 lb. dog is anywhere from 5mg to 15mg. The lower end of the CBD dosage is ideal for maintaining general pain support, dosing pets with cannabinoid sensitivities, or for those just starting out with CBD. The higher end of the suggested dose range should be reserved for more severe pain, chronic discomfort, or dogs with a slower metabolism due to age. 2. Can I give high-quality CBD oil for humans to dogs? It's not recommended to give CBD oil made for humans to dogs. Not only are the cannabinoids and terpenes different in concentration, but human-grade products often contain ingredients that could be toxic to pets, such as xylitol or grapeseed oil. It's best to purchase high-quality CBD oil products formulated specifically for dogs to ensure your pup gets the best and safest CBD experience possible. 3. Are full-spectrum and broad-spectrum CBD oils the same? No. Full-spectrum formulas contain a much more comprehensive range of hemp plant cannabinoids to provide a fuller, more encompassing therapeutic experience. Broad-spectrum formulas, on the other hand, contain condition-specific cannabinoids that act in synergy with CBD content. If you only want to tackle one type of dog wellness need, then broad-spectrum treats are the way to go. If you want to promote comprehensive wellness for physical and emotional issues, go with full-spectrum CBD products. 4. What is the best CBD oil for dogs? The best CBD oils for dogs are those specifically chosen to match their size, age, and wellness needs. Always read labels carefully to ensure that the CBD oil you're buying has all the right ingredients in the right amounts for your pup. It's also important to purchase from a reputable brand with independent testing practices - that way, you can rest assured knowing that what you see on the label is actually inside the bottle. Stop Canine Arthritis with the Best CBD Oils Whether from age or genetic predisposition, arthritis can be a major source of discomfort for your pup. Fortunately, the best CBD oils for dogs can help manage those painful symptoms and help them live their fullest, most active life. And for the best chances at maximum physical and emotional wellness support, make sure you purchase high-quality quality CBD products from our top-rated list or by using our helpful CBD shopping tips.
