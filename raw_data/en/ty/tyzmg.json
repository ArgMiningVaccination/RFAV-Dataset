In response to a resolution intro- duced by the United States Delega- tion in March 1958, a study was un- dertaken of the possibility of UNICEF aid in this field. A UNICEF staff member, acting as special consultant to the United Nations Bureau of So- cial Affairs, visited a number of coun- tries and developed a report' that formed the basis for the proposed program. The World Health Organ- ization supplemented this analysis with a special report on the health aspects.2 The main report was strongly sup- ported at the Board meeting as being sound both in its general philosophy and in the specific principles that it established. Designed to serve as a basis for planning child welfare proj- ects suitable for submission for UNICEF aid, it should also serve as a valuable resource to countries in- terested in evaluating existing serv- ices to children and planning for their improvement. The report stresses the importance of training for all levels of workers- a recommendation heartily endorsed by the Board. Services that reach the most vulnerable age groups-infants and young children-are high on the priority list, as are the preventive services, such as day care, which might enable children to live in their own homes. While recognizing that institutional care is not ideal for chil- dren deprived of home life, the Board also recognized that in many coun- tries institutions will need to be used for many years to come. Improve- ment of existing institutions and stimulation of planning for services that strengthen home life are the aims of the program. As the report states, \"aid would not be justified un- less it were conceived of as a begin- ning toward a broader and more fundamental objective, namely that of aiding countries develop well- organized national systems of social 1UN Economic and Social Council, E/ ICEF/377-30 January 1959. *UN Economic and Social Council, E/ ICEF/378-18 February 1959. services which would help preserve and strengthen family life, and foster opportunities for the healthy growth of the personality, abilities, and social habits of the child.\" Just as UNICEF relies on the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization for technical advice in areas of their competence, so it will receive techni- cal advice on thh new program from the Bureau of Social Affairs. Though the sum allotted for the first year is small-$135,000-the development of even a few sound projects will require the full-time services of a competent child welfare worker in the Bureau. UNICEF is authorized to assist in paying such a staff member until the Bureau of Social Affairs can inCOI'PO- rate the position in its budget. Which countries will wish to have assistance for projects in this field and what the projects will be like is unknown. The program will be watched with interest, however, as the flrst excursion of UNICEF outside the field of health. This departure into the field of child welfare is renewed evidence of the dynamic quality of UNICEF's program. Initiated in 1946 to meet emergency needs for food and cloth- ing of children in wartorn countries, UNICEF has changed and continues to change to meet new challenges. By resolution of the United Nations General Assembly in December 1950, UNICEF shed its exclusively tempo- rary character and was directed to use its resources \"for the purpose of meeting, through the provision of sunplies, training, and advice, emer- 6 ?cy and long-range needs of chil- -,ren and their continuing needs, par- ticularly in under-developed coun- tries.\" Taking a broad view of the \"needs of children,\" UNICEF has developed in the short space of 8 years an im- aginative and flexible program for stimulating and assisting countries to meet those needs. A narrow approach might have limited aid to the tradi- tional field of maternal and child health as conceived in a Western country where other categorical pro- grams provide other segments of service. The planners, however, with a clear awareness of the needs of children around the world, have built 23 a more realistic program. Aid under UNICEF goes, of course, to basic ma- ternal and child health services, but the services may include environmen- tal sanitation projects, equipment for pediatric and obstetric wards in hos- pitals, and programs for premature infants, as well as the more tradi- tional features. Disease control, which might have been limited to diseases primarily af- fecting children, has been directed into mass campaigns against general scourges-yaws, leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria-which are also great killers of children. For its part in the world Program to eradicate malaria, UNI- CEF contributes almost half its own total resources. Its attack on disease has extended beyond the treatment of the individual to the equipping of Plants to produce treatment mate- rials, such as DDT, penicillin, sera, and vaccines. In extension of its early interest in hungry children, UNICEF has added to its feeding programs a long-range attack on malnutrition. Some 177 milk-processing plants have been aided; the latest allocation was for $1 million to equip the milk plant in Bombay, for which the Government has set aside $5 million. To \"pay back\" UNICEF, Bombay will provide free or subsidized milk to the value of $1.5 million for mothers and children. In September 1957 an expanded Program of aid to nutrition was ap- proved by the Board to provide for surveys, train personnel at all levels, and aid nutrition activities at the vil- lage level. School gardens, village fish ponds, nutrition education for teachers, nurses, and midwives, and poultry and small animal raising-all as Part of community-development Programs - are among the many kinds of Projects for which UNICEF provides imported equipment, sup- Plies, and transport and sometimes training stipends. At the last Board session in March, allocations for such Projects were made to Uganda, India (Orissa), Indonesia, Ethiopia, Israel, and Turkey. By making aid possible for so many kinds of programs UNICEF has be- come an adaptable tool for meeting a variety of needs. With the existing differences in levels of development among the countries of the world, a 24 more circumscribed program would have accomplished less than has this very diversified program. Any coun- try can find something in the UNICEF armamentarium on which it is ready and able to embark. Stimu- lated by international assistance it will invest its own funds in something that may require long-range support. No overall international pattern is imposed, but each country is free to select from a variety of programs the one most suited to its needs. The range of assistance is from the very simple, such as distribution of dry skim milk, to the very complex, such as aid to pediatric education. This latter aid, accepted by the Board as a new program in March 1957, is intended to upgrade the teaching of pediatrics in medical schools, through assisting in the establishment of full- time departments. Only four such projects thus far have been approved -three in India and one in Uganda. Although it is a very specialized kind of aid, it can provide for the country ready to use it an enormous boost to both the quantity and quality of medical care. Against this background of past activity, the vote at the March Board meeting to extend aid to \"Social Services for Children with Particular Reference to Institutions, Day-Care Centers and Other Methods of Care of Children Outside Their Own Homes\" is a natural step forward in the evolution of UNICEF. Another proposed departure from the field of health fared less Well at the hands of the Board. Extension of UNICEP Aid to Primary Education, developed in response to a resolution of the Pakistan delegation, was not accepted by the Board in the form recommended by the administration. The program would have provided for cooperation with UNESCO for aid in training teachers and in broadening the scope of primary education to en- able children to adjust to community life. Proponents of the plan made the point that health, welfare, and edu- cation are interrelated. The Execu- tive Director called attention to the United Nations Report on the World Social Situation, which pointed out the corollary to this \"inter-relafion- ship of needs,\"-that is, that an at- tack on any one of the evils of hun- ger, illness, or ignorance has proved less successful than a simultaneous attack on all three. Though impressed with these arguments the Board was also impressed with the vast amount of unmet need in the fields of health and nutrition that UNICEF is cur- rently attempting to deal with. Rather than spread UNICEF re- sources too thin, the Board decided against expansion into primary edu- cation at this time. Some greater effort was authorized in teacher training in subjects falling within UNICEF's traditional fields of inter- est, such as health, nutrition, hygiene, and home economics. Though not accepted at this time, aid in the fight against illiteracy Will undoubtedly be the subject of future Board consideration, as will other areas of children's needs. The \"tradi- tion\" of UNICEF is to face and deal with changing emphases in Program. - Recent Publications\" General BECKER, JOSEPH M.
