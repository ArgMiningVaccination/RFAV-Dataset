The timing of the application of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 depends on confirmation of full functionality of the EU clinical trial portal and database through an indep endent audit. A delivery timeframe is under development by the EMA, in collaboration with the Member States and the European Commission, for the Regulation to come into effect during 2019. Therefore, the currently applicable definitions in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC are maintained in this GVP Annex I Rev 4 and are the ones which should be used until Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable. The new definitions are included in this GVP Annex I Rev 4 (in addition to the currently applicable d efinitions) in order to support preparations for the upcoming changes. They are distinguished from the currently applicable definitions by blue font colour . The GVP Annex 1 will be revised in order to delete the definitions in accordance with Directive 200 1/20/EC once Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 has become applicable.

Active substance Any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of a medicinal product and that, when used in its production, becomes an active ingredient of that product intended to exert a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions or to make a medical diagnosis [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(3a)]. See also Substance Advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) A medicinal product for human use that is either a gene therapy medicinal product, a somatic cell therapy product or a tissue engineered products as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 [Reg (EC) No 1394/2007 Art 1(1)]. Adverse event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment [Dir 2001/20/EC Art 2(m)]. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline). The following will apply when Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable (see ** on page 3) : In the context of a clinical trial: any untoward medical occurrence in a subject to whom a medicinal product is administered and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment [Reg (EU) No 536/2014 Art 2(2)(32)]. A subject means an individual who participates in a clinical trial, either as recipient of an investigational medicinal product or as a control [Reg (EU) No 536/2014 Art 2(2)(17) ]. In the context of pharmacovigilance and outside a clinical trial: any untoward medical occurrence in a patient to whom a medicinal product is administered and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment ( based on ICH -E2D Guideline, see GVP Annex IV ). An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline). Adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) See Vaccine pharmacovigilance , Vaccine product -related Immunis reaction Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) - Annex I (Rev 4) EMA/876333/2011 Rev 4 Page 8/33 Adverse reaction; synonyms: Adverse drug reaction (ADR), Suspected adverse (drug) reaction, Adverse effect, Undesirable effect A response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(11)]1. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2A Guideline). An adverse reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised by the fact that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected. For regulatory reporting purposes, if an event is spontaneously reported, even if the relationship is unknown or unstated by the by healthcare professional or consumer as primary source, it meets the definition of an adverse reaction (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2D). Therefore all spontaneous reports notified by healthcare professionals or consumers are considered suspected adverse reactions, since they convey the suspicions of the primary sources, unless the primary source specifically state that they believe the event to be unrelated or that a causal relationship can be excluded. Adverse reactions may arise from use of the product within or outside the terms of the mar keting authorisation or from occupational exposure [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 101(1)]. Use outside the marketing authorisation include s off- label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors. See also Adverse event, Serious adverse reaction, Unexpected adverse reaction, Off- label use, Overdose, Misuse of a medicinal product , Abuse of a medicinal product , Medication error, Occupational exposure to a medicinal product Footnote 1 will be deleted when Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable (see ** on pa ge 3). Audit A systematic, disciplined, independent and documented process for obtaining audit evidence and evaluating the evidence objectively to determine the extent to which the audit criteria are fulfilled (see ISO 19011 (3.1) 2). Benchmarking, reviews of qualifications, risk assessment questionnaires, surveys or other activities in which evidence of fulfilment of pharmacovigilance requirements is not independently obtained and evaluated, would not be regarded as an audit . Audit finding(s) Results of th e evaluation of the collected audit evidence against audit criteria (see ISO19011 (3.4)3). Audit evidence is necessary to support the auditor's results of the evaluation, i.e. the auditor's opinion and report. It is cumulative in nature and is primarily o btained from audit procedures performed during the course of the audit. See also Audit Audit plan Description of activities and arrangement for an individual audit (see ISO19011 (3.12)4). See also Audit 1 In the context of clinical trials, an adverse reaction is defined as all untoward and unintended responses to an investigational medicinal product related to any dose administered [Dir 2001/20/EC Art 2(n)]. 2 International Organi zation for Standardi zation (ISO) ; www.iso.org 3 International Organi zation for Standardi zation (ISO) ; www.iso.org 4 International Organi zation for Standardi zation (ISO) ; www.iso.org Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) - Annex I (Rev 4) EMA/876333/2011 Rev 4 Page 9/33 Audit programme Set of one or more audits planned for a specific timeframe and directed towards a specific purpose (see ISO 19011 (3.11)5). See also Audit Audit recommendation Describes the course of action management might consider to rectify conditions that have gone awry, and to mitigate weaknesses in systems of management control (see Sawyer LB et al, 20036). Audit recommendations should be positive and as specific as possible. They should also identify who is to act on them (see Sawyer LB et al, 20036). See also Audit Biological medicinal product A medi cinal product, the active substance of which is a biological substance [DIR 2001/83/EC, Annex 1, Part I, Section 3.2.1.1(b)] . A biological substance is a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and that needs for its characteris ation and the determination of its quality a combination of physico -chemical -biological testing, together with the production process and its control [DIR 2001/83/EC, Annex 1, Part I, Section 3.2.1.1(b)]. Biosimilar medicinal product A biological medicinal product that contains a version of the active substance of an already authorised original biological medicinal product (reference medicinal) product in the E uropean Economic Area, and which has shown similarity to the reference product in terms of quality characteristics, biological activity, safety and efficacy based on a comprehensive comparability exercise (see EMA -CHMP Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products Rev 1) . See also Biological medicinal product Clinical study Any investigation in r elation to humans intended: (a) to discover or verify the clinical, pharmacological or other pharmacodynamic effects of one or more medicinal products; (b) to identify any adverse reactions to one or more medicinal products; or (c) to study the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of one or more medicinal products; with the objective of ascertaining the safety and/or efficacy of those medicinal products [Reg (EU) No 536/2014 Art 2(2)(1)]. See also Clinical trial, Non -interventional study This definition becomes applicable only when Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable (see ** on page 3 ).

This includes clinical trials carried out in either one site or multiple sites, whether in one or more Member State [Dir 2001/20/EC Art 2(a)]. See also Ongoing clinical trial, Completed clinical trial, Investigational medicinal product The following will apply when Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable (see ** on page 3 ): A clinical study which fulfils any of the following conditions: (a) the assignment of the su bject to a particular therapeutic strategy is decided in advance and does not fall within normal clinical practice of the Member State concerned; (b) the decision to prescribe the investigational medicinal products is taken together with the decision to in clude the subject in the clinical study; or (c) diagnostic or monitoring procedures in addition to normal clinical practice are applied to the subjects [Reg (EU) No 536/2014 Art 2(2)(2)]. See also Clinical study, Low -intervention clinical trial, Investigational medicinal product, Ongoing clinical trial, Completed clinical trial Closed signal In periodic benefit -risk evaluation reports, a signal for which an evaluation was completed during the reporting interval (see GVP Annex IV, ICH- E2C(R2) Guideline). A safety signal can be closed either because it is refuted or because it is determined to be a potential or identified risk following evaluation (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline). This definition is also applicable to periodic safety update reports. See also Signal , Refuted signal Company core data sheet (CCDS) For medicinal products, a document prepared by the marketing authorisation holder containing, in addition to safety information, material related to indications, dosing, pharmacology and other information concerning the product (see GVP Annex IV, ICH- E2C(R2) Guideline). See also Company core s afety information Company core s afety information (CCSI) For medicinal products, a ll relevant safety information contained in the c ompany core data sheet prepared by the marketing authorisation holder and which the marketing authorisation holder requires to be listed in all countries where the company markets the product , except when the local regulatory authority specifically requires a modification (see GV P Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline). It is the reference information by which listed and unlisted are determined for the purposes of periodic reporting for marketed products, but not by which expected a nd unexpected are determined for expedited reporting (s ee GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline).

Development safety update report ( DSUR ) Format and content for periodic reporting on drugs under development (see ICH -E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU). Direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC) A commu nication intervention by which important information is delivered directly to individual healthcare professionals by a marketing authorisation holder or by a competent authority, to inform them of the need to take certain actions or adapt their practices in relation to a medicinal product. DHPCs are not replies to enquiries from healthcare professionals. Emerging safety issue A safety issue considered by a marketing authorisation holder to require urgent attention by the competent authority because of the potential major impact on the risk -benefit balance of the medicinal product and /or on patients' or public health and the potential need for prompt regulatory action and communication to patie nts and healthcare professionals . Examples include: major safety issues identified in the context of ongoing or newly completed studies, e.g. an unexpectedly increased rate of fatal or life -threatening adverse events; major safety issues identified through the spontaneous reporting system or publications in the scienti fic literature, which may lead to considering a contraindication, a restriction of use of a medicinal product or its withdrawal from the market; major safety -related regulatory actions outside the EU, e.g. a restriction of use of a medicinal product or its suspension.

Excipient Any constituent of a medicinal product other than the active substance and the packaging material [DIR 2001/83/EC I]. See also Active substance Failure to vaccinate An indicated vaccine was not administered appropriately for any reason (see CIOMS -WHO7). For interpreting what is appropriate, consider the explanatory note for Immunisation error -related reaction. See also Vaccination failure Falsified medicinal product Any medicinal product with a false representation of (a) its identity, including its packaging and labelling, its name or its composition as regards any of the ingredients including excipients and the strength of those ingredients; (b) its source, including its manufacturer, its country of manufacturing, its country of origin or its marketing authorisation holder; or (c) its history, including the records and documents relating to the distribution channels used [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(33)] . This definition does not include unintentional quality defects and is without prejudice to infringements of intellectual property rights [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(33)]. Generic medicinal product A medicinal product which has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substances and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product, and whose bioequivalence with the reference medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate bioavailability studies [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 10(2)(b)]. Good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) for the European Union (EU-GVP) A set of guidelines for the conduct of pharmacovigilance in the European Union (EU) , drawn up based on Article 108a (a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, by the European Medicines Agency in cooperation with competent authorities in Member States and interested parties, and applying to marketing authorisation holders in the EU, the Agency and competent authorities in the Member States.

Where in the EU -GVP reference is made to Member States of the EU, this should be read to include Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein8. Healthcare professional For the purposes of reporting suspected adverse reactions, healthcare professionals are defined as medically qualified persons, such as physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and coroners, or as otherwise specified by local regulations (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline). Herbal medicinal product Any medicinal product, exclusively containing as active ingredients one or more herbal substances or one or more herbal preparations, or one or more such herbal substances in combination with one or more such herbal preparations [DI R 2001/83/EC Art 1(30)]. Herbal substances are all mainly whole, fragmented or cut plants, plant parts, algae, fungi, lichen in an unprocessed, usually dried, form, but sometimes fresh. Certain exudates that have not been subjected to a specific treatment are also considered to be herbal substances. Herbal substances are precisely defined by the plant part used and the botanical name according to the binominal system [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(31)]. Herbal preparations are preparations obtained by subjecting her bal substances to treatments such as extraction, distillation, expression, fractionation, purification, concentration or fermentation. These include comminuted or powered herbal substances, tinctures, extracts, essential oils, expressed juices and processed exudates [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(32)]. Homeopathic medicinal product Any medicinal product prepared from substances called homeopathic stocks in accordance with a homeopathic manufacturing procedure described by the European Pharmacopoeia or, in the absenc e thereof, by the pharmacopoeias currently used officially in the Member States. A homeopathic medicinal product may contain a number of principles [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(5)]. Identified risk An untoward occurrence for which there is adequate evidence of an association with the medicinal product of interest (see ICH -E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU). Examples include: an adverse reaction adequately demonstrated in non- clinical studies and confirmed by clinical data ; an adverse reaction observed in well -designed clinical trials or epidemiological studies for which the magnitude of the difference, compared with the comparator group on a parameter of interest suggests a causal relationship; an adverse reaction suggeste d by a number of well -documented spontaneous reports where causality is strongly supported by temporal relationship and biological plausibility, such as anaphylactic reactions or application site reactions (see ICH -E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Gov erning Medicinal Products in the EU). In a clinical trial, the comparator may be placebo, an active substance or non- exposure. 8 The only exemption from this is that legally binding acts from the EU (e.g. Commission Decisions) do not directly confer rights and obligat ions but have first to be transposed into legally binding acts in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

What constitutes an important risk will depend upon several factors, including the impact on the individual, the seriousness of the risk and the impact on public health. Normally, any risk that is likely to be included in the contraindications or warnings and precautions section of the product information should be considered important (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline). See also R isk-benefit balance, Identified risk , Potential risk, Safety concern Important potential risk See Important identified risk and Important p otential risk Incident A situation where an event occurs or new information arises, irrespective whether this is in the public domain or not, in relation to (an) authorised medicinal pr oduct(s) which could have a serious impact on public health (see European Union Regulatory Network Incident Management Plan for M edicines for Human Use). The incident may be related to quality, efficacy or safety concerns, but most likely to safety and/or quality (and possibly subsequent supply shortages). In addition, situations that do not seem at a first glance to have a serious impact on public health, but are in the public domain - subject of media attention or not- and may lead to serious public conce rns about the product, may also need to be considered as incidents. Likewise, other situations which might have a negative impact on the appropriate use of a medicinal products (e.g. resulting in patients stop taking their medicine) may fall within the def inition of an incident (see European Union Regulatory Network Incident Management Plan for Medicines for Human Use). In the context of this , the European Union Regulatory Network Incident Management Plan for Medicines for Human Use Incident Management Pla n, an incident relates to (a) medicinal product(s) authorised in the EU, irrespective of their route of authorisation (see European Union Regulatory Network Incident Management Plan for Medicines for Human Use). 10 Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS).

If a marketing authorisation holder has no information on the actual IBD for a product, it should first refer to listings of birth dates that some regions develop and make pub licly available. If the product is not included in any listing, it should propose to the regulatory authority a birth date that is based on the earliest known marketing a uthorisation of the substance and then obtain the regulatory authority's agreement (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Q&A) .

See also Indi vidual case safety report Missing information Gaps in knowledge about a medicinal product, related to safety or use in particular patient populations, which could be clinically significant . It is noted that there is an ICH definition for important missing information, which is: critical gaps in knowledge for specific safety issues or populations that use the marketed product (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline). The change of the EU term, to name this concept \"missing information\" rather than \"important missing information\", is to be clear that in the EU a marketing authorisation cannot be granted if there are unacceptable gaps in knowledge, in accordance with Article 12 of REG (EC) No 726/2004 a marketing authorisation shall be refused if the quality, safety or efficacy are not properly or sufficiently demonstrated. Misuse of a medicinal product Situations where a medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorisation . See also Misus e of a medicinal product for illegal purposes Misuse of a medicinal product for illegal purposes Misuse for illegal purposes is misuse with the additional connotation of an intention of misusing the medicinal product to cause an effect in another person. This includes, amongst others: the sale, to other people, of medicines for recreational purposes and use of a medicinal product to facilitate assault. See also Misuse of a medicinal product Name of the medicinal product The name which may be either an invented name not liable to confusion with the common name, or a common or scientific name accompanied by a trade mark or the name of the marketing authorisation holder [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(20)]. The common name is the international non- proprietary name (INN) recommended by the World Health Organization, or, if one does not exist, the usual common name [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(21)]. The complete name of the medicinal product is the name of the medicinal product followed by the strength and pharmaceutical form.

Newly identified signal In periodic benefit -risk evaluation reports , a signal first identified during the reporting interval, prompting further actions or evaluation (see GVP Annex IV, ICH- E2C(R2) Guideline). This definition could also apply to a previously closed signal for which new information becomes available in the reporting interval prompting further action or evaluation (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline). This definition is also applicable to periodic safety update reports. See also Signal , Closed signal Non-confirmed signal For the signal management process in the EU, a validated signal entered in the European Pharmacovigilance Issues Tracking Tool (EPITT) that does not require further analysis and prioritisation by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) at that point in time, according to th e PRAC Rapporteur or (lead) Member State. See also Validated signal, Signal management process, Signal confirmation by the PRAC Rapporteur or (lead) Member State, Signal analysis and prioritisation the PRAC , Confirmed signal Non-interventional trial; synonym: Non-interventional study A study where the medicinal product(s) is (are) prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorisation. The assignment of the patient to a particular therapeutic strategy is not decided i n advance by a trial protocol but falls within current practice and the prescription of the medicine is clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. No additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures shall be applied to the patie nts and epidemiological methods shall be used for the analysis of collected data [Dir 2001/20/EC Art 2(c)]. Thus, a trial is non- interventional if the following requirements are cumulatively fulfilled: the medicinal product is prescribed in the usual manne r in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorisation; the assignment of the patient to a particular therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by a trial protocol but falls within current practice and the prescription of the medicine is clearl y separated from the decision to include the patient in the study; and no additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures are applied to the patients and epidemiological methods are used for the analysis of collected data (see Volume 10 of the Rules Governi ng Medicinal Products in the EU, Questions & Answers Version 10.0). Non-interventional studies are defined by the methodological approach used and not by the scientific objectives. Non-interventional studies include database research or review of records where all the events of interest have already happened (this may include case -control, cross -sectional, cohort and other study designs making secondary use of data). Non- interventional studies also include those involving primary data collection (e.g. pros pective observational studies and registries in which the data collected derive from routine clinical care), provided that the conditions set out above are met. In these studies, interviews, questionnaires and blood samples may be performed as normal clini cal practice. Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) - Annex I (Rev 4) EMA/876333/2011 Rev 4 Page 21/33 Non-interventional trials do not fall in the scope of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Occupational exposure to a medicinal pro duct For the purpose of reporting cases of suspected adverse reactions, an exposure to a medicinal product as a result of one's professional or non -professional occupation . It does not include the exposure to one of the ingredients during the manufacturing process before the release as finished product. Off-label use Situations where a medicinal product is intentionally used for a medical purpose not in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorisation. Examples include the intentional use of a pr oduct in situations other than the ones described in the authorised product information, such as a different indicatio n in terms of medical condition, a different group of patients (e.g. a different age group), a different route or method of administration or a different posology. The reference terms for off-label use are the terms of marketing authoris ation in the country where the product is used.

Periodic safety update report (PSUR) Format and content for provid ing an evaluation of the risk -benefit balance of a medicinal product for submission by t he marketing authorisation holder at defined time points during the post- authorisation phase. In the EU, periodic safety update reports should follow the format described in GVP Module VII. Pharmacovigilance Science and activities relating to the detection , assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine -related problem ( see WHO13). In line with this general definition, underlying objectives of pharmacovigilance in accordance with the applicable EU legislation for are: preve nting harm from adverse reactions in humans arising from the use of authorised medicinal products within or outside the terms of marketing authorisation or from occupational exposure; and promoting the safe and effective use of medicinal products, in parti cular through providing timely information about the safety of medicinal products to patients, healthcare professionals and the public. Pharmacovigilance is therefore an activity contributing to the protection of patients' and public health. Pharmacovigila nce system A system used by the marketing authorisation holder and by Member States to fulfil the tasks and responsibilities listed in Title IX of Directive 2001/ 83/EC and designed to monitor the safety of authorised medicinal products and detect any chan ge to their risk -benefit balance [D IR 2001/ 83/EC Art 1(28d)]. In general, a pharmacovigilance system is a system used by an organisation to fulfil its legal tasks and responsibilities in relation to pharmacovigilance and designed to monitor the safety of a uthorised medicinal products and detect any change to their risk -benefit balance. 13 World Health Organization (WHO).

See also Clinical trial, Non-interventional study Potential risk An untoward occurrence for which there is some basis for suspicion of an association with the medicinal product of interest but where this association has not been confirmed (see ICH -E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU) . Examples include: non-clinical toxicological findings that have not been observed or resolved in clinical studies; adverse events observed in cl inical trials or epidemiological studies for which the magnitude of the difference, compared with the comparator group (placebo or active substance, or unexposed group), on the parameter of interest raises a suspicion of, but is not large enough to suggest, a causal relationship; a signal arising from a spontaneous adverse reaction reporting system; an event known to be associated with other active substances within the same class or which could be expected to occur based on the properties of the medicinal product (based on ICH-E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU).

It is a subset of information containe d within the marketing authorisation holder's reference product information for the periodic benefit- risk evaluation report. Where the reference product information is the company core data sheet, the reference safety information is the company core safety information (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline). See also Company core data sheet , Company core safety information Footnote 13 becomes applicable only when Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable (see ** on page 3 ). Refuted signal A valida ted signal which, following further assessment has been determined to be \"false\", i.e. a causal association cannot be established at that point in time . It is noted that f or the purpose of the periodic benefit- risk evaluation report (PBRER) ICH describes r efuted signals as signals that, following evaluation, have been refuted as \"false\" signals based on medical judgment and a scientific evaluation of the currently available information (GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline). See also Validated signal, Signal assessment Registry An organised system that uses observational methods to collect uniform data on specified outcomes in a population defined by a particular disease, condition or exposure. Risk-benefit balance An evaluation of the positive therapeutic ef fects of the medicinal product in relation to the risks [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(28a)], i.e. any risk relating to the quality, safety or efficacy of the medicinal product as regards patients' health or public health [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(28)]. See also Risks related to use of a medicinal product Risk management plan (RMP) A detailed description of the risk management system [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(28c)]. The risk management plan established by the marketing authorisation holder shall c ontain the following elements: (a) an identification or characterisation of the safety profile of the m edicinal product(s) concerned; (b) an indication of how to characterise further the safety profile of the m edicinal product(s) concerned; (c) a documentation of measures to prevent or minimise the risks associated with the medicinal product, including an assessment of the effecti veness of those interventions; (d) a documentation of post- authorisation obligations that have been imposed as a condition of the marketing authorisation [IR 520/2012 Art 30(1)]. See also Risk management system, Risk minimisation measure 14 In the context of a clinical trial, if the investigator 's brochure is not a summary of product characteristics, it shall con tain a clearly identifiable section called the 'Refe rence Safety Information' (RSI). ... the RSI shall contain product information on the investigational medicinal product and on how to determine what adverse reactions are to be considered as expected adverse reactions, and on the frequency and nature of thos e adverse reactions [Reg (EU) No 536/2014 Annex 1.E.30]. Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) - Annex I (Rev 4) EMA/876333/2011 Rev 4 Page 26/33 Risk management system A set of pharmacovigilance activities and interventions designed to identify, characterise, prevent or minimise risks relating to a medicinal product, including the assessment of the effectiveness of those activities and interventions [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(28b)]. Risk minimisation measure ; synonym: Risk minimisation activity Interventions intended to prevent or reduce the occurrence of adverse reaction s associated with the exposure to a medicine, or to reduce their severity or impact on the patient should adverse reactions occur. These activities may consist of routine risk minimisation measures ( the summary o f product characteristics, the package leaflet , the labelling , the pack size , the legal status of the product, and its formulation) or additional risk minimisation measures (educational programmes , controlled access programmes, o ther additional risk minimisation measures). Risks related to use of a me dicinal product Any risk relating to the quality, safety or efficacy of the medicinal product as regards patients' health or public health and any risk of undesirable effects on the environment [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(28)]. Safety concern An important identified risk, important potential risk or missing information. It is noted that the ICH definition of safety concern is: an important identified risk, important potential risk or important missing information, i.e. includes the qualifier \"important\" in relati on to missing information (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline). The ICH -E2E Guideline (see GVP Annex IV) uses the terms safety issue and safety concern interchangeably with the same definition for safety concern as defined in the ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline . See also Important identified risk and Important potential risk , Missing information Serious adverse reaction An adverse reaction which results in death, is life -threatening, requires in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(12)]. Life-threatening in this context refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reacti on; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline). Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious, su ch as important medical events that might not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but might jeopardise the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse (see Annex GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline). Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also conside red a serious adverse reaction. Guideline on go od pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) - Annex I (Rev 4) EMA/876333/2011 Rev 4 Page 27/33 Signal Information aris ing from one or multiple sources , including observations and experiments, which suggest s a new potentially causal association, or a new aspect of a known association between an intervention and an event or set of related events, either adverse or beneficial, that is judged to be of sufficient likelihood to justify ver ificatory action [IR 520/2012 Art 19(1)]. New aspects of a known association may include changes in the frequency, distribution (e.g. gender, age and country), duration, severity or outcome of the adverse reaction. For the purpose of monitoring data in the EudraVigilance database, only signals related to an adverse reaction shall be considered [IR 520/2012 Art 19(1)]. For the purpose of Section 16.2 of the periodic benefit- risk evaluation report, signals relate to adverse effects (see GVP Annex IV, ICH -E2C(R2) Guideline). See also Signal management process, Newly identified signal, Closed signal, Ongoing signal Signal analysis and prioritisation by the PRAC For the signal management process in the EU, the process by which the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) determines whether a confirmed si gnal requires further assessment, and if required, to what timeframe and in which procedural framework, based on an initial analysis of the potential impact of the signal on patients' or public health and the risk -benefit balance of the concerned medicinal product(s). See also Signal management process Signal assessment The p rocess of further evaluating a validated signal taking into account all available evidence, to determine whether there are new risks causally associated with the active substance or med icinal product or whether known risks have changed. This process may include non- clinical and clinical data and should be as comprehensive as possible regarding the sources of information. Within the signal management process in the EU, signal assessment by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), is, f ollowing PRAC 's initial signal analysis and prioritisation, the process of evaluating all available data relevant to a signal to determine the need for any regulatory action.

This process is not intended to be a full assessment of the signal. The fact that a signal is confirmed does not imply that a causal relationship has been established, but that the signal should be discussed at EU level and further investigated by the PRAC.

Signal management process A set of activities performed to determine whether , based on an examination of individual case safety report s, aggregated data from active surveillance systems or studies, scientific literature information or other data sources, there are new risks associated with an active substance or a medicinal product or whether known risks have changed, as we ll as any related recommendations, decisions, communications and tracking. The signal management process shall include the following activities: signal detection, signal validation, signal confirmation, signal analysis and prioritisation, signal assessment and recommendation for action [IR 520/2012 Art 21(1)]. For explanations on a ctive surveillance, see GVP Module VIII.App1.1.1.. See also Signal detection, Signal validation , Signal prioritisation, Individual case safety reports Signal prioritisation The process, continuously performed through out signal management , which aims to identify those signals suggesting risks with a potential important patients' or public health impact or which may significantly affect the risk -benefit balance of the medicinal pro duct and thus require urgent attention and management without delay (based on SCOPE Best Practice Guide on Signal Management16). See also Signal management process Signal validation Process of evaluating the data supporting the detected signal in order to v erify that the available documentation contains sufficient evidence demonstrating the existence of a new potentially causal association, or a new aspect of a known association, and therefore justifies further analysis of the signal [IR 520/2012 Art 21(1)]. This evaluation should take into account the strength of the evidence, the clinical relevance and the previous awareness of the association .

In this context, an adverse reaction refers to a suspected adverse reaction. Stimulated reporting can occur in certain situations, such as after a direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC), a publication in the press or questioning of healthcare professionals by company representatives, and adverse reaction reports arising from these situations are considered spo ntaneous reports (see GVP Annex IV, ICH - E2D), provided the report meets the definition above. Reporting can also be s timulated by invitation from patients' or consumers' organisations to their members , or a class lawsuit. Reporting made in the context of e arly post - marketing phase vigilance (EPPV), e.g. in Japan, is also consi dered stimulated reporting.

Traditional herbal medicinal product A herbal medicinal product that fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 16a(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(29)], i.e. (a) it has (an) indication (s) exclusively appropriate to traditional herbal medicinal products which, by virtue of their composition and purpose, are intended and designed for use without the supervision of a medical practitioner for diagnostic purposes or for prescription or monitoring of treatment; (b) it is exclusively for administration in accordance with a specified strength and posology; (c) it is an oral, external and/or inhalation preparation; (d) th e period of traditional use as laid down in Article 16c(1)(c) has elapsed; (e) the data on the traditional use of the medicinal product are sufficient; in particular the product proves not to be harmful in the specified conditions of use and the pharmacological effects or efficacy of the medicinal product are plausible on the basis of long -standing use and experience [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 16a(1)]. Regarding (d), the product must have been in medicinal use throughout a period of at least 30 years, including a t least 15 years within the EU (see DIR 2001/83/EC Art 16c(1)(c)). See also Herbal medicinal product Unexpected adverse reaction An adverse reaction, the nature, severity or outcome of which is not consistent with the summary of product characteristics [DI R 2001/83/EC Art 1(13) ]17. This includes class -related reactions which are mentioned in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) but which are not specifically described as occurring with this product. For products authorised nationally, the relevant SmPC is that authorised by the competent authority in the Member State to whom the reaction is being reported. For centrally authorised products, the relevant SmPC is the SmPC authorised by the European Commission. During the time period between a CHMP opi nion in favour of granting a marketing authorisation and the Commission decision granting the marketing authorisation, the relevant SmPC is the SmPC annexed to the CHMP opinion.

Membership of this group is determined by the governance structure of the organisation. While it is envisaged that the upper management usually is a group, the head of the organisation is the one person at the top of the organisation with ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the organisation complies with relevant legislation. 17 For investigational medicinal products, an unexpected adverse reaction is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consiste nt with the applicable product information (e.g. the investigator's brochure for an unauthorised investigational product or the summary of product characteristics for an authorised product) [Dir 2001/20/EC Art 2(p)]. The following becomes applicable when R egulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable (see ** on page 3): In the context of a clinical trial, an unexpected serious adverse reaction means a serious adverse reaction, the nature, severity or outcome of which is not consistent with the reference saf ety information [Reg (EU) No 536/2014 Art 2(2)(34)].

See also Immunisation Vacc ination failure Vaccination failure due to actual vaccine failure or failure to vaccinate (see CIOMS -WHO18). Vaccination failure may be defined based on clinical endpoints or immunological criteria, where correlates or surrogate markers for disease protecti on exist. Primary failure (e.g. lack of seroconversion or seroprotection) needs to be distinguished from secondary failure (waning immunity) (see CIOMS -WHO18). See also Vaccine failure , Failure to vaccinate Vaccine See Immunological medicinal product Vacci ne failure Confirmed or suspected vaccine failure. Confirmed clinical vaccine failure Occurrence of the specific vaccine -preventable disease in a person who is appropriately and fully vaccinated taking into account the incubation period and the normal dela y for the protection to be acquired as a result of immunisation (see CIOMS -WHO19). Suspected clinical vaccine failure Occurrence of disease in an appropriately and fully vaccinated person, but the disease is not confirmed to be the specific vaccine -preventa ble disease, e.g. disease of unknown serotype in a fully vaccinated person (based on CIOMS -WHO19). Confirmed immunological vaccine failure Failure of the vaccin ated person to develop the accepted marker of protective immune response after being fully and appropriately vaccinated, as demonstrated by having tested or examin ed the vaccin ated person at an appropriate time interval after completion of immunisation (based on CIOMS - WHO19. Suspected immunological vaccine failure Failure of the vaccin ated person to develop the accepted marker of protective immune response after being fully and appropriately vaccinated , but with the test ing or examinat ion of the vaccin ated person done at an in appropriate time interval after completion of immunisation (based on CIOMS -WHO19).

In this definition, immunisation means the usage of a vaccine for the purpose of immunising individuals (see CIOMS -WHO20), which in the EU is preferably referred to as vaccination (in the report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance the terms immunisation and vaccination are used interchangeably20). Usage includes all processes that occur after a vaccine product has left the manufacturing/packaging site, i.e. handling, prescribing and administration of the vaccine (see CIOMS -WHO20). An adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) i s any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunisation and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or dise ase. While this AEFI definition is compatible with the definition of adverse event appli ed in the EU, the AEFI definition is not needed to describe pharmacovigilance for vaccines in the EU. However, EU guidance on pharmacovigilance for vaccines makes use o f the terminology suggested by CIOMS -WHO20 regarding possible causes of adverse events, turning them into suspected adverse reactions. A coincidental event is an AEFI that is caused by something other than the vaccine product, immunisation error or immunis ation anxiety (see CIOMS -WHO20). See Adverse event, Immunisation anxiety -related reaction, Immunisation error -related reaction, Vaccine product -related reaction, Vaccine quality defect -related reaction , Vaccination Vaccine product -related reaction An adverse event following immunisation that is caused or precipitated by a vaccine due to one or more of the inherent properties of the vaccine product (see CIOMS -WHO21). In this definition i mmunisation means the usage (handling, prescribing and administrati on) of a vaccine for the purpose of immunising individuals (see CIOMS -WHO21), which in the EU is preferably referred to as vaccination (in the report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance the terms immunisation and vaccination are used interchangeably21). See also Vaccine pharmacovigilance Vaccine quality defect -related reaction An adverse event following immunisation that is caused or precipitated by a vaccine that is due to one or more quality defects of the vaccine product including its administration device as provided by the manufacturer (see CIOMS -WHO22). In this definition i mmunisation means the usage (handling, prescribing and administration) of a vaccine for the purpose of immunising individuals (see CIOMS -WHO22), which in the EU i s preferably referred to as vaccination (in the report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance the terms immunisation and vaccination are used interchangeably22). For the purpose of this definition, a vaccine quality defect is defined as any deviation of the vaccine product as manufactured from its set quality specifications (see CIOMS -WHO22).
