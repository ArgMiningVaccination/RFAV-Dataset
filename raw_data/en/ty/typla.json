Ensure you are consulting the most up-to-date version of these prescribing guidelines and documents. Note: Prescribing of oral antiviral agents is authorized ONLY during a COVID-19 pandemic declared by the Chief Medical Health Officer for Saskatchewan. These guidelines have been developed according to Saskatchewan pharmacy prescribing standards. Please reference your own province's guidelines when prescribing and billing. June 2023 medSask Drug Interactions Table has been updated to reflect guidance around contraindicated interactions and management. Community prescribers are responsible for managing drug interactions and are encouraged to use drug interaction resources (e.g. Liverpool COVID-19 Drug Interactions, BCCDC Practice Tool - Drug-Drug Interactions, medSask Drug Interactions Table, etc.) AND clinical judgement in decision making and management. Remdesivir exclusion criteria updated. Individuals with eGFR < 30 mL/min are now potentially eligible to receive remdesivir. Individuals not eligible for Paxlovid but potentially eligible for remdesivir may be referred to Early COVID Therapeutics Team for remdesivir assessment. 'Active Liver Disease' clarified as 'Liver disease with severe hepatic impairment'. Liver disease with severe hepatic impairment is an exclusion criterion for antiviral therapy in Saskatchewan. August 2022 Eligibility criteria for Paxlovid prescribing updated. Individuals that have previously been infected and have recovered from the infection are now potentially eligible to receive Paxlovid. In addition, individuals who previously received an early COVID-19 therapeutic agent are now potentially eligible to receive an additional course of an early COVID-19 antiviral (Paxlovid, remdesivir). Paxlovid Resources and Documents Mild COVID-19 Infection: Paxlovid The medSask Guidelines for Prescribing PaxlovidTM (the \"Guidelines\") are intended to be used as a tool to aid decision-making when prescribing for certain minor ailments or self-care conditions. The Guidelines are intended solely for educational and informational purposes and are not to be used for diagnostic purposes, and do not replace personal skill, professional judgment, and care of a pharmacist or other healthcare professionals. - Description - An acute viral respiratory tract infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, resulting in COVID-19 disease. - Other viruses may cause similar symptoms, making it impossible to differentiate clinically between the COVID-19 virus and other viruses. Some clinical features (for example, smell or taste disorders) are more common with COVID-19, but these cannot be used as reliable distinguishing signs or symptoms. - The virus first started circulating at the end of 2019, causing outbreaks and a worldwide pandemic. - COVID-19 has mutated and changed over time, with several variants of varying degrees of transmission and ability to evade vaccines and treatments emerging. - Transmission of the COVID-19 virus occurs via respiratory droplets or aerosols (e.g. coughing, sneezing, singing, talking, etc.), by direct or indirect contact, or both. - Pre-Omicron incubation period ranged from 2-14 days, with most cases occurring within 4 to 7 days after exposure. Omicron incubation has been found to be 2-4 days on average. - Most patients are considered infective 3 days prior to symptom onset or date of initial positive test, and for 10 days following symptom onset or date of initial positive test. However, in some patients (particularly in patients severely ill from COVID-19 and immunocompromised patients) the viral shedding may occur for 20 days or longer from symptom onset. - Patient groups at higher risk of symptomatic disease and progression to critical illness from COVID-19 include: - Older age (risk increases incrementally with each increase in decade of life) - In Saskatchewan, patients age 55 are considered high risk - Obesity: BMI 30 kg/m2 - Pregnancy (all stages and 4 weeks post-pregnancy) - Indigenous peoples - Residents of long-term care and other chronic care facilities - Asthma, COPD, other chronic lung diseases - Chronic kidney disease - Chronic liver disease - Cardiovascular disease - Cerebrovascular disease - Hypertension - HIV infection - Cancer - Diabetes mellitus - Immunocompromised due to disease or medication - Solid organ or blood stem cell transplant - Neurodevelopmental disorders - Compromised handling of respiratory secretions - may occur in cognitive dysfunction, spinal cord injury, seizure disorders, neuromuscular disorders, cerebral palsy, etc. - Older age (risk increases incrementally with each increase in decade of life) **Note: Eligibility criteria varies based on different health authorities. For the purposes of this prescribing guideline, community prescribers will be expected to align with the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA). See the \"Treatment\" section for current eligibility. ** - Spectrum of illness ranges from asymptomatic infection, to mild symptoms, to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction. - Potential complications: - Respiratory failure: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome - Thromboembolic complications or thrombosis (VTE, PE), acute stroke - Neurological complications: encephalopathy, stroke, ataxia, delirium, movement disorders and sensory and motor deficits, neuropathy, and less commonly seizures. - Dehydration, hypovolemia - Acute kidney injury and renal insufficiency (low urine output) - Worsening of underlying medical conditions (e.g. heart failure, diabetes, COPD) - Recovery time is highly variable and takes into consideration the patient's age, comorbidities as well as severity of illness. Patients with mild illness generally recover within 2 weeks, while patients with more severe illness may take several months to recover. - Post-COVID/Long COVID: [COVID-19 for health professionals: Post COVID-19 condition](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/post-covid-19-condition.html) - Patients may report long-term health effects that may persist for weeks, months, or years after recovery from acute illness. - World Health Organization defines post COVID-19 condition in adults as occurring 3 months from onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and can't be explained by an alternative diagnosis. US agencies have defined long COVID as symptoms that continue or develop and are present four weeks or more after initial phase of infection with potential for a relapsing and remitting pattern and progression. - Estimated prevalence ranges from 5-80% - Risk factors include: - Repeated infection - Female - Severity of infection - Comorbidities - Vaccination with 2 or more doses mRNA or viral vector vaccine may be associated with reduced risk of developing long COVID. - Symptoms are diverse and may include persistent/recurrent symptoms as well as new symptoms. They include, but are not limited to: - Fatigue - Cough - Shortness of breath - Chest pain or tightness - Anosmia, dysgeusia, poor appetite - Arthralgia or myalgia - Headache - Memory loss, cognitive difficulty - Dizziness, palpitations - Depression, insomnia - Physical limitations of normal activity As the information continues to evolve at a rapid rate, for more information and to access the most up to date information, see the following websites: [Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals.html) [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) LAST UPDATED: 20 JUNe 2023 - Signs and Symptoms [Health Canada COVID-19 signs, symptoms and severity of disease: A clinician guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/guidance-documents/signs-symptoms-severity.html#a1) - Other viruses may cause similar symptoms, making it impossible to differentiate clinically between the COVID-19 virus and other viruses. Some clinical features (for example, smell or taste disorders) are more common with COVID-19, but these cannot be used as reliable distinguishing signs or symptoms. - When COVID-19 is known to be circulating in the community, diagnosis can be made based on a positive PCR or rapid antigen test (RAT). - Presenting symptoms of mild COVID-19 vary, and may include: - Common: - Runny nose or congestion - Sore throat - Sneezing - Headache - Cough - Anosmia (loss of smell), dysgeusia (taste disturbance) or ageusia (loss of taste) - Myalgia (muscle pain) or arthralgia (joint pain) - Conjunctivitis - Dyspnea (shortness of breath); new or worsening over baseline, or change in activities that cause breathlessness - Fatigue, malaise, confusion - Fever 38.5\u00b0C (lasting < 72 hours) - Chills or rigors - Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain) - Anxiety, depression, insomnia - New or worsening - Common: Severity classification: ** Classification of symptom severity varies based on different references, health authorities, etc. For the purposes of this prescribing guideline, community prescribers will be expected to align with the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA).** Mild Illness - Signs and symptoms of mild illness. - Non-hospitalized adults, not requiring supplemental oxygen (or increase in supplemental oxygen from baseline) with SpO2 greater than 92% at rest, and have no increased work of breathing. Moderate Illness - Hospitalized patients requiring low-flow supplemental oxygen. Severe Illness - Hospitalized patients requiring additional interventions such as ventilatory or circulatory support. - Note: Patients may progress from one severity category to another relatively quickly. The rapidity of symptom progression does not appear to predict a worse outcome. Ensure patients are educated on signs and symptoms that indicate worsening of their condition and when to seek emergency medical attention.

Provide the patient with the medSask document \" LAST UPDATED: 20 june 2023 - Differential Assessments Many different bacterial and viral infections of the upper respiratory tract may present with similar symptoms as COVID-19, making it difficult to distinguish. Provincial data on circulating respiratory illnesses may help to inform risk of exposure to other infections and can be found in the Saskatchewan [Community Respiratory Illness Surveillance Program (CRISP) reports](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/government-structure/ministries/health/other-reports/community-respiratory-illness-surveillance-program). The only way to rule out the following conditions that may present with similar symptoms is with a confirmatory PCR test or RAT. - Influenza - symptoms may be very similar, however, gastrointestinal symptoms are generally uncommon in adults with influenza. Presentation varies, but in general includes signs and symptoms of upper and/or lower respiratory tract involvement in addition to systemic symptoms usually lasting 4 to 7 days but may last up to 10 days. Initial symptoms tend to be systemic progressing to more respiratory symptoms as systemic symptoms improve. - Children: may present with a non-specific fever, or respiratory illness such as bronchitis or croup. - Healthy adolescents and adults: abrupt onset of fever and dry cough is highly predictable. - Older adults: 2 symptoms of cough, sore throat, myalgia and extreme weakness or exhaustion. - Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) - causes infections of the lungs and respiratory tract. Symptoms most commonly appear about 4-6 days after exposure to the virus. Usually causes mild cold-like signs and symptoms such as congested or runny nose, dry cough, low-grade fever, sore throat, sneezing and headache. Infants are most severely affected by RSV. - Common cold - less severe symptoms than influenza which resolve in a few days. Initial complaints are usually related to the throat (dry, scratchy, sore), nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. May experience cough that starts dry, progressing to productive. - Allergic rhinitis - persistent upper respiratory tract symptoms such as rhinitis, sneezing, conjunctivitis, and absence of fever. Suspect if history of allergic rhinitis or exposure to allergen. See the [Allergic Rhinitis](/professional-practice/restricted-guidelines/allergic-rhinitis-guidelines-for-prescribing-intranasal-corticosteroids.php)prescribing guidelines. - Pneumonia - Primary: persistent symptoms which worsen instead of resolving - high fever, dyspnea, coughing purulent sputum - Secondary bacterial pneumonia: exacerbation of fever, respiratory symptoms after initial improvement - Mixed: concurrent viral and bacterial infections. Patients may experience gradual worsening of symptoms or may experience some improvement followed by worsening. - Acute exacerbation of COPD or asthma - characterized by change in baseline symptoms beyond normal daily variations that requires change in therapy. - Sinusitis - persistent purulent nasal secretions, nasal congestion, facial tenderness or pain, and headache are common. May also experience fever. - Streptococcal pharyngitis - acute onset of sore throat, fever, tender lymph nodes and pain upon swallowing. Unlikely to present with cough, runny nose or other common symptoms of upper respiratory infection. - Croup - non-productive, barking cough, inspiratory stridor (whistling wheeze), hoarseness, most common in children less than 3 years of age. Symptoms often worsen at night. - Mononucleosis - classical presentation triad: fever, pharyngitis, and swollen glands. Additional symptoms may include fatigue, headache and lack of appetite. - Heart failure - cough, shortness of breath, history of heart failure. LAST UPDATED: 20 june 2023 - Influenza - symptoms may be very similar, however, gastrointestinal symptoms are generally uncommon in adults with influenza. Presentation varies, but in general includes signs and symptoms of upper and/or lower respiratory tract involvement in addition to systemic symptoms usually lasting 4 to 7 days but may last up to 10 days. Initial symptoms tend to be systemic progressing to more respiratory symptoms as systemic symptoms improve. - Eligibility and Referral Criteria Patients with mild COVID-19 signs/symptoms and positive PCR test or RAT usually do not require further investigation, however, an assessment by the patient's primary care provider, referral to 811 or emergency referral may be required. Patients ineligible for Paxlovid (ie: likely to recover without antiviral therapy, not at risk for progression to severe disease) should be advised to manage their symptoms at home, unless their symptoms progress from mild to moderate or severe disease. Patients should then be referred to emergency. If unable to confirm patient's self diagnosis and/or self-care is not appropriate, refer to the patient's primary care provider, 811, or emergency department, as appropriate, for further investigation and/or supervised therapy. Eligibility Criteria - Positive PCR test or RAT - Symptomatic and day 5 since symptom onset; Day of symptom onset = Day 0 - Patients may be eligible for remdesivir up to day 7 after symptom onset. - Mild COVID-19 signs and symptoms - At least 90 days have elapsed since symptoms from previous infection (if applicable) have resolved. - 90-day timeframe is to ensure that the current infection is a distinct and new infection.

Goals of Therapy - Relieve symptoms of COVID-19 - Reduce severity and duration of symptoms and infection - Decrease and/or prevent the risk of complications such as worsening of co-morbid conditions, hospitalization, or death - Prevent the spread of infection A thorough patient history is pertinent in determining the most appropriate treatment option. Particular attention must be paid to the following: - Time since symptom onset - Signs and symptom(s) and their severity - Presence of risk factors - Level of circulating COVID-19 in the community - Whether patient has a positive PCR test or RAT - Vaccination status - Previous COVID-19 infection - Previous treatment with an early COVID-19 antiviral Non-pharmacologic Treatment - Recommend plenty of fluids, rest, and increased humidity. - Reduce spread of the virus by: - Handwashing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub after contact with eyes, mouth, nose, or respiratory secretions. - Covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. - Staying at home when feeling unwell. - Wearing a mask. Pharmacologic Treatment Over-the-Counter Options - Supportive or symptomatic management in addition to non-pharmacologic treatment for mild COVID-19 symptoms may be all that is required. - Analgesics such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) can be used for fever relief, headache and myalgia. - Usual dosing as per the product label is recommended. - ASA should not be used in children or adolescents due to a risk of Reye syndrome. - Saline sprays, solutions and gels may provide symptomatic relief of nasal irritation. - Cough and cold remedies may provide relief of upper respiratory symptoms. - Avoid in children < 6 years of age - The CPhA has developed a simple [infographic](https://www.pharmacists.ca/cpha-ca/assets/File/cpha-on-the-issues/Managing_Covid_Poster_EN.pdf)that can be provided to patients. Prescription Options Antiviral: Nirmatrelvir/ Ritonavir (Paxlovid protease inhibitor - Inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2; the virus requires this enzyme to replicate. - Ritonavir: an HIV-1 protease inhibitor and CYP3A inhibitor - Helps to slow down nirmatrelvir's metabolism; allows it to remain active in the body and at higher concentrations for longer. - Supporting Evidence: - EPIC-HR trial: - Consistent efficacy for previously identified variants (i.e., alpha, beta, delta, gamma, lambda, and mu). - In vitro data confirms efficacy against the Omicron 3CL - Treatment initiation: - Indicated for the treatment of mild COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe disease. - See the Eligibility Criteria section above for patients considered to be high risk for the purpose of this prescribing guideline. People without risk factors are unlikely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19 and tend to recover without needing an antiviral like Paxlovid. - Initiate within day 5 of symptom onset: ideally as soon as possible after confirmation of a positive PCR test or RAT. - May reduce complications of COVID-19 such as hospitalization, exacerbation of comorbidities and death. - Initiation > day 5 after symptom onset: not applicable. Patients presenting with symptoms up to day 7 after symptom onset may be eligible for remdesivir therapy and should be referred if they are eligible. - Paxlovid should not be routinely used for asymptomatic patients, or in patients < 18 years of age that are otherwise healthy and do not have any risk factors for severe disease progression. - Paxlovid is not indicated for COVID-19 prophylaxis (in patients that are considered close household contacts). - Indicated for the treatment of mild COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe disease. - Dosage: Nirmatrelvir/ Ritonavir (Paxlovid) - Recommended dose in adults 18 years of age: - 300 mg (TWO x 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with 100 mg (ONE x 100 mg tablet) of ritonavir, every 12 hours for FIVE days. - All tablets in a dose must be taken together; if doses are separated the ritonavir is unable to \"boost\" the nirmatrelvir, possibly making it ineffective. - Adjustments required in renal impairment: - eGFR < 30 mL/min or on dialysis: Paxlovid contraindicated; may be eligible for remdesivir - eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min: dose adjustment required - Dose: 150 mg (ONE x 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with 100 mg (ONE x 100 mg tablet) of ritonavir, every 12 hours for FIVE days. - Important note: Paxlovid is available in packaging specific for this dosing (DIN 02527804): cartons contain 5 blister cards that include 2x 150 mg nirmatrelvir and 2x 100 mg tablets of ritonavir (ONE tablet each to be taken for each dose of the day). - The original packaging containing blisters of 4x 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablets and 2x 100 mg ritonavir tablets (DIN 02524031) can be used if the renal dose packaging is not available. However, the five blister cards must be manipulated. Pharmacy must: - Remove and dispose of the unneeded doses from the package. (TWO nirmatrelvir tablets per blister) - Inform the patient that packaging has been modified. - Ensure the prescription label instructions match the appropriate dosing. - Apply [a sticker](https://medsask.usask.ca/sites/medsask/files/2023-02/paxlovid-renal-dosing-stickers.pdf)indicating the dose has been manipulated. - Recommended dose in adults 18 years of age: - Adjustments required in hepatic impairment: - No adjustment in mild to moderate impairment Child-Pugh Class A or B - Contraindicated in severe impairment- Child-Pugh Class C - Note: at this time, according to SHA eligibility criteria, any patients with any medical history of liver disease with severe hepatic impairment (or suspicion of such) are not eligible. - Missed doses: - If within 8 hours of the usual time it is taken, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible and resume normal dosing schedule. - If > 8 hours, the patient should skip the dose and resume normal dosing schedule. The dose should not be doubled and should be properly discarded. - Administration: - Take with or without food with adequate fluid. - PaxolovidTM may be split or crushed. See guidance from [BCCDC](http://www.bccdc.ca/Health-Professionals-Site/Documents/COVID-treatment/Crushing_Paxlovid.pdf). - Pediatrics: - The safety and efficacy have not been established in patients below 18 years of age. - Pregnancy: - Pregnancy (any stage or recently pregnant) is a risk factor for severe disease and complications due to COVID-19. This is especially true in patients with asthma, diabetes, obesity, advanced maternal age, hypertension, or heart disease. - Per product monograph, Paxlovid should not be used in pregnant people unless the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. For the purposes of community prescribing in Saskatchewan, the use of Paxlovid is contraindicated in this population. - Precaution: Effect on fertility and teratogenic risk is not known, therefore all patients (all sexes) are required to use contraception or abstain from intercourse that can result in pregnancy for the duration of treatment and 4 days after completion of treatment. - Pregnancy (any stage or recently pregnant) is a risk factor for severe disease and complications due to COVID-19. This is especially true in patients with asthma, diabetes, obesity, advanced maternal age, hypertension, or heart disease. - Breastfeeding/chestfeeding: - Unknown whether nirmatrelvir or any components: - are present in human milk - affect milk production - have an effect on a breast/chest fed infant - HIV studies have shown ritonavir to be present in human milk. - For the purposes of community prescribing in Saskatchewan, the use of Paxlovid is contraindicated in this population. - Unknown whether nirmatrelvir or any components: - Adverse Effects: - From the EPIC-HR study: mild to moderate grade and are comparable to placebo - Dysgeusia (altered sense of taste) (6%) - This is the most frequent adverse effect being seen in \"real-world\" use. Tell patients to expect it so that they are prepared. - Remind patients that taste will return to normal. - Diarrhea (3%) - Hypertension (1%) - Myalgia (1%) - Vomiting - If a patient vomits, they should not retake that dose and should continue on with therapy until completion of the course. If a patient misses more than one dose, they should discontinue the therapy. - Headache - Dysgeusia (altered sense of taste) (6%) - From the EPIC-HR study: mild to moderate grade and are comparable to placebo - Drug Interactions - For guidance on drug interactions, and management by the community prescriber, see the next drop-down tab. LAST UPDATED: 20 june 2023 - Drug Interactions - Many potential drug interactions. - Some are absolute contraindications. - Some are not manageable by a community prescriber. - Some interactions require intervention and/ or modification to treatment and are manageable by a community prescriber. - Some require monitoring by the patient. - Community prescribers are advised to consult the drug interaction resources available to determine if a drug interaction is manageable, as well as guidance on how to manage the interaction. Prescribers are responsible for ensuring that drug interactions are managed appropriately and for communicating the management strategy to the patient. Prescribers may need to follow-up to ensure that any medications which are temporarily held or adjusted are appropriately restarted. - Resources available to help community prescribers manage drug interactions include: [University of Liverpool: COVID-19 Drug Interaction Checker](https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/) [BCCDC medSask [Paxlovid Drug [IDSA Management of Drug Interactions with - Lexi-Interact (available via Lexicomp or via CPS [access via [SHIRP](https://shirp.usask.ca/home)]) Natural Medicines via SHIRP) [University of Waterloo: Paxlovid - What to Know](https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/sites/ca.pharmacy/files/uploads/files/paxlovid_-_what_pharmacists_and_prescribers_need_to_know_with_appendix_june_6_2022.pdf) [University of Waterloo: Paxlovid for a Patient on a DOAC](https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/sites/ca.pharmacy/files/uploads/files/paxlovid_for_a_patient_on_a_doac.pdf) [Product Monograph](https://health-products.canada.ca/dpd-bdpp/info?lang=eng&code=101307) - Potential management strategies include: - Adjusting the dose of interacting medication. - Temporarily holding the interacting medication. - Stopping the interacting medication. - Using an alternative COVID-19 therapeutic (ie: remdesivir) or an alternative to the interacting medication. - Continuing the interacting medication with monitoring. - All patients that are cancer patients or transplant patients are not manageable at the community level or by the usual prescribers. All patients must be referred directly to their specialist or to the Early COVID Therapeutics Team. - Remember: Just because a drug in the table is deemed \"manageable\", it does not necessarily mean it is manageable for every patient. Do not forget to consider additional patient factors that affect their ability to properly manage the drug interaction, such as: - Do they understand which medication to hold or to split in half? - Can they actually split the tablet themselves? - Do they receive compliance packs which require manipulating? - Do they comprehend when to restart their medication? CYP 3A Drug Interactions Ritonavir is a CYP 3A inhibitor: - Ritonavir may decrease the metabolism of medications dependent on CYP 3A. - In those medications that require CYP 3A for clearance, elevated concentrations may occur. This could result in a serious or life-threatening reaction. - In those medications that require CYP 3A for activation, such as prodrugs, reduced concentrations may occur. This could result in a decreased therapeutic effect of the medication. Nirmatrelvir and Ritonavir are both CYP 3A inducers may increase metabolism of Paxlovid - Potential for loss of virologic response and/or resistance. Treatment failure! Natural Medicines and Herbal Products - Many products contain multiple ingredients; ensure each ingredient is assessed for a potential drug interaction. - Pay particular attention to any that involve the CYP pathway. - Prescribers will have to decide on whether the interaction is significant and/or manageable. - Natural Medicines (available through [SHIRP](https://shirp.usask.ca/home)) is a suggested resource. LAST UPDATED: 20 june 2023 - Many potential drug interactions. - General Advice/Monitoring Advice - Remind patients of measures to prevent spreading by: - Handwashing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub after contact with eyes, mouth, nose, or respiratory secretions. - Covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. - Staying at home when feeling unwell. - Wearing a mask. - Following all public health recommendations. - In most cases, individuals are infectious for 3 days prior to symptom development or positive PCR test or RAT and continue for up to 10 days after presentation of symptoms. - Note: patients with severe COVID-19 infection and immunocompromised patients may shed the virus for a longer duration. - Recommend non-pharmacologic measures and OTC treatments. - Educate patients on signs and symptoms that would indicate worsening of condition and need for medical attention; patients may progress from one severity category to another relatively quickly. Provide the patient with the medSask document [Managing COVID-19 or Flu at Home](/sites/medsask/files/2023-02/managing-covid-19-flu-at-home.pdf). - If the patient receives a prescription for Paxlovid: - Provide the patient with the [medSask Paxlovid Patient Handout.](/sites/medsask/files/2023-02/paxlovid-patient-handout.pdf) - Provide the patient with the - Remind the patient of the importance of: - Taking all tablets per dose together - Taking all doses - Advise the patient how to manage missed doses. - Remind all patients (all sexes) that they are required to use contraception or abstain from heterosexual intercourse for the duration of treatment and 4 days after completion of treatment with Paxlovid. - If the patient has not received a complete primary vaccination series or is eligible for a booster dose, encourage them to get vaccinated in the future. The patient does not need to wait for vaccination. - Patients with acute illness may receive the vaccine as soon as the acute illness has resolved. See the [medSask COVID-19 Vaccine Doses, Eligibility, and Intervals guidance.](/COVID-19_Vaccines) - Patients with acute illness may receive the vaccine as soon as the acute illness has resolved. See the Assess Benefit - Follow-up in 2 days. - Refer to emergency department if symptoms have progressed to more severe or patient is deteriorating. - If an antiviral is prescribed: - Improvement in symptoms varies amongst patients. Some patients are seeing improvements within 1 day, while others are not seeing improvement until the course is completed. - If patient is improving or not worsening, and still has mild symptoms, advise patient to continue with the medication until the course is completed and to continue symptomatic treatment as needed. - Remind patients that signs and symptoms may wax and wane, however, it is important to complete the entire course of therapy even if they are feeling better. - If the patient had a \"manageable\" drug interaction, ensure they are managing the drug as advised, such as holding the drug, monitoring, etc. - If the patient was required to hold a drug or reduce the dose, ensure the patient understands when to restart their previous dose. Assess Adverse Effects - Patient expectation is key! Remind patients to push through the adverse effects if they are mild as stated below and it is reasonable to do so. - Paxlovid is well tolerated. Side effects are comparable to placebo. - Dysgeusia (altered sense of taste) - This is the most frequently experienced side effect. Tell patients ahead of time to expect it. Remind patients that taste will return to normal once the medication is completed. - Diarrhea - Hypertension - Myalgia - Vomiting - If a patient vomits, they should skip that dose and continue on with therapy until completion of the course. If a patient misses more than one dose, they should discontinue the therapy. - Headache - Dysgeusia (altered sense of taste) - If a patient discontinues due to adverse effects, ensure it is documented on the patient follow-up. Reporting Adverse Events - Any serious or unexpected side effects should be reported to either: - Pfizer at 1-866-234-2345 For information on how to report online, by mail or by fax, see [MedEffect Canada's Web page](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/report-declaration/index-eng.php) LAST UPDATED: 09 May 2022 - Remind patients of measures to prevent spreading by: - Products Detailed information on contraindications, cautions, adverse effects and interactions is available in individual drug monographs in eCPS, Lexi-Comp, or other reliable drug monograph references.
