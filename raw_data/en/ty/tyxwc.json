Background In September 2012 a novel human coronavirus was identified in two patients with severe respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. Th e virus was later named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV). As of 26 June 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been informed of 77 laboratory - confirmed cases of MERS -CoV, 40 of w hom died due to the infection . Laboratory -confir med cases have predominately been identified in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. A small number of additional cases have so far been described in France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom . In these situations the inde x case was connected to the Middle East through travel or they were transferred outside of the Middle East for ongoing intensive care clinical management (1). Currently there is evidence of limited, non -sustained person -to-person transmission although potential exposures to a common source may also play a part. Transmission has been reported between close contacts and within family clusters in the Middle East. There has also been reports of nosocomial transmission in healthcare facilities from patient to patient and from patients to health care workers (1). In Europe and Northern Africa the known index cases have all had direct connections with the Middle East. Limited local transmission has been documented between close family contacts and nosocomial transmission has also been reported between patients (1). The current cases suggest that person -to-person transmission of MERS -CoV requires close contact, and that the virus may not be as readily transmissible or likely to develop epidemic potential as a fully adapted respiratory virus (2). However, this needs to be interpreted with caution as uncertainty remai ns about the behavior and epidemiology of the virus. For example, the full extent of geographical spread is not known and it is possible that only severe cases have been identified to date (3). The clinical presentation of MERS -CoV may include fever, cough, shortness of breath and myalgia although current working knowledge is limited and based on a small number of cases (4-6). A recent case identified in France with an initial presen tation including diarrh oea, raising the possibility of non - respiratory symptoms, especially in the immunocompromised or those with underlying medical conditions (7). Most of the cases o f MERS -CoV progressed to severe acute respiratory disease with some also developing an acute kidney injury , although it is uncle ar if this is a typical picture. Milder illness associated with MERS -CoV has also been identified (8). Despite admission to intensive care un its and the use of resource intensive measures (such as mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO] ) the case fatality rate across all cases is estimated at 59% (4,7) . MERS -CoV shares virological and epidemiological characteristics with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This has raised concerns about the potential public health impact if wider community transmission occurs (3) especially when linked with international mass gatherings, such as the annual Hajj Pilgrimage that takes place annually in the Middle East which is attended by over three million people and therefore offers the propensity for wide geographical spread (9). The SARS outbreak caused over 8,000 probable or confirmed cases and 774 deaths, in 26 countries in five continen ts. The overall mortality rate during the outbreak was estimated at 9.6%. Of greater concern is that in 2003 SARS spread from Hong Kong to Vietnam, Singapore and Canada in a number of weeks, illustrating the potential for modern day air passenger movement to substantially accelerate international spread of a novel respiratory infection (10). Unfortunately no vaccine or specific treatment is available for MERS -CoV, nor is there any prospect of either in the foreseeable future . Interim guidance for the clinical management of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) when novel coronavirus is suspected, have been produced by WHO (11). These guidelines recommend the use of supplemental oxygen therapy, empirical antimicrobials and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS -CoV) and the effectiveness of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infection s of viral aetiology: a systematic review 4 conservative fluid management for patients presenting with SARI. The guidelines advise against the use of corticosteroids or other adjunctive therapies for viral pneumonitis unless they are indicated for another reason (e.g. underlying asthma). Close monitoring of patients for signs of clinical deterioration is recommended in order to apply supportive care interventions as early as possible. Public Health England and the International Severe Acute Respiratory & Emerging Infection Consortium have recently published a decision support tool for clinicians managing cases of MERS -CoV (12). This document includes a summary review of current treatments for MERS -CoV, predominately based on expert advice and clinical experience of treating patients with severe respiratory disease caused by other viruses including SARS and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1 ). The authors report that current evidence is strongest for convalescent plasma or other therapeutics which contain neutralising antibodies (such as hyperimmune immunoglobulin) where a probable clinical effect exists f or treatment of MERS -CoV. Due to uncertainties regarding the viral replication kinetics of MERS -CoV, the authors suggest that convalescent plasma may be considered for patients w ho are deteriorating (despite other specific and supportive therapy) and in whom the virus remains detectable (12). Convalescent plasma has previously been used for the treatment of novel viruses such as 'Spanish influenza ' (1918 -19 pandemic) , 2009 influenza )pdm09) (A(H5N1)) and SARS (13-16). meta -analysis performed on literature from 1918 -19 pandemic influenza the analysis suggested that patients who presented with pneumonia and who received a transfusion with influenza convalescent human blood products may have experienced an importan t reduction in the risk of death and improve ment in their clinical condition (14). More recent studies on the use of convalescent plasma in patients with severe A(H1N1) pdm09 infection including a randomised control trial suggested that treatment with convale scent plasma may have reduced respiratory tract viral load, serum cytokine response and mortality (13,17) . A review of the treatment of SARS suggested that patients with SARS who continue to deteriorat e and were treated with convalescent plasma had a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality (18). However, this was based on a single retrospective non -randomized study where the comparator group w as formed from SARS cases treated with methylprednisolone. A further systematic review found that the studies identified were inconclusive, as the effect of convalescent plasma or intravenous immunoglobulin could not be differentiated from the effect of patient comorbidities or other treatments (19). In a number of case studies regarding SARS treatments, the authors commented that pati ents with severe presentation seemed to improve after treatment with convalescent plasma (20,21) . The current evidence base for use of convalescent plasma for respir atory viruses is therefore inconclusive and comes from different periods with varying size and quality of studies. This highlights the need for a systematic review of the literature and meta -analysis of available data , which has not so far been performed, to help inform management of MERS -CoV cases. The systematic review will be conducted according to the requirements of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) statement (22). This protocol will be registered and made available through the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/Prospero/ ). 2. Review questions The aim of this review is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of convalescent plasma , convalescent serum and hyperimmune immunoglobulin for the treatment of SARI cases with a viral aetiology, to help inform the evidence base for MERS -CoV tre atment. This will be achieved by addressing the following questions: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS -CoV) and the effectiveness of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infection s of viral aetiology: a systematic review 5 1.

The Population, Intervention, Comparators, and Outcomes (PICO) framework to inform the review objectives are as follows: Population : Human subjects of any age or either sex who have been hospitalised due to a severe acute respiratory infection of viral aetiology. This study will adopt the epidemiological case definition of SARI in accordance with surveillance guidance published by WHO/Europe (23). Subjects presenting with the following clinical conditions will be included: Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, pulmonary parenchymal disease, viral pneumonitis, viral pneumonia, acute lung injury , and acute respiratory dis tress syndrome (11) Intervention: The of convalescent immunoglobulin derived from convalescent plasma Comparators: Placebo, sham treatment, or no intervention where a comparator group has been studied. Case series or other studies with no comparator will also be included Outcomes: Mortali ty at 30 days and by study end following onset of respiratory symptoms; length of stay in hospital; rate of admission to I CU/HDU; length of stay in I CU/HDU; rate of intubation; rate and duration of non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation; rate a nd duration of ECMO and other rescue therapies for respiratory failure ; rate and severity of non -respiratory organ system involvement , sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock ; rate of hospital and I CU/HDU readmission , rate of severe disease recurrence; laboratory confirmed viral load and clearance in respiratory, faecal and blood specimens; laboratory confirmed viral antibody levels Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS -CoV) and the effectiveness of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infection s of viral aetiology: a systematic review 6 of IgM and IgG pre and post treatment, seroconversion and seropositivity rate s post treatment ; serious adverse events and i ntervention -related adverse reactions, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (24) 3. Study selection Inclusion criteria Systematic reviews with or without meta -analysis, experimental studies, observational studies, and other literature sources reporting relevant outcome data on the effectiveness of convalescent plasma , convalescent serum or hyperimmune i mmunoglobulin for the treatment of SARI cases with a viral aetiology Studies which recruited acutely hospitalised subjects of any age or sex whose clinical presentation was consistent with the WHO/Europe SARI case definition , of a viral aetiology . Symptoms or syndromes may include at least one of the following : (23) (11) o Fever, cough , sore throat or dyspn oea (including shortness of breath or difficulty breathing) o Middle East respiratory syndrome o Severe acute respiratory syndrome o Pulmonary parenchymal disease o Viral pneumonia o Viral pneumonitis o Acute lung injury o Acute respiratory distress syndrome o Opacities on imaging , pulmonary oedema (non -cardiogenic, not due to fluid overload) or poor oxygenation Studies of SARI cases with laboratory -confirmed or probable viral infection due to : o Coronavirus (including MERS -CoV and SARS) o Seasonal, avian or pandemic influenza o Adenovirus o Rhinovirus o Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) o Parainfluenza o Human metapneumovirus o Varicella -zoster virus o Measles Records reporting data pertaining to at least one of the outcome meas ures specified in the PICO framework Records published up to June 2013 Records published in the English language and other lan guages (where the available resources allow access to multi -lingual translators or reviewers ) Exclusion criteria Records reporting prophylactic interventions Records where the intervention was a monoclonal antibody (licensed or experimental) Records where convalescent plasma was used for treatment of infections other than viral infections of the respiratory system Studies conducted in animals Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS -CoV) and the effectiveness of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infection s of viral aetiology: a systematic review 7 Any systematic review with or without meta -analysis that has been superseded b y an updated evidence synthesis Two reviewers will conduct the literature search (see Appendix 1 - literature search strategy), these results will then be pooled and duplicates removed. Identified literature will be screened by two reviewers, applying the eligibility criteria using a three stage sifting approach to review literature title, abstract, and the full text. The number of papers screened out will be recorded at each stage. A PRISMA diagram will be produced and reasons for exclusion will be recorded when sifting at the full text stage. Any disagreement between the two reviewers will resolved by consensus, this may involve a third reviewer when requ ired. 4. Assessment of risk of bias and data extraction The risk of bias in the study and outcome level of selected records will be assessed using the following tools: Cochrane Collaboration tool (25) for assessing risk of bias in experimental and prospective cohort studies Newcastle Ottawa scale (26) for other observational studies (excluding prospective cohort studies) . This will be used to assess levels of confounding along with bias. The Cochrane Collaboration recommends the assessment of confounding due to the potential risk of selection bias in these studies, and importance in contributing toward s heterogeneity between studies United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality domain and element -based evaluation instrument (27) for Systematic reviews that meet the eligibility criteria Outcome reporting bias will be assessed within each st udy using the above quality assessment tools. The result of each assessment will be presented per domain or per question , in line with recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration and the PRISMA statement. Abstracts that are assessed to meet the study eli gibility criteria for inclusion will be subject to data extraction only and not assessment for risk of bias. Reviewers will be required to identify the confounding factors stated in each study, describe the methodology used to measure them, and state how s election bias was controlled through any study design specific features and methods of statistical analysis. In compliance with the Cochrane collaboration, potential confounding factors anticipated to be of importance in the review are: Demography of the study population Differences in severity and presentation Settings from which study population has been sampled The range of interventions being given to a patient at the same time as the intervention of interest Viral infection type (including virus co -infection) Underlying medical history or comorbidities Methodology used to assess study outcome measures Duration of the follow up Data extracted from records will be collected according to the PICO framework and in a predefined form which will be piloted until the final version is agreed (see Appendix 2 - data extraction form ). Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS -CoV) and the effectiveness of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infection s of viral aetiology: a systematic review 8 Data extraction and quality assessments will be conducted by reviewers that will be trained in the study protocol prior to undertaking any study related procedures. Any disagreement s between reviewers will be recorded and resolved after discussion with a third reviewer. 5. Data synthesis Study characteristics and outcome measures will be tabulated to aid narrative synthesis. Statistical analyses will be performed where feasible to produce a random -effects meta -analysis of pooled estimates of effect size (including 95% confidence intervals) . Heterogeneity will be assessed using I2 statistics . Primary narrative synthesis and meta -analysis results will be presented by vir us aetiology . Sensitivity analyses are planned to explore the robustness of these estimates throug h studying the effect of treatment by age group (particularly adults vs. children) , intervention characteristics , risk of bias and underlying meta -analysis model . Publicati on bias will be assessed for each outcome measure studied using funnel plots of effect size versus sample size for each included study (where sufficient data is available). Statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry such as those proposed by Egger or Harb ord may be conducted. A narrative approach will be used to synthesise quality assessments and extract data according to the following framework described by the Economic and social research council and recommended by the University of York Centre for Revi ew and Dissemination (28). Develop a theory of how the intervention works, why and for whom. Develop a preliminary s ynthesis of findings of included records . Exploring relationships within and between records . Assessing the robustness of the synthesis. 6. Dissemination A report will be produced and submitted to WHO Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases Department (PED). The re port will aim to be developed into a publication in a peer -reviewed journal. Presentation of the final version of this manuscript at appropriate conferences and meetings will also be considered. 7. Resource implications An Agreement for Performance of Wo rk (APW) will be drawn up between WHO and the University of Nottingham. This agreement will incorporate a budget accounting for any resources deemed necessary for the completion of the project. 8.
