While integrative medicine and holistic health approaches offer some benefits to people with depression, it is important to develop a more precise understanding of how these work in the context of socio-demographic, genetic and prescription therapies. Through this year's two-day virtual Integrative Medicine Network Forum, we aimed to create a greater understanding of depression through a cross-disciplinary dialogue rooted in scientific inquiry, multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives, and clinical innovation. We began by examining the sources of depression. Are we dealing with a problem in brain chemistry and neuroscience or a disorder of mind and spirit? We examined integrative medicine (IM) approaches to depression, how IM practitioners often distinguish between curing (fixing the broken part) and healing (achieving wholeness) and strove to address both. We discussed cultural themes in defining and managing depression and looked at cutting-edge approaches to treating depression. Watch the video recordings of the sessions below.
