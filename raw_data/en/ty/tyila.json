The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Today's prayer will be given again by our guest Chaplain, Rev. Campbell Gillon, of Georgetown Presbyterian Church in Washington, DC. ______ prayer The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer: Gracious Father, Thy word declares, ``Be still and know that I am God.'' (Psalm 46) Teach us that prayer is more a matter of attitude than audibility. Guide our praying as it seeks not to bend Thee to our will, but us to Thine. Grant us that alert, focusing stillness before the Divine which is the necessary precondition to sharing the psalmist's certainty that Thou art indeed our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. O Lord, help in trouble is what so many need. In this time of conflict, we pray for all risking life and limb as they bravely face the hazards of war in a liberating cause. We remember their loved ones and families as they strive to cope with their uncertainty and heartache mingled with supportiveness and pride as they fear the worst or face the worst. Give wisdom and guidance to those on whom the burdens of decision rest: the Commander-in-Chief, his advisors and military leadership. May the result of their actions be a liberation of the oppressed, a day of reckoning for evil and the beginning of a new chapter of peace in that region. Lord God, these are challenging times. Bless and empower the men and women of this Senate as they daily face their heavy responsibilities for the secure good of this great Nation. May they draw strength from being still before the Eternal and knowing that Thou art God. Amen. ____________________ PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Honorable Ted Stevens led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. ____________________ RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized. ____________________ SCHEDULE Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we will be voting on amendments to the budget resolution this morning. The chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee have exchanged copies of the only amendments that remain in order. We have a number of amendments to dispose of prior to a final vote on this resolution. With the cooperation of all Members, we will be able to move through the remaining amendments in an efficient and orderly manner. It would be helpful if Members would remain in the Chamber during voting. I warn Members in advance that, following the first vote, the remaining votes will be limited to 10 minutes. The practice of 10-minute votes is to allow a grace period of 5 minutes, that is a total of 15 minutes, after which these votes will be terminated. We will not extend a vote beyond that time, and thus Members should not stray far from the Chamber. As a reminder, the order entered into last Friday is that the Senate will proceed to a final vote on the budget resolution no later than 4 p.m. on Wednesday. Therefore, I advise my colleagues that we have a lot of work before us over the course of today and tomorrow. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Nevada. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the majority leader and he has graciously consented to the Senator from California speaking for up to 5 minutes as in morning business prior to our going to the budget resolution. I ask unanimous consent that that be the case. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA SERVICEMEN KILLED IN ACTION Mrs. BOXER.

Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. ____________________ CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 23, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res 23) setting forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2004 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2003 and for fiscal years 2005 through 2013. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, the managers will be here shortly. They are looking at the amendments. As I said earlier, the Democrats have developed 40 amendments and the Republicans have 17 amendments. Once we start voting on these amendments, I expect they will be rapid-fire today. Once again, I request the presence of all Senators on the floor once that voting begins. I will expect the first vote to begin close to 9:45 or 9:50. Both managers are working at this point to develop the order of those amendments as we go forward. With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 401 Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I call up Specter amendment No. 401. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 401. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To increase discretionary health spending for fiscal year 2004 by $2,800,000,000 and make an offsetting reduction in overall administrative expenses) On page 27, line 11, increase the amount by $2,800,000,000.

Mr. President, all time is yielded back. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 401. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for Mrs. Lincoln, for herself, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Pryor proposes an amendment numbered 324. Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

On page 47, line 15, increase the amount by $919,000,000. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Arkansas. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute. Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise very proudly today on behalf of the men and women who serve this great Nation as members of the National Guard and the Reserve units in all of our 50 States. We have an opportunity today to put ourselves, and I hope each of my colleagues in the Chamber will put themselves, in the shoes of these proud men and women who serve our country from the National Guard and the Reserves, to understand what it means not only when they are called up but when they are at home waiting to serve their country. Well over 20 percent of the Reserve and National Guardsmen in this country do not have health insurance when they are called up to active duty. We have to spend a tremendous amount of money simply getting them to a health condition that actually allows us to activate them and send them into harm's way. I think it is essential that this amendment be passed. I am proud to be joined by Senators Landrieu, Feingold, Pryor, Mikulski, and Kennedy. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mrs. LINCOLN. I do not think it is too much to ask of this great Nation to find them health care. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote in opposition to this amendment. I understand from the Armed Services Committee they are opposed to this amendment. This amendment portends that it would increase funding for this particular purpose, but it does not. All any amendment says is, for this one function, we will increase it. The Armed Services Committee has not requested this. The President has not requested this. As a former National Guardsman who served, one does not receive health care for basically serving one weekend a month. When they are activated, they receive health care services. This function would increase spending, as well as taxes. The cost is an estimated $7,000 or $8,000 per year per guardsman or reservist. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall vote be limited to 10 minutes on all subsequent votes and that the 10 minutes be strictly enforced. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 324. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 46, nays Boxer Breaux Byrd Cantwell Carper Clinton Conrad Corzine Daschle Dayton Dodd Dorgan Durbin Edwards Feingold Feinstein Graham (FL) Harkin Hollings Inouye Jeffords Johnson Kennedy Kerry Kohl Lautenberg Leahy Levin Lincoln Mikulski Murray Nelson (FL) Nelson (NE) Pryor Reed Reid Rockefeller Sarbanes Schumer Stabenow Wyden NAYS--51 Alexander Allard Allen Bennett Bond Brownback Bunning Burns Campbell Chafee Chambliss Cochran Coleman Collins Cornyn Craig Crapo DeWine Dole Domenici Ensign Enzi Fitzgerald Frist Graham (SC) Grassley Gregg Hagel Hatch Hutchison Inhofe Kyl Lott Lugar McCain McConnell Murkowski Nickles Roberts Santorum Sessions Shelby Smith Snowe Specter Stevens Sununu Talent Thomas Voinovich Warner NOT VOTING--3 Landrieu Lieberman Miller The amendment (No. 324) was rejected. Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I inquire from the Presiding Officer, how much time elapsed on that rollcall? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes. Mr. NICKLES. Just for the information of our colleagues, we are going to [[Page 7337]] be tightening down substantially. I don't want people coming up and being mad at Senator Conrad and myself or Senator Frist or Senator Daschle if they missed a vote, but we are going to start cutting off these votes, just for your information. I yield to my colleague to call up the next amendment. Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent there be 2 minutes equally divided on this amendment--for all of them. The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is already provided. Mr. CONRAD. I yield to Senator Baucus. Amendment No. 348 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I call up amendment 348. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) proposes an amendment numbered 348. Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To ensure that a prescription drug benefit is available to all medicare beneficiaries on an equal basis, including those who choose to remain in the current fee-for-service program) On page 61, line 12, insert ``on an equal basis with respect to benefit level regardless of whether such beneficiaries remain in the traditional medicare fee-for- service program under parts A and B of such title or enroll in a private plan under the medicare program'' after ``prescription drugs''. Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask I be notified when I have consumed 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute. Mr. BAUCUS. The administration's drug plan essentially abandons the 89 percent of senior citizens who are now on fee-for-service. How? By providing that seniors who stay in fee-for-service get catastrophic benefits and a discount card but they do not get additional drug benefits. However, if you are a senior and enroll in managed care, you are going to get a drug benefit, therefore, forcing seniors out of fee- for-service, into managed care. I might add this will also not save money. The managed care programs we have in our country are costing more than fee-for-service. They are costing more than the Federal Employees Health Benefit package. And seniors are dropping out of managed care because they are not getting the benefits they deserve. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. BAUCUS. I urge Members to vote for this amendment which provides all seniors get the same drug benefit. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. The Budget Committee should not be trying to write the prescription drug bill. Our colleague from Montana is on the Finance Committee. That is where this bill should be written. I yield to the chairman of the Finance Committee. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, obviously, like on so many issues, I happen to agree with my friends on the other side of the aisle. But where do you make this decision? You don't make it on the Budget Committee. You make it on the Finance Committee. I am committed to having a drug benefit for all seniors. We developed such a bill last year, so we have the capability of doing it. We are going to do it this year. I do not want this decision made here. I do not want to curb the freedom of the Finance Committee. I argued the same point on an issue that friends on the other side of the aisle would have agreed with me, on a Medicaid issue, that would have been in this budget that is not in the budget. Leave these issues to a committee of competence, the Senate Finance Committee. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have an additional minute, I believe? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator only had 1 minute. Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 348. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 46, nays Boxer Byrd Cantwell Carper Clinton Collins Conrad Corzine Daschle Dayton Dodd Dorgan Durbin Edwards Feingold Feinstein Graham (FL) Harkin Hollings Inouye Jeffords Johnson Kennedy Kerry Kohl Lautenberg Leahy Levin Lincoln Mikulski Murray Nelson (FL) Nelson (NE) Pryor Reed Reid Rockefeller Sarbanes Schumer Stabenow Wyden NAYS--51 Alexander Allard Allen Bennett Bond Breaux Brownback Bunning Burns Campbell Chafee Chambliss Cochran Coleman Cornyn Craig Crapo DeWine Dole Domenici Ensign Enzi Fitzgerald Frist Graham (SC) Grassley Gregg Hagel Hatch Hutchison Inhofe Kyl Lott Lugar McCain McConnell Murkowski Nickles Roberts Santorum Sessions Shelby Smith Snowe Specter Stevens Sununu Talent Thomas Voinovich Warner NOT VOTING--3 Landrieu Lieberman Miller The amendment (No. 348) was rejected. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time was spent on that vote? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes. Mr. NICKLES. For the information of our colleagues, I am going to try to tighten this down closer and closer to 10 minutes, and we are going to cut people off. I don't want people to be upset, but we are going to have to do this. We made a commitment to plow through these amendments. I told our colleagues that is what we are going to do, and that is what we are going to do. So I urge my colleagues to stay on the floor. Amendment No. 411 (Purpose: To provide a substitute) Mr. President, this next amendment is a very important amendment. It is the substitute proposal offered by my colleague, Senator Conrad. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a whole substitute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an amendment numbered 411. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of Amendments.'') Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a substitute amendment that has $1.2 trillion less in deficits than the President's plan. It also provides the funding for the war supplemental. It provides for additional funding for homeland security of $80 billion over the baseline. It provides $194 billion of additional funding for prescription drugs, which is still well short of what would be needed to give Americans the kind of coverage we, as Members of Congress, have. It provides $73 billion to keep the promise made by Congress to States on funding for that program. It [[Page 7338]] provides $71 billion for transportation infrastructure, $13 billion for veterans, and balances in 2011, as compared to the underlying resolution of balancing in 2012, and the President's budget which never balances. Colleagues, I urge you to support this substitute which is the priorities of the American people. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague for having a proposal. Last year, we did not get to vote on a Democrat alternative; today, we will. It greatly increases taxes and greatly increases spending. I call upon my colleague from Nevada. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada. Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Democrat substitute increases taxes by $1.24 trillion over 10 years relative to the budget assumptions. It increases total spending by $113 billion in 2004 over the budget assumptions and by $458 billion over the 10 years. I think there is a clear difference pointed out between our budget and this budget from a philosophical standpoint. There is only $60 billion in a growth package allowed under this budget. I think this budget does not provide for the economic growth we need to get this economy going so there will be jobs for our military people when they get home. Our budget provides for that; their budget does not. I urge a ``no'' vote on this budget. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 411.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CORPORATE TAX HAVEN LOOPHOLES (a) Findings.--Congress finds that companies are taking advantage of loopholes in the United States tax code to direct taxable income to tax haven jurisdictions, some of which have excessive bank secrecy laws and a poor record of cooperation with United States civil and criminal tax enforcement. (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should act to stop companies from avoiding paying their fair share of United States taxes by-- (1) addressing the problem of corporations that have renounced their United States citizenship (``inverted'') by relocating their headquarters to tax haven jurisdictions while maintaining their primary offices and production or service facilities in the United States; and (2) addressing the problem of Bermuda-based insurance companies that are using reinsurance agreements with their subsidiaries to direct property and casualty insurance premiums out of the United States into Bermuda to reduce their United States taxes in a way that places United States property and casualty insurance companies at a competitive disadvantage. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while young men and women are putting their lives on the line for us, for our country, some corporations are stiffing our country, renouncing their citizenship, going through phony reincor- porations in Bermuda. There are other tax haven countries, so-called inverting themselves in order to avoid taxes. This is one of the most egregious of all of the tax haven abuses that we know about--just a shell headquarters being opened, but all of the benefits of living in America continue. These corporations continue to use our roads, use our law enforcement, use our education system, and so forth. It is unfair to the taxpayers who are left holding the bag. It is unfair to U.S. competitors. It is something we ought to end. I hope we will end it today with the adoption of this amendment, particularly at a time when young American men and women are giving their all for us. It is time for Congress to get serious about closing tax haven loopholes. This amendment is aimed at closing two of those loopholes that would raise $4.7 billion over 10 years. It proposes that we take half of that $4.7 billion to reduce the deficit over 10 years and half to increase funding over 10 years for the following education initiatives: one, special education; two, after-school programs; and three, school construction and modernization grants. First, we need to stop corporate inversions, and do it in a way that will not permit those that started the inversion pretense to enjoy billions in future tax benefits that will continue to disadvantage their U.S. competitors. The companies targeted by this measure are those which have, in essence, pretended to move their headquarters to a tax haven when, in reality, their primary offices and production or service facilities remain right here in the United States. By opening shell headquarters in a tax haven, companies that got their start in this country, do most of their work here, and benefit from U.S. roads, banks, patents, computers, law enforcement, fair trade laws, its educated workforce, and much more, avoid contributing their fair share to pay for those benefits. A bill I have introduced along with Senators Reid, Durbin, and Kennedy is designed to stop this abusive practice. Last year, the Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed an almost identical bill and estimated that it would raise $4 billion over 10 years. Second, we need to close the Bermuda reinsurance tax loophole. Utilizing the U.S. tax code, a number of Bermuda-based property and casualty [[Page 7340]] insurance companies are placing American-owned property and casualty insurance companies at a severe competitive disadvantage by ducking U.S. taxes that U.S. insurers are required to pay. Through reinsurance agreements with their subsidiaries, Bermuda insurance companies operating in the United States are using their U.S. subsidiaries to send U.S. insurance premiums out of this country and into Bermuda, where interest can be earned on the premiums tax-free. By sending the premiums offshore, the U.S. subsidiary of the Bermuda parent is able to reduce the amount of its income in the United states and, accordingly, reduce its U.S. taxes. Comparable U.S.-owned insurance companies cannot operate in the same way and, as a result, operate on an uneven playing field. Legislation has been developed to correct this inequity and level the playing field for U.S. property and casualty insurers. The Joint Committee on Taxation last year estimated the bill seeking to close this tax haven loophole would produce about $700 million over ten years. These are not the only tax haven abuses we need to address; there are others. We need to eliminate tax breaks for U.S. taxpayers that do business in uncooperative tax havens that fail, in the judgment of the U.S. government, to provide information needed in U.S. tax enforcement efforts. Since the 9/11 tragedy, the importance of financial transparency and cooperative information exchange among international law enforcement agencies has increased, not only to fight money laundering and other crimes, but also to understand financial transactions that my involve tax evasion or other illegal conduct. But a handful of tax haven jurisdictions continue to employ secrecy laws that impede U.S. tax enforcement or provide lackadaisical or ineffective responses to U.S. requests for information needed in criminal and civil tax matters. Legislation has been developed that would restrict the tax benefits that a U.S. taxpayer could claim from business transacted in one of these uncooperative jurisdictions. This legislation would produce not only new tax revenues, but also a powerful incentive for the targeted jurisdictions to reform their abusive policies. The funds that would be raised by such a provision are not included in the $4.7 billion at issue in this amendment due to our inability to obtain a timely revenue estimate, but this tax haven issue--and others like it--need to be addressed. We should use half of the $4.7 billion that would be raised by closing the inversion and Bermuda reinsurance loopholes to reduce the deficit and increase our commitment to education, which has been underfunded in this budget resolution. The budget resolution proposes funding that is almost $10 billion below the 2004 amount authorized in the No Child Left Behind Act, and includes funding levels that will reduce funding for after school centers and eliminate over 40 education programs, including programs relating to rural education, school counselors and teaching standards. It also would provide no funds for school modernization and construction grants and reduced funding for Teacher Quality State Grants, resulting in fewer teachers receiving the high-quality training they need. This amendment would increase education funding by over $2 billion over ten years, and proposes that the funds be evenly divided between special education programs, afterschool programs and school construction and modernization. The increased funding for special education will help to ensure that more students with disabilities get the public education they deserve, and that school districts will have additional funds to provide needed services without dipping even further into their general education budgets. School superintendents, school board members, teachers and parents in my state of Michigan and all across America have attested to the fact that the shortfall in federal support has placed a severe strain on local education budgets. It is clear that additional resources are necessary to help provide a quality education to all special needs children. Additional funds are also necessary to support after-school programs. The development of our nation's children does not start and end in our nation's classrooms. It is important to give all children safe, enriching environments in which they can spend their time when the school day ends. Juvenile crime hits its peak after children leave school and before their parents arrive home. Between 5 and 15 million children have nowhere to go after school. Research indicates that between the hours of 3 and 7 p.m., children are more likely to engage in at-risk behavior, including abusing drugs or alcohol or engaging in sexual activity, or become the victims of crime. 21st Century Community Learning Centers provide after school educational, recreational, cultural, health and social services to youth in many communities. The additional funds in this amendment will help to ensure that we do not leave these children behind when the school day ends. We also are faced with startling statistics about the state of America's public school facilities. Record enrollments and growing communities are causing severe overcrowding in many public schools. The average public school facility in America is over 40 years old. Approximately 46 percent of all public schools lack the electrical and communication wiring necessary to utilize today's computer systems and to prepare our children for today's technologically-based society. Recent surveys by the General Accounting Office and the National Council for Education Statistics, NCES, have placed cost estimates of school construction needs between $112 billion to $127 billion. Sixty to 70 percent of Michigan's schools reported having six or more insufficient technology elements. In this Congress and the last I supported grants and school bond tax provisions for the construction, rehabilitation, or repair of school facilities. The additional funds this amendment provides will help to ensure that no student is denied access to the Internet because a school does not have the physical infrastructure to use computers or other technology. Support for this amendment indicates support for three things-- closing two egregious tax haven loopholes, increasing funding for education, and paying down the deficit. I urge my colleagues' support. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we do not rewrite the Tax Code in this bill.

Amendment No. 341 (Purpose: To increase new budget authority and outlays for National Defense (050) in order to permit phased-in concurrent receipt of retired pay and veterans' disability compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 60 percent or higher) Mr. REID. Mr. President, the next amendment in order to be called up is No. 341. [[Page 7341]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment numbered 341. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, March 20, 2003 under ``Text of Amendments.'') Mr. REID. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, over the last several years we worked hard to make veterans eligible for the concurrent receipt of retirement pay and disability benefits. Under current law, most veterans, except those who were disabled as a result of combat, are prevented from receiving the pay and benefits they have rightly earned while serving this Nation. This is something the Armed Services Committee, with Senators Warner and Levin, worked on with me last year, and we got this done. It was a big step forward, but we need to do more. My amendment adjusts the budget resolution to pay for phased-in concurrent receipt for veterans with service-related disabilities rated at 60 percent or higher. Although it is not full concurrent receipt, this one change would help tens of thousands of veterans. I hope everyone supports this most worthy amendment. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to support Senate amendment No. 341, an amendment to provide partial concurrent receipt for veterans. I would like to thank my colleague from Nevada for his unwavering and tireless support of veterans throughout the country. My constituents are aware of his advocacy for full concurrent receipt and appreciate his support. Mr. President, as you know, our current military benefits system requires disabled military retirees who have a service-connected disability to deduct their disability compensation from the funds they would otherwise receive as retirement pay. This requirement unfairly merges two distinct programs and forces many disabled retirees to forfeit a significant portion of their well-deserved retirement pay. The retirement benefit is an entitlement granted to all members of the U.S. Armed Forces who dedicate 20 or more years to providing our Nation's defenses. Disability compensation, on the other hand, is awarded as a compensation for personnel who are injured in the line of duty. I believe veterans should receive each payment separately. Allowing disabled veterans to receive their full military retired pay and disability compensation will restore fairness and common sense to U.S. military retirement policy. Last year, President Bush signed compromise legislation that provides concurrent receipt to two veterans groups: one, any retiree receiving disability compensation, of at least 10 percent, whose disability was combat-related and for which the retiree was awarded the Purple Heart; and two, any retiree with a service-connected disability rated at 60 percent or higher incurred as a direct result of armed conflict, while engaged in hazardous service, in the performance of duty under conditions simulating war, or through an instrumentality of war. Although this compromise was an important first step, it remains an insufficient remedy to a persisting inequity in our veterans benefits system. Senate Amendment No. 341 would expand concurrent receipt to include veterans who have a service-connected disability of at least 60 percent. This is another important step in what will continue to be a long battle to provide concurrent receipt to all eligible veterans--a battle that I remain committed to fighting. Again, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his leadership on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and look forward to working with them to provide full concurrent receipt for all veterans. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, last year the Armed Services Committee did a lot of good work in this field, and I compliment my colleague from Nevada and also the chairman from the Armed Services Committee and the Senator from Michigan for the great work they did last year. Concerning the pending amendment by my friend and colleague from Nevada, we have no objection to accepting the amendment by voice vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is time yielded back? Mr. REID. It is. Mr. NICKLES. I yield back the remainder of time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 341. The amendment (No. 341) was agreed to. Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield to Senator Byrd for his amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 minutes on each side on this amendment. Mr. NICKLES. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Amendment No. 412 (Purpose: To foster greater debate in the Senate and to prevent further increases in the deficit by striking the reconciliation instructions to the Committee on Finance) Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an amendment numbered 412. On page 45, strike beginning with line 20 through page 46, line 2. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my amendment will strike the reconciliation instructions to the Finance Committee that would shield the President's $726 billion tax cut from a thorough debate in the Senate. To use reconciliation to increase the deficit is an abuse of the budget process. The Budget Act framers did not contemplate that reconciliation would ever be used to produce $726 billion in tax cuts that would be financed through Social Security surpluses and an increasing debt. The Budget Act includes explicit and implicit language underscoring that the purpose of reconciliation is for deficit reduction. If the reconciliation instructions were removed from the pending budget resolution, the Senate could still pass any economic stimulus plan it chose. To limit debate on such legislation is irresponsible, particularly when the administration has not even explained how it intends to pay for the cost of the war. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. BYRD. I ask for an additional 30 seconds. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if this budget resolution passes with these reconciliation instructions included, the American people, through their elected representatives in Congress, will be denied their right to have a full debate upon the budgetary priorities of the Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and a vote to strike the reconciliation instructions to the Finance Committee from this budget resolution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Budget Act is 25 years old and 22 times [[Page 7342]] we have used reconciliation, and of that 22 times, 18 have had instructions to change, alter, or amend tax laws, change, alter, or amend programs such as Medicare, entitlement programs. We have done that. It has become an integral part of the Budget Act of the United States. Without that, you could take the Budget Act and say it is for nought. It would accomplish nothing. It would be an exercise in debating and then later on we would have as much time as we wanted on every bill. There would be filibusters on every bill and, as contemplated by the Framers, we would get no budget activity in the United States. Reconciliation includes minimum debate. Without minimum debate, nothing will be done of a budgetary nature for the United States. The Senator understands that. That is why he offers it. The budget will be a shell meaning nothing.

Mr. President, how could we in good conscience deny unemployment benefits to the long-term unemployed at the same time we are considering more than $1.3 trillion in additional tax cuts disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest taxpayer? That is exactly what this budget does. This amendment will extend and expand unemployment benefits for the millions of workers who need them. It will cost just $16 billion, about 1 percent of the cost of the tax cut. That should not be too much to ask for those families who need our help the most. More than 4 million Americans will be unemployed with no Federal benefits after June 1 under the current law. These men and women have worked hard for years, paid into the unemployment fund, and now find themselves without a job through no fault of their own. They are victims of the stagnant economy, and the economic news is not getting any better. Where is our concern for these 4 million Americans? Where is our sense of fairness? I hope Members will support this amendment. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of amendment No. 315 of which I am a proud cosponsor. The purpose of this amendment is to accommodate in the budget an extension of unemployment insurance benefits. Currently, extended unemployment insurance benefits are scheduled to expire at the end of May. Beginning June first, individuals whose regular unemployment benefits expire will no longer be eligible for extended benefits. This amendment sets aside the necessary funds, $16 billion, to extend the existing unemployment insurance benefits program for an additional 6 months. That is estimated to provide assistance to between 2 to 2.5 million working Americans who have lost their job through no fault of their own. The amendment takes the money from the proposed $1.5 trillion dollars in tax cuts. This raises the very fundamental question of what our priorities are. I am convinced that we are going to still be in very difficult shape when the current extension of unemployment insurance benefits expires at the end of May, and I think we will need to extend it. There is little chance that the labor market will significantly improve for unemployed workers between now and the end of May. There is growing evidence that the labor market is still deteriorating. The Federal Open Market Committee's most recent statement on interest rates concluded that, ``recent labor market indicators have proven disappointing.'' That is an understatement. It was reported yesterday that the 4-week average of initial jobless claims rose to a 10-month high of 429,500. Last month we lost 308,000 jobs and the unemployment rose last month to 5.8 percent. The unemployment rate is higher today than when extended benefits were first enacted in March 2002. Over 3.4 million Americans are drawing unemployment benefits today a 4-month high. It would take private sector job creation of over 100,000 per month, every month, for the next 2-years, in order for the economy to recoup the 2.5 million private sector jobs that have been lost since President Bush took office. The labor market remains weak because the overall economy remains weak. Last week the Federal Reserve released a report stating that, ``growth in economic activity remained subdued in January and February. . . . Consumer spending remained weak,'' and ``business spending was very soft, with little change in capital spending or hiring plans.'' Little change in business hiring is horrible news for would be job seekers who are caught in what the New York Times called the ``Worst Hiring Slump in 20 Years.'' And this hiring slump has been very tough on those who are of moderate means. Witness the Baltimore Sun's recent story entitled ``Jobs for poor few in a weak economy.'' You have a situation where people are unemployed: Over 8.5 million unemployed Americans, over 22 percent of which, 1.87 million, have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks, are looking for work, and can't find a job because there are no jobs to be had. This is the highest percentage--of long-term unemployed our economy has witnessed since 1992. In situations like this, the Congress has always provided extended unemployment benefits. In the last recession these benefits were provided for 29 months. During the recession before that, they lasted for 33 months. In both of those recessions extended benefits were discontinued only after a pronounced strengthening in the labor market. Today these benefits are set to expire after only 15 months, well before the labor market has improved. If this happens, it will mark not only a departure from prudent fiscal policy that has been implemented in a bipartisan fashion in the past but will also harm economic growth and hurt millions of Americans. Extended unemployment insurance benefits, already enacted by the Congress, have assisted 4.7 million workers and provided $12 billion of stimulus into the economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has testified that ``extended unemployment insurance provided a timely boost to disposable income.'' This amendment will allow for up to an additional $16.3 billion in stimulus to be provided precisely to those Americans who need it the most. In fact, that is why it is so effective as economic stimulus-- those who receive unemployment benefits, by definition, are in such a precarious fiscal position that they must spend every dollar of benefits, which are far less than what they used to earn in their previous job. The $16 billion would allow for the program not only to be extended as it is, but to provide for all Americans who qualify to receive an additional 13 weeks of benefits. This would include the 1 million workers who have already exhausted their extended benefits. These workers need help. They want to find work but cannot find a job because there are simply no jobs to be had. I know that some of my colleagues oppose providing extended benefits for more than 13 weeks to anyone. I have a differing view point. I point out that at this state of the last recession, a minimum of 20 weeks of additional Federal benefits were provided for all Americans in every State. Under normal circumstances with a growing labor market, there is a strong case to be made that providing too long of a duration of unemployment insurance benefits would be harmful. However, in times when the labor market is weak and the job base is shrinking, the situation is very different. Even Fed Chairman Greenspan acknowledged this in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, stating: ``in periods like this [a shrinking labor market], that the economic restraints on the unemployment insurance system almost surely ought to be eased.'' [[Page 7344]] In the previous recession and jobless recovery, extended unemployment insurance benefits lasted for 29 months and for much of that time provided benefits for 26 to 33 weeks. In this recession and jobless recovery, benefits are scheduled to expire after only 15 months and have provided only 13 weeks of extended benefits to the vast majority of Americans. Even if you still cling to the idea that we should have no more than 13 additional weeks, passing this amendment does not itself extend these benefits. it only allows the Senate the flexibility to address this issue when the time comes without having a budget point of order raised. The amendment sets aside the necessary funds, $16.3 billion--which I point out are more than covered by the $21 billion in the unemployment insurance trust funds today--to provide for whatever form of extended benefits the Senate should choose to pass. Hold the debate on how to structure the program until then. What we cannot afford to do today is to pass a budget that contains nothing to provide for extension of benefits which may be critically needed in only a few months time. Last year this issue was not properly dealt with, and as a result millions of Americans suffered through the holiday season believing that their benefits were going to expire. Yet when Congress reconvened, extended benefits were retroactively restored, 11 days after they had expired. Let's not put these people through this again. Let's act now and set aside in this budget the resources necessary to do the job that we, in my view, will have to do between now and the end of May. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are making good progress. I am a little concerned about bouncing around on which amendment is next. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. We have only voted on this particular amendment two or three times, maybe four or five times if you go back to last year. This would double the program from a 13-week program to a 26-week program. It would cost billions, $16.6 billion, I believe, in probably a year. According to GAO, there is $6.6 billion of an $8 billion block grant we gave to the States that they have not used. This is a very expensive amendment, in my opinion, not well thought out, not coordinated with States. High unemployment States already get up to 65 weeks in benefits under present law. This would extend it. It is very expensive. I urge my colleagues to vote no. Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, this amendment adds an additional $2 billion into our educational accounts. We already increased educational spending last week. We are increasing it here again. The practical effect of what we are doing is that we will have seen a 91-percent, or $3.2 billion, increase in Head Start as a result of this amendment and the additional amendments we passed. We will have seen over a 333- percent increase in funding in special education in the last few years as a result of this amendment and others and a 90-percent increase in funding in title I as a result of this amendment and others. With this amendment, we will have again dramatically increased the funding for both preschool and general education activities at the elementary and secondary level, and I believe we should have pretty much filled up the bucket in those accounts. Mr. President, I yield back the rest of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are prepared to take this amendment.

This is both the afterschool program and Head Start. We were going to do it separately, but to move things along I decided to combine them. This is a 10-year proposal since much of this budget proposal covers 10 years. It amounts to about $18 billion for afterschool programs and $24 billion for Head Start. As a result of this amendment, we would actually increase from 850,000 under this budget to 2.5 million the number of children who would take advantage of afterschool programs this year. Mr. President, 2,000 prosecutors and police chiefs have endorsed this amendment. On Head Start, we would go from roughly 850,000 kids to approximately 1 million, 1.2 million. That is an increase of 20 percent over the next 10 years for Head Start. We pay for it by reducing the tax cut of $1.73 trillion by about $42 billion. It is a tiny fraction of that tax cut, to serve kids in preschool and the afterschool programs. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that relevant material be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Washington Post, Mar. 23, 2003] Cutbacks to Our Children (By David S. Broder) Under the shadow of war with Iraq, the House and the Senate last week fought a series of skirmishes over the federal budget for next year. One big, overriding question was at stake: Would President Bush and the Republican majorities in Congress step up to the costs of battle, of homeland defense and of national obligations at home, or would they pass the costs on to future generations? The answer, sadly, is that youngsters yet to be born will see their choices limited and their prospects blighted by the decision of today's politicians to press ahead with an unaffordable tax cut even while the costs of war and reconstruction make earlier spending estimates wildly unrealistic. The possible doubling of the national debt in the next decade will drive up interest costs that must be paid every year--billions of dollars that will not be available for Social Security; Medicare or any of the myriad responsibilities of the government here and abroad. But the squeeze is not all prospective. Some dangerous economies are being forced this year--cutbacks that will have long-term damaging consequences for American society. This was brought home to me from an unexpected source in a group interview last week with six state attorneys general-- four Democrats and two Republicans--who were in Washington for a professional conference. Their theme was one I had heard before, not just from social workers, academics and supposed bleeding-heart liberals but from police chiefs, prosecutors and other hard-nosed denizens of the criminal justice system. It is the irrefutable evidence that the most effective anti-crime strategies--and the least expensive--are early childhood education, after-school programs and serious mentoring of youngsters who otherwise are almost certainly fated to be dropouts, delinquents and, yes, prison inmates. Larry Long, the South Dakota attorney general and a 30-year career prosecutor, put it this way. ``I can tell you that by the time kids of 12 or 14 are brought into the juvenile justice system, they are lost. All I can do is warehouse them--at huge expense. The sooner and faster we reach kids, the better the chance of their being saved.'' Long and his counterparts from Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Montana and New Mexico described what they are doing to reach vulnerable youngsters--especially those being raised by single mothers still in their teens--and to help those parents stabilize lives often blighted by drugs or other addictions. But they also confirmed that many of their initiatives are on the chopping block, as states struggle with declining revenue and runaway health care costs for the elderly. ``These are proven programs that work,'' said Montana Attorney General Mike McGrath, ``but our budget crisis is so severe we may not be able to meet the federal matching requirement''--the dollars a state must put up to qualify for a grant from Washington. That is why they express such dismay at what they are hearing out of the Washington budget proceedings. The briefing paper that all the state law enforcement officials were given by the advocacy group Fight Crime: Invest in Kids spelled out some of the cuts included in the Bush budget. Funds for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers after-school program would be cut from $1 billion to $600 million. The memo to the attorneys general says that cutback would take a half-million children each year out of a those centers, even though unsupervised youngsters make the hours from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. the peak time for serious and violent juvenile crime. The Bush budget increases Head Start funding by $148 million, just about enough to keep pace with inflation, but the program now serves only six out of 10 preschoolers who are eligible. Several other early childhood block grants and programs are ticketed for reduction or elimination. The picture is similar for other Justice Department and Education Department program aimed at preventing juvenile delinquency. ``This is so shortsighted,'' said Maine Attorney General Steven Rowe. ``For $300 billion, one-fifth the [10-year] cost of the new tax cut, we could fully fund all of these programs'' for the next decade. That kind of investment would not only save lives, the attorneys general said. It would save money. ``We are spending $75,000 a year every time we incarcerate someone under 18,'' said Delaware Attorney General Jane Brady. ``We have to jail them, educate them, counsel them and try to rehabilitate them. It would be so much better to help them while they are young.'' It's another example of the long-term costs will incur today's budget decisions. ____ [From the Washington Post, Mar. 7, 2003] The 3 to 6 Gap (By E.J. Dionne, Jr.) The phrase ``balancing work and family'' is abstract. Here's the concrete part: Kids' school schedules are out of sync with their parents' work schedules. It is plain dumb that from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, we just let kids loose. Yes, many families make heroic efforts to deal with this problem. But many others--especially in households that desperately need two incomes--are put in a terrible dilemma. Filling the 3 to 6 gap is one of our most urgent social needs, a point made regularly by law enforcement officials. Some politicians understand it, too. ``After-school programs keep kids safe, help working families and improve academic achievements,'' said the most prominent one of them all. ``They engage students in service and ensure that youth have access to anti-substance abuse programs. For America's working parents, they provide the confidence that their children are well cared for after the school day ends.'' Excellent points. President Bush made them in a letter he wrote on Oct. 4, 2002, to a group called the Afterschool Alliance. So why, exactly, has the president proposed to cut federal spending on after-school care by 40 percent? Under Bush's budget, federal spending on 21st Century Community Learning Centers would drop from $1 billion this year to $600 million next year. Rep. George Miller, a California Democrat who worked with Bush on the education bill, notes that the program now covers about 1.5 million kids. The program's advocates estimate that at least 500,000 would be affected by the cut. This cut, alas, perfectly embodies what's wrong with the way this administration is doing business. The dissonance between the president's moderate, compassionate words and his spending priorities is jarring. Moreover, the federal government is pulling away from a problem at exactly the moment when giant budget deficits are forcing states to do less themselves. In Maryland, for example, Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, has proposed cutting the Maryland After School Opportunity Fund in half, from $10 million to $5 million. Afterschool Alliance reports similar cuts in at least four other states and expects more to follow. Bush speaks constantly of making it easier for faith-based groups to get federal funds. The 21st Century program was opened to such organizations last year. Does it help faith- based groups to let them into the program and then dry up the funding? Miller is not alone in suspecting that this program was vulnerable because it happened to be one of former president Bill Clinton's more popular initiatives. ``There's obviously been a search-and-destroy mission against anything that was Clinton,'' he says. Oh, yes, Bush says we have to make these hard budget choices, but he has refused to put a price tag on the war with Iraq (it could easily run to $100 billion) and insists we need his huge tax cuts for the wealthy. Let's see: We have to cut $400 million from after-school program to pay for the elimination of the dividends tax, which will eventually cost the government $50 billion a year in revenue? Most remarkable, the administration has justified this cut as good government. It cites a recent study by Mathematica Policy Research showing, as the administration's budget documents put it, that ``the centers funded in the program's first three years are not providing substantial academic content and do not appear to have a positive impact on students' behavior.'' The Mathematica study did find some positive effects from the program, and some of its criticisms were disputed by after school advocates. But let's assume that the report was sound and that these programs would do well to beef up their academic content. That's still no excuse for using a single report as a rationale for cutting the federal [[Page 7347]] government's commitment to helping kids between the hours of 3 and 6. We need to build on the after-school experience, not retreat. And, by the way, does the administration have one standard for social programs--a little bad news and they're slashed--and another for tax cuts and, say, missile defense? To challenge these cutbacks, I nominate a good Republican known as The Terminator. Last fall, Arnold Schwarzenegger led the fight for Proposition 49 in California, a ballot measure that will eventually provide about $430 million for after- school programs. It passed with 57 percent of the vote. ``My hope is that, as goes California, so goes the rest of the nation,'' he declared. Arnold, where your priorities are concerned, your president is saying, ``Hasta la vista, baby.'' ____ [From the New York Times, Feb. 13, 2003] Heavy Lifting (By Bob Herbert) He's at it again. President Bush traveled to Nashville on Monday to talk, among other things, about compassion, which is a topic this president probably should leave alone. Mr. Bush's idea of compassion tends to send a shiver of dread through those who are disadvantaged. But there he was in Nashville at the National Religious Broadcasters convention, exhorting his audience to ``rally the armies of compassion so that we can change America one heart, one soul at a time.'' The president said religious organizations had a responsibility to assist the poor and those who are suffering, and to help alleviate the ``artificial divisions'' of race and economics. ``I welcome faith to help solve the nation's deepest problems,'' he said. If religious leaders take up the challenge they will have to do some awfully heavy lifting, because Mr. Bush's domestic policies--instead of easing suffering--are all but guaranteed to provide an ever-swelling stream of people in need of help. Everywhere you turn, support programs for the poor, the ill, the disabled and the elderly are under attack. Children's services are being battered. As Mr. Bush smiles and talks about compassion, funding for programs large and small is being squeezed, cut back, eliminated. The day after, Mr. Bush's upbeat speech to the religious broadcasters, The Times's Robert Pear revealed that the administration was proposing a change in federal law that would result in rent increases for thousands of poor people receiving housing aid. The administration has proposed a restructuring of Medicare that would curtail, rather than enhance, delivery of health services to the elderly. In the $2.2 trillion budget that Mr. Bush sent to Congress last week was an unconscionable proposal that would eliminate after-school programs for 500,000 children. In the arena of bad ideas, that one's a champion. It would result not just in hardship, but tragedy. For one thing, the peak hours for juvenile crime are 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., with the biggest, most dangerous burst coming in the very first hour after school. That is also the time of day in which most teenage girls become pregnant. Mr. Bush has proposed cuts in juvenile delinquency programs, public housing assistance, children's health insurance and on and on. He's even undermined the funding for his own highly touted school reform program, the No Child Left Behind Act. Senator Edward Kennedy, who had worked closely with the president on the school reform legislation, said yesterday, ``As soon as the Klieg lights were off and the bunting came down, the Bush administration turned its back on school reform and America's children.'' Looming over this calculated assault on programs of crucial importance to millions of Americans is Mr. Bush's colossal accumulation of tax cuts for the wealthy and an endless mountain range of federal budget deficits. The ideologues on the right are close to realizing their dream of crippling social services by starving the government of revenues. Dr. J. Lawrence Aber, director of the National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University, said yesterday: ``These cuts are tearing at what was emerging as a bipartisan consensus at the end of the last administration that the unfinished agenda on welfare reform was to create the work and family supports necessary to continue to help people move from welfare to work.'' Tip O'Neill once said of Ronald Reagan, ``He has no concern, no regard, no care for the little man of America.'' George W. Bush is making the Gipper look like a softy. Policies that affect the poor and working poor seldom get sustained attention. In an atmosphere of terror and impending war, Mr. Bush's approach to social services is getting even shorter shrift than usual. The policies he is attempting to put in place would largely overturn the notion we've had of a federal responsibility for programs to help struggling Americans. Mr. Bush would turn much of that responsibility over to the states, which are struggling with backbreaking budget problems of their own that are forcing drastic reductions in state services. The collective result would be a long-term abandonment of the most needy among us. It's difficult to square that with the idea of compassion, conservative or otherwise. ____ March 24, 2003. Hon. Christopher Dodd (D-CT), U.S. Senate. Dear Senator Dodd: The Afterschool Alliance is pleased to endorse your proposed amendment to the fiscal year 2004 Senate Budget Resolution providing the fully authorized funding level for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program. More than 15 million school aged children lack a safe, supervised place to spend their aftershcool hours-- where they can get academic support and have the opportunity to take part in art, music, athletic and other enrichment activities. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program provides critical support to communities throughout the nation to create and expand high quality afterschool programming. According to the law enforcement community, the afterschool hours are when youth are most at risk. Juvenile crime triples between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Studies show that students who have no access to extracurricular activities are much more likely to get involved with drug use and become teen parents. Beyond safety, high quality afterschool programs are helping kids learn new skills and perform better in schools. A study just released by The Afterschool Corporation reported that 84 percent of principals in New York credited afterschool programs with improved overall effectiveness of their schools. Afterschool programs are increasingly popular among parents and other community leaders. Nine out of ten voters think that all children should have access to afterschool programs. Nationally, more than 50 percent of teens wish there were more afterschool programs available as well. In other words, afterschool programs work and are popular with the people who need them most. At a time when safety is high on everyone's list of concerns, funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program should continue to grow--not be the target of deep cuts in the federal budget. The 40% cut proposed by the President in his fiscal year 2004 budget would deny 570,000 children and youth the afterschool programming they now receive. It would hurt them, their families and their communities. Support for the Dodd Afterschool/Headstart amendment is a vote in favor of kids, working families and local schools and communities. Sincerely, Judy Samelson. ____ Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, Washington, DC, March 24, 2003. Dear Senator: On behalf of the thousands of sheriffs, police chiefs, prosecutors and crime victims who constitute the national anti-crime group Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, we urge you to support amendments to the Fiscal Year 2004 budget resolution that increase funding for key investments that can keep kids from growing up to become criminals. Specifically, we urge you to support the amendment offered by Sen. Christopher Dodd to increase funding for Head Start and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers and the amendment offered by Sen. Jeff Bingaman to increase funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant by $4.6 billion over five years (to the level in the tri-partisan reauthorization bill reported out of the Finance Committee last year), as well as any other amendments supporting similar investments. As leaders on the front-line in the battle against crime, our members know that the best way to prevent crime is to invest in programs that keep kids from becoming criminals in the first place. Research and experience prove that crime and violence can be greatly reduced through quality early childhood and after-school programs. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association of the Chicago Child-Parent Centers early childhood education program found that children left out of the program were 70% more likely to be arrested for a violent crime by age 18. A study of the Quantum Opportunities after-school program showed that boys left out of the program averaged six times more criminal convictions in their high school years than the boys who attended the after-school program. Unfortunately, programs that support these types of activities are drastically under-funded. Only six in ten children eligible for Head Start can participate in the program, only one in seven eligible for the Child Care and Development Block Grant can receive subsidies, and less than 5% of eligible kids can participate in Early Head Start. In addition, 75% of the requests for 21st Century Community Learning Centers after-school grants have to be turned down due to a lack of funding, leaving more than 10 million children and teens home alone after school on a regular basis. Investing in children is the most effective investment that our nation can make in long-term growth, and will pay off in crime reduction and other benefits for years to come. These programs not only better the [[Page 7348]] lives of children and prevent crime, but also save money and help grow the economy in the long run. The Chicago Child- Parent Centers saved the public $7 for every $1 invested, and the Quantum Opportunities program saved the public $3 for every $1 invested. Please support crime-reducing amendments to the budget that will provide more families with access to quality early education and care and force fewer parents to leave their child unattended during the peak hours of juvenile crime from 3-6 p.m. If you have any questions, please contact us at 202-776- 0027 ext. 143. Sincerely, Sanford A. Newman, President. Miriam A. Rollin, Federal Policy Director. Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields time? The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in the Head Start and early education programs, we have increased those by 800 percent--800 percent--in the last decade. In this budget, we have a significant increase in Head Start. In fact, we are putting so much money into Head Start already that about 7 percent of the slots in Head Start are not even filled. We have so much money in this program, in a number of parts of this country they cannot find the kids to put into the programs. It is really inappropriate for us to fund it in a way which is excessive. We are doing a strong and effective job in the area of funding Head Start and early education programs. I hope we defeat this amendment as spending which is unnecessary at this time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back? Mr. GREGG. I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators be able to file documents supporting their amendments as we go throughout the day. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Who yields time? Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield time to the Democratic leader. Amendment No. 361 (Purpose: To fulfill the U.S. commitment to provide health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives) Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 361. The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Campbell, proposes an amendment numbered 361. Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, March 20, 2003, under ``Text of Amendments.'') Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Native Americans and Alaskan Natives have a guarantee under law and treaty that we provide health benefits to them and to their families. They are not getting it today. In fact, we are falling dramatically short of the budget required to buy them the services that they must now have. In fact, we are so short that we are now under a life or limb test. Unless your life is threatened, unless you may chance the loss of a limb, you are deferred treatment in most Indian health care facilities today. This amendment would simply provide clinical services funding for any current users--not for anybody who is currently ineligible, but only for those who are eligible today. We must provide this health care under the law. This amendment would do it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of colleagues, we were prepared to offer a second-degree amendment, but at the request of the minority leader we will not do that. I ask unanimous consent that the second-degree amendment we have prepared be eligible to be considered as an amendment on or in relation to immediately following the Daschle amendment. Mr. CONRAD. We agree to that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote against this amendment. I understand there are a lot of problems in Indian Health Service. We have some of those in my State as well. It doesn't solve it by saying we should have an 86 percent increase in growth in this function. I understand the demands and needs, but percentage-wise this is too great. The amendment to be offered by Senator Murkowski will have at least a 10-percent increase. We have increased this function by millions of dollars in the last couple of years. I understand the demand. I urge colleagues to vote no on this amendment and in favor of the subsequent amendment to be offered by the Senator from Alaska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back? Mr. CONRAD. Yes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 361. Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. [[Page 7349]] The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll. Mr. REID.

On page 42, line 15, decrease the amount by $5,840,000. At the appropriate place insert: It is the Sense of the Senate that Congress has recognized the importance of Native American health. In 1997, Congress enacted a program to spend $30 million a year on research and treatment on diabetes in the Native American community. This amount was increased to $100 million a year in 2000 and further increased to $150 million a year in 2002. This is a 500% increase since 1997. This priority focuses on prevention and treatment for a major disease in the Native American community. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado. Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Daschle for his concern about the health of American Indians. For many of us, it is not really a front burner issue on our agendas as we face the war and so many other things, but to a lot of people whose health problems are between 5 and 10 times the national average, it is very important. So I thank Senator Daschle for doing that. Unfortunately, the amount seemed to exceed what we are able to support. The amount under this amendment increases IHS by 10 percent, or $292 million, bringing the total funding for the Indian Health Service to $3.208 million for facilities and services. In addition, it includes a sense of the Senate that Congress recognizes the need for prevention and research for a major disease in the Native American community, which is diabetes. As the Chair might know, some tribes suffer a 50-percent rate of diabetes among their members. Since 1997, Congress has increased Native American diabetes research and treatment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. CAMPBELL. In closing, this is a marked improvement over what we have done. I wish it could have been more, and I do thank Senator Daschle for bringing this to the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have great admiration for the Senator from Colorado. There is no one who is more sensitive to many of these issues than is he. He has led us well in the Indian Affairs Committee. This amendment still leaves us over $2.6 billion short in providing health care services. Under the life and limb test: Your life has to be threatened or you are going to lose a limb to even walk in the front door. We are going to be $2.6 billion below that level right now if this amendment passes. That is No. 1. No. 2, this 10 percent is taken out of other Indian Health programs, other Indian education programs and other priorities. So we are really taking---- Mr. NICKLES. No. Mr. DASCHLE. One dollar out of one pocket and putting it in the pocket of the other side, and we are not accommodating the real need or real commitment in health care that is so desperately needed right now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, it is taken out of general government, not out of any health service. I do not know if a vote is necessary on this. I urge the adoption of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 416. The amendment (No. 416) was agreed to. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Amendment No. 318 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reid, Mr. Biden, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Byrd, proposes an amendment numbered 318. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To increase the level of funding in fiscal year 2004 for first responders by $3,000,000,000 (to a total of $6,500,000,000) to support their efforts to protect homeland security and prevent and respond to acts of terrorism and to reduce tax reductions for taxpayers with annual incomes greater than $300,000, and provide an additional $3,000,000,000 for deficit reduction) On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $2,100,000,000.

PROVIDING GRANTS TO SUPPORT FIRST RESPONDERS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PROTECT HOMELAND SECURITY AND PREVENT AND RESPOND TO ACTS OF TERRORISM. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that-- (1) since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our Nation has asked State and local responders (firefighters, law enforcement officers, and emergency personnel) to defend Americans as never before on the front lines in the war against terrorism; (2) on March 17, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Homeland Security Council, raised the national threat level from an ``Elevated'' to ``High'' risk of terrorist attack (Level Orange) because the intelligence community believes that terrorists will attempt multiple attacks against United States and Coalition targets worldwide in the event of a military campaign against Saddam Hussein led by the United States; (3) Level Orange indicates a high probability of a terrorist attack and requires additional precautions by first responders at public events; (4) this is the third time since the Federal Homeland Security Advisory System was created on March 12, 2002, that State and local first responders have been kept on Orange Alert, including-- (A) September 10 to September 24, 2002; and (B) February 7 to February 27, 2003; (5) notwithstanding the periods listed under paragraph (4), the Nation has continuously been at Yellow Alert (an ``elevated'' threat level declared when there is a significant risk of terrorist attacks), which has required increased surveillance of critical locations for State and local first responders; (6) the National Governors' Association estimates that States incurred about $7,000,000,000 in homeland security costs in the past year for State and local first responders; and (7) as a result of the elevated and high national threat alerts and other Federal homeland security requirements, State and local governments have been subject to unfunded Federal mandates. (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that-- (1) the funding levels in this resolution assume a total of at least $6,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 for the Office of Domestic Preparedness through the Department of Homeland Security to provide direct funds to support first responders nationwide in their efforts to protect homeland security and to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the budget resolution now provides less funding to our Nation's first responders in the next fiscal year than it does in the current one. My amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators Daschle, Reid, Biden, Schumer, Clinton, and Dayton, will increase the level of direct funding for fiscal year 2004 for first responders by $3 billion to support their efforts to protect homeland security and respond to acts of terrorism. This will bring the total funding for our State and local first responders to at least $6.5 billion for the first fiscal year. When one calls 9-1-1, they get the State and local; they do not get Washington. They need the money. We offset this by reducing tax reductions by $3 billion for taxpayers with annual incomes greater than $300,000, and we provide an additional $3 billion for deficit reduction. I hope we can support our Nation's police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel by passing this amendment. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a cosponsor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. [[Page 7351]] The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my good friend from Vermont has told us what the amendment provides in way of an increase in spending. But what he did not tell us is it increases taxes by $6 billion over the period of 2004 through 2007. It increases the spending caps and it changes the reconciliation instructions. What also is contained in this budget resolution is $28 billion in discretionary spending for the homeland security function. This amendment is aimed at one small part of the budget resolution, and it increases that account, though, by 85 percent. Today, we have received from the President a supplemental budget request for homeland security asking for an additional $4.2 billion. The administration is making a very strong effort, under the competent leadership of Secretary Tom Ridge, to have a coordinated national strategy. While this amendment is well intended and we all support the goal of strengthening our effort to deliver the safety and health assistance that is needed at the local levels, this amendment is unnecessary and the bill takes care of the problem. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 318. The clerk will call the roll The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what we have is a very unfair system on reimbursement for beneficiaries. Here is a chart that shows the national average is about $5,490 per beneficiary in reimbursement. There are 34 States below that. My State of Iowa is $3,000 per beneficiary per year; New Mexico, $3,700. You can see all these States down here; we pay the same taxes, we pay the same Medicare taxes as every other State, yet Iowa receives $4,300 per beneficiary less than the top State in the Nation. All this amendment does is it provides $25 billion over 10 years to the Finance Committee to bring up these States. It does not take from the States at the top; it only adds to the States at the bottom, and even some of the States at the top will be helped because it helps the rural-urban inequity. So some of the States at the top that have rural areas will actually benefit, but this brings up the bottom States. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. I urge our colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. This amendment doesn't do anything to help the rural areas. All it does is say let's increase, in the resolution, the amount from $400 billion to $425 billion in the area of Medicare. Under the resolution we passed, we said there would be $400 billion in the Medicare reserve fund to strengthen and enhance Medicare, improve access for beneficiaries under that program to prescription drugs and promote geographic equity payments. That was included because Senator Grassley wanted to make sure we dealt with the inequities that were just described by my friend from Iowa. We are going to address that when we take up Medicare in the Finance Committee, which is where it should be addressed, not on a budget resolution that wouldn't have the impact. When we draft a Medicare bill that we are going to have on the floor this year, we can deal with some of these inequities. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Dodd. It is an amendment that would increase the mandatory funding for childcare by approximately $900 million per year or $4.6 billion over 5 years. The amendment is paid for by lowering the amount of the unreconciled tax cuts that are contemplated in the pending budget. I emphasize, the unreconciled tax cuts. The issue is very simple. We need to at least maintain current childcare services. The Congressional Budget Office has done an estimate that determines we need to raise the level of spending to the amount called for in the amendment in order to maintain the current level of childcare services. This is particularly important in light of the fact that we have the proposal by the administration, which many of us support, to increase work-related requirements for welfare recipients. Clearly, if we are going to do that, the demand for childcare would increase. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. We have increased childcare assistance by 250 percent since 1996. We doubled the number of children in childcare programs. This budget resolution alone increases childcare assistance by 7.3 percent in the mandatory accounts, 10 percent in the discretionary accounts, for a $5 billion increase. All of this has been done while welfare rolls have dropped by 54 percent. We are putting a dramatic increase in money in fewer children who are even qualified for the money which means, as a practical matter, that we are certainly making an extra effort in these accounts. This increase is excessive in light of the amount of the increases already in the bill, which are dramatic in and of their own right. I yield the balance of my time. Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 417. The clerk will call the roll.

On page 79, after line 22, insert the following: SEC. 308. GRANTS FOR FIREFIGHTERS. It is the sense of the Senate that the funding levels in this resolution assume that under section 33 of the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974-- (1) not less than $1,000,000,000 will be used annually to provide grants to local governments for the sole purpose of hiring additional firefighters; and (2) not less than $750,000,000 will be used annually to provide grants to local governments for the purchase of firefighter emergency response equipment and training. Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is the FIRE Act. I introduced this with Senator DeWine in 1999. It became law in the year 2000. Senator Warner and I were able to get $100 million for our 20,000 fire departments across the country. One million people serve in our fire services. We had a number--about $750 million--which this budget rolls back to $500 million for these firefighters across the country for the basic homeland security issues of first responders. This amendment would restore that number to $750 million, and over 10 years it would be $1 billion a year, which is paid for by reducing the tax cut. I do not need to tell my colleagues how important this is to the million firefighters in 20,000 departments across this country. They need equipment. They need personnel. Many of their members are off in the Persian Gulf as I speak because they have been called up in the National Guard and Reserve services. These dollars would provide for new firefighters, replacements, as well as safety equipment. Two-thirds of all departments are badly understaffed and too many still do not have the basic safety equipment. This amendment allows for those numbers to be restored to the numbers we appropriated and agreed to last year. I urge the adoption of the amendment. [[Page 7355]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are all very concerned about making adequate funds available for this account, but we also have in the budget--and Senators should recognize this--$28 billion in discretionary spending in the homeland security function of the budget resolution. What the Senator from Connecticut did not let you know was--and I am sure he will be glad to admit this is the case--this amendment would cause taxes to go up. The amendment increases taxes by $23.7 billion over the period of time from 2004 to 2007. It increases the spending caps, and it changes the reconciliation instructions. We just received from the President today a supplemental budget request for homeland security in the amount of $4.2 billion. The President is giving strong leadership on this issue, trying to organize a national strategy to help not only first responders, firefighters, and others, but have a national strategy for making our homeland safer and our people more secure. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. COCHRAN. I hope Senators will vote against the amendment. Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment because it fully funds the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Act, the Byrne Grant Program, named for a New York City police officer, and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Act, by providing a respective $650 million and $400 million in funding in fiscal year 2004. In addition, this amendment raises the discretionary cap for fiscal year 2003 by $1 billion and fiscal year 2004 by $2.5 billion to provide direct homeland security first responder funding to localities and for high threat areas such as New York City through the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness. This amendment is paid for by the nonreconciliation part of the tax cut. In addition, we are still not adequately funding homeland security directly where it needs to go to the people on the front lines in our cities. Just because we now have new terrorist threats does not mean we can let our guard down when it comes to drug dealers, violent crimes, the kinds of things that we have successfully dealt with over the last decade. I ask my colleagues to cast this vote for our police officers, our firefighters, and our emergency responders. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the resolution already provides $2.1 billion for a variety of local law enforcement grant programs, as well as an additional $500 million at the Department of Homeland Security specifically for grant programs to local law enforcement entities. Under an arrangement at the Department, Governor Ridge has made clear that discretionary funds going to the States are passed through to local governments and localities. One thing the Senator did not point out was if this amendment is adopted, it is going to increase taxes by $9 billion over the period from 2003 to 2007. It will also increase the spending caps. This resolution we have before us already provides for funding for the strategy for making our homeland safer and our people more secure. I urge Senators to vote against this amendment. Mrs. CLINTON. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 418. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

RESERVE FUND TO STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY. If legislation is reported by the Senate Committee on Finance, or an amendment thereto is offered or a conference report thereon is submitted that would extend the solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may revise the aggregates, functional totals, allocations, and other appropriate levels and limits in this resolution by up to $396,000,000,000 in budget authority and outlays for the total of fiscal years 2003 through 2013. Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, cutting taxes when you have a $5.6 trillion surplus in the Treasury is one thing. Cutting taxes by $1.3 trillion--which is where we are right now--when you do not have a surplus but in fact you have a $300 billion deficit, and, added to that, we are at war and we don't know how much it is going to cost, is not good public policy. The amendment at the desk reduces the reconciled tax cut to $350 billion. It takes $120 billion of the tax cut outside of reconciliation and creates a Social Security reserve account. That Social Security reserve account will be for reforming Social Security. If we don't get around to doing it, the money will go to reduce the deficit. This amendment has a $350 billion tax cut which is [[Page 7358]] protected by budget reconciliation. The remaining funds will be used for a Social Security reserve fund. This amendment is an amendment that was previously considered by the Budget Committee, which did not pass it, and we are offering it on the floor now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is an amendment on which we voted on Friday. The amendment was defeated 62 to 38. Maybe it is another reason we should have finished the entire bill on Friday, the initial bill. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. I have a couple of comments about it. The thing that is different about it, that now there is a Social Security reserve fund, that is bogus. There is no money going into the Social Security reserve fund because on the other hand they say the money goes toward deficit reduction. It can't go into both. This amendment would cut the growth package in half. It would cut the growth out of the growth package. We need to be growing our economy. Our economy is really going through a difficult time. The President has a package that will help create jobs, put people to work, encourage investment, and encourage real growth in our economy. We need that. I am afraid if we pass this amendment, we will just be cutting it in half and end up with a package that is $323 billion of tax cuts over a total of $28 trillion over that 10-year period of time. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 420. Mr. BREAUX. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Kentucky has the next amendment. Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 413. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] proposes an amendment numbered 413. Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of Amendments.'') Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, this amendment is a much needed amendment. It repeals the Clinton tax increase on Social Security benefits that passed by one vote in 1993. Before 1993, seniors were taxed on 50 percent of their Social Security benefits if their incomes were above $25,000 for individuals and $32,000 for couples. After the increase, individuals who made over $34,000 and couples who made over $44,000 paid taxes on 85 percent of their Social Security income. These figures have not been adjusted for inflation for the past 10 years. The tax hike was unfair in 1993. It is unfair today. On the one hand, we tell the seniors to plan and save for retirement. On the other hand, we tax them for doing just that. That doesn't make any sense. We ought to repeal this tax. Some of us have been trying to undo this mistake for 10 years. The amendment would allow the Finance Committee to finally finish the job. I urge support for the amendment to end this unfair tax on seniors and their Social Security benefits. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let us be clear, the budget resolution does not make the determination for the Finance Committee on how this additional tax cut will be used. This amendment is very simple. It increases the tax cut by $146 billion. It does absolutely nothing about the Social Security tax--nothing--because a budget resolution does not make the specific determination. All we decide is what the instruction is to the Finance Committee for raising money and the Appropriations Committee to spend money. So this has absolutely nothing to do with the Social Security tax. The only effect of this amendment is to raise the tax cut $146 billion to over $1 trillion, all of it borrowed, every penny. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 413. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll. Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

[[Page 7359]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the last vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, a number of times it has been indicated that the various amendments have been to increase taxes. Let us just be clear that all the amendments heretofore have been to reduce the tax cut, not to increase taxes. I now yield time to the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Amendment No. 330 Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, amendment No. 330 is at the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper], for himself, Mr. Chafee, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 330. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, March 20, 2003, under ``Text of Amendments.'') The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Chafee, Senator Feinstein, and myself, and I thank Senator Landrieu and Senator Lincoln for joining us as cosponsors. Mr. President, if my colleagues are looking for a balanced approach to balancing the budget by 2009, this is it. If my colleagues are looking for tax cuts that would be effective immediately, this amendment does that. This amendment takes the 10 and 20 percent bracket cuts and makes them effective immediately. The estate tax exclusion is set permanently at $6 million per family. We grow the child credit. We eliminate the marriage penalty. We allow small business to expense their equipment purchasing at $75,000 for this year and for next. We pay for that by deferring further cuts in the 35 and 38.5 percent rate until we balance the budget. We also work on the spending side. We adopt the committee's increased defense numbers. We use about an $80 billion offset with the President's numbers to actually add to domestic discretionary spending. We put back in place controls that have been allowed to lapse: Pay-go controls and reinstatement controls. It is a good, balanced approach. We would appreciate your support. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while I oppose the level and distribution of funding in this amendment, it is no worse than what is in the current budget resolution, and it proposes a tax cut plan which is superior to the one before us. While it is a better alternative if it is substituted for the resolution before us, I would vote against it on final passage because it still underfunds too many of our nation's priorities. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield our time to the Senator from South Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina. Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment. This is basically the Blue Dog budget in the House. The net impact: Versus our budget, there would be an increase of $1.25 trillion over the next 10 years. The growth package goes to $50 billion. Here is the net effect. We are going to take $27.8 trillion from the American taxpayers over the next 10 years to run this Government. Mr. President, $50 billion represents .18 percent, less than two-tenths of one penny; $323 billion is about one penny on the dollar. Surely to goodness this body can afford to give 1 cent on a dollar, 2 cents on a dollar, maybe .18 of a penny on a dollar back to the American taxpayer. Do we have to keep all the $27.8 trillion? On top of that, our friends on the other side want to add $990 billion today. People are crying uncle. They need a little bit of help. We are not helping very much. I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 330. Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. REID.

Amendment No. 422 Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to consider and we will accept the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin. Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin. Mr. FEINGOLD. On behalf of myself, Senator Chafee, and Senator Carper, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Carper, proposes an amendment numbered 422. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To extend the pay-as-you-go requirement) On page 57, lines 3 through 5, strike ``as adjusted for any changes in revenues or direct spending assumed by such resolution'' and insert ``based on laws enacted on the date of adoption of that resolution as adjusted for up to $350 billion in revenues or direct spending assumed by section 104 of this resolution''. Mr. FEINGOLD. This is the pay-as-you-go amendment. We extend the pay- as-you-go system that has been in place since 1990 as adjusted for the reconciled levels just adopted in the Breaux amendment. This amendment says tax cuts or entitlement spending increases, if they are beyond the $350 billion for which the Senate just voted, do have to be deficit neutral. This is a system that has worked well since 1990. It has helped keep deficits in check. It was suspended in times of surplus, and we got ourselves into the current deficit jam. The budget resolution before the Senate, however, creates a giant exception to pay-as-you-go for everything the budget assumes. Basically, it says pay-as-you-go, but for the first $900 billion they are free, they are on the house. They are not free. We should not take money from Social Security revenues. We should not just bill our children's generation, robbing them of [[Page 7360]] their choices. We need to return to the ethic that we will pay for what we get. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his willingness to accept the amendment. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, there are bound to be a few people in this body, and probably fewer in the country, who understand pay-go. I compliment my colleague from Wisconsin. I am not sure the amendment is perfect, but I will work with him and others. I have no objection to the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 422) was agreed to. Amendment No. 421 (Purpose: To increase funding to implement the No Child Left Behind Act in 2004) Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, authorized me to yield to the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, for the next amendment. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 421 and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 421. (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of Amendments.'') Mrs. MURRAY. The amendment before the Senate stops at the No Child Left Behind Act. It is an issue this Senate supports, the House and Senate supported, and the President signed it into law, putting in new accountability measures for all public schools. There were two promises in that bill: One that would require accountability for our students; second, that we will pay for the resources so they can meet the standards we had set. The amendment before the Senate puts $2 billion from the tax cut into the No Child Left Behind Act so we can begin to follow up on the promise made by Senators in this body to the children in our country. This is an extremely important amendment as many of our States are suffering from very difficult budget crises. We cannot put on them another unfunded mandate under the guise of No Child Left Behind. This amendment makes sure we provide some of the resources that we required when we passed that bill a year and a half ago. I ask for all of our colleagues to support it. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have accepted a lot of education amendments. I believe now, after consulting with Senator Gregg, chairman of the committee, we will even be beyond the education level as proposed by Senator Conrad in last year's budget for 2004. We have no objection to this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 421) was agreed to. Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 395 Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield to Senator Dorgan for amendment No. 395. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Dorgan is recognized. Mr. DORGAN. I send an amendment to the desk for myself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Johnson, and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 395. Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To increase budget authority and outlays in Function 450 (Community and Regional Development) and Function 500 (Education, Training, Employment, and Social Security) to establish a New Homestead Venture Capital Fund to make equity and near equity investments in start-up and expanding businesses located in high out-migration rural counties and to repay up to 50% of college loans (up to $10,000) for recent graduates who live and work in such counties for five years, respectively; and to express the sense of the Senate that any economic stimulus or other revenue measure passed by Congress in the future should include tax incentives designed to address the devastating problem of chronic out-migration from rural communities in America's Heartland) On page 23, line 19, increase the amount by $260,000,000.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROVIDING TAX AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO REVITALIZE RURAL AMERICA. It is the Sense of the Senate that if tax relief measures are passed in accordance with the assumptions in the budget resolution in this session of Congress, such legislation should include tax and other financial incentives, like those included in the New Homestead Act (S. 602), to help rural communities fight the economic decimation caused by chronic out-migration by giving them the tools they need to attract individuals to live and work, or to start and grow a business, in such rural areas. Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is this amendment has been accepted on both sides. On behalf of Senator Brownback, myself, Senator Hagel, Senator Johnson, and others, we are offering an amendment that deals with the issue of outmigration in the heartland of our country and provides incentives to provide tools to those involved in economic development to try to stem the outmigration. This is an important amendment. I believe it is bipartisan. I appreciate the work of both the chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee to accept this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am thankful for the cooperation of our colleague from North Dakota. Also I wish to acknowledge the hard work of Senator Brownback. He has been talking to me about this amendment for a long time. We are happy to accept the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 395) was agreed to. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.

The Senator from New Jersey. Amendment No. 423 Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.

The Senator from New Jersey. Mr. CORZINE. This amendment which I offer today with Senators Kerry, Jeffords, Murray, Lautenberg, Clinton, Boxer, and Sarbanes, increases funding for environmental protection and natural resource conservation. Cleanup of brownfields, Superfund sites, MTBE, contaminated water supplies are a national and a bipartisan objective. These environmental challenges to public health stand as roadblocks to economic development and economic renewal across America. Addressing these issues with efficacy requires a constancy of purpose and funding. The amendment does just that. In addition, this amendment provides resources to fund parks, open space acquisition, wildlife habitat, and beach conservation. These should not be [[Page 7362]] shortchanged. They are investments in the future of America, not just for today's generation but future generations. Funding for the amendment adds $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2004 and the same amount in future years adjusted for inflation. The funding is offset by a corresponding reduction in the nonreconciled tax cut. I ask for the support of my colleagues to be sure we protect our environment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in debate last Friday we agreed to the amendment of Senators Crapo and Sarbanes which added $3.5 billion. I think that would be more than adequate. We are way over the President's budget, considering that amendment. I yield to my colleague from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, our brownfield legislation was very successful. Nothing is adequately funded, but this comes very close to being adequately funded. We put out an amendment to include the petroleum sites which doubles the scope of the brownfields program.

Mr. President, outside of the education of children, American families are most concerned about whether they have health insurance coverage. President Bush, in his budget, requested of the Congress some $89 billion. In the budget before us now, it has only $50 billion. This amendment brings the budget up to what President Bush had asked for. It makes no judgment about the form of any health insurance program. I am hopeful we can put this on our agenda and respond to an overwhelming concern of American [[Page 7363]] families. This would provide an important downpayment to make sure we had some resources to begin that process. I appreciate the fact that the chairman of the Budget Committee is willing to accept it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are very grateful to the Senator from Massachusetts for bringing this to our attention. We are supportive of the President and his budget. I know it has happened time and time again, and we welcome his support. We have no objection to the amendment. Mr. KENNEDY. I have a couple of others. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 357) was agreed to. Amendment No. 408 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey. Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 408 and ask for its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mrs. Murray and others, proposed an amendment numbered 408.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment for myself, Senators Boxer, Corzine, Chafee, Reed, Sarbanes, and Murray. In short, if we believe that polluters should pay for the contamination they cause, everybody ought to vote for this amendment. It will restate the original taxes created to support the Superfund trust fund as well as two additional taxes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. It also increases the total Federal revenues by at least [[Page 7364]] $15 billion over 10 years and will reduce the deficit accordingly. Without the tax, the general fund will have to contribute $1.5 billion to continue the Superfund Program. We cannot afford that. But we cannot abandon Superfund either. I urge my colleagues to vote for the polluter-pays approach. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, of all the amendments we have been talking about, this probably is the broadest tax increase of any of them. This is a tax increase on every business regardless of what business they are in, if their income tax shows $2 million or more. It has nothing to do with polluters. It also has a tax increase of 9.7 percent per barrel in excise oil and somewhere between 50 cents and $10 a ton in feedstocks. Right now we are getting the highest amount of cleanups and yet we have the lowest amount in the fund. It is really not needed now. This is not polluters pay. This is not a tax on polluters. This is a tax on people who do not pollute. The responsible parties are being held liable today. We had a hearing on it in our Environment and Public Works Committee. They are all being held responsible. They are cleaning up the pollution. I urge a ``no'' vote on this tax increase proposal of Senator Lautenberg. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 408. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller), is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment, offered by myself and Senator Bingaman, will restore funding for vocational education to its 2003 appropriations level for the next 10 years. The chairman's mark cuts this program by 25 percent from its 2003 level. We often talk about education, and many times we act as if every single child in this country is going to go to college and graduate school, and we do not pay enough attention or give due regard to those people who do the technical work that keeps this country going from day to day. The President has proposed a new vocational educational program which will place many new demands on the technical training infrastructure. These lofty goals deserve an adequate investment. Slashing funding by one-quarter will undermine the chances of our high schools and community colleges being able to fulfill their obligations to these students. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to cast this vote in favor of technical vocational education and to support the infrastructure in our high schools and community colleges. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. CREGG. We are now participating in the theater of uncontrolled spending. We have already added to education--we are $4 billion above where the Democratic budget was last year. We have a spending bill which is presently $8 billion above the actual appropriation level for last year. We are at a number which is 15.3 percent over what was spent last year. We have added massive amounts of money into the educational spending accounts at a level which can only be concluded as being not only reasonable but maybe even beyond our capacity to get the money out to the school districts and the people who are involved in this area. To continue to add money to these educational accounts is really the theater of uncontrolled spending. By ``theater,'' I mean in the term of show because it is not substance any longer that we are dealing with; it is simply the purposes of show. Let's try to be fiscally responsible and defeat this amendment. Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 424. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask Senator Biden be added as a cosponsor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senate will be in order. Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the cosponsors of this amendment: Senators Biden, Feinstein, DeWine, Hagel, Chafee, Smith, Jeffords, and Kennedy. My amendment would increase the foreign affairs account by $1.15 billion, using section 920 of the budget as an offset. This would restore foreign affairs spending to the amount requested by President Bush. We are engaged in a worldwide war against terrorism and a regional war against Iraq. We should grant the Commander in Chief's funding requests for the accounts that pay for our diplomats' assistance to key allies, food aid, nonproliferation efforts, public diplomacy, and other tools that will contribute to victory now and a better world later. I ask the Senate to join me in restoring the funds the President has requested. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the amendment offered by myself and my colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, to restore the international affairs function 150 account to the President's request. I firmly believe that if we are to win the war against terror and decrease global poverty, we must use every tool at our disposal to do so. At the constituent breakfasts I hold every Thursday in Washington, DC, for visiting Californians, I often ask: ``What percentage of the Federal Budget do you think we spend on foreign aid?'' The answers are fascinating and thought provoking: Some say 10 percent, others offer 15 percent, and even some think 20 percent is the right answer. My constituents are surprised--even shocked--when I tell them that, in fact, the United States spends less than 1 percent of our budget on foreign aid. That is less than half of what it was just 15 years ago and it is barely 0.1 percent of GDP. The United States spends less than $30 a year for each of its citizens helping those in the developing world, compared with a median per capita of $70 by other industrialized nations. In fact, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States in recent years ranks next to last among 21 industrialized donor countries in per capita foreign assistance. Most Americans, however, recognize the benefits of foreign aid and support a robust international assistance package. A survey conducted by the Program on International Policy Attitudes of the University of Maryland found that, on average, Americans believe that 14 percent is an appropriate percentage of the Federal budget for foreign aid. While we are far from that mark, I was pleased that President Bush announced last year before a summit in Monterrey, Mexico, an important new initiative to begin to restore the foreign aid budget to the high water mark of the cold war years and increase foreign assistance spending by $5 billion over the next 3 years In announcing the program he stated, The advancement of development is a central commitment of American foreign policy . . . We work for prosperity and opportunity because they are right. It's the right thing to do. We also work for prosperity and opportunity because they help defeat terror. I and a bipartisan group of 35 other Senators wrote to President Bush to express our strong support for his initiative and to urge him to make a substantial first commitment to that effort in his fiscal year 2004 budget request. That request, announced in February, contained $28.5 billion for the international affairs budget, including increased spending for the fight against HIV/AIDS and $1.3 billion for the proposed millennium challenge account. I was disappointed, then, that the budget resolution passed out of the Budget Committee cut $1.15 billion from the President's request and reduced funding for the millennium challenge account to $300 million. Senator Lugar and I have drafted an amendment to restore the President's request of $28.5 billion. In fact, I strongly believe that the United States should devote additional funds above the President's request to the international affairs budget. However, under the current fiscal circumstances and in the context of this budget, I understand that meeting the President's request is the best opportunity to make a statement about the importance of increasing foreign assistance. I understand that the offset used in this amendment--the function 920 account--is not ideal, but we must move forward on our commitment to build a robust international affairs budget, and the Lugar/Feinstein amendment is the best vehicle to do so at this time. Restoring the President's international affairs budget request is key to protecting our national security and our standing as a leader in the effort to reduce global poverty. The Senate, by accepting this amendment, will rise to the challenge. As the men and women of our Armed Forces prepare to go into harm's way, we are reminded once again about the serious costs--in financial and human terms--of military conflict and postwar reconstruction. We will be doing our soldiers, sailors, and airmen a grave disservice if we do not make every effort to avoid the need for such conflicts in the future. Our foreign aid budget, at a dramatically smaller cost and loss of life, can protect our national interests and the safety and security of all Americans. One of the tragic mistakes of the post-cold-war era was the fact that the United States turned its back on Afghanistan after the collapse of the Soviet Union. We shifted our attention elsewhere, and the Taliban and al-Qaida moved in. The Afghan people, especially women and girls, suffered under a brutal dictatorship and terrorist camps flourished. We are all aware of the consequences. We spent billions to remove the Taliban from power and it will cost billions more to rebuild Afghanistan. However costly an aid package would have been for the people of Afghanistan at the end of the cold war, it certainly would not have compared with the costs we have met so far. No one doubts the strength of our Armed Forces. Our service men and women are the best in the world and the military component is key to defeating al-Qaida and other international terrorist organizations. Yet our troops cannot do the job on their own and we will not win the war on terror without making use of all the tools at our disposal to provide safety and security for all Americans. By fulfilling President Bush's request and increasing the foreign aid budget, we will attack the conditions that foster terrorism in the developing world: poverty, hunger, illiteracy, and illness. Terrorists prey on the hopelessness, anger, fear, and alienation of the poor and provide an easy way out of the misery of the developing world. Foreign aid by providing education, health care, shelter, and food promotes tolerance, understanding, and political stability. Such attitudes and conditions are crucial if we are to help build prosperous democracies who will then become important allies and partners in facing a wide range of global challenges in addition to terrorism: Narcotics trafficking, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, aiding refugees, and building market economies. And we can build such allies far cheaper through a robust foreign aid budget than through costly military interventions. Foreign aid not only protects our national security, it promotes the best of America and American values and sustains our influence in the world. Simply put, it brings out the best of who we are as a people. Imagine a child in the developing world who attends a school built with American assistance, who studies textbooks purchased with American assistance, and who eats a meal provided by American assistance. How effective will the words of terrorists be on such a child? How prone to anti-Americanism will that child be? [[Page 7367]] Former German Chancellor Helumt Kohl often spoke of his memories as a child in postwar Germany, receiving soup off of an army truck from an American soldier. This is what foreign aid does: It gives hope to those who have none and shows them that Americans care. In the days and weeks ahead, we will witness the power of our Armed Forces. By passing this amendment, the Senate will demonstrate the power of American goodwill and our commitment to helping those in need and safeguarding our own interests. This is a significant first step for the United States to reclaim its status as a leader in providing foreign assistance, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration to build on this initiative. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I urge everyone to vote for this amendment. This would restore the President's number for the Millennium Challenge account. This account is very specific. It is to go for economic assistance and improvements in undeveloped countries. I think all of us know that our budget in this area is surprisingly small. We rank next to last in industrialized countries. As Mr. Lugar has so ably pointed out, the Iraq war should show us the need, indeed, is great. I hope everyone on this side of the aisle will vote to restore this $1.15 billion and offset it with the account 920. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Mr. SARBANES.

Mr. President, the budget resolution before us eliminates 46 important education programs, programs such as rural education, dropout prevention, arts education, the Carol M. White Physical Education for Progress, Gifted and Talented, Ready To Learn, the National Writing Project, Parental Assistance Information Centers, a number of them--46 programs that have been broadly supported by both the House and the Senate on the Republican and Democratic sides. These are programs that go to meet certain specific kinds of needs like rural education, where small schools do not have the wherewithal to get in grants. They do not have the economies of scale. They have specific transportation needs. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, may we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator is entitled to be heard. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what this amendment will do--it does not add any money. It simply restores these programs. It would be $2.2 billion the first year, $24 billion over 10 years, [[Page 7368]] offset by a reduction in the tax cut. All it does is simply restore the programs. I assume some of these will be restored as we go through the process. But if we don't have it in the budget, that means we are going to take it out of title I, we are going to take it out of special education, and other areas. Let's put the money in there now to pay for these programs. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as the Senator from Iowa well knows, this bill does not eliminate any programs. As the Senator from Iowa well knows, this bill sets a number, a gross number, that we will spend on education. However, what the Senator from Iowa doesn't appear to know is that this bill is already $8.1 billion above where his bill was when he reported it out of committee just 3 months ago. I am wondering why we need to continue to put money into programs to which there is a significant commitment already. It is time to bring down the curtain on this theater of spending. I yield the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller), is necessarily absent.

Strike section 104(b) Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we all know, consumer confidence is at its record lowest level in 10 years. There are 300,000 Americans who lost their jobs in February alone--2.5 million in the last 2 years. State and local governments are in trouble. Families and businesses are having trouble. We are running Federal deficits as far as the eye can see. And we are at war. My amendment tries to avoid saddling the next generations with debt by offering a $150 billion tax cut to average Americans over the course of the next 2 years, contemplating a payroll tax holiday, paid for in the outyears. It will strengthen our economy by putting money as a stimulus into the pockets of Americans now. And it does not take a dime out of Social Security or Medicare. We can give every American worker $750 this year. If you are married with children and are both working, you would get $1,500, which is more than with the Bush tax cut, without any of the negative impact in the long run. It does not raise taxes. It simply avoids going forward with the worst components of the President's proposal. It is not a tax increase; it is simply not giving the cut, which is unwise and nonstimulative and takes from our children. I hope my colleagues will support it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts would not only gut the growth package, it would gut the amended growth package, the Breaux bill. It cuts it in half. I urge our colleagues to vote no. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from New Hampshire. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. SUNUNU. I thank the chairman. Mr. President, for anyone to believe repealing a tax cut already signed into law is not a tax increase is a serious mistake. Second, this is a provision that would cut payroll taxes. To suggest that will not undermine the strength of the Social Security trust fund is also a mistake. We cannot pretend that payroll taxes do not go into the Social Security trust fund. And third, if my colleagues are really concerned about deficits, then we need to do two things: We need to encourage economic growth, and this amendment will not do that; second, we need to control spending. As my colleague from New Hampshire has made clear, we are in a theater of spending right now: increasing spending, increasing debts, and deficits. This isn't the approach we should be taking. I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 397. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller), is absent.

Amendment No. 285 (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that economic stimulus legislation enacted pursuant to the instructions contained in this concurrent resolution on the budget should include provisions to make higher education affordable) Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 285. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 285. (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, March 19, 2003, under ``Text of Amendments.'') Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, this amendment, which is a bipartisan amendment, cosponsored by Senator Biden of Delaware, Senator Snowe of Maine, Senator Smith of Oregon, Senator Bayh of Indiana, and myself is simply a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that when we come back with a tax proposal, it ought to increase the deductibility of college tuition. As you know, we worked 2 years ago and this year for the first time tuition is deductible, $3,000. It goes up to $4,000 in 2004. This amendment is a sense of the Senate, a bipartisan amendment that urges that tuition deductibility be raised from $3,000 to $8,000 in the year 2003, and from $4,000 to $12,000 in the year 2004 and the years thereafter. The high cost of tuition, we know, is a huge burden, particularly on middle-class families. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute. Mr. SCHUMER. I urge the adoption of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, as Senator Conrad and I both stated a couple times, we do not write the tax bill. That is going to be up to the Finance Committee. That being said, we have no objection and are happy to accept the amendment by voice vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 285) was agreed to. Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana. Amendment No. 426 (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on low income programs and the income tax on certain Social Security benefits) Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk for immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh], for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Lincoln, proposes an amendment numbered 426. Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. Mr. NICKLES. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue with the reading of the amendment. The senior assistant bill clerk continued with the reading of the amendment, as follows: (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on low income programs and the income tax on certain Social Security benefits) SEC. . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR LOW INCOME PROGRAMS AND THE INCOME TAX ON CERTAIN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. It is the sense of the Senate that the final budget conference report should not include any net reduction in funding below current baseline levels for programs that assist low income working families, and that repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits can be accommodated within the revenue totals and instructions of this resolution, in a manner that does not reduce the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Part A of Medicare.). Mr. BAYH. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Schumer, and Senator Lincoln. This expresses the sense of the Senate that the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits should be repealed. It is similar to the amendment offered by Senator Bunning because it accomplishes this objective in a more fiscally responsive way because it instructs the Finance Committee to accomplish this within the context of the current tax cut rather than adding to it. It helps Social Security beneficiaries, it cuts taxes, and it does so in a fiscally responsible way. I ask for its immediate adoption. Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, we already dealt with whether we should tax Social Security. I call upon my colleague from Kentucky. Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, this is an absolute zero amendment. It is a sense of the Senate, which means nothing in law. The amendment we voted on earlier had the direct effect on $146 billion which is the amount of money that would have been reduced from the tax base if we did what we said we were going to do on the Social Security reduction from 85 percent to 50 percent, with the instructions to the Finance Committee to do just that. This amendment does absolutely nothing to correct that situation. Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, the pending amendment offered by our colleague from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, proposes to create a sense of the Senate which is precatory and thus not germane. This language is not germane to the measure now before the Senate. Therefore, I raise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Mr. BAYH. To offer any language that is precatory pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sessions of that act for purposes of the pending amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays, and I thank my colleagues for their courtesy. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion of the Senator from Indiana. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

The point of order is sustained and the amendment falls. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, for the information of our colleagues, I thank all Members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, for working together. Senator Conrad should be complimented as well. We worked hard to finish the resolution under the agreement we made to finish it by 4 o'clock tomorrow, and we will finish it by 4 o'clock tomorrow. We may well finish it before 4 o'clock. I thank all colleagues for their cooperation in doing so. For the information of colleagues, we will have one additional rollcall vote tonight, an amendment by Senator Cantwell. That will be the last rollcall for tonight. We will announce the schedule tomorrow after consulting with the majority and minority leaders. But I do thank all our colleagues for their cooperation. It has been a very productive day. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield to Senator Cantwell for the purpose of offering an amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Amendment No. 382 Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 382. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell], proposes an amendment numbered 382. Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

On page 47, line 15, increase the amount by $391,000,000. Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, this is a very important amendment that would restore $678 million to workforce training programs that is vital to America in a time of high unemployment. The underlying bill basically cuts these funds and, instead, gives them to a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. What is really important for us to understand is that we have had report after report that in the Information Technology area there are more jobs to be had if we had skilled workers who had the training to work in this areas, and the same is true for the nursing and health care fields. According to the American Hospital Association there are over 126,000 openings in nursing, yet we are cutting the training programs that could retrain thousands of unemployed workers who could fill these openings. By cutting funding for workforce training, we are eliminating the opportunity for 65,000 Americans to receive training. So where do these jobs go instead, I know because I have had firsthand experience as an employer. You go find the workers and sometimes they are from overseas. So by cutting workforce training, we are sending a message that instead of retraining our dislocated and unemployed workers we would rather have the Department of Labor issue more labor certifications so that these jobs can be filled by foreigners. Please vote for this amendment to restore the funds so that the workforce level in this country will at least be at 2002 levels. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, this amendment would increase spending by $678 million. I might mention, we have $6.6 billion of $8 billion in a block grant that has not even been used yet by the States. Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Pennsylvania. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, much has been made about deficits. I just want to know what the Senate has accomplished today--I should argue, what the Democrats have tried to accomplish. As you can see from these charts, this is a list of the Democratic amendments that were voted on today. They add up to a 10-year cost of $666 billion in brand new Federal spending, for which, as you can see by these votes, the vast majority of Democrats voted. If this amendment is agreed to, at least on the Democratic side, that number will go to $675 billion in new spending over the next 10 years. Compare that to what we want to do, which is a very modest reduction in taxes over those 10 years, and you see the same spending priorities versus giving money back to taxpayers--the same amount of money. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield? We had not gotten up to $726 billion. We had it paid for until you-- -- Mr. NICKLES. Regular order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 382. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I request the yeas and nays. [[Page 7372]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.

The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Conrad and I would now like to see if we can clean up a couple other amendments that we have basically agreed to. I believe the Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, has a couple sense-of-the-Senate amendments that we are willing to accept. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Amendment No. 354 Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 354. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning funding for children's graduate medical education) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CHILDREN'S GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that-- (1) children's hospitals provide excellent care for children; (2) the importance of children's hospitals extends to the health care of all children throughout the United States; (3) making up only 1 percent of all hospitals, independent children's hospitals train almost 30 percent of all pediatricians and 50 percent of all pediatric specialists; (4) children's hospitals provide over 50 percent of the hospital care in the United States for children with serious illness, including needing cardiatric surgery, children with cancer, and children with cerebral palsy; and (5) children's hospitals are important centers for pediatric research and the major pipeline for future pediatric researchers. (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that, for fiscal year 2004, children's graduate medical education should be funded at $305,000,000. Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support my Sense of the Senate amendment, advocating full fiscal year 2004 funding--$305 million--for children's hospitals graduate medical education programs. This funding for pediatric GME is a vital part of our efforts to protect children's health. Today, children's hospitals--though they represent only one percent of all hospitals--train 30 percent of all pediatricians and 50 percent of all pediatric specialists. And, they also provide hospital care to almost 50 percent of seriously ill children. Furthermore, children's hospitals serve as the healthcare safety net for low-income children in their respective communities and are often the sole regional providers of many critical pediatric services. These children's hospitals are often the only source of many pediatric specialty services. And it is their graduate training programs that make these services possible. Funding for this training-- funding for pediatric graduate medical education--helps provide our Nation with highly qualified pediatricians, who can properly treat and care for our children when they are sick. Congress took a remarkable step when it fully funded this program in FY2002 and again in FY2003. Now, for the first time, the independent children's hospitals have the same Federal support for their teaching programs that other teaching hospitals were receiving through Medicare. It has saved many children's hospitals from being forced to reduce their physician training or cut other services. Clearly, funding for GME in children's hospitals is a sound investment in children's health and provides stability for the future of the pediatric workforce. Please join me in support of continued full funding for children's hospitals graduate medical education. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it. Mr. CONRAD. We have no objection on this side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 354) was agreed to. Amendment No. 355 Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 355. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWINE] proposes an amendment numbered 355. Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the programs authorized under the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 to improve the justice system will be fully funded at the levels authorized for each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2007) On page 79, after line 22, add the following: SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that-- (1) bipartisan efforts have led to success in the fight against crime and improvements in the administration of justice; (2) Congress steadily increased funding for crime identification technologies between 1994 and 2003; and (3) a strong commitment to improve crime identification technologies is still needed. (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the funding levels in this resolution assume that the programs authorized under the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 to improve the justice system will be fully funded at the levels authorized for each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2007. Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of an amendment that Senator Leahy and I are offering to express the Sense of the Senate that we should fund the Crime Identification Technology Act at its authorized level of $250 million through the year 2007. CITA provides State and local law enforcement with the much-needed resources to make improvements in anti-crime technology. CITA has streamlined a patchwork of Federal funding programs, giving the Department of Justice greater flexibility to make [[Page 7373]] grant awards to States and localities for their specific anti-crime technology needs. What we are talking about is DNA items. We are talking about ballistics. We are talking about all kinds of crime technology items that really go to the heart and soul of our fight against crime today. This single Federal funding stream allows States and localities to make improvements in 17 different areas relating to crime-fighting technology, including automated fingerprint background checks, ballistics testing, DNA-testing, domestic violence information systems, and automated criminal history systems. Quick and efficient access to information is crucial to solving and preventing crimes and protecting our communities. And access to state- of-the-art technology means access to information. Whether it's matching fingerprints or DNA samples or bullets from a gun, law enforcement personnel--police officers and prosecutors and scientists in crime labs--all rely on technology to do their jobs. America can no longer afford to fight 21st Century crime with 20th Century tools and technology. This amendment would demonstrate our support for giving our State and local law enforcement access to the practical tools they need to do their jobs. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Ohio for his amendment. I urge my colleagues to accept it. Mr. CONRAD. We are willing to take the amendment on this side as well. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 355) was agreed to. Amendment No. 427 Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senators Hatch and Levin. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Mr. Hatch and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 427. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that of the functional totals in this resolution assume that up to $20,000,000 from funds designated, but not obligated, for travel and administrative expenses, from drug interdiction activities should be used for drug addiction treatment programs that utilize substances that block the craving for heroin and that are newly approved for such use by the Food and Drug Administration) At the end of title III, add the following: SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS. It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals in this resolution assume that up to $20,000,000 from funds designated, but not obligated, for travel and administrative expenses, from drug interdiction activities should be used for service-oriented targeted grants for the utilization of substances that block the craving for heroin and that are newly approved for such use by the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment stating that $20 million in drug interdiction funds shall be used for drug addiction treatment programs that utilize substances that block the craving for heroin and that are newly approved for such use by the FDA. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of a bipartisan sense-of-the-Senate amendment that Senator Levin and I are offering. Here is what the amendment does: We ask that it be the sense of the Senate that up to $20 million of any unused travel or other administrative funds designated, but not obligated, for drug interdiction activities be used for a grant program that helps disseminate innovative anti-heroin medications recently approved by the FDA. Not one penny of drug interdiction funds will be taken away; our amendment only asks the Senate to go on record as supporting the use of unobligated drug interdiction travel or administrative funds to help distribute and get out the word on a new class of drug addiction treatments. This amendment builds upon the Drug Addiction Treatment Act that allows qualified doctors the ability to treat a limited number of heroin addicts in an office setting. This sense-of-the-Senate amendment will send a signal to the private sector to invest in developing new drug treatments. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Hatch and I have offered, which the Senate has adopted, is a life-saving amendment. It will help to mend broken lives and shattered families that are living with the scourge of drug addiction and are struggling to rid themselves of this dreadful disease. Our sense of the Senate amendment supports $20 million in fiscal year 2004 for drug treatment programs that utilize a newly FDA approved substance called buprenorphine, which blocks the craving for heroin. The costs of substance abuse treatment are minimal when compared to the resulting savings. According to a national study of treatment programs that are funded by HHS's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, the average savings per individual in the year after treatment was approximately $9,200--more than three times the average cost of one treatment period. Another study by the RAND Corporation found that treatment is 10 times more cost effective than interdiction in reducing societal costs of certain illegal drugs. The U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has estimated that 57 percent of those who need drug treatment do not receive it, despite its proven cost effectiveness over criminal justice approaches in reducing drug abuse and related social costs. Another ONDCP study, released in January of 2002, found that illegal drugs drain $160 billion a year from the American economy; and that the majority of these costs, $98.5 billion, stem from lost productivity due to drug- related illnesses and deaths, as well as incarcerations and work hours missed by victims of crime. The report also found that illegal drug use cost the health-care industry $12.9 billion in 1998. The $20 million assumed in our amendment pales in comparison to these sums, yet this modest funding will reap huge benefits in lowering illicit drug use, by providing funding for up to 60 new drug treatment projects, utilizing new FDA approved substances that block the craving of heroin. Again, I am pleased that the Senate has adopted our much-needed amendment. It has the potential of opening the door to tens of thousands of individuals who seek to rid themselves of their addiction to heroin, through the use of the anti-addiction medication called buprenorphine, which was approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 427) was agreed to. Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleagues. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, just before the last amendment, the Senator from Pennsylvania held up a series of charts purporting to be total spending advocated by our side of the aisle during the budget consideration. I have no idea where he got those numbers from because they bear no relationship to what has been offered on this side. No. 1, we did not offer a package of spending increases. We offered a series of amendments that were offered one at a time to increase resources for education, for homeland security, for national defense, and a series of other national priorities. Again, they were not offered as a package. [[Page 7374]] Even if one were to consider them a package, they do not add up to $675 billion or $650 billion or $400 billion or $300 billion. It is $231 billion--$231 billion--all of it paid for by reducing the size of the tax cuts being proposed by the other side. The President proposed $1.6 trillion in tax cuts. The budget resolution offered over $1.3 trillion out of the committee. It was over $1.3 trillion. The budget substitute I offered on our side reduced the deficit included in the President's budget by over $1.2 trillion. Yes, we had some additional spending, very modest. Over the 10 years, we would go to a total spending as a percentage of GDP at 19.3 percent compared to the budget resolution offered by our colleagues on the other side of 18.8 percent, so slightly more spending over the years for education, for homeland security, for national defense, and we paid for the war in our substitute. This series of charts that were held up by the Senator from Pennsylvania bear no relationship in fact to amendments that were offered today by our side. I repeat, those amendments were not offered as a package. They were offered individually. Even if you count them all, they add up to $231 billion. Again, you cannot do that either because they were not offered as a package. Many of them were defeated. So if you offer a subsequent amendment, you cannot then add that to a defeated amendment. I do not know where he ever came up with the number $675 billion because it bears absolutely no relationship to what occurred today. I thought it was important to set the record straight, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I might later go into what the amendments were. I think right now I would like to complete this day. It has been a long day, but a productive day at least, working our way through the amendments. For the information of our colleagues, I believe there are eight amendments still pending on the Democratic side. We worked through 32 amendments. We still have a few amendments pending on the Republican side. I am not sure if any of those will require a rollcall vote-- possibly one or two, maybe more, but I doubt it. So we are well positioned to complete action, as we committed to do, by 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. I thank all of our colleagues. I think the tenor of the debate was positive. I did not agree with the outcome on one or two of the amendments, but that is part of the legislative process. Amendment No. 425 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to comment briefly on my vote against Senator Harkin's amendment this afternoon. I do so because I was faced with a very difficult decision. I care very deeply about the education programs that would be funded through this amendment, programs that include afterschool programs and vocational education programs. These are critical programs in schools across my State, and I hope we find a way to fund them. But I am forced to vote against this amendment because of another concern--my concern with mounting deficits. The budget resolution brought before us includes tax cuts that total $1.3 trillion. The budget also proposes that $725 billion of these tax cuts be enacted immediately, under the reconciliation process. Two years ago, we passed a $1.3 trillion tax cut. I supported that tax cut. But those were different times. We had a surplus. We did not foresee the significant decline in revenues, or the deficits that followed. This is not the time to reduce revenues by $725 billion. It would hurt our budget and our economy. Why is $725 billion in tax cuts inappropriate at this time? The most crucial problem is that it is not paid for. The budget resolution brought before us forecasts enormous deficits for almost the next decade. Reducing revenues by $725 billion adds to the already mounting deficits. In order to prevent the passage of tax cuts that would drive up the deficit and hurt our economy, I believe that we must reduce the size of this tax cut. I joined three of my colleagues in a letter that laid out these concerns--we pledged that we would not agree to tax cuts above $350 billion. This is crucial. The Budget Committee approved $725 billion in tax cuts, and brought it to the Senate floor. Along with my colleagues, I promised to vote to bring this number down by $375 billion. In a narrowly divided Senate, it is important that both parties work together to come up with the appropriate spending and revenue targets for the budget. That is why I worked with both Democrats and Republicans. Together, we came up with a target of $350 billion for this tax cut, and we agreed that we would all stick to that number. As part of our commitment to try to reduce the size of the tax cut approved by the Budget Committee, we also agreed that we would not try to reduce the size of the tax cut below $350 billion. That means I am forced to make difficult decisions. In order to keep my commitment to a more responsible tax cut, I have to vote against funding priorities like the one presented by Senator Harkin. During tough times, we must make tough choices. I chose to commit to a responsible tax cut. A tax cut that will prevent worsening deficits that would hurt our economy. ____________________ MORNING BUSINESS Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a period for morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ LANCE CORPORAL JOSE GUTIERREZ Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true hero--to one of the first Americans to have fallen in combat in Iraq and make the ultimate sacrifice. His name: Jose Gutierrez, a lance corporal in the United States Marine Corps. He was just 22 years old. Corporal Gutierrez arrived in the United States when he was a 16 year old orphan, having left poverty-stricken circumstances in Guatemala City and a country racked by a brutal civil war. He traveled over 2,000 miles by foot, north through Mexico, in search of a better life here in the United States. Like so many immigrants, his past was soon eclipsed by his new life as an American. He was taken in by the Mosquera family of Lomita, CA. Nora and Max Mosquera had begun helping immigrant foster children when their own children had grown. ``He joined the Marines to pay back a little of what he'd gotten from the U.S.,'' Max Mosquera said. ``For him it was a question of honor.'' A tall and quiet young man who enjoyed soccer and chess, Jose learned English quickly and had plans to study architecture. He became an infantry rifleman with the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. He enlisted exactly 1 year ago, on March 25, 2002, and arrived at Camp Pendleton, CA, in early September. Corporal Gutierrez died in battle, around 4 a.m. on Friday. He was struck by enemy fire while fighting alongside fellow marines near the southern Iraqi port city of Umm al Qasr. ``He was such a good kid,'' remembered Robert Nobles, a physical education teacher at North High in Torrance, where Corporal Gutierrez graduated in 2000. I have been told that news of his death has resonated throughout Guatemala. Every major newspaper, radio and TV station carried his story. He has been portrayed as a brave and selfless young man--which he most certainly was. I have also heard that it has been difficult to locate his one blood relative, his sister, who still lives in poverty in Guatemala City. The sister is arranging to have his body sent back to Guatemala, whereas a social worker in Los Angeles, Wendy Perlera, an acquaintance of Corporal Gutierrez, wants to bring his body back to L.A. Wherever Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez is finally laid to rest--in the [[Page 7375]] country of his birth or the country which he was willing to give his life for--he will not be forgotten. Our thought and our prayers are with his family--with his sister in Guatemala and with the Mosquera family, who provided him with the emotional and financial support to pursue his dreams. The fact that he died so young--just 22--is tragic. Indeed, the loss of any young life is a tragedy. The fact that he was willing to fight-- and die--for his adopted homeland, has earned him the lasting admiration of Americans everywhere. ____________________ LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001 Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I introduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred December 8, 2001, in Valencia, CA. A Sikh liquor store shopkeeper was severely beaten by two men. The men first entered the store and asked the victim, ``Are you Osama bin Laden?'' He tried to explain that he was a Sikh and had no association with Bin Laden. The men struck him repeatedly with metal poles, causing serious head injuries. The shopkeeper managed to escape his attackers after pushing a shelf over on top of them, knocking them down. I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well. ____________________ GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the designation of March 25, 2003, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy. As in previous years, I welcome the opportunity to honor the democratic values and lasting friendship that bind our nations. Our common struggle to protect freedom and democracy at home and around the world has forged a strong partnership between Greece and the United States, a partnership which is critical to meeting today's challenges. On the international front, Greece has played an important role in Operation Enduring Freedom and is now working with its European Union partners to support the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Greece continues to be a leader in bringing stability to the Balkans and in guiding the countries of this former region of conflict toward the community of democracies in Europe. Greece has been a steadfast ally in the fight against international terrorism, responding to every request for assistance in tracking and disrupting terrorist networks. Greece has been actively pursuing security on the home front as well. In the last year, we welcomed the arrest in Greece of 19 suspected members of ``November 17,'' a terrorist group responsible for approximately 120 criminal acts over a 27-year period, including the murder of Greeks, Americans, and citizens of other countries. For too many years, this case remained unsolved and the criminals unpunished. I am heartened by the efforts of the Government of Greece to move quickly to prosecute the suspects. The authorities in Greece must now accelerate efforts to bring charges against those suspects responsible for the 1983 killing of CAPT George Tsantes, USN, who is survived by his wife, Thalia Panos; his sons George K. Tsantes, III, and Nicolas P. Tsantes; and by his daughter Stephanie Tsantes, a distinguished citizen of the State of Delaware. Prosecution of this and other such cases will, I hope, bring a measure of closure and justice to all the families of the victims of ``November 17.'' Greece is now preparing to host the Summer Olympics in 2004--a challenge under the best of circumstances, a Herculean task in today's security environment. Working with the international community, including the United States, Greece has made unprecedented efforts to provide for safe and secure Olympic Games in 2004. And it has done so with great attention to preserving its 3,000 year-old cultural patrimony, the glory of the Hellenic past and present. Greece has wisely chosen the theme ``Our Europe: Sharing the Future in a Community of Values'' to define its current term in the rotating Presidency of the European Union. In emphasizing the enlargement and transformation of the European Union, Greece will lead the efforts to create an even stronger European partner of the United States, a partner committed to protecting and promoting the fundamental values of freedom and democracy. In designating March 25, 2003, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy, we honor both a proud heritage and our commitment to continued partnership and cooperation. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today we honor the 182nd anniversary of the independence of Greece. Nearly two centuries ago a band of determined and courageous Greek patriots rose against tremendous odds to end nearly four centuries of oppressive foreign domination of their homeland. Their arduous struggle continued for 8 years, until independence was at last secured in 1829, and the first steps were taken toward the establishment of the modern Greek state. Our Founding Fathers drew heavily on the political experience and philosophy of the ancient Greeks, who first developed the principles of democratic government that vest the supreme governing authority in the people. Barely a generation later, Greek patriots turned to the American Revolution for inspiration, seeing in the success of the new American Republic the promise of their own future. For nearly 200 years, the American and Greek peoples have shared a profound commitment to democratic principles, and have worked to create societies built on these principles. The United States and Greece have stood together in every major struggle for freedom and democracy: through two devastating World Wars, and through the long decades of the cold war. Today they are joined in the fight against terrorism, notably as Greece moves in cooperation with U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to root out and dismantle the November 17 terrorist organization and bring its members to justice. Greece today is a vigorous and prosperous democracy, a solid partner of the United States, a full member of NATO and of the European Union. Currently serving as President of the EU, Greece has focused its efforts on promoting peace and stability in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. For many nations in these regions seeking to develop viable economic systems and democratic institutions, Greece serves as a model. Greece has worked hard and with extraordinary success in recent years to expand cross-cultural understanding and reduce longstanding tensions in the Greek-Turkish relationship. Indeed, in recognition of its expanding role in the world community, Greece was chosen to host the next Olympic games, which are scheduled to take place in Athens in 2004 and which will bring millions of visitors to Greece from all over the world. There is another essential aspect to the U.S.-Greece partnership: the distinctive contributions that Greek Americans have made to every aspect of our Nation's life, in the arts, in business, in science, in medicine, in scholarship. Greek immigrant families to this country brought with them the traditional values of commitment to family and church, hard work and education, and Greek Americans have carried these values forward; they have helped to strengthen and invigorate communities everywhere across the land. [[Page 7376]] Greek Independence Day is a time of celebration, and also a moment for reflection. We see the many ways in which our country and Greece are drawn together, and we see how the past and the present are joined. Thinking back to the first steps toward Greek independence, on March 25, 1821, we are mindful of the long and twisting road traveled; of the courage and sacrifice of those who have worked over the decades to make Greece the democratic and prosperous nation it is today; of the fundamental importance in our lives of the democratic institutions, first conceived and created by the ancient Greeks, that are the bedrock of our society and the guarantee of freedom for peoples around the world. Never have these institutions been more important to us. We revere and rejoice in them, and we commit ourselves once again to making them our legacy to the generations yet to come. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 182nd anniversary of Greek Independence that will be celebrated on Tuesday, March 25. It was on this day, March 25, 1821, that Greek patriots rose up against their Ottoman subjugators and began an 8-year struggle that culminated in a new Greek Republic in 1829. On this day, it is fitting that we reflect on the enormous contributions the Greek people have made to the modern world. The legacy of the ancient Greeks, in the fields of philosophy, literature, drama, sculpture, and architecture, continues to influence our beliefs, our values, and our concept of art. Our own democratic principles have their very foundation in the practices of the ancient Greece republic. Indeed, the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in the people. Greek ideology also had a profound effect on our Founding Fathers, who modeled the American Government upon the principles of Greek democracy. Thomas Jefferson studied the Greek classics in his youth and was inspired by their philosophy throughout his life, most dramatically when he crafted the Declaration of Independence. When formulating his vision for this country, Jefferson specifically referred to the integrated assertions, theories, and aims of the classic Greek world. Our admiration for Greece continues into the modern day. Greece and the United States are at the forefront of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and human rights, forging a close bond between the two Nations. We share a partnership with Greece in NATO, and our countries are linked forever by close family relationships between our peoples. Our Nation looks forward to working closely with Greece in the coming years as we examine ways to bring full peace, stability, and prosperity to all the nations of Europe and the world. As we celebrate Greek independence, we remember the history of those who sacrificed their lives to preserve freedom and democracy. We value our friendship and continuing partnership with the Government and people of Greece, and we commit to work together to provide greater opportunity and more freedoms for the citizens of the world. And we join the world in anticipating the momentous 2004 Summer Olympic Games, which will be held in Athens, the birthplace of the Olympic tradition. I am proud to join many of my colleagues as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 214 which designates March 25, 2003 ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.'' I give Greek Americans my best wishes as they celebrate Greece's independence. Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two Oregon-based humanitarian organizations that are preparing to offer aid to the Iraqi citizens who may be displaced or who are facing hardships as a consequence of Saddam Hussein's intransigence and military events in Iraq. Mercy Corps, an international relief and development organization, exists to alleviate suffering, poverty and oppression around the world. Since 1979, Mercy Corps has provided more than $640 million in assistance to 75 nations. Mercy Corps primarily works in countries in transition from war or natural disaster or in the midst of extreme economic or social transition. This group offers humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic needs, but helps lay the foundation for peace by building local capacity and a just, inclusive civil society. Mercy Corps is already mobilizing an expanded relief effort that will deliver $20 million in aid to Iraq. Relief supplies for as many as 700,000 displaced people will include crucial water, food, sanitation supplies, shelter, medical care and basic items like blankets and cooking supplies. Mercy Corps is already delivering critical medical care, shelter and reconstruction services to thousands of displaced people in northern Iraq. In addition, Mercy Corps is working with a consortium of other international partners, including the UN, to coordinate efforts to alleviate any humanitarian crisis that might arise in Iraq. Representatives of northwest Medical Teams International (NWMTI), also headquartered in Portland, are meeting this week with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to focus on the delivery and distribution of medical care, food, clean water and shelter for displaced Iraqis. Northwest Medical Teams International seeks to demonstrate the love of Christ to those in crisis by sending volunteer medical and response teams, distributing humanitarian aid, and providing community development programs and children's ministries. In particular, the organization provides assistance to vulnerable people suffering from the consequences of war, famine, epidemics, poverty, physical illness, deformities and natural disasters. Since 1979, NWMTI has sent teams or supplies to more than 40 countries. Northwest Medical Teams has a staff physician in Iraq, and three local medical volunteers will be joining him to provide life-saving aid. The agency also has $40,000 in medicines to send with the team and will send $20,000 to procure supplies locally in Iraq. The volunteers will serve thousands of displaced people at three camps as soon as the areas are secure. Northwest Medical Teams is also preparing to provide medicines, blankets and tents to large groups of Iraqis who might become displaced due to the ongoing armed engagement. Both of these organizations have had volunteers and staff working in northern Iraq since the Persian Gulf War in 1991. ____________________ ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ CHILDREN AND HEALTHCARE WEEK IN GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, many children face illnesses requiring a hospital visit. This can be a frightening experience and underscores the need to provide quality pediatric health services, while easing the stress children and their families feel. To do just that, the Greenville Hospital System Children's Hospital in South Carolina is celebrating Children and Healthcare Week the week of March 24th with a number of valuable activities. Among the scheduled events are: continuing education classes for medical residents and support staff, an awards ceremony to honor local individuals who have dedicated their lives to pediatric care, a special tribute service to honor children, and special staff appreciation activities conducted by community volunteers. Lack of quality health care should never be an impediment to the long-term success of our children, and I commend Greenville's dedication to this. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO RAYTHEON COMPANY EMPLOYEES IN LOUISVILLE Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the 262 employees of Raytheon Company in Louisville, KY, for their vital role in strengthening our Nation's defense. Americans remember the terrorist attack on the USS Cole on October 12, [[Page 7377]] 2000. On that tragic day we lost 17 of our best sailors and 39 more were injured by a small boat laden with explosives that hit the USS Cole as it was refueling in a Yemeni port. The Cole is now a symbol of our Nation's fight against terrorism to many Americans. The destroyer has since been repaired and has rejoined its fleet. The employees of Raytheon in Louisville have been working hard to prevent future attacks against our ships in the U.S. Navy and in the navies of our allies across the globe. Raytheon produces the Phalanx Block 1B Close In Weapon System. Phalanx is a rapid-fire, fully computerized radar and 20-mm gun system that is designed to prevent attacks similar to the Cole tragedy. The Phalanx protects our crews and ships by identifying and shooting down threats from small gunboats, anti-ship missiles, helicopters, floating mines, and many other threats. This week Raytheon delivered a Phalanx Block 1B system to the USS Cole as part of a U.S. Navy effort to upgrade its defense systems onboard its ships. The men and women of Raytheon work hard to produce the best system possible to protect our crews and our ships. Mr. President, I am proud of the employees of Raytheon in Louisville for continuing to give the men and women serving our country the best possible defense to protect the USS Cole and other ships against future attacks. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO EDWARD ZIGLER, PH.D. Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding public servant, and a wonderful friend and colleague, Dr. Edward Zigler, who has recently retired after 40 years as a professor of psychology at Yale University. Dr. Zigler has been a tireless advocate for children for many years, and has successfully been able to take his scientific research and apply it to society's greatest problems. Because of his expertise and his commitment to our Nation's children, he has been asked to assist every Presidential administration since the time of President Lyndon Johnson. From 1970 to 1972, Dr. Zigler was the first director of the U.S. Office of Child Development (now the Administration on Children, Youth, and Families) and Chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau. He is a true visionary leader who has transformed national and State policies in early childhood development. Edward Zigler is a Sterling Professor of Psychology, Emeritus, head of the psychology section of Yale's Child Study Center at the School of Medicine, and director of Yale's Center in Child Development and Social Policy. He is the author, co-author, and editor of hundreds of scholarly publications and has conducted extensive studies on topics related to normal child development, child psychopathology, and mental retardation. He is the founder of the School of the 21st Century, which has been adopted by more than 1300 schools nationwide. Ed Zigler is a true pioneer in the effort to promote childhood development. He is the father of Head Start and has been deeply involved with every twist and turn the program has taken over the last 38 years. He recently completed work with policymakers and the administration to revise the Head Start Program Performance Standards, establish Early Head Start for very young children and their families, and design a research agenda. He is now working with Head Start leadership to develop assessment measures and to expand comprehensive early childhood services geared toward the development of the whole child to all children not yet enrolled in school. In his ongoing role as an advisor on the Head Start Program, he has worked with several Secretaries of: Education; Health and Human Services, Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW); and Labor, including Secretary Bennett in the Reagan administration and Secretary Riley in the Clinton administration. Currently, he is on Secretary Tommy Thompson's Head Start Research Committee. The fact that his counsel has been sought consistently by both parties through the years service serves as a testament to maintain his nonpartisan focus on what research indicates is best for children. Dr. Zigler has transformed State policies for children as well as national policies. He has worked with the State of Connecticut for decades and played a critical role in the establishment of Connecticut quality school readiness programs for low-income children. He and his colleagues have repeatedly surveyed child care standards in the states as well as preschool programs to raise awareness of the importance of quality and to guide policy makers in establishing better programs. Dr. Zigler regularly testified as an expert witness before congressional committees and has served as a consultant to a number of Cabinet-rank officers. In February of 2002, he testified as an expert witness before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension in a hearing examining the science and practice of early childhood development and related policies. He was a member of the Advisory Committee on Head Start Quality and Expansion and of the planning committee for the Early Head Start program for families and children ages zero to three. Dr. Zigler is currently serving as the Honorary Chair of the National Advisory Panel for the Head Start 2010 Project. Dr. Zigler's many honors include awards from the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Society for Research in Child Development, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Academy on Mental Retardation, the American Orthopsychiatric Association, the National Head Start Association, the Heinz Foundation, and Teachers College, Columbia University. He has also received honorary degrees from Park University in Missouri and McGill University in Canada. Throughout his career, Dr. Zigler has successfully combined his commitment to scholarly research and his commitment to public service. Throughout the decades, Dr. Zigler has never lost sight of what he believed was his true calling: improving the lives of all children, particularly poor children. His greatest passion has always been helping the most underprivileged among us. I am pleased to honor him this day and to express my gratitude for all he has done and continues to do on behalf of our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. ____________________ IN HONOR OF CAPTAIN JOSEPH D. NOLAN Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise before you today to honor the life and decorated naval career of Captain Joseph D. Nolan, who passed away late last year. The journey that he and his wife Betty traveled through the U.S. Navy extended from Virginia to the shores of Korea and Vietnam, and it finally came to rest in the deserts of New Mexico. Throughout his 30 years of service Captain Nolan wore the uniform of the U.S. Navy with pride and honor, and his dedication was recognized by the Silver Star amongst many others. The quantity and quality of his service stand as a model for all Americans to emulate as this young nation enters its fourth century. Joseph Nolan's roots in my home State run deep. Joe graduated from Boston College then went on to receive his master's degree from Boston Teachers College, where his masters thesis focused on Oliver LaFarge's ``Laughing Boy.'' After graduating from the Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island, Joe was commissioned in January 1952. His first tour of duty was as CIC officer on-board the USS Preston where he received the Naval Commendation Medal with Combat ``V'' for his combat action in Korea. He continued to serve in destroyer types as Operations Officer and Gunnery Officer of the USS Cross and matriculated into the Regular Navy in August 1955. Officer Nolan assumed the role of aide to the Shipyard Commander in his first tour of shore duty at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Here, he received orders to return to sea duty as Executive Officer of the USS Snyder based in New York. Following the decommissioning of the USS Snyder, [[Page 7378]] Nolan reported to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet Operational Control Center for 2\\1/2\\ years and attended the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell AFB, Alabama throughout 1964 and 1965. Upon completion of the Air Command and Staff College, Nolan served as Senior Naval Advisor in the ``I'' Corps area of Vietnam and as Commander Task Group 115.1 in Operation Market Time. For his combat action Nolan was awarded the Vietnamese Cross for Gallantry and Legion of Merit with Combat ``V.'' Nolan assumed command of the USS New in December 1966 in Portsmouth, VA. After gaining the rank of captain, Captain Nolan was given command of the USS Halsey and later became the commanding officer of the Naval Destroyer School and then Surface Warfare Officer School, in Newport. In his final tour of duty Captain Nolan moved to Albuquerque, NM, to work for the Defense Nuclear Agency at Kirtland Air Force Base. In 1982 Captain Nolan retired after 30 years of service with the United States Navy. Proud as he was of his professional military career, Joe Nolan's life encompassed much more than his service to country; he was a man of action who consumed the works of J. Frank Dobie and Eugene Manlove Rhodes and he came to love Western art. While I am saddened by his passing and the grief it visits upon his family and friends, I am proud to stand here today and share with the Nation my regard for the truly American life lived by Captain Joseph Nolan. We are humbled by his loss but we are better for his time here on earth. ____________________ EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS The following communication was laid before the Senate, together with accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and was referred as indicated: EC-1726.

A bill to clarify the status of the Young Men's Christian Association Retirement Fund for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill of critical importance to the over 90,000 participants and beneficiaries of the YMCA pension plan. This issue affects the 656 hard-working YMCA employees in Kentucky that initially brought this problem to my attention. With its presence felt in more than 10,000 communities nationwide, YMCA is the Nation's largest community service organization. Each year YMCA employees deliver important health and social services to over 17.9 million Americans. The YMCA mission to ``put Christian principles in practice through programs that build healthy spirit for mind, body, for all'' is indeed a very noble endeavor. YMCAs serve people of all faiths, incomes, ages, and race. This generous organization never turns people away for inability to pay. YMCA's strength is in both its dedicated employees and the people they bring together through its service. Each local YMCA is tailored to the specific needs of the community in which it serves. The employees of the YMCA do God's work each day. This bill ensures that they will continue to receive the pensions they have earned and deserve. With over $3 billion in assets, the YMCA pension plan has been in place for over 80 years. The plan has always been considered as a ``church pension plan.'' There are no problems with the operation of the plan and the IRS has said it is in full compliance--with one possible exception. Generally, in order to be considered a ``church plan'' the sponsoring organization must be affiliated with a specific church. Traditionally, the YMCA has not affiliated with any one church, but has instead identified with a ``Christian affiliation.'' This bill would clarify that the plan will continue to be a ``church plan'' despite the fact that the YMCA is not limited to one specific church or religious denomination. It is important that Congress clarifies this technicality to ensure that the beneficiaries of the YMCA pension plan receive the benefits they have earned and deserve. ______ By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Biden): S. 700. A bill to provide for the promotion of democracy, human rights, and rule of law in the Republic of Belarus and for the consolidation and strengthening of Belarus sovereignty and independence; to the Committee on Foreign Relations. [[Page 7381]] Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as Co-Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I have closely monitored developments in the Republic of Belarus and informed my Senate colleagues of disturbing trends in that nation. I have met with members of this fledgling democratic opposition who, at great personal risk, dare to speak out against the repressive regime led by Alexander Lukashenka. I have met with the courageous wives whose husbands disappeared because they stood up to the regime and would not be silent. Against the backdrop of this climate of fear, the powers of the state have been brought to bear against independent journalists, trade unionists, and other voices of dissent. Increasingly, Belarus has been driven into self-imposed isolation under Lukashenka devoid of legitimate leadership or accountability. A little over a year ago I addressed the Senate to voice concern over reported arms deals between the regime and rouge states, including Iraq. It appears that such sales have taken on greater importance as the Belarusian economy spirals downward. While some might be tempted to dismiss Belarus as an anomaly, the stakes are too high and the costs too great to ignore. Accordingly, today, I am introducing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2003, which is designed to help put an end to repression and human rights violations in Belarus and to promote Belarus' entry into a democratic Euro- Atlantic community of nations. As a participating State in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, Belarus has accepted a series of norms in the areas of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. As Europe's last dictator, Lukashenka continues to brashly trample the fundamental rights of his own people and their culture. As I alluded to earlier, independent media, non-governmental organizations, trade unions and the democratic opposition have had to operate under extremely difficult conditions, often facing serious mistreatment and an orchestrated campaign of harassment. Despite the repressions there are courageous individuals who support democracy have not been silenced. Two weeks ago, for example, Alexander Yarashuk, the leader of the Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions, called on Lukashenka to immediately cease backing Saddam. Moreover, just last week, on March 12, thousands gathered peacefully in a central Minsk square to protest deteriorating economic and social conditions in Belarus. Four of the rally's organizers--Andrei Sannikov, Ludmila Gryaznova, Dmitry Bondarenko and Leonid Malakhov--were given 15 day jail sentences for ``participation in unauthorized mass actions.'' Despite calls for change within Belarus, and considerable prodding from the international community, Lukashenka has shown no desire to deviate from his path of authoritarianism and personal profit at the expense of his own people. A few months ago, Lukashenka, who effectively controls the Belarusian parliament, signed into law a new, repressive religion law. Local elections held earlier this month followed the pattern of Belarus' 2000 parliamentary and 2001 presidential elections--they were a joke. Control of election commissions, denials of registration for opposition candidates, ``early voting'' and outright falsifications were the norm. The Belarus Democracy Act of 2003 would authorize additional assistance for democracy-building activities such as support for NGOs, independent media, including radio and television broadcasting to Belarus, and international exchanges. It also encourages free and fair parliamentary elections, which have been notably absent in Belarus. This bill would also deny high-ranking officials of the Lukashenka regime entry into the United States. Additionally, strategic exports to the Belarusian Government would be prohibited, as well as U.S. Government financing except for humanitarian goods and agricultural or medical products. The U.S. executive directors of the international financial institutions would be encouraged to vote against financial assistance to the Government of Belarus except for loans and assistance for humanitarian needs. The bill would also require reports from the President concerning the sale of delivery of weapons or weapons-related technologies from Belarus to rouge states, including Iraq and North Korea. I am very pleased that the Ranking Member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator Biden, is an original cosponsor of this measure. His support will ensure that we proceed on a bipartisan basis as we work to ensure the timely adoption and implementation of this legislation. The goal of the Belarus Democracy Act is to assist Belarus in becoming a genuine European state, in which respect for human rights and democracy is the norm and in which the long-suffering Belarusian people are able to overcome the legacy of dictatorship--past and present. Adoption and implementation of the Belarus Democracy Act will offer a ray of hope that the current period of political, economic and social stagnation will indeed end. The people of Belarus deserve a chance for a brighter future free of repression and fear. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Belarus Democracy Act be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 700 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Belarus Democracy Act of 2003''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The United States supports the promotion of democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law in the Republic of Belarus consistent with its commitments as a participating state of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). (2) The United States has a vital interest in the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Belarus and its integration into the European community of democracies. (3) The last parliamentary election in Belarus deemed to be free and fair by the international community was conducted in 1995 from which emerged the 13th Supreme Soviet whose democratically and constitutionally derived authorities and powers have been usurped by the authoritarian regime of Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenka. (4) In November 1996, Lukashenka orchestrated an illegal and unconstitutional referendum that enabled him to impose a new constitution, abolish the duly-elected parliament, the 13th Supreme Soviet, install a largely powerless National Assembly, and extend his term of office to 2001. (5) In May 1999, democratic forces in Belarus challenged Lukashenka's unconstitutional extension of his presidential term by staging alternative presidential elections which were met with repression. (6) Democratic forces in Belarus have organized peaceful demonstrations against the Lukashenka regime in cities and towns throughout Belarus which led to beatings, mass arrests, and extended incarcerations. (7) Victor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovsky, and Yuri Zakharenka, who have been leaders and supporters of the democratic forces in Belarus, and Dmitry Zavadsky, a journalist known for his critical reporting in Belarus, have disappeared and are presumed dead. (8) Former Belarus Government officials have come forward with credible allegations and evidence that top officials of the Lukashenka regime were involved in the disappearances. (9) The Lukashenka regime systematically harasses and represses the independent media and independent trade unions, imprisons independent journalists, and actively suppresses freedom of speech and expression. (10) The Lukashenka regime harasses the autocephalic Belarusian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Jewish community, the Hindu Lights of Kalyasa community, evangelical Protestant churches (such as Baptist and Pentecostal groups), and other minority religious groups. (11) The Law on Religious Freedom and Religious Organizations, passed by the National Assembly and signed by Lukashenka on October 31, 2002, establishes one of the most repressive legal regimes in the OSCE region, severely limiting religious freedom and placing excessively burdensome government controls on religious practice. (12) The United States, the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Parliamentary Assembly, and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly have not recognized the National Assembly. (13) The parliamentary elections of October 15, 2000, conducted in the absence of a democratic election law, were illegitimate, unconstitutional, and plagued by violent [[Page 7382]] human rights abuses committed by the Lukashenka regime, and have been determined by the OSCE to be nondemocratic. (14) The presidential election of September 9, 2001, was determined by the OSCE and other observers to be fundamentally unfair, to have failed to meet OSCE commitments for democratic elections formulated in the 1990 Copenhagen Document, and to have featured significant and abusive misconduct by the Lukashenka regime, including-- (A) the harassment, arrest, and imprisonment of opposition members; (B) the denial of equal and fair access by opposition candidates to state-controlled media; (C) the seizure of equipment and property of independent nongovernmental organizations and press organizations, and the harassment of their staff and management; (D) voting and vote counting procedures that were not transparent; and (E) a campaign of intimidation directed against opposition activists, domestic election observation organizations, and opposition and independent media, and a libelous media campaign against international observers.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage contributions of capital gain real property made for conservation purposes; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I re-introduced the Rural Heritage Conservation Act, along with my good friend Senator Grassley from Iowa. I would like to say a few words about why this bill is so important to my home state of Montana and to the Nation. We are losing precious agricultural and ranch lands at a record pace. Farming and ranching are the backbone of my state, comprising the largest sector of my state's economy. Not only do these farms and ranches provide Montana and the Nation with the highest quality food and fiber, they also provide wildlife habitat, open space and peace of mind. It is imperative that we help our hard-working farmers and ranchers preserve this precious heritage and their way-of-life. Conservation easements have been tremendously successful in preserving open space and wildlife habitat. Unfortunately, the way current tax law is structured makes it difficult for farmers and ranchers, who generally don't have much income, to take advantage of the tax benefits associated with donating conservation easements. They've been left behind by this important conservation tool. That's why I introduced the Rural Heritage Conservation Act. My bill will provide targeted income tax relief to small farmers and ranchers who wish to make a charitable contribution of a qualified conservation easement. The Rural Heritage Conservation Act would allow eligible farmers and ranchers to increase the amounts of deduction that may be taken currently for charitable contributions of qualified conservation easements by raising the Adjusted Gross Income limitations to 100 percent and extending the carryover period from 5 years to 15 years. In the case of all of the landowners, the AGI limitation would be raised from 30 percent to 50 percent. This is a win-win situation--farmers and ranchers will be able to preserve their important agricultural and ranching lands for future generations, while continuing to operate their businesses and stay on their land. It's a purely voluntary, incentive-based way to promote conservation. It will allow us to bring people together. Landowners, conservationists, the federal government, and local communities all can work together to preserve our precious natural resources. This legislation is vitally important to Montana, and to every other state in the Nation where important agricultural or ranching lands are being lost to rapid development, and a way-of-life is disappearing. I ask my colleagues to join with me and Senator Grassley to pass this bill as soon as possible and send it to the President's desk. We have to act now. ______ By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Akaka): S. 702. A bill to amend the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act to revise and extend that Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs. Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to reauthorize the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act. Senator Akaka joins me in sponsoring this measure. The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act was enacted into law in 1988, and has been reauthorized every four years since that time. The Act provides authority for a range of programs and services designed to improve the health care status of the Native people of Hawaii. With the enactment of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act and the establishment of Native Hawaiian health care systems on most of the islands that make up the State of Hawaii, we have witnessed significant improvements in the health status of Native Hawaiians, but as the findings of unmet needs and health disparities set forth in this bill make clear, we still have a long way to go. For instance, Native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality rates in the State of Hawaii--rates that are 21 percent higher than the rate for the total State male population and 64 percent higher than the rate for the total State female population. Nationally, Native Hawaiians have the third highest mortality rate as a result of breast cancer. With respect to diabetes, in 2000, Native Hawaiians had the highest mortality rate associated with diabetes in the State--a rate which is 138 percent higher than the statewide rate for all racial groups. When it comes to heart disease, the mortality rate of Native Hawaiians associated with heart disease is 68 percent higher than the rate for the entire State, and the mortality rate for hypertension is 84 percent higher than that for the entire State. These statistics on the health status of Native Hawaiians are but a small part of the long list of data that makes [[Page 7384]] clear that our objective of assuring that the Native people of Hawaii attain some parity of good health comparable to that of the larger U.S. population has not yet been achieved. ______ By Mr. HAGEL (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska): S. 703. A bill to designate the regional headquarters building for the National Park Service under construction in Omaha, Nebraska, as the ``Carl T. Curtis National Park Service Midwest Regional Headquarters Building''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 703 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF CARL T. CURTIS NATIONAL PARK SERVICE MIDWEST REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS BUILDING. The regional headquarters building for the National Park Service under construction in Omaha, Nebraska, shall be known and designated as the ``Carl T. Curtis National Park Service Midwest Regional Headquarters Building''. SEC. 2. REFERENCES. Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the regional headquarters building referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the Carl T. Curtis National Park Service Midwest Regional Headquarters Building. ______ By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Warner, and Mr. McCain): S. 704. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to increase the amount of the death gratuity payable with respect to decreased members of the Armed forces; to the Committee on Armed Services. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on behalf of my self and Senator Warner that will provide increased support for the families of those brave men and women in the armed forces who make the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation. The bill I introduce will raise the amount paid to the next-of-kin of military personnel killed while on active duty from $6,000 to $12,000. Further, it makes this increase retroactive to September 11, 2001. Like all Americans, I have been greatly saddened by the loss of life in recent days during our operations in Iraq. While all of us understand the dangers whenever the Commander-in-Chief sends our troops into harm's way, that does not lessen the shock and sadness we all have felt as we learn of the loss of lives and see the cruel video of American POWs held in Iraq. In the initial days of the war, two Marines with ties to Maine lost their lives. Both Captain Jay Aubin and Corporal Brian Kennedy, who perished in a helicopter crash in the Kuwaiti desert, have parents living in Maine. I came to this floor yesterday to express my condolences to their families, and declare my commitment to ensuring that their sacrifice is remembered. I can think of no better way to honor their memories, and the memories of other Americans who have given their lives, than to ensure that their loved ones receive the care that they need and deserve. The last time that the death gratuity was raised was in 1991, during the period of the last Gulf War. At that time, it was increased from $3,000 to $6,000. It well past time for the Congress to move forward and increase this amount to better recognize the sacrifices of these families. The death gratuity is commonly provided within 72 hours to the family of the servicemember who is killed while on active duty. This amount, while a small solace to a grieving family, assist them with their immediate financial needs. It is our obligation as a Nation to ensure that those families receive every support we can provide during such a terrible time. Just as important, as our troops enter into combat they need to be confident that, should the worst occur, that their family will have the support they need. We can never fully repay the debt of our Nation to those who have laid down their lives for our Nation. The best we can do is honor their memory, ensure that their sacrifice is not in vain, and help provide for their families. The bill I have introduced will send a message to our brave young men and women that their Nation is grateful for their service. ______ By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, and Mr. Allen): S. 705. A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to alleviate delay in the payment of the Selected Reserve reenlistment bonus to members of Selected Reserve who are mobilized; to the Committee on Armed Services. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 705 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. PAYMENT OF SELECTED RESERVE REENLISTMENT BONUS TO MEMBERS OF SELECTED RESERVE WHO ARE MOBILIZED. Section 308b of title 37, United States Code, is amended-- (1) by redesignating subsections (d), (e), and (f) as subsections (e), (f), and (g), respectively; and (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new subsection (d): ``(d) Payment to Mobilized Members.--In the case of a member entitled to a bonus under this section who is called or ordered to active duty, any amount of such bonus that is payable to the member during the period of active duty of the member shall be paid the member during that period of active duty, notwithstanding the service of the member on active duty pursuant to such call or order to active duty.''. ______ By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, and Mr. Allen): S. 706. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide Survivor Benefit Plan annuities for surviving spouses of Reserves not eligible for retirement who die from a cause incurred or aggravated while on inactive- duty training; to the Committee on Armed Services. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 706 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SURVIVOR BENEFIT PLAN ANNUITIES FOR SURVIVING SPOUSES OF RESERVES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETIREMENT WHO DIE FROM A CAUSE INCURRED OR AGGRAVATED WHILE ON INACTIVE-DUTY TRAINING. (a) Surviving Spouse Annuity.--Paragraph (1) of section 1448(f) of title 10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: ``(1) Surviving spouse annuity.--The Secretary concerned shall pay an annuity under this subchapter to the surviving spouse of-- ``(A) a person who is eligible to provide a reserve- component annuity and who dies-- ``(i) before being notified under section 12731(d) of this title that he has completed the years of service required for eligibility for reserve-component retired pay; or ``(ii) during the 90-day period beginning on the date he receives notification under section 12731(d) of this title that he has completed the years of service required for eligibility for reserve-component retired pay if he had not made an election under subsection (a)(2)(B) to participate in the Plan; or ``(B) a member of a reserve component not described in subparagraph (A) who dies from an injury or illness incurred or aggravated in line of duty during inactive-duty training.''. (b) Conforming Amendment.--The heading for subsection (f) of section 1448 of such title is amended by inserting ``or Before'' after ``Dying When''. (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take effect as of September 10, 2001, and shall apply with respect to performance of inactive-duty training (as defined in section 101(d) of title 10, United States Code) on or after that date. [[Page 7385]] ____________________ SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS ______ SENATE RESOLUTION 97--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ARRESTS OF CUBAN DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Allen) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. S. Res. 97 Whereas on March 18, 2003, Fidel Castro and the Government of Cuba began an island-wide campaign to arrest and jail dozens of prominent democracy activists and critics of the repressive regime; Whereas since March 18, 2003, the Cuban police have arrested more than 100 Cubans for engaging in free speech under Law 88, the Law for the Protection of National Independence and the Economy of Cuba, which is a notorious law passed 3 years ago by the communist country; Whereas the imprisoned political opponents of Castro include librarians, journalists, and others who have supported the Varela Project, which seeks to bring free speech, open elections, and democracy to the island nation; Whereas Fidel Castro has seized the opportunity to expand his brutal oppression of the Cuban people while the attention of the United States and other nations around the world is focused on the war in Iraq; and Whereas the failure to condemn the Cuban Government's renewed political repression of democracy activists will undermine the opportunity for freedom on the island: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) condemns the recent arrests and other intimidation tactics against democracy activists by the Castro regime; (2) calls on the Cuban Government to immediately release those imprisoned and held during this most recent crackdown for activities the government wrongly deems ``subversive, counter-revolutionary, and provocative''; (3) reaffirms Senate Resolution 272, 107th Congress, agreed to June 10, 2002, which was agreed to without opposition and which called for, among other things, amnesty for all political prisoners; (4) praises the bravery of those Cubans who, because they practiced free speech and signed the Varela Project petition, have been targeted in this most recent government crackdown; and (5) urges the President to demand the immediate release of these prisoners and to take all appropriate steps to secure their immediate release. ______ SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 29--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA AND THE NEED TO ASSURE THAT UNITED STATES TRADE ACTIONS DO NOT RESULT IN GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS OR UNITED STATES JOB LOSSES Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance: S. Con. Res. 29 Whereas the Republic of Korea is a vital ally of the United States in Asia; Whereas the current tensions on the Korean Peninsula require the strongest possible alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea; Whereas Hynix Semiconductor Inc. is a major Korean and global semiconductor manufacturer; Whereas Hynix Semiconductor Inc. has invested over $1,000,000,000 in its facilities in Eugene, Oregon, and is increasing that investment; Whereas Hynix Semiconductor Inc. employs over 1,000 highly skilled and compensated Americans at its facilities in Eugene, Oregon; Whereas these jobs are particularly valuable to Oregon and the United States economy at a time of economic uncertainty; Whereas semiconductor trade between the United States and the Republic of Korea is currently the subject of trade remedy proceedings and continuing review by the United States Trade Representative; Whereas the Republic of Korea has, as a result of the currency crisis in the mid-1990s, implemented economic reforms; Whereas as a result of those reforms the Government of South Korea is no longer involved in commercial lending decisions; and Whereas the Government of South Korea has affirmed that it has had no role in the economic restructurings of Hynix Semiconductor Inc.: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the United States Government should act carefully and judiciously with regard to issues involving semiconductor trade between the United States and the Republic of Korea to assure that trade disputes do not create geopolitical or economic tensions between the United States and the Republic of Korea, and do not result in the loss of highly skilled American jobs, including jobs at United States facilities of Korean semiconductor manufacturers; (2) the Secretary of Commerce should review carefully and objectively all the facts surrounding the financial restructuring of Hynix Semiconductor Inc. in light of economic reforms which have taken place in South Korea in recent years, and avoid taking any action which will threaten the jobs of American workers in the semiconductor industry or threaten future investment in Hynix Semiconductor Inc.'s facility in Eugene, Oregon; and (3) the United States Trade Representative should seek to address issues involving semiconductor trade between the United States and the Republic of Korea through consultation after full review of the facts. ____________________ AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED SA 411.

Res. 23, setting forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2004 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2003 and for fiscal years 2005 through 2013; as follows: At the end, insert the following: SEC. . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR LOW INCOME PROGRAMS AND THE INCOME TAX ON CERTAIN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. It is the sense of the Senate that the final budget conference report should not include any net reduction in funding below current baseline levels for programs that assist low income working families, and that repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits can be accommodated within the revenue totals and instructions of the resolution, in a manner that does not reduce the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Part A of Medicare.) ______ SA 427. Mr. NICKLES (for himself and Mr. Levin) proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution S. Con. Res. 23, setting forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2004 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2003 and for fiscal years 2005 through 2013; as follows: At the end of title III, add the following: SEC. . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS. It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals in this resolution assume that up to $20,000,000 from funds designated, but not obligated, for travel and administrative expenses, from drug interdiction activities should be used for service-oriented targeted grants for the utilization of substances that block the craving for heroin and that are newly approved for such use by the Food and Drug Administration. ____________________ APPOINTMENT The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I expect that we will have several rollcall votes. We made tremendous progress today. We conducted 23 rollcall votes on amendments, and we adopted several other amendments and resolutions by voice vote. I wish to thank all my colleagues for their cooperation. That being said, we will be voting throughout the day tomorrow on the remaining amendments with a final vote on the resolution to occur no later than 4 p.m. tomorrow. Therefore, tomorrow will be a very busy day. I am hopeful we can finish the resolution before 4 p.m. I encourage all my colleagues to remain in the Chamber during tomorrow's votes on the budget. Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to say we, too, believe this has been a productive day. This is the way this Senate ought to operate. It was well organized, and I thank the chairman for his contribution to that organization and to the tone that was evidenced throughout today in terms of the debate. I really thought the tone today reflected the best of the Senate. These were real debates on real substance and conducted in a way that I think we can all be proud. Again, I thank the chairman for helping to set that tone and also for his participation in the organization of these amendments so that colleagues could know what was happening, what was going to happen next. I thought it went very well. Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and very much appreciate his cooperation. ____________________ ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M. TOMORROW Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order. There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:28 p.m., adjourned until Wednesday, March 26, 2003, at 10:30 a.m. [[Page 7399]] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES--Tuesday, March 25, 2003 The House met at 12:30 p.m. and was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Boozman). ____________________ DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Speaker: Washington DC, March 25, 2003. I hereby appoint the Honorable John Boozman to act as Speaker pro tempore on this day. J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives. ____________________ MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Mr. Monahan, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed a concurrent resolution of the following title in which the concurrence of the House is requested: S. Con. Res. 28. Concurrent resolution authorizing the printing of the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-2005. ____________________ MORNING HOUR DEBATES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of January 7, 2003, the Chair will now recognize Members from lists submitted by the majority and minority leaders for morning hour debates. The Chair will alternate recognition between the parties, with each party limited to not to exceed 30 minutes, and each Member, except the majority leader, the minority leader, or the minority whip, limited to not to exceed 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay). ____________________ MAKING OUR CHILDREN SAFER Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, this week is Children's Week, and the House will consider four bills designed to make our children safer. We are reminded this week that a society that does not keep its children safe is failing its most basic duty. A reading of the titles of the bills before the House reveals the circumstances experienced by too many American children today: The prevalence of child abuse and neglect, the significance of runaway prevention, and the importance of preventing child abductions and sexual exploitation. These bills stand as a stark reminder that our children need special protection because they are children and therefore simply vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. We will have two bills on the suspension calendar that are designed to increase public awareness of the problems of child abuse and runaway prevention. Mr. Speaker, the problems of child abuse are staggering. It is estimated that every year in our country more than 1,200 children die as a direct result of being abused and neglected. Some studies suggest that as many as 2.8 million children run away from home to escape abuse, age out of foster care or are thrown out of their homes and live on the streets. Both the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 and the Child Abduction Prevention Act will be the subject of debate and floor consideration this week. The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act reauthorizes and modifies the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and related measures to prevent family violence, to assist abandoned babies and to promote adoption. The bill emphasizes the prevention of child maltreatment and family violence before it occurs, puts in place procedures to care for infants born drug-exposed, and ensures that parents investigated for child abuse be fully informed of the specific allegations made against them. Finally, the House will consider the Child Abduction Prevention Act with the purpose of preventing child abductions and putting in place the necessary enforcement tools to assure that child abductors will not escape justice. This bill offers a comprehensive package of child abduction prevention tools that make severe child abuse and torture a capital crime, that provides stronger penalties against kidnapping and sexual trafficking, that keeps child kidnappers behind bars until trial and that puts a ``two strikes you're out'' law in place. After all, how many children's lives do you have to ruin before you should be locked up for life? Additionally, it keeps all the safeguards in place for wiretapping, but creates four new circumstances to allow better monitoring of criminals' abuse of children's chat rooms. We used to be able to keep an eye on our children at the playground in order to keep them safe. Chat rooms pose a dangerous new challenge that we must confront. In addition, the bill would extend the Justice Department's Amber Alert system to a nationwide program and authorizes funds to enhance communication systems along highways to support the Amber Alert communications plans. Mr. Speaker, I believe that the child-related legislation that the House is set to move this week shows the American people that our children are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation and that the House is committed to ensuring that more of our children are protected and made safe. ____________________ DOING MORE TO COMBAT UNDERAGE DRINKING The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of January 7, 2003, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 minutes. Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, would not every Member of this House love to have a campaign in which they could run 93 TV ads for every TV ad run by their opponent? There is no doubt which candidate would win. So it goes with the contest between alcohol commercials and responsible drinking ads purchased by the alcohol industry. As reported by the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth, in 2001 America's youth were 93 times more likely to see an ad promoting alcohol than an industry ad discouraging underage drinking. Although the liquor industry tells us their ads are not targeted at children, our children see plenty of them, and they have enormous impact on our young population. On average, in 2001, an American youngster saw 245 ads promoting alcohol products to only four ads discouraging underage drinking. The amount of money the liquor industry spends on advertising alcohol is also astounding; and compared to what the industry spends on warnings about underage drinking it is, at best, disappointing. For example, in the year 2001, the alcohol industry spent $811 million to air 208,000 alcohol ads, compared to $23 million for a mere 2,379 responsible drinking ads. In other words, the alcohol industry spent less than 3 percent of its total advertising dollars on responsible drinking. As a result, our youth saw more commercials for beer [[Page 7400]] than for juice, gum, chips, sneakers or jeans, product ads that usually target a young audience. The power of liquor advertising has been effective. While drinking under the age of 21 is illegal in all 50 States, a recent report by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University found that kids illegally spent over $22 billion a year on alcohol and they account for 20 percent of all alcohol consumed in our Nation. These numbers attest to the negative impact of the extensive investment the alcohol industry is making to attract consumers to their products while ignoring their responsibility to be equally diligent about ads warning about the dangers of underage drinking. Mr. Speaker, why does it matter? It matters because the consequences of underage drinking are devastating to our youth and to our society. According to an NIH study, over 10 million kids in the U.S. consume alcohol illegally, starting, on average, at age 13. The NIH study also found that kids who began drinking before the age of 15 are four times more likely to become alcoholics than those who begin drinking after the age of 21, 22 times more likely to use marijuana and 50 times more likely to try cocaine than kids who do not drink. That, Mr. Speaker, is why it matters. In order to counter the alarming assault on our youth, Congress has commissioned the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences to develop a strategy to reduce underage drinking with a national media campaign at its centerpiece. The report is expected in May. In the meantime, Mr. Speaker, the beer wholesalers and others representing the alcohol industry will be visiting congressional offices in the coming weeks to lobby for a reduction in alcohol taxes. When they do, I urge my colleagues to make it clear to the liquor industry that our children are an important and critical asset to our Nation and that we cannot afford to lose them. I urge my colleagues to put the liquor industry on notice that it must do more than pay for their token underage drinking ads and seriously invest to inform parents and children about the dangers of underage drinking. ____________________ ASSUMING THE MANTLE OF RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of January 7, 2003, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 minutes. Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, last Sunday I attended the dedication of a recently constructed house of worship at High Point, North Carolina. The minister reminded those of us in the congregation about the past history of the United States, our benevolence, our having offered assistance time and again to our distressed neighbors across the world. When I heard these words, I concluded that we Americans do need to remind the world, pardon my immodesty, that we are indeed the eternal good guy. We have pulled chestnuts from the fire for many nations and many people; and some who have become beneficiaries of our benevolence conveniently become victims of amnesia. I recently saw a televised interview, Mr. Speaker, of one protesting our involvement in Iraq, who blamed President Bush for having led us to believe that this would be brief and easy. That charge, Mr. Speaker, is misleading and inaccurate. President Bush from the very outset has made it clear that this encounter would be arduous and demanding. I have been advised that President Clinton publicly said that this war would be quickly won. I did not hear him say it, but, if he did, it was a reckless, irresponsible conclusion. Such utterances lull observers into what could be a sense of false security and serve no good purpose to our troops. The United Nations has been disappointing throughout this exercise. Certain members of the U.N. need to enroll, it seems to me, in refresher leadership courses. Saddam Hussein has danced circles around the U.N., and he surely must be laughing up his sleeve. Saddam, not unlike the school yard bully, has imposed havoc upon his people and upon his neighbors; and, not unlike the school yard bully, he will continue to destroy until someone has the fortitude to challenge him, to call his bluff. Permit me to examine Saddam's record during his bloody regime: Thousands have disappeared in the Iraqi prison network; there are numerous accounts of torture and burning of human flesh of accused victims, children dying of starvation, starvation accelerated by Saddam, women notoriously raped in the presence of third parties; and, once this evil dictator is removed, I am confident many additional unbelievable horrible accounts will surface. Enter President Bush, enter Prime Minister Tony Blair, enter Spain and Australia and others. These leaders have decided the time has come to take on the school yard bully. Many insist that this is a unilateral operation. Not true. There are many supporters, but they are reluctant to openly oppose Saddam. They fear him. They in fact, Mr. Speaker, are afraid. Many of his neighbors loathe Saddam, but they stand in fear. But the Bush-Blair wagon will move forward with the support, albeit sometimes anonymous, of other nations. Some observers have suggested that the U.N. should remove the United States from the U.N. Kick the United States out, they say. I have an alternative suggestion: Certain members of the U.N. should be led to the gate that leads to the road out of the country. They might be advised to follow that road if they are unable and are unwilling to assume the mantle of responsible leadership. Mr. Speaker, meanwhile, the liberation of Iraq advances, as we continue to keep our troops and their families and the troops of our neighbors and their families in our thoughts and prayers. ____________________ UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, MALARIA AND TUBERCULOSIS ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of January 7, 2003, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 minutes. Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the Committee on International Relations recently introduced H.R. 1298, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis Act. The bill is a 5-year, $15 billion bill providing $3 billion in relief in each of these 5 years. It provides no minimum for U.S. contributions to the Global Fund and authorizes a maximum of $1 billion for fiscal year 2004 and such sums as necessary in the ensuing 4 years. {time} 1245 The bill provides the limitation that ``no U.S. contribution to the Global Fund may cause a total amount of U.S. Government contributions to exceed 33 percent of the total amount of funds contributed to the Global Fund from all other sources.'' This encourages other countries to step up to the plate also and other philanthropists around the world. This bill is a start. It is the first step in a long and difficult journey we must take in the effort to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Sixty-five million people have been infected with HIV since the epidemic began, 65 million people; and 25 million of them have died. Fourteen million children have been orphaned. The numbers are not only staggering; they are devastating, and they are growing. I am glad to see this bill authorizes up to $1 billion next year for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; but we need to offer more. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has asked each of the 25 richest democracies in the world to contribute seven-tenths of 1 percent of their gross domestic product towards world hunger, world poverty, and in combating infectious disease, seven-tenths of 1 percent. Only four countries [[Page 7401]] have committed that figure and have contributed that figure. The United States contributes less than one-tenth of 1 percent of its gross domestic product, ranking as dead last among the 25 wealthy industrial democracies in the world in terms of what we do in foreign aid to combat poverty and infectious disease. In the upcoming years, we will spend estimates upward of $100 billion to rebuild Iraq. Yet we have been unwilling to spend more than one- fifth of 1 percent of that amount, $200 million so far, to save the lives of millions of people around the world. A physician with the World Health Organization remarked recently, ``There are certain problems the U.S. simply cannot solve on its own, much as it would like to believe otherwise.'' Bilateral aid programs are important tools and should not be discounted, but they are not enough. Too often they are BandAids placed on a hemorrhaging patient. To successfully turn the tied against HIV/ AIDS, against tuberculosis, against malaria, diseases that kill 6 million people around the world each year, will take the largest multilateral coalition imaginable. Simply put, it will take the entire world to save the world. That level of commitment is not fully on our radar screen, but it needs to be. The Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and malaria represents the best tool we have to provide relief on a scale that will really matter. I started this speech, Mr. Speaker, with numbers, and I will leave my colleagues with some numbers. Thirteen thousand new AIDS infections every day, 2,000 of them in children under age 15; 8,500 AIDS deaths a day; 20 million AIDS orphans are projected in Africa by 2010. Mr. Speaker, 1,100 people in India every day die from tuberculosis. Take a moment to think about what these numbers really mean. Every day we fail to act, every day we fail to take the necessary action, these numbers increase. Every dollar we fail to provide today will cost us 100 times that tomorrow. U.S. failure to properly commit to the Global Fund is not just unfortunate, it is shameful. In 20 years, we will tell our children that we did all we could to combat the tide of these epidemics, or we will be forced to tell them that we failed the world. ____________________ SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Boozman). Pursuant to the order of the House of January 7, 2003, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Smith) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make some comments on the war in Iraq. Most of us voted for the resolution to authorize the President to use force in Iraq to help solve the problem of weapons of mass destruction. Voting for that resolution makes us at least somewhat responsible for the young men and women in the military going into harm's way. And even though we know it is the right thing to do, it still gives one pause for all of the suffering and the sorrow. Now we have several of our military who have been captured, or missing, or who have died. The challenge for this country is that if Saddam gets away with it, other tyrants in other rogue nations think that it also is going to be to their advantage to develop these weapons of mass destruction. This will make the world much less secure and this country much less secure. I pray for not only the young men and women soldiers, but for their families. When I was 21 years old, we got a phone call notifying us that my brother, Chan, who was 23, that his jet plane went down and that he was killed. That grief never left our family. So the sacrifice is great for families. I, for one, am convinced that the war is the right thing to do. If we were to delay, it would mean that much greater of a challenge for us in the future. Recently a newspaper in my district in Michigan ran an editorial saying that people have the right to protest against the war; and they do, certainly. But now that we are in the war, I think we should encourage everybody to rethink what protesting does. Before we went in, maybe you can protest and maybe it is going to end up in a decision not to be there. But now, we have thousands of our young men and women over there that need our support. We are in combat. Imagine an analogy where a mom did not want her son to go out for boxing because it is too dangerous, or football; but once the decision was made, does she not cheer him and go to the game and cheer him on? Or a mom and dad that did not want their daughter to go out for basketball because, after all, that was sort of wrong for a young lady to do. That was a boy's sport. But once that young lady goes out for the team, the parents cheer her on and say, good game, do your best. Or what happened in Vietnam when we literally spat on some of our soldiers and sailors when they came home? My point, Mr. Speaker, is that to demonstrate against the war makes the challenge for our military greater. As an old Air Force veteran I assure my colleagues that it is true, it makes it harder for our military, when people now demonstrate and say, look, you are doing an immoral thing, you are doing the wrong thing. It makes it that much more difficult. We are in it. Let us cheer for our team and give our total support for the action of our military men and women that are now over in this war in Iraq. Give them our prayers and certainly give their families and their loved ones our prayers. ____________________ QUESTIONING THE MATRICULA CONSULAR The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of January 7, 2003, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 minutes. Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a problem that should be at the forefront of our agenda as we move into the 108th Congress. Our immigration system today needs improvement. Unfortunately, it took a tragedy to remind us about this. This country, of course, was based upon immigration. It was what has made us strong and all Americans recognize its importance. But this system needs improvement. We must continue to facilitate the entry of those men and women who make productive citizens, yet continue to filter those who are not eligible and those who could bring harm to our way of life. As a body, we recently moved the INS to the Department of Homeland Security, a measure that signals a return to our security. This administration has realized the fact that reorganization must take place before we can take steps to reform our immigration system. At no other time in our Nation's history have we faced more of a threat to our domestic security; but as we make strides towards improved security measures, I am deeply concerned that countries, even those who are considered allies, are lining up to compromise our work. Every day, Mr. Speaker, thousands of illegal immigrants stream across our sieve-like borders and into our country. Once they are inside, the grim reality stands that they are totally, totally untrackable. Yet our neighbor to the south does nothing to help us. But this is in no way shocking, seeing that remittances from Mexico's citizens, both legal and illegal, account for Mexico's third largest source of income. It amounts to over $10 billion a year. That is what is sent back by the Mexican immigrants. So it is no surprise that the Mexican Government is not helping us to secure our borders. One method I would bring to the attention of my colleagues has been found recently by Mexico in the wake of the 9-11 terrorist attacks. As we remember, we were going to have legislation on the floor dealing with Mexico that was tabled because our attention was focused on homeland security. So then the Mexican Government decided to change its strategy and they substituted a grass-roots approach that focused at the local level to seek small successes and build momentum for congressional action. Now, the linchpin for this new strategy was to be the matricula consular. [[Page 7402]] Now, this is a word which means an official identity card which would be issued by the Mexican Government which it wants to be officially recognized by the United States. Now, unless we recognize this card, it goes nowhere; but they want us to recognize this card. This card would essentially allow illegal immigrants from Mexico the right to apply for a driver's license, Social Security card, and bank account. The U.S. Treasury Department has even gone so far as to promote its use. In a report to Congress, Treasury included a footnote that would go on to influence the language of the United States Patriot Act. The footnote says: ``Thus, the proposed regulations do not discourage bank acceptance of the matricula consular identity card that is being issued by the Mexican Government to immigrants.'' My colleagues, we can stop this by sponsoring H.R. 502. This bill requires that any ID cards must be verifiable by our government to obtain Federal public benefits. We do not have to recognize these identity cards from Mexico. The intent of the PATRIOT Act of 2000, which passed overwhelmingly by Congress, was to strengthen our homeland security. It addressed the issue of secure identification because the hijackers had obtained Social Security numbers and drivers licenses. Especially in this context, it is difficult to comprehend why Treasury went out of its way to give approval to an identity card being offered by a single foreign government whose contiguous border is a matter of acute concern to the United States and whose nationals represent the majority of illegals within the United States. As our troops risk their lives thousands of miles from home, it is disappointing that a country so dependent upon us would continue to compromise our security and openly denounce our foreign policy, that is, they are not supporting the war in Iraq. Despite the fact that the United States provides Mexico with 75 percent of their annual trade and is home to millions of migrants, President Fox of Mexico, a friend of President Bush, openly decries our military action. As the battle for our homeland security wages both here and in the deserts of the Middle East, we must find a way to better monitor the men and women who freely cross our borders every day. The matricula consular identity card would not help in this regard, Mr. Speaker. It is time we reevaluate our immigration system and ensure that our country will be better protected by those who would wish to do us harm. ____________________ RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 84) providing for the acceptance of a statue of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, presented by the people of Kansas, for placement in the Capitol, and for other purposes. The Clerk read as follows: H. Con. Res. 84 Whereas Dwight D. Eisenhower gave a lifetime of service to the Nation as a military officer, leader of the victorious Allied armies in World War II, first supreme commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and as President of the United States; Whereas Dwight D. Eisenhower was raised in Abilene, Kansas; Whereas Dwight D. Eisenhower was the 34th President of the United States from 1953 to 1961, and during his presidency he saw the end of the Korean War, maintained peace during the Cold War, desegregated the military, marking the beginning of the modern civil rights movement, and implemented the interstate highway program, among other accomplishments; Whereas Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife Mamie are buried in the Place of Meditation, on the grounds of the Eisenhower Center and Presidential Library and Museum in Abilene, Kansas, a premier historical institution recognized around the world; and Whereas the great State of Kansas desires to honor its most famous son for his many contributions and to keep his legacy alive for future generations: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), SECTION 1. ACCEPTANCE OF STATUE OF DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER FROM THE PEOPLE OF KANSAS FOR PLACEMENT IN THE CAPITOL. (a) In General.--The statue of Dwight D. Eisenhower, furnished by the people of Kansas for placement in the Capitol in accordance with section 1814 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (40 U.S.C. 187), is accepted in the name of the United States, and the thanks of Congress are extended to the people of Kansas for providing this commemoration of one of the most eminent persons from Kansas. (b) Presentation Ceremony.--The State of Kansas is authorized to use the Rotunda of the Capitol on June 4, 2003, for a presentation ceremony for the statue. The Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board shall take such action as may be necessary with respect to physical preparations and security for the ceremony. [[Page 7404]] (c) Display in Rotunda.--The statue shall be displayed in the Rotunda of the Capitol for a period of not more than 6 months, after which time the statue shall be moved to its permanent location. SEC. 2. TRANSMITTAL TO GOVERNOR OF KANSAS. The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall transmit a copy of this resolution to the Governor of Kansas. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney). Mr. NEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 84. This legislation provides for the acceptance of the statue of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, presented by the people of Kansas, for placement in the Capitol. The Capitol's National Statutory Hall Collection started in 1864 to let each State honor two of its famous own. About half the statues joined the collection in the late 1800s and the early 1900s. A bronze statue of Dwight D. Eisenhower, better known as ``Ike,'' will replace the statue of the former Governor, George Washington Glick. Dwight D. Eisenhower was a small-town boy from Kansas who grew up to be one of America's greatest military commanders and 34th President of the United States, from 1953 to 1961. Although his mother was a pacifist who morally opposed war and violence, Eisenhower believed that a strong military was the key to keeping peace. Hence, he decided at a young age to become a military officer. Eisenhower commanded 420,000 American soldiers in field training in Louisiana, working alongside his West Point colleague George Patton. Impressed with Eisenhower's planning skills, General George Marshall made him liaison between American and British strategic planners in London, where he made such a favorable impression on British Prime Minister Winston Churchill that Churchill had him appointed supreme commander of ``Operation Overlord,'' the Allied assault on Nazi- occupied Europe. Eisenhower was a hero, loved and admired by the American public. Madam Speaker, this resolution was brought to us by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt). I appreciate our ranking member, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), and members of both sides of the aisle moving so promptly on a measure that is important not only to Kansas to honor one of their own, but also to the Nation, and the debt of gratitude we have to Dwight D. Eisenhower who led us into victory and made the world a safer place. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, how appropriate today as we are engaged in battle abroad that we pause to honor Dwight David Eisenhower, and how appropriate that the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt), the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Ryun), the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran) and the great State of Kansas have chosen to erect this statue that will be on display in our Rotunda on June 4 and will then later be moved to a permanent spot in recognition of the great achievements of Dwight David Eisenhower. I join with the chairman and the entire Kansas delegation in saluting and recognizing this great American, Dwight David Eisenhower. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 84, which would provide for acceptance of a statue of the late President Dwight Eisenhower, presented by the people of Kansas, for placement in the Capitol as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection. Once presented, the statue will become the property of the American people. The concurrent resolution would also authorize use of the Rotunda of the Capitol on June 4, 2003, for a ceremony presenting the statue of the United States and providing for its display in the Rotunda for six months, after which it would be moved by the Architect of the Capitol to a permanent location in the Capitol selected by the Joint Committee on the Library (JCL). This is a common form of resolution that Congress has often passed when states are submitting statues for the National Statuary Hall Collection. There is no legal requirement for us to take this action in order to accept the new statue from Kansas, and the practice has not always been followed, but it has been a fairly common practice since the 19th Century. The arrival of the Eisenhower statue will be historic in one way because this is the first statue ever presented by a state to replace an existing statue in the Statuary Hall Collection. Pursuant to P.L. 106-554, the Legislative Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001, enacted in 2000, states are now allowed to replace their existing statues no more frequently than once every 10 years, subject to the approval of the Joint Committee on the Library. No state may ever have more than two such statues as part of the Collection. On October 9, 2002, members of the Joint Committee, by a written poll, approved the Eisenhower statue as a replacement for that of George Washington Glick, a former Kansas Governor in the 1880's, whose statue was received in the U.S. Capitol in 1914. Disposition of the Glick statue, which remains the property of the United States in the meantime, will also be determined by the Joint Committee on the Library. Pursuant to the statute, ownership of any replaced statue shall be transferred back to the state, subject to JCL approval. I am hopeful that the State of Kansas will find a suitable location for this statue. Madam Speaker, this concurrent resolution is sponsored by the entire Kansas delegation and honors Kansas' most famous son, President Eisenhower. He is certainly a worthy recipient of being honored by a statue in America's most prestigious collection here in the Capitol. I would also like to compliment Representative Dennis Moore, Jim Moran, Jim Ryan, and Todd Tiahrt of the Kansas delegation for their work on this effort to honor President Eisenhower and I appreciate the opportunity to join with them in this effort by managing this bill for the Minority. Therefore, Madam Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support this effort to honor President Eisenhower by joining the Kansas Delegation, Chairman Ney and myself in voting for this resolution. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEY. Madam Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt). Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) for moving this legislation quickly. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak about a resolution that is very important to me. House Concurrent Resolution 84 officially receives on behalf of the United States a statue of General Dwight D. Eisenhower from the people of Kansas. {time} 1415 Every day visitors to our Capitol are impressed by the diverse manner in which each of the 50 States has chosen to memorialize their favorite sons and daughters. Each State is permitted to provide two statues for display in the Capitol pursuant to an 1864 act of Congress which created the National Statuary Hall. While new statues have been introduced as each State fills their allotment, prior to this resolution no State has replaced one of their statues. So this is a historical event in our Nation's Capitol. For the past 89 years, the statue of Governor Glick has served as one of Kansas' memorials in our Nation's Capitol. Like other States, Kansas selected individuals it wished to memorialize in the early years of the 20th century. While Governor Glick's contributions to Kansas' political development are notable, many Kansans have long wished for our statues to be replaced by individuals with whom visitors to the Capitol can more readily identify and that reflect Kansas' contributions to the Nation and world. It is in that spirit that I introduced this resolution, which is cosponsored by the entire Kansas delegation. It will provide for the replacement of Governor Glick's statue with a representation of one of our Nation's most prominent figures, a Kansan, General Dwight D. Eisenhower. General Eisenhower is an instantly recognizable international figure and fully embodies what is best about Kansas and the spirit of its people. The statue of Governor Glick will find a new home in a prominent location at the State capitol in Topeka, [[Page 7405]] Kansas, where Kansans will appreciate its historical value. Born in 1890, Dwight David Eisenhower grew up in Abilene, Kansas, as the third of seven sons to David Jacob and Ida Elizabeth Stover Eisenhower. He was a capable athlete, and this resulted in his appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in September 1915 and thus began one of the most illustrious military careers in the history of our Armed Forces. Stationed in Texas as a second lieutenant, he met and subsequently married Mamie Geneva Doud. In his early Army career he excelled in staff assignments, serving under Generals John J. Pershing and Douglas MacArthur. After Pearl Harbor, he was called upon by General George C. Marshall to assist in developing the strategy by which the Allies would eventually overcome the Axis Powers. Shortly thereafter he was named the Commander in Chief of the Allied forces in North Africa in November 1942. In December 1943 Eisenhower received the assignment that would eventually secure his place in history when he was appointed the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. As Supreme Commander, he oversaw Operation Overlord that brought together the land, air and sea forces of the Allied armies in what became known as the largest invasion force in human history. After leading the Allies to victory, Eisenhower briefly served as president of Columbia University before being named Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. While in Paris, Republican emissaries persuaded him to return home and run for President in the 1952 election, which he won in a landslide. As a two-term President, Eisenhower oversaw the end of the Korean War, sought to contain Communist expansion, ordered the desegregation of the United States Army, and oversaw the development of the interstate highway system, among other major accomplishments. The 1950s are remembered as an idyllic period in American history, in no small part due to Eisenhower's principled leadership. Due to the magnificent example of his life of public service, the great State of Kansas has chosen to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower by having his statue placed in the United States Capitol. General Eisenhower embodied all that was and is great about Kansas and has long been considered Kansas' most revered son. He is also one of our Nation's most revered sons; and in a city that prides itself on honoring our Nation's heroes, I find it regrettable that we have neglected to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower with a memorial in our Nation's capital. This year marks the 50th anniversary year of his inauguration as President. We still like Ike, and it is an appropriate time to commemorate the important contributions he made to our Nation. We have chosen to remember Dwight Eisenhower as a soldier rather than as President and Commander in Chief because of the extraordinary courage he demonstrated in leading our Nation to victory in the Second World War. It is important to note that there is currently no one of that era honored in the United States Capitol; so as much as this statue will honor the life and service of Dwight David Eisenhower, it will also serve as a memorial to an entire generation of men and women who, together, rose to confront a challenge that threatened our civilization. My family, like those of many Americans, includes a number of individuals who served in our Armed Forces during this period. It is only fitting that we remember the sacrifices that the Greatest Generation and their leader, Dwight D. Eisenhower, made on our behalf. Jim Brothers, a native Kansan and the sculptor of the statue, chose to sculpt Eisenhower as he spoke to the troops the day before the D-Day invasion at Normandy, June 6, 1944, a day that he often reflected on as the defining moment in his life and which certainly was the defining moment of the Second World War. General Eisenhower was aware of the tremendous risks involved in an Allied invasion of Europe, and his decision to proceed with Operation Overlord was a true test of his character and leadership. His strength in the face of enormous adversity, willingness to shoulder the burden of responsibility alone, and unflagging determination to succeed galvanized the more than 2 million soldiers under his command and led to the ultimate Allied triumph. The life of Dwight David Eisenhower reminds us that freedom is not free, that it has been bought with blood and sacrifice. When faced with adversity during the Second World War and at other points in his life, Dwight Eisenhower never shirked from his responsibility to the men that he commanded, the obstacles before him, and the Nation that he loved. Given the current challenges facing our great Nation, Dwight David Eisenhower's example is particularly important today. Today we honor Dwight David Eisenhower so that we may demonstrate to our children and to our children's children that courage matters as much today as it did in 1944. Let us celebrate the courage that he never failed to demonstrate over the course of his remarkable life. On a final note, I would like to encourage the American public to visit Abilene, Kansas, where both President Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie, are buried in the Place of Meditation on the grounds of the Eisenhower Center and Presidential Library and Museum, a premier historical institution that is recognized around the world. Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Emerson). The Chair must ask Members to refrain from displaying communicative badges while engaging in debate. Mr. NEY. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Ryun). Mr. RYUN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking minority member, and I also thank the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt) for his hard work on this issue. I rise today to speak on behalf of House Concurrent Resolution 84. With this bill, a statue of our 34th President and a favorite son of Kansas will adorn the halls of this great institution. Born in Texas, but raised in Abilene, Kansas, Dwight D. Eisenhower was a small-town boy who led our military through the harsh days of World War II and then led our Nation in the trying times of the Korean Conflict. However, throughout Eisenhower's career, he always remained true to his Kansas roots. Ike understood early on in his life how important the military was to the protection of our Nation and decided to pursue a career as an Army officer. After graduating from West Point, he was transferred around the world from Panama to the Philippines. During World War II, Ike's talents and character were recognized by everyone who worked with him. He quickly rose through the ranks from lieutenant colonel to five-star general in just 4 short years. He commanded the Allied forces, landing in North Africa and was the Supreme Commander on D-Day. After the war, Eisenhower became the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was the Supreme Commander of the forces of the newly created NATO. Due to his well-proven leadership and strong popularity with the American people, Eisenhower was heavily courted by both political parties to run for the Presidency. Finally, he agreed to become a Presidential candidate under the Republican banner. Eisenhower resigned the Army and 5 months later won the Presidency in a landslide election. During his two terms as President, Eisenhower worked tirelessly to bring peace and economic prosperity to the American people. Ike signed a cease-fire agreement between North and South Korea, pursued the policies of containment against the Soviet empire, desegregated the military, balanced the Federal budget, and signed the landmark Interstate Highway Act. After leaving the Presidency, Eisenhower returned to private life and enjoyed his final days with his family. This great general, great President, and great American holds an important place in American history and in the hearts and minds of the American people. He will soon hold a rightful place in the halls of the Capitol. [[Page 7406]] Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, if I might reclaim my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Ohio wish to give the gentleman from Connecticut some of his time? Mr. NEY. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the gentlemen from Kansas and join with them in saluting Dwight David Eisenhower and also rising on behalf of George Washington Glick. I know that the good people of Kansas and the Representatives here will make sure that this historic figure, as well, receives his just place back in Kansas. Mr. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 84, legislation introduced by the Kansas delegation to the U.S. House that will replace an existing statue of former Kansas Governor George Washington Glick, who served from 1882 to 1885, with a statue of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. This statue, which is presented from the people of Kansas to the U.S. Capitol, will serve as one of the two statues that our State is allowed to be displayed in the U.S. Capitol. I want to particularly commend the bipartisan manner in which the dean of our House delegation, Representative Todd Tiahrt, has handled this matter. This marks the first time that a State has sought to replace one of its statues in the Capitol's Statuary Hall. Our actions were prompted by the enactment by the Kansas Legislature of Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1617, in 1999, which memorialized Congress to authorize the replacement of Governor Glick's statue with the statue of President Eisenhower, and to replace the State's other statue, of the late Senator John J. Ingalls, with a statue of the famous female aviator, Amelia Earhart. The 7\\1/2\\ foot tall bronze Eisenhower statue, which was privately funded by the Eisenhower Foundation of Abilene, Kansas, was sculpted by Jim Brothers of Lawrence, Kansas. The pose is taken from a famous photograph where General Eisenhower was talking with soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division on the day before the D-Day invasion. It is fitting that we enact this legislation on the fiftieth anniversary of President Eisenhower's first inauguration as president. Madam Speaker, I am honored to serve as a member of the Executive Committee of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, which has been tasked with proposing an appropriate permanent memorial in Washington, DC, for President Eisenhower, who served as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe in World War II and subsequently as the 34th President of the United States. Having served on that Commission since my first term in Congress, I have had many opportunities to review and reflect upon the outstanding legacy of service that Dwight Eisenhower selflessly provided to the American people. One of the best discussions of the Eisenhower legacy that I have examined, however, is the foreword that Professor Louis Galambos recently drafted for the Report on the Legacy Committee on Dwight David Eisenhower's Military Achievements, Presidential Accomplishments and Lifetime of Public Service, which was presented to our Commission in December 2002. Professor Galambos chairs this committee, and I ask unanimous consent to include his foreword in the Record at this point. Foreword (By Professor Louis Galambos) Dwight David Eisenhower left the United States of America and its people a great legacy that deserves our respect today and in future generations. As a military leader, as the nation's President, and as a citizen deeply dedicated to democracy, Eisenhower compiled a record of public service that has won for him a unique place in the history of this country and the world in the twentieth century. In the realm of military and national security affairs, Eisenhower's vision, his character, and his outstanding leadership are analyzed in the following report by General Andrew J. Goodpaster, chair; Robert R. Bowie, and Carlo D'Este. As supreme commander of the Allied military coalition in World War II--in the Mediterranean and then in Northwest Europe--General Eisenhower made the crucial and frequently controversial decisions that led to victory. He held together the military alliance. The shining moment for his command came at D-Day in early June 1944, when he led his successful Allied forces in the greatest amphibious invasion in history. By the war's end in 1945, he was one of the most acclaimed men of the century, and in the years that followed, this distinguished public servant was in turn Chief of Staff of the Army, President of Columbia University, and first supreme commander of the military forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He relentlessly promoted unity among the nations allied in opposition to communist aggression, as he did among the services in the U.S. military establishment. One of his most important innovations after he became President of the United States was to place all military operations in a unified command structure. As President, he led the nation through repeated challenges from the U.S.S.R. and China and developed the basic strategy that would guide our policy for the remaining three decades before the Soviet collapse. He was masterful in his handling of the Suez Crisis in 1956-57, and it was a tribute to his leadership that he was able to keep the alliance with our leading European allies together after peace was restored. The Eisenhower Presidency (1953-61) was distinguished above all by peace and prosperity. As the report by Daun van Ee (chairman), Michael J. Birkner, and John H. Morrow, Jr., demonstrates, Eisenhower, who was firm when directly challenged, was nevertheless always prepared to make the kind of fruitful compromises that were as essential to international relations as they were to democratic government at home. He brought the Korean War to an end and then prepared the U.S. defense establishment for a long struggle to maintain the containment policy without damaging the American economy or breaking down the civil liberties that were essential after the Soviet Union launched its Sputnik earth satellite in 1957. Fear that the United States had fallen behind the communist countries and was threatened by long-rang atomic attacks yielded a sense of panic and a rush to respond. Eisenhower responded by calming the public fear while guiding the government towards eventual victory, both in space and armaments, at a reasonable cost. Steering between war and conciliation, President Eisenhower dealt forcefully with the Chinese effort to seize the islands off the mainland held by America's Chinese Nationalist allies. Through-out, he insisted on a show of good faith before he would negotiate in summit conferences, and he sought always to avoid unrealistic expectations about what such meetings could accomplish. As the French and British empires collapsed, he worked hard to maintain the support of these allies in Europe while helping to ease them out of their colonial possessions. At home, he stayed on the Middle Way, seeking to balance the budget (a goal achieved for three budget years), facilitate creative change in civil rights for African-Americans, and promote economic development with a new federally sponsored interstate highway system. Challenged on civil rights in Little Rock, Arkansas, he forcefully demonstrated that neither mobs nor a belligerent governor could defy the federal courts. The keys to his leadership as president were ``strength and civility.'' Eisenhower's presidency was indeed a triumph of character. Central to the Eisenhower legacy was his relationship to the American public, a relationship based securely on a shared democratic ethic. Michael Beschloss (chairman), Kiron Skinner, and Richard Norton Smith explore the manner in which Eisenhower's basic values were shaped by his upbringing in Abilene, Kansas, where he learned from an early age to balance team play with leadership, cooperation with competition, and individual striving with service to others. In the years that followed he never lost his faith in the ability of the people to decide for themselves who their leaders should be and what policies they should implement. His values were reinforced at the U.S. Military Academy, and the motto ``Duty, Honor, Country,'' became the bedrock for his life of service to the nation. In effect, the story of that life of service became an essential part of his legacy to the people he loved and led. As a leader, he was interested in making society and its basic institutions successful and efficient. Precise about responsibilities and authority, he was a relentlessly positive and forceful commander and executive. He worked endlessly and effectively to promote cooperation and compromise in every institution he served. His conviction as President that the middle way between extremes was the best way for a democracy to succeed was deeply grounded in his fundamental values and his experiences as a military officer, president of a leading educational institution, and commander of the military forces in Europe for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. While promoting individualism and cooperation, he fully understood that the United States could not always avoid conflict and needed strong national programs if the country was going to continue to lead the free world against communist aggression. He improved and strengthened the nation's military forces, established the guiding principles for U.S. exploration of space, and promoted the transportation infrastructure the country needed for national security and economic prosperity. By blending traditional American values with a vigorous emphasis upon internationalism, he helped usher the nation into a new age. Madam Speaker, history marches on, and it is fitting that our State honors one who spent his formative years in Kansas with this resolution today. As the Kansas delegation's lone Democrat, however, I feel I should say a few [[Page 7407]] words about Governor George Washington Glick, whose statue will now be removed to a place of honor in the Kansas State Capitol in Topeka. George Glick was the first Democrat to be elected Governor of Kansas, in 1882; his statute was sent to the U.S. Capitol in 1914, which was the only time in the 20th century when Kansas had both a Democratic governor and a Democratically-controlled Legislature. Governor Glick is also remembered for establishing a livestock sanitary commission that curbed an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. I know that many Kansas students of history will welcome the return of his statute to our home State, and I thank my delegation colleagues for their collegial work in support of this measure. Mr. NEY. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 84. The question was taken; and (two-thirds having voted in favor thereof) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________ GENERAL LEAVE Mr. NEY. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of H. Con. Res. 84, the concurrent resolution just agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. ____________________ PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO ASSIST CALIFORNIA IN PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL SERVICES IN YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK Mr. RADANOVICH. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 620) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide supplemental funding and other services that are necessary to assist the State of California or local educational agencies in California in providing educational services for students attending schools located within the Park, as amended. The Clerk read as follows: H.R. 620 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The three elementary schools serving the children of employees of Yosemite National Park are served by the Bass Lake Joint Union Elementary School District and the Mariposa Unified School District. (2) The schools are in remote mountainous areas and long distances from other educational and administrative facilities of the two local educational agencies. (3) Because of their remote locations and relatively small number of students, schools serving the children of employees of the Park provide fewer services in more basic facilities than the educational services and facilities provided to students that attend other schools served by the two local educational agencies. (4) Because of the long distances involved and adverse weather and road conditions that occur during much of the school year, it is impractical for the children of employees of the Park who live within or near the Park to attend other schools served by the two local educational agencies. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide supplemental funding and other services that are necessary to assist the State of California or local educational agencies in California in providing educational services for students attending schools located within the Park. SEC. 2. PAYMENTS FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. (a) Authority to Provide Funds.--For fiscal years 2003 through 2007, the Secretary may provide funds to the Bass Lake Joint Union Elementary School District and the Mariposa Unified School District for educational services to students who are dependents of persons engaged in the administration, operation, and maintenance of the Park or students who live at or near the Park upon real property of the United States. (b) Limitation on Use of Funds.--Payments made by the Secretary under this section may not be used for new construction, construction contracts, or major capital improvements, and may be used only to pay public employees for services otherwise authorized by this Act. (c) Limitation on Amount of Funds.--Payments made under this section shall not exceed the lesser of $400,000 in any fiscal year or the amount necessary to provide students described in subsection (a) with educational services that are normally provided and generally available to students who attend public schools elsewhere in the State of California. (d) Adjustment of Payments.--Subject to subsection (c), the Secretary is authorized to adjust payments made under this section if the State of California or the appropriate local education agencies do not continue to provide funding for educational services at Park schools at per student levels that are equal to or greater than those provided in the fiscal year immediately prior to the date of the enactment of this section. (e) Source of Payments.-- (1) Authorized sources.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), in order to make payments under this section, the Secretary may use funds available to the National Park Service from appropriations, donations, or fees. (2) Exceptions.--Funds from the following sources may not be used to make payments under this section: (A) Fees authorized and collected under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-4 et seq,). (B) The recreational fee demonstration program under section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 (as contained in section 101(c) of Public Law 104-134; 16 U.S.C. 460l-6a note). (C) The national park passport program established under section 602 of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (16 U.S.C. 5992). (D) Emergency appropriations for Yosemite flood recovery. (f) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act, the following definitions apply: (1) Local educational agencies.--The term ``local educational agencies'' has the meaning given that term in section 9101(26) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. (2) Educational services.--The term ``educational services'' means services that may include maintenance and minor upgrades of facilities and transportation to and from school. (3) Park.--The term ``Park'' means Yosemite National Park. (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR PARK FACILITIES TO BE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK. Section 814(c) of the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 (16 U.S.C. 346e) is amended-- (1) in the first sentence-- (A) inserting ``and Yosemite National Park'' after ``Zion National Park''; and inserting ``transportation systems and'' before ``the establishment of''; and (2) by striking ``park'' each place it appears and inserting ``parks''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich). Mr. RADANOVICH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 620, authored by me, would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide supplemental funding and other services necessary to assist local school districts in providing educational services for students attending three schools located within Yosemite National Park. The three schools in question are Yosemite Valley, which serves 46 students K-8; El Portel Elementary, which serves 50 students in seven grades; and Wawona Elementary, which serves 20 children in grades K-8 with only one teacher. All three schools represent those one-room schools of yesteryear. Madam Speaker, California is unique in that operating funds for schools are based on an average daily attendance. Since the devastating 1997 Merced River flood, there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of park employees and, thus, fewer school children attending these schools. With fewer and fewer children attending these schools, fewer State dollars are committed. The result is that the superintendent for Yosemite National Park and the concessionaire serving park visitors are attracting less-than-qualified candidates to work in the park because families are not provided with adequate schools. Meanwhile, while Federal funding sources such as Impact Aid and payment in lieu of [[Page 7408]] taxes, or PILT, are made available to Mariposa and Madera Counties where these three schools exist and through which this money is distributed, the reality is very few of these dollars are actually used to fund these classrooms. In light of these realities, I was able to secure special funding in the amount of $111,000 in the fiscal year 2002 Interior appropriations bill for these schools. However, going to appropriators every year for this critical assistance is not the most productive approach. Therefore, for the reasons I have outlined, the solution before the House today is the best long-term approach to this problem. During subcommittee and committee consideration in the 107th Congress, I made a number of changes to the bill that addressed issues raised by the administration, members of the Committee on Resources and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. For example, the bill makes it clear that funds made available by the Secretary under H.R. 620 will not go towards new construction, construction contracts, or major capital improvements and thus would be limited to general upkeep, maintenance, and classroom teaching. Madam Speaker, I do not think that we should stand by and permit children of the Park Service and concessionaire employees from being deprived of their education simply because their parents have chosen to work in Yosemite National Park. {time} 1430 Lastly, the bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to locate facilities including transportation systems outside the boundaries of the Yosemite National Park. H.R. 620 is supported by the minority and majority of the Committee on Resources and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 620, as amended. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, we have no objections to this legislation in its current form and would encourage our colleagues to support its passage. H.R. 620 provides a unique arrangement for funding certain local public schools. The legislation authorizes the National Park Service to provide funds and services to supplement the educational services and facilities provided to children of Yosemite National Park employees and the park concessionaire at three small local schools located within the park system. Similar legislation was considered in the 107th Congress. Initially, a significant number of issues and problems were associated with that bill; however, the sponsor, the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich), agreed to a number of changes requested by the minority and the administration; and it appears as if we have worked out some of those concerns. There were also changes made to the bill as a result of negotiations with the Committee on Education and the Workforce that holds joint jurisdiction with the Committee on Resources over this matter. As a result of those changes, the bill passed the House in April of 2002. H.R. 620 is essentially the same bill that was passed through the House last year with limitations on the amount, use, source, and duration of the funds for these local schools. Of particular note, while the bill authorizes the use of appropriated funds, it is our expectation that these will be newly appropriated funds and not come from the existing operating budget within the park system. Yosemite National Park, like many other national parks, has significant operating challenges. The park can ill afford to divert operating funds to a nonoperations function. Madam Speaker, as I noted earlier, this legislation does provide a unique arrangement for funding what should be a local responsibility. However, we have no objection to the bill's consideration, and again we encourage its passage here today. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RADANOVICH. Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Emerson). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 620, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds having voted in favor thereof) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________ GLEN CANYON NATIONAL RECREATION AREA BOUNDARY REVISION ACT Mr. RADANOVICH. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 788) to revise the boundary of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in the States of Utah and Arizona. The Clerk read as follows: H.R. 788 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Glen Canyon National Recreation Area Boundary Revision Act''. SEC. 2. GLEN CANYON NATIONAL RECREATION AREA BOUNDARY REVISION. (a) In General.--The first section of Public Law 92-593 (16 U.S.C. 460dd; 86 Stat. 1311) is amended-- (1) striking ``That in'' and inserting ``Section 1. (a) In''; and (2) by adding at the end the following: ``(b) In addition to the boundary change authority under subsection (a), the Secretary may acquire approximately 152 acres of private land in exchange for approximately 370 acres of land within the boundary of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, as generally depicted on the map entitled `Page One Land Exchange Proposal', number 608/60573a-2002, and dated May 16, 2002. The map shall be on file and available for public inspection in the appropriate offices of the National Park Service. Upon conclusion of the exchange, the boundary of the recreation area shall be revised to reflect the exchange.''. (b) Change in Acreage Ceiling.--Such section is further amended by striking ``one million two hundred and thirty-six thousand eight hundred and eighty acres'' and inserting ``1,256,000 acres''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich). Mr. RADANOVICH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, H.R. 788, as introduced by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon), would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to complete a land exchange that would help protect an important viewshed located in southern Utah at the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and revise the boundaries of the park to reflect the change. The exchange would facilitate the acquisition of 152 acres, including an important scenic viewshed by the National Park Service, while the private developer would acquire 370 acres of land on the other side of Highway 89 that is more appropriate for development. The parcel acquired by the Park Service will also help facilitate a more manageable boundary at the park's most visited entrance. While the Park Service will be acquiring land of considerably greater value than the developer, the private developer has expressed his willingness to donate the approximately $350,000 difference in value to the National Park Service. Both parties consider the exchange to be mutually beneficial. The House passed legislation containing this same exchange during the 107th Congress. The bill is supported, as it was during the last Congress, by both the majority and the minority as well as the administration, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, we also support the passage of H.R. 788, a bill which is similar to legislation which passed the House in June of last year. It must be said, however, that there continues to [[Page 7409]] be great concern regarding most cases where public land owned by the American taxpayer is exchanged for private land. In many instances it is not at all clear that the taxpayers are receiving full value for the lands being traded away in their names. In fact, in many cases it is clear that they are not. We have been working with our friends on the other side of the aisle and the Federal Land Management agencies to develop a more comprehensive approach to exchanges that might address the failures in the current process, and we look forward to continuing those efforts. In the meantime, it is our hope that we would only approve specific exchanges that truly serve the best interests of the American taxpayer. Fortunately, it appears we have such an exchange in this instance. The basic concept of the exchange contained in H.R. 788 appears to serve both the interests of the private landowner as well as the park. In addition, once authorized, this exchange will go through a full NEPA process, including appraisals, which should identify and address any remaining issues. We commend the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon) on his legislation and support passage of H.R. 788 and encourage our colleagues to do the same. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RADANOVICH. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon). Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me this time. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 788. This bill has two purposes: first, it will revise the boundary of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Utah by exchanging 152 acres of land owned by Page One LLC for approximately 370 acres of land within the National Recreation Area. This exchange will enable both entities to consolidate the properties and make it possible for the Park Service to better protect the area around Lake Powell and Highway 89. The second purpose of the bill is to increase the acreage ceiling for the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The park's enabling legislation incorrectly identified the total acreage within the park boundary. H.R. 788 will correct that error. The bill is the result of years of discussion and negotiation between Page One and the National Park Service. The Park Service has been involved from day one. The local communities have also voiced their support for this bill. In addition, the Kane County Planning and Zoning Commission, the Southern Utah Planning Advisory Council, and the National Parks Conservation Association all endorse this land exchange. H.R. 788 is a noncontroversial piece of legislation that is beneficial to the park, to the private developer, and to the public at large. I urge its support. Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RADANOVICH. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 788. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds of those present have voted in the affirmative. Mr. RADANOVICH. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________ UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN PROTECTION ACT Mr. RADANOVICH.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich). Mr. RADANOVICH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, H.R. 961, the Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act, authored by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) provides for the U.S. Geological Survey under the Department of the Interior to supplement, coordinate, and manage data collection on sediments and nutrients in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. The data would be used to provide the baseline data and modeling tools needed to make scientifically sound and cost-effective river management decisions. The legislation includes a provision requiring landowner permission prior to disseminating information from monitoring stations located at private lands to protect the privacy of individual property owners. Finally, it provides for the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive water resources assessment of the Upper Mississippi River Basin. I urge adoption of this bill. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I want to, first of all, thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo), the Chair of the Committee on Resources, and the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall), the ranking member, including their entire staff for the help and assistance that they provided in this legislation. It is a bill that has received wide bipartisan support. In fact, it passed the House last year. We were unable to get it on the unanimous consent calendar in the Senate; so we are back here today to move the process along. But it is a process that has been in the works for quite a few years, Madam Speaker. I have been fortunate enough to spend nearly my entire life alongside one of the greatest national treasures that exists in this great country, the Mississippi River Basin. Like so many others, I grew up enjoying the diverse recreational activities: swimming, boating, fishing, hunting along the river's shore. It was a true Tom Sawyer type of childhood. In fact, it is the background or context to a couple of the greatest American novels written in American literature by Mark Twain, ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' and ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.'' As a young boy, though, back in the 1960s growing up, I noticed some problems that the river basin was having. [[Page 7411]] Going to some of my favorite swimming beaches, they would be closed from time to time because of high bacteria count; or going to some of my favorite fishing holes, there would be signs posted warning not to eat the fish that we were catching from the river because of high mercury count. And as a young boy growing up and seeing that, I knew something was not right. A lot of progress has, however, been made in regards to the health and sustainability of the Mississippi River Basin. With the passage of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, significant progress has been made. But it is still an incredible national treasure and ecosystem that faces many challenges. In fact, if one were to consult with most river basin experts, they will tell them that the greatest challenge that the basin faces today is the amount of sediments and nutrients flowing into the river basin, affecting the quality of the water supply, destroying the natural habitat, filling in the back bays. Why is this important? It is, first and foremost, the primary drinking source for over 22 million Americans who rely on the river basin and the river's tributaries for their water needs. It is also North America's largest migratory route with over 40 percent of water fowl species using the Mississippi River Basin as the main corridor during their migration route in the spring and fall every year. It also is a multifaceted, multiuse river system with incredible economic advantages, given the commercial navigation that takes place on the river, hundreds of millions of tons of product, a lot of it agricultural product, on barges being used to transport the product to market. It has just in the upper Mississippi River Basin alone a $1.2 billion recreation impact for the communities within the basin, a $6.6 billion tourism impact. This year we are going to be celebrating the 100th anniversary of the National Refuge System. The Upper Mississippi River Wildlife Refuge is the largest refuge system in the entire country. In fact, most people are surprised to learn that we have more visitors to the Upper Mississippi Wildlife Refuge than they have in the entire Yellowstone National Park System every year. Farmers rely on the health and sustainability of the river basin. That is one of the reasons we have the fertile farmlands in middle America today. Yet every year our farmers are losing topsoil; they are losing over $300 million worth of applied nitrogen that ultimately flows into the river basin and has an ecosystem impact on it. That is what we are trying to correct with this legislation, Madam Speaker. H.R. 961 authorizes the U.S. Geological Survey to coordinate and integrate Federal, State, and local government agencies' efforts, develop guidelines for data collection and storage, and establish an electronic database system to store and disseminate the information. USGS would also establish a state-of-the-art computer modeling program to identify significant nutrient and sediment sources at the subwatershed level to better target reduction efforts. H.R. 961 includes strong protections for the privacy of personal data collected and used in the monitoring and modeling of activities. {time} 1445 Input from farmers, the navigation industry, sporting groups, environmental organizations, government agencies, was solicited and used for this legislation. The legislation also fits with the recommendations of the Mississippi River Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force for reducing, mitigating and controlling the hypoxia problem in the Gulf of Mexico. It was a report that was formally submitted to the Congress for our consideration in January of 2001, and many of the recommendations and proposals contained in this legislation tracks those recommendations significantly with the task force and the work that they had done. Amazingly enough, in the course of our work and putting this legislation together, I discovered that there were also 77 nonpublic private entities doing some form of water quality testing along the Mississippi River Basin. Unfortunately, because the data was not standardized, it was not being collected and it was not being pooled in order to get the complete snapshot of what was happening throughout the river basin. What this legislation will do is try to coordinate those levels, from the public sector to the private sector, giving USGS the lead, given their expertise in doing a lot of the water quality and modeling and monitoring that they are already involved in, but to expand it, so we have a complete scientific picture of what is taking place in this valuable ecosystem, so we will know how better to direct the limited resources that we have to optimize the programs that exist, or perhaps create some new programs in order to accomplish the ultimate reduction in the flow of sediments and nutrients that affect the river system. In the Upper Mississippi alone, in order to maintain the navigable channels for commercial navigation, we are spending over $100 million a year just in dredging costs. So I think there is a significant budgetary impact by getting the science right and getting it in place so that we can reduce that sediment and, therefore, hopefully also have an opportunity of reducing the cost of dredging to maintain the important commercial navigation that exists along the river. We have worked very closely with the five States in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. In fact, the governors recently submitted a letter to the administration and the Congress basically calling for this type of scientific, comprehensive approach in dealing with the nutrient and sediment flows that affect their regions. That is what we are trying to accomplish here. Madam Speaker, obviously with this personal background and experience and the work I have done on the river basin, I feel a certain individual responsibility to try to provide some focus on this incredibly important national treasure that we have in the Mississippi River Basin, a treasure that I feel has gone neglected for too long. One of my first goals in coming to the United States Congress was to help form a bipartisan Mississippi River Caucus between the North and the South so we can get together from time to time and discuss the issues that affect our specific geographic areas, but also how we share this one continuous ecosystem and what we can do, working together, to better preserve and protect it and make sure it is sustainable, so not only can we use it, but our children and grandchildren will be able to benefit from its use. So I thank the members on the Mississippi River Caucus for the support that they gave to this legislation. All of them were original cosponsors of the bill. I want to especially thank the co-chairs of the Upper Mississippi River Caucus, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello), the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Leach) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht), who I have worked closely with on this legislation, for the help and support they have given, as well as the cochairs of the overall Mississippi River Caucus, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Hulshof) and the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Boswell). I thank them for their support of this legislation. In addition, I want to thank Holly Stoerker of the Upper Mississippi River Basin Association, Doug Daigle of the Mississippi River Basin Alliance, Dr. Jerry Schnoor of the University of Iowa, and especially Dr. Barry Drazkowski and the administration and staff at St. Mary's University in Minnesota. Their expertise and work was essential in crafting this legislation, and I am very thankful for their assistance. Also greatly appreciated is the tireless work of Allen Hance of the Northeast Midwest Institute and former Sea Grant fellows in my office, Jeff Stein, Ed Buckner, Laura Cimo and currently Melissa Woods, who consulted with stakeholders throughout the region. Their efforts were essential in shaping and reshaping this legislation into a focused, effective bill with broad support. I also want to especially pay particular thanks to some staff members who have given a couple quarts of their [[Page 7412]] own blood in order to reach the consensus that we have established with this bill, namely Brad Pfaff, Ben Proctor and Darrin Schrader, with the countless hours they put in crafting this important piece of legislation. Finally, I want to thank the members of my Mississippi River Advisory Group back home for their help and input throughout the process. H.R. 961 represents a commonsense move toward building the scientific foundation necessary to remedy nutrient and sediment problems in the region. I believe this is a needed, cost-effective step in preserving the upper Mississippi River Basin and its multi-use heritage for future generations. I also believe it could provide a wonderful model for similar types of scientific modeling and monitoring efforts in other river basins and watershed areas throughout the entire country. So, I again thank my colleague for his support of the legislation. It has wide bipartisan support, and I would encourage its passage today. Mr. POMBO. Madam Speaker, I would like to enter the following letter into the Record. March 24, 2003. Hon. Don Young, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: H.R. 961, a bill to promote Department of the Interior efforts to provide a scientific basis for the management of sediment and nutrient loss in the Upper Mississippi River Basin, and for other purposes, has been initially referred to the Committee on Resources. To allow this bill to be considered by the House of Representatives tomorrow, I ask that you forego a referral of the bill. Of course, by allowing this to occur, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive its jurisdiction over H.R. 961 or any other similar matter. If a conference on H.R. 961 or a similar bill becomes necessary, I would support the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's request to be named to the conference. Finally, this action should not be seen as precedent for any Committee on Resources bills which affect the Committee on Transportation and Infrastruction's jurisdiction. I would be pleased to enter this letter and your response in the Congressional Record during debate on this bill to document this agreement. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter, and I look forward to working with you and your staff on other matters of shared concern in the coming months. Sincerely, Richard W. Pombo, Chairman. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Speaker, I would like to enter the following letter into the Record. March 24, 2003. Hon. Richard W. Pombo, Chairman, Committee on Resources, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Pombo: Thank you for your letter with regard to H.R. 961, the Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act which provides for sediment and nutrient monitoring of the watershed. I recognize your desire to bring this bill before the House in an expeditious manner and will not exercise my Committee's right to a sequential referral of the legislation. By agreeing to waive its consideration of the bill, however, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive its jurisdiction over H.R. 961. In addition, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee reserves its authority to seek conferees on provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference that may be convened on this legislation. I thank you for your commitment in advance to support any request by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for conferees on H.R. 961. Your cooperation in this matter is very much appreciated. Sincerely, Don Young, Chairman. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 961, the Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act. This bipartisan bill is the result of efforts to bring farmers, sportsmen's groups, conservation organizations, and government agencies together to develop a strategy to monitor water quality in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. H.R. 961 provides a coordinated, public-private approach to reducing nutrient and sediment losses in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Relying on existing federal, state and local programs, the bill establishes a water quality monitoring network and an integrated computer-modeling program. These monitoring and modeling efforts will provide the data needed to make scientifically and economically sound conservation decisions that will benefit southern Minnesota and the Nation. Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I yield back balance of my time. Mr. RADANOVICH. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Emerson).

Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all of my colleagues in the House join me for a moment of silence as we commemorate the young men and women of the 507th Maintenance Group and the 11th Air Defense Artillery. One of my constituents, Brandon Sloan, is among those groups of young people. He is a graduate of Bedford High School. His father is Reverend Thandie Sloan, his mother Michelle. His father is a minister at Greater Friendship Baptist Church in my congressional district. I ask that my colleagues join me in two moments of silence at the end of this statement as we pray for these families and the safe return of those young men and women. ____________________ CYPRUS PEACE SETTLEMENT (Mr. BEREUTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks and include therein extraneous material.) Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Speaker, last November U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan proposed a comprehensive framework for a just and lasting settlement of the Cyprus problem. He then [[Page 7415]] asked the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders to accept the plan by February 28. Because of the forthcoming EU membership for at least the Greek portion of Cyprus and other factors of leverage, this was the best opportunity in decades for a solution to the Cyprus problem. When neither side could resolve their problems by the end of February, the Secretary General asked the two leaders to meet in The Hague on March 10 to sign an agreement to put the framework to simultaneous referenda on the island. Two weeks ago, we learned with great disappointment that the Secretary General was told by Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash that he could not accept the settlement plan and would not agree to the referenda despite the fact that informal polling indicated that the majority of the Turkish Cypriots were prepared to support the plan. Mr. Speaker, this Member urges the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to quickly resume negotiations to resolve this problem, to seize this rare opportunity for a peaceful settlement and urge the United Nations and the Bush administration to redouble their efforts to get the talks going once again, and to seek a Cyprus solution which at long last seems to be within our grasp. Mr. Speaker, it was highly regrettable, to this Member, that Mr. Denktash refused to let the Turkish Cypriot people have the opportunity to determine their own future on an agreement which would have reunited the island and which would have served the best interests of the Turkish Cypriot community. This Member was also disappointed with the government of Turkey for their apparent unwillingness to exert influence on Mr. Denktash to agree to the plan at such a critical time. Attached is a recent editorial from The Economist on this subject. [From the Economist, Mar. 13, 2003] Settling Cyprus--What a Waste the collapse of talks to reunite the island marks a stupidly missed opportunity Over the years it has been hard to apportion blame for the failure of the divided island's Greek and Turkish leaders to strike a deal to give their people security and prosperity in a loosely federal but reunited Cyprus. Recently, under the blandishments of the United Nations and the European Union, they had come within finger-touching distance of a settlement. All the sadder, then, that this week the Turkish- Cypriots' truculent leader, Rauf Denktash, rejected the UN's sensible proposals for a deal. The government in mainland Turkey must also share blame by failing to bludgeon Mr. Denktash into accepting the plan. A further gloomy outcome is that, while the island's Greek-run part will almost certainly join the EU on its own next year and the Turkish part will fester in isolation and poverty, mainland Turkey's own hopes of starting negotiations to join the Union have been dented too. Both of the island's communities had a lot to gain. The Turks would have given back control of around 8% of the island's territory to the Greeks--a substantial chunk of the land taken in 1974 when the Turkish army intervened after a short-lived Greek-Cypriot coup on the island. The Turks, 18% of the population before the invasion, have since held 37% of the land. The Greek-Cypriots' new president, Tassos Papadopoulos, at first complained that the latest UN compromise did not adequately address his people's grievances. But he wisely accepted it. This time it is overwhelmingly Mr. Denktash's fault that a settlement has been blocked. Indeed, the Turks had even more to gain than the Greeks. They would have kept a vast amount of autonomy in their still disproportionately large zone. They would have enjoyed an influx of EU cash had the whole island been joining the Union next year, not to mention the rapid lifting of sanctions long imposed by the EU against their breakaway statelet. The Turkish government may have been too preoccupied by the political wrangling and tortuous diplomacy over Iraq (see article). Many of Turkey's still-too-influential generals see the Turkish-run bit of Cyprus as a strategic asset, while some Turkish politicians regard the island as a bargaining chip in Turkey's quest to join the EU. They are wrong. Turkey's failure to persuade Mr. Denktash to say yes to compromise will make it much harder for the EU to smile on its application, due for consideration at the end of next year, to start negotiations to join. Many governments are already queasy about the idea of Turkey as a fellow Euro-club member. what next? The UN's secretary-general, Kofi Annan, had suggested a ruse to force Mr. Denktash's hand and to strengthen that of the Greek-Cypriots' leader by holding a referendum on the proposals next month--on both sides of the island. Both communities would probably have said yes. But Mr. Denktash wrecked that idea too. If stalemate prevails, as seems likely, Mr. Annan says he will abandon all further efforts to settle Cyprus during his time as UN boss. It would then be up to the EU to reopen proceedings. By the end of this year the Turkish-Cypriots are due for a general election. Mr. Denktash's opponents on his own side of the island, who approved of Mr. Annan's plan, may well take power in parliament but the presidential term has a few years yet to run. One day, perhaps mercifully soon, the ailing Mr. Denktash will go. Then, maybe, a fair deal can at last be done. But a golden chance has been stupidly wasted. ____________________ SPECIAL ORDERS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bradley of New Hampshire). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 7, 2003, and under a previous order of the House, the following Members will be recognized for 5 minutes each. ____________________ GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) is recognized for 5 minutes. General Leave Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, today I proudly rise to celebrate Greek Independence Day and the strong ties that bind the nation of Greece and the United States. 182 years ago exactly on this date, the people of Greece began a journey that would mark the symbolic rebirth of democracy in the land where those principles for human dignity were first espoused. They rebelled against more than 400 years, 400 years of Turkish oppression. The revolution of 1821 brought independence to Greece and emboldened those who still sought freedom across the world. I commemorate Greek Independence Day each year for the same reasons that we celebrate our Fourth of July. It proved that a united people through sheer will and perseverance can prevail against tyranny. Men such as Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, and Euripides developed the then unique notion that men could, if left to their own devices, lead themselves rather than be subject to the will of a sovereign. It was Aristotle who said: ``We make war that we may live in peace,'' a timely statement considering today's events. On March 25, 1821, Archbishop Germanos of Patras embodied the spirit of those words when he raised the flag of freedom and was the first to declare Greece free. Revolutions embody a sense of heroism, Mr. Speaker, bringing forth a greatness of the human spirit. As Thomas Jefferson once said: ``To the ancient Greeks we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves, American colonists, out of Gothic darkness.'' Quoting Jefferson on the anniversary of Greek independence is particularly appropriate. Jefferson and the rest of the Founding Fathers looked back to the teachings of ancient Greek philosophers for inspiration as they sought to craft a strong democratic state. In 1821, the Greeks looked to our Founding Fathers for inspiration when they began their journey toward freedom. We all know that the price of liberty can be very high. History is replete with the names of the millions that have sacrificed for it. Many great scholars throughout history warn that we maintain democracy only at great cost. The freedom we enjoy today is due, to a large degree, to the sacrifices made by men and women in the past in Greece, in America and all over the world. Freedom is America's heart. It is central to our being, and from the beginning we have recognized that freedom is not just an American right. It is a God-given right to every citizen of the world. [[Page 7416]] Even as we commemorate Greek Independence Day, American ser- vicemembers are fighting to liberate the Iraqi people who have suffered for decades under Saddam Hussein's brutal regime. We must never forget that freedom must be constantly guarded. It is a noble, but fragile, thing that can be stolen or snuffed out if not protected. We cannot take for granted that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. We enjoy our freedom only because we have been willing to fight and die for it, just like our forefathers and the valiant Greeks in 1821. Mr. Speaker, on this 182nd birthday of Greek independence, when we celebrate the restoration of democracy to the land of its conception, we also celebrate the triumph of the human spirit and the strength of man's will. The goals and values that the people of Greece share with the people of the United States reaffirm our common democratic heritage. This occasion also serves to remind us that we must never take for granted the right to determine our own fate. Mr. Speaker, today I proudly rise to celebrate Greek Independence Day and the strong ties that bind the nation of Greece and the United States. One hundred and eighty two years ago, the people of Greece began a journey that would mark the symbolic rebirth of democracy in the land where those principles to human dignity were first espoused. They rebelled against more than 400 years of Turkish oppression. The revolution of 1821 brought independence to Greece and emboldened those who still sought freedom across the world. I commemorate Greek Independence Day each year for the same reasons we celebrate our Fourth of July. It proved that a united people, through sheer will and perseverance, can prevail against tyranny. The lessons the Greeks and our colonial forefathers taught us provide hope and inspiration to victims of persecution throughout the world today. Men such as Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, and Euripides developed the then-unique notion that men could, if left to their own devices, lead themselves rather than be subject to the will of a sovereign. It was Aristotle who said: ``We make war that we may live in peace.'' On March 25, 1821, Archbishop Germanos of Patras embodied the spirit of those words when he raised the flag of freedom and was the first to declare Greece free. Revolutions embody a sense of heroism, bringing forth the greatness of the human spirit. It was Thomas Jefferson who said that, ``One man with courage is a majority.'' Quoting Jefferson on the anniversary of Greek independence is particularly appropriate. Jefferson, and the rest of the Founding Fathers, looked back to the teachings of ancient Greek philosophers for inspiration as they sought to craft a strong democratic state. And in 1821, the Greeks looked to our Founding Fathers for inspiration when they began their journey toward freedom. The history of Greek independence, like that of the American Revolution, is filled with many stories of courage and heroism. There are many parallels between the American and Greek Revolutions. Encouraged by the American Revolution, the Greeks began their rebellion after four centuries of Turkish oppression, facing what appeared to be insurmountable odds. Both nations faced the prospect of having to defeat an empire to obtain liberty. And if Samuel Adams, the American revolutionary leader who lighted the first spark of rebellion by leading the Boston Tea Party, had a Greek counterpart, that man would be Alexander Ypsilantis. Ypsilantis was born in Istanbul, and his family was later exiled to Russia. Ypsilantis served in the Russian army, and it was there, during his military service, that he became involved with a secret society called the ``Philike Hetairia,'' which translated means ``friendly society.'' The ``friendly society'' was made up of merchants and other Greek leaders, but the intent of the society was to seek freedom for Greece and her people. The group planned a secret uprising for 1821 to be led by Ypsilantis. He and 4,500 volunteers assembled near the Russian border to launch an insurrection against the Turks. The Turkish army massacred the ill- prepared Greek volunteers, and Ypsilantis was caught and placed in prison, where he subsequently died. However, the first bells of liberty had been rung, and Greek independence would not be stopped. When news of Greek uprisings spread, the Turks killed Greek clergymen, clerics, and laity in a frightening display of force. In a vicious act of vengeance, the Turks invaded the island of Chios and slaughtered 25,000 of the local residents. The invaders enslaved half the island's population of 100,000. Although many lives were sacrificed at the altar of freedom, the Greek people rallied around the battle cry ``Eleftheria I Thanatos''-- liberty or death, mirroring the words of American Patriot Patrick Henry who said: ``Give me liberty or give me death.'' These words personified the Greek patriots' unmitigated desire to be free. Another heroic Greek whom many believe was the most important figure in the revolution was Theodoros Kolokotronis. He was the leader of the Klephts, a group of rebellious and resilient Greeks who refused to submit to Turkish subjugation. Kolokotronis used military strategy he learned while in the service of the English Army to organize a force of over 7,000 men. The Klephts swooped down on the Turks from their mountain strongholds, battering their oppressors into submission. One battle in particular, where Kolokotronis led his vastly outnumbered forces against the Turks, stands out. The Turks had invaded Peloponnese with 30,000 men. Kolokotronis led his force, which was outnumbered by a ratio of 4 to 1, against the Turkish army. A fierce battle ensued and many lives were lost, but after a few weeks, the Turks were forced to retreat. Kolokotronis is a revered Greek leader, because he embodied the hopes and dreams of the common man, while displaying extraordinary courage and moral fiber in the face of overwhelming odds. Athanasios Diakos was another legendary hero, a priest, a patriot, a soldier. He led 500 of his men in a noble stand against 8,000 Ottoman soldiers. Diakos' men were wiped out and he fell into the enemy's hands, where he was severely tortured before his death. He is the image of a Greek who gave all for love of faith and homeland. While individuals acts of bravery and leadership are often noted, the Greek Revolution was remarkable for the bravery and fortitude displayed by the typical Greek citizen. This heroic ideal of sacrifice and service is best demonstrated through the story of the Suliotes, villagers who took refuge from Turkish authorities in the mountains of Epiros. The fiercely patriotic Suliotes bravely fought the Turks in several battles. News of their victories spread throughout the region and encouraged other villagers to revolt. The Turkish Army acted swiftly and with overwhelming force to quell the Suliote uprising. The Suliote women were alone as their husbands battled the Turks at the front. When they learned that Turkish troops were fast approaching their village, they began to dance the ``Syrtos,'' a patriotic Greek dance. One by one, rather than face torture or enslavement at the hands of the Turks, they committed suicide by throwing themselves and their children off Mount Zalongo. They chose to die rather than surrender their freedom. The sacrifice of the Suliotes was repeated in the Arkadi Monastery of Crete. Hundreds of non-combatants, mainly the families of the Cretan freedom fighters, had taken refuge in the Monastery to escape Turkish reprisals. The Turkish army was informed that the Monastery was used by the Cretan freedom fighters as an arsenal for their war material, and they set out to seize it. As the Turkish troops were closing in, the priest gathered all the refugees in the cellar around him. With their consent, he set fire to the gunpowder kegs stored there, killing all but a few. The ruins of the Arkadi Monastery, like the ruins of our Alamo, still stand as a monument to liberty. News of the Greek revolution met with widespread feelings of compassion in the United States. The Founding Fathers eagerly expressed sentiments of support for the fledgling uprising. Several American Presidents, including James Monroe and John Quincy Adams, conveyed their support for the revolution through their annual messages to Congress. William Harrison, our ninth President, expressed his belief in freedom for Greece, saying: ``We must send our free will offering. `The must wave in the Aegean . . . a messenger of fraternity and friendship to Greece.'' Various Members of Congress also showed a keen interest in the Greeks' struggle for autonomy. Henry Clay, who in 1825 became Secretary of State, was a champion of Greece's fight for independence. Among the most vocal was Daniel Webster from Massachusetts, who frequently roused the sympathetic interest of his colleagues and other Americans in the Greek revolution. It should not surprise us that our Founding Fathers would express such keen support for Greek independence, for they themselves had been inspired by the ancient Greeks in their own struggle for freedom. As Thomas Jefferson once said, ``To the ancient Greeks . . . we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves . . . American colonists, out of gothic [[Page 7417]] darkness.'' Our two nations share a brotherhood bonded by the common blood of democracy, birthed by Lady Liberty, and committed to the ideal that each individual deserves the right of self-determination. We all know that the price of liberty can be very high--history is replete with the names of the millions who have sacrificed for it. Many great scholars throughout history warned that we maintain democracy only at great cost. The freedom we enjoy today is due to a large degree to the sacrifices made by men and women in the past--in Greece, in America, and all over the world. I recount these stories because they pay homage to Greece's absolute commitment to freedom and liberty and the common bonds which we share. Unfortunately, our devotion to the principle of freedom is not shared by many people whose interests are better served by applying oppression to their own people and spreading terror elsewhere. The cowardly attack of September 11, 2001, against our great Nation backfired because these horrific acts united our country as Americans rushed to the aid of their fellow countrymen. The terrorist attacks brought out the best in America and showed the world that ordinary people like you and me will do extraordinary things when called upon. Freedom is America's heart. It is central to our being, and from the beginning we have recognized that freedom is not just an American right. It is a God-given right to every citizen of the world. Even as we commemorate Greek Independence Day, American servicemembers are fighting to liberate the Iraqi people who have suffered for decades under Saddam Hussein's brutal regime. We must not overlook those who are still fighting for their independence in other parts of the world, such as in the Republic of Cyprus. Turkey still illegally occupies Cyprus, as it has since its invasion in 1974. Finding a fair resolution for Cyprus will help stabilize a region marked more often by conflict than accord. As with so many international issues, U.S. leadership is essential to urge Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leaders toward peace. It is unfortunate that the Turkish Cypriot leadership has recently rejected the plan proposed by the U.N. Secretary General, aimed at reuniting the island under a government of shared power and having the united island admitted to the European Union. This is a vision worthy of our attention and full support because it will end the illegitimate division of Cyprus, improve the relations between Turkey and Greece and promote stability in the sensitive region of Eastern Mediterranean. We must never forget that freedom must be constantly guarded. It is a noble but fragile thing that can be stolen or snuffed out if not protected. We cannot take for granted that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. We enjoy our freedom only because we have been willing to fight and die for it, just like our forefathers and the valiant Greeks in 1821. Mr. Speaker, on this 182nd birthday of Greek Independence, when we celebrate the restoration of democracy to the land of its conception, we also celebrate the triumph of the human spirit and the strength of man's will. The goals and values that the people of Greece share with the people of the United States reaffirms our common democratic heritage. This occasion also serves to remind us that we must never take for granted the right to determine our own fate. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, today Greece celebrates its 182nd year of independence. I am here tonight to praise a society that represents, in a historical sense, the origins of what we call Western culture, and, in a contemporary sense, one of the staunchest defenders of Western society and values. There are many of us in Congress, on both sides of the spectrum, who are staunchly committed to preserving and strengthening the ties between Greek and American people. In the years since its Greek independence, Americans and Greeks have grown ever closer, bound by ties of strategic and military alliance, common values of democracy, individual freedom, human rights, and close personal friendship. The timeless values of Greek culture have endured for centuries, indeed for millennia. Four hundred years of control by the Ottoman Empire could not overcome the Greek people's determination to be free. But, I regret to say, Mr. Speaker, to this day, the Greek people must battle against oppression. For almost 28 years now, Greece has stood firm in its determination to bring freedom and independence to the illegally occupied nation of Cyprus. Given instability around the world and a war in Iraq, now is a good time to heal the wound in Cyprus that has poisoned the relations between Greece and Turkey for so many years. Mr. Speaker, that is why I was so disappointed earlier this month when I learned of the breakdown in the United Nations-sponsored Cyprus peace talks in The Hague. All of the facts lead to the inescapable conclusion that the cause of the breakdown is the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, and his supporters in Ankara. Mr. Speaker, yesterday 16 of my House colleagues joined me in sending a letter to President Bush urging that all official statements from the U.S. Government regarding the Cyprus issue place the blame for this negative outcome squarely where it belongs, with Mr. Denktash and Ankara. We also requested that the Bush administration redouble its efforts to persuade Turkey and Turkish-Cypriot leaders to work constructively within the U.N. process and framework to achieve a negotiated settlement to end the division of Cyprus. Due to the attitude of Mr. Denktash and Turkey, further progress on the U.N. plan now appears derailed. The office of the Secretary General's Special Advisor on Cyprus will be brought to a close in the coming weeks. The Secretary General has said that his plan is still on the table. It is apparent that continued division serves Mr. Denktash's narrow political interests--even if his position is completely contrary to the interests of the large majority of the Turkish Cypriots, who have made their views known in support of the U.N. process in massive demonstrations. In contrast, Mr. Speaker, Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos has pledged to continue efforts for a Cyprus settlement that would properly serve the interests of both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. Mr. Speaker, it is my expectation, and the expectation of 16 of my colleagues who joined me in sending the letter to President Bush, that the Bush administration will use all available political and diplomatic means to persuade Turkey to work constructively to resolve the Cyprus question. At a time when Turkey is interested in joining the EU, its lack of cooperation in the efforts to solve the Cyprus problem can only result in a setback for Turkey's EU candidacy. Ultimately, the victims of these shortsighted policies from Ankara and the Turkish Cypriot leadership are the people of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot community, who will continue to be deprived of an opportunity to share in the economic, social and other benefits of EU membership. Moreover, the Turkish rejection is a setback to peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, a U.S. strategic objective and long-standing policy for the region. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to work with my colleagues here in Congress to ensure that the United States government remains on the right side of this issue--because there is no gray area when it comes to this conflict. In closing I want to congratulate the Greek people for 182 years of independence and thank them for their contributions to American life. Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 182nd anniversary of Greece's modern independence, and I can think of no more fitting time to celebrate the birth place of democracy than now, when our brave men and women are overseas fighting for the very principles that the Ancient Greeks first embraced. I am proud and honored to pay tribute tonight to the more than 3 million Greek-Americans in the United States, almost 10,000 of whom reside in my congressional district. From the books that are still taught in schools, such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, to the homecoming of the Olympics in Athens, Greek culture continues to influence American life today. Greek-Americans contribute to every aspect of American culture as teachers, scientists, engineers, writers, actors, and every other occupation in the United States. Greek-Americans continue to teach us about the ideals that their great grandparents first taught the world: loyalty, pride, rugged individualism and governing for the people by the people. Greece was the world's first democracy, and now more than ever it is important to celebrate democracy at a time when Coalition forces fight to preserve it. The citizens of Iraq will soon reap the benefits of living in a democratic land, and their children will be able to grow up in a society free from tyranny. This is what we celebrate tonight on the anniversary of Greek Independence Day: the idea of living free in a society where citizens freely elect their representatives to govern them, without coercion or intimidation. Athens was the first city to say that one person does not have the right to rule by whim without the consent of the people. Saddam Hussein is a dictator. His totalitarian regime undermines human dignity. It works against, not for, the people of Iraq. Greece was the first civilization to realize this truth, and it is for this reason that tonight we celebrate its Independence Day. [[Page 7418]] We must also never forget the exceptional relations that Greece and America enjoy. As Greece continues to be a country of stability in an otherwise turbulent Balkans region, let us always remember that Greece, one of America's greatest allies, has fought with the United States in every major war from World War I to the Persian Gulf, and that it remains committed to promoting the democratic ideals that we celebrate tonight. Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of the 182nd anniversary of Greek independence. As a member of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues, I once again join my colleagues in paying tribute to the Greek nation and its people. Today in the Congress of the United States we commemorate not only the independence achieved by the Greeks in 1821, but the freedom, civil liberties and self-determination sought by people everywhere. Today is also a day to mark the longstanding special relationship between our two countries. We Americans owe a special debt of gratitude to the country upon which our democratic process is founded. Greece was the cradle of democracy, birthplace of ideals and values that shaped human history. Whenever we promote participatory democracy, public service, and equal rights, we pay testament to our shared heritage. In the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, modern day Greece was one of the first nations to offer its support to America in the struggle against terrorism so that we could create a safer world where future generations grow up in a free and open society. And during these days of war, cherished democratic principles are more vital than ever. In my district in Massachusetts, thousands of Greek American families will participate in political, religious and cultural festivities, expressing pride in their Greek heritage and patriotism in their American citizenship. I extend congratulations to them, to all the people of Greek heritage in the United States, and to the people of Greece on this important holiday. Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the Greek people and their successful struggle for independence from Ottoman occupation that began nearly 182 years ago. Greek Independence Day has special symbolic resonance for Americans. Our forefathers founded our democratic system of government on the principles of popular representation introduced to this world by the ancient Athenians. Our word democracy is, in fact, of Greek derivation and literally translates as people (``demo'') rule (``kratos''). The ancient Greek experiment with democracy, however, was a visionary aberration that was centuries ahead of its time. Democracy did not last long in Ancient Greece as the fist of empires--Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman--silenced democratic yearnings for nearly two millennia. Although democracy temporarily disappeared, the Greeks continued to thrive and prosper. As the Roman Empire expanded in the early centuries after the birth of Christ, the Greek peoples dominated the eastern half of the Roman Empire, known as Byzantium, and it was the Greek city of Constantinople where the Roman emperor Constantine converted himself and the entire Roman Empire to Christianity. After the fall of Rome in 476 AD, the Greek-led Byzantine Empire emerged as a potent force in the world and protectorate of Christian Orthodoxy. The Greeks remained strong and independent until the Central Asian Ottomans crushed the Byzantine armies and conquered the spiritual capital of the Byzantine world at Constantinople in 1453. The victory of the Ottomans cast the Greek speaking peoples into more than four hundred years of occupation. But even while under the yoke of Ottoman rule, the Greeks were an impressive force. As successful and educated merchants, many thrived in the Ottoman middle class and bolstered the Ottoman economy. Still, the Greeks were not meant to be subject peoples and they began to oppose the imperial policies of the Ottoman government. Greeks, many of whom were educated in the universities of the West, began to adopt revolutionary ideas from France, Great Britain, and the United States. The concepts of the nation-state, self-determination, and liberal democracy found their ways into the Greek villages and cities from Athens to Constantinople. On March 25, 1821, Greek patriots from the southern tip of the Peloponnese to the northern outskirts of Macedonia finally rebuked the yoke of the Ottomans and declared the independence of the Greek people from subjugation. At first, the Hellenic fighters met with violent failure, but their just cause ignited the imaginations of their people and of scores of Western philhellenes, such as the English poet Lord Byron, who left their homelands to fight and die with the Greeks for their liberation. The United States was never far from the minds of the revolutionary Greeks, nor was the struggle of the Greeks unnoticed by Americans. As Greek revolutionary commander Petros Mavromichalis, one of the founders of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of the United States in 1821, ``It is in your land that liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if we succeed in resembling you.'' By 1833, the Greeks had secured independence and with it a place in history as the first of the subjugated peoples in Europe to overthrow their Ottoman masters. As the Greek nation developed and grew, it emerged as a stalwart ally of the United States. The Greek people fought alongside the American and Allied forces in both of the world wars of the twentieth century. The Greeks again took up arms against their Ottoman foes in the First World War and then handed the Axis powers their first defeat in World War II when the Greek army pushed back the forces of Mussolini. Soon after, however, they would suffer through a long and painful Nazi occupation. After World War II, Greece became an instrumental member of the NATO alliance. Greece's strategic location made it a vital buffer between the Western Democratic world and Soviet Communism. Over the last thirty years, Greece has made major strides forward for its people. In 1974, Konstantine Karamanlis finally restored democracy to Greece, bringing representative government back to its birthplace. Greece became a member of the European Community and the powerful European Union. Today, Greece continues to move in the right direction thanks to the enlightened leadership of Prime Minister Costas Simitas. Greece currently has the honor of holding the European Union's rotating Presidency. It is working to promote peace and stability in Europe and the Middle East during challenging times. Greece and its Foreign Minister George Papandreou continue aggressive efforts to end generations of strained relations between Turkey and Greece, including actively promoting a settlement on Cyprus and helping to promote Turkey's bid for EU membership. Greece understands that a democratic Turkey belonging to the EU would serve the interests of Greece, Turkey, and all of Europe. Economically, Greece is prospering and recently became a member of the European Monetary Union. Next year, the Olympics will finally return to their birthplace in Greece where athletes and spectators from around the world will experience the warmth of Greek hospitality. Strategically, Greece remains important, especially to the United States. It is a force of stability in the volatile Balkans where it continues to promote open markets and democracy. The Greek government is also united with the United States in its war on terrorism. Over the last year Greek law enforcement and intelligence services have worked closely with U.S. authorities to shut down the November 17th terrorist group and its terrorist allies in Greece. Greece has made major arrests and has begun prosecuting terrorist leaders for their crimes. I cannot overstate the importance of strong ties between Greece and the United States. As an American citizen who believes firmly in the principles of democracy and as a representative of thousands of Greek- Americans that live in Central New Jersey, I rise today in humble recognition of Greek Independence Day. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud recognition of the 182nd anniversary of Greek Independence. This special day for Greece commemorates the end of nearly four hundred years under the rule of the Ottoman Empire and a return to its democratic roots. The political philosophies of both the United States and Greece have been challenged by oppressive powers, and both nations have proudly defended their right to self-government. After showing a desire to be free from the Ottoman Empire in 1821, Greece endured eleven long years of war to succeed in gaining independence. American and Hellenic cultures greatly respect their tradition of independence and recognize the importance of democratic principles. The United States and Greece have always enjoyed a reciprocal relationship in international and cultural endeavors. Hellenic principles resonate in our culture and politics, since the United States was founded on the principles of democracy developed thousands of years ago in the city-states of ancient Greece. Hellenic influence can even be seen in the architecture of our Capitol building. Our country has also had an influence on Greece since our Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution influenced their first Constitution. On a cultural level, I am looking forward to 2004 and the homecoming of the Olympic [[Page 7419]] Games to Athens. Since Greece resurrected the Olympics in 1896, they have symbolized peace and excellence for people around the world. Greece will undoubtedly serve as a gracious host of the Games, and the 25th Summer Olympics will prove again to the world how Hellenic ideals such as equality and friendship have stood the test of time and continue to flourish at a global level. Hellenic culture, whether through its development of democratic government or from its espousal of friendly competition, encourages people to come together amicably even during the most difficult of times. Mr. Speaker, it would be difficult to imagine a United States of America, or even the world, without the great contributions from Greece. I will continue my work in Congress to support Hellenic causes and keep the ties between our two countries strong. I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Greece on the anniversary of its independence. I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating this anniversary. ____________________ CELEBRATING GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleague and dear friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), with whom we founded and co-chair the Hellenic Caucus here in Congress; and I rise with him today to celebrate the 182nd anniversary of Greece's declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire. As many of my colleagues may know, New York City is the home of the largest Hellenic population outside of Greece and Cyprus; and historic Queens, which I have the honor of representing, is often called Little Athens because of the large influence from Greece and Cyprus in that neighborhood. I rise today to pay tribute along with the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) to the Hellenic American community, not only in the 14th Congressional District but in the entire country, for their many contributions to America; and also I rise to honor the Federation of Hellenic Societies, which will lead the Greek Independence Day Parade in Manhattan, again in my district, that pays tribute to the Olympic spirit. The grand marshal this year is Senator Schumer, who will be accompanied by the Federation president, Apostolos other major leaders from Astoria and Manhattan, Konstantis Lambrakis, Elena Maroulleti, Andreas Savva, John Zapantis, Bill Stathakoss who is the honorary president, and John Spyridakis and George Razis. Democracy traces its earliest roots back to ancient Greece and the Greeks of 1821 fought for independence from Turkey; and when they fought, they truly drew inspiration in turn from the ideals and institutions of the fledgling United States as they waged their own struggle for independence. In the year 2003, a vibrant Greek democracy serves once again as an inspiration to its neighbors and the free world. The recent apprehension of one of the 19 members of the November 17 terror group provides reassurance that Greece deals sternly and effectively with terrorists. That is one reason that in Greece this is considered as the trial of all trials. Certainly, there is every reason to welcome the fact that the group responsible for killing many people, including four American officials and a British general, is finally being brought to justice. This significant contribution to the prevention of terrorism and Greece's membership to the EU will provide Hellenes with even greater stature. The Hellenic American community shares a love of freedom, liberty, and individual rights. The friendship between our two nations is based on mutual respect, a commitment to common goals, and a sharing of fundamental values. Ties of blood and kinship also unite us. The modern community of approximately 3 million Greek Americans has established a natural and enduring bridge between our two nations. Today, we take special note of these citizens and thank them for their many contributions to our Nation's cultural, economic, and political heritage. In the coming year we look forward to the preparations for the 2004 Olympics, which will take place in their birthplace of Greece. We also look forward to progress in the reunification of Cyprus. The EU council said, ``The EU strongly supports the continuation of the Secretary General's mission of good offices and of negotiations on the basis of his proposals.'' They continued that ``it urges all parties concerned to spare no effort toward a just, viable and functional settlement and, in particular, the Turkish-Cypriot leadership to reconsider its position.'' My desire is that this Greek Independence Day be the symbol of independence for all enslaved people. Zeto e eleftheria. ____________________ {time} 1915 VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION FUND The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bradley of New Hampshire). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, in the late 1980s, Congress passed a bill that established a Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund. It was supposed to be a nonadversarial fund that was to help children and their parents when they were damaged by vaccines. We have found in the last few years that we have had a tremendous increase in the number of autistic children in America. We went from 1 in 10,000 children who are autistic to 1 in 200; and now many scientists and doctors around the world and in the United States believe it has been caused by mercury in vaccines. There is a product in vaccines called thimerosal; and 50 percent of thimerosal, which is a preservative in vaccines, is mercury. Mercury causes damage to the neurologic system and to the brain; and yet we have been putting it in needles and then into our kids for many, many years, mercury which has a cumulative effect in the brain and does cause things like autism and other neurological disorders. Most parents do not know that. When we established this fund in the late 1980s, there was a 3-year window when people could file if their children had been damaged by vaccines. Many parents with autistic children did not know about the fund until the 3 years had elapsed. We are trying to get that changed so these thousands and thousands of parents with autistic children have the opportunity to apply to that fund to get the kind of restitution that they need to take care of their kids. Many parents have gone bankrupt, have lost their homes, have had to take extra mortgages to help with their problems, and the children are never going to be completely right. If Members saw the movie Rainman, Members know what I am talking about. Mr. Speaker, each night I am coming to the floor and reading one of the thousands of letters I get from parents who have no place to turn except to the Congress. This lady who wrote this letter is named Melinda Clark from Parma, Missouri. Here is what she writes: ``My family's journey down this road began a little over 3 years ago. The day of my son's diagnosis is permanently etched in my mind. I stood there frozen in the doctor's office almost as if time stood still, and I was instantly put on autopilot. It is still painful to go back to that time in my mind. It finally explained why my precious little boy no longer uttered my name or even looked into my eyes. Oh, how I longed to hear the words 'I love you,' but those were not going to come easily. It would take numerous hours [[Page 7420]] of intense therapy to put together any sounds. With our backs against the wall, we immediately immersed ourselves into research and getting therapy treatment under way. While most kids his age enjoyed leisure time playing with toys and watching Sesame Street, my son began a time-intensive schedule of 40 hours a week of combined therapies. We started from scratch and had to first learn what exactly Nicholas knew and then work from there to fill in many gaps. ``As our research continued, I was quick to discover the use of thimerosal in many of my son's vaccines. Nicholas received his vaccines from both the county health department as well as the doctor's office. All in all, too much thimerosal was accumulated for his fragile immunity and nervous system. My investigation has been thwarted by the doctor's office from the beginning. As I began to put together pieces and find proof for my well-founded fears of mercury poisoning in my son, I requested the specific lot numbers as well as manufacturers' names for his vaccines in order to file a vaccine injury report. The doctor's office effectively stalled me for many months before finally telling me that no specific records had been maintained. I could not believe my ears. This was their legal, not to mention ethical, obligation to their patients' safety and welfare. Without this specific information, I was never able to officially report the injury, but it is my sincere hope that through this letter my story can be told. Nothing can be done to undo the damage done to my son, but I pray that no other family will have to suffer at the hands of our ignorant use of mercury in these vaccines. What sickens me even more is I worked in an environmental lab where we would test for this toxin in parts per billion, and no one ever mentioned to me during my son's vaccines that this toxin was being used as preservative. As an intelligent human being, if given the opportunity and knowledge of being told this chemical was contained in his vaccines, I never would have allowed this poison to be injected into my child. Then it goes on and tells how horrible it was as she saw her child slip away from her and does not pay attention or look at her any more. It is difficult for those who are not personally affected to understand or even acknowledge the truth. We have been trained from early on to trust in our government and follow all the guidelines set forth for vaccine safety. Like many others, I used to have that trust. Now my vision has been greatly blurred as the blame and acceptance of this issue has been set aside time and again. It is time for our country to step forward and do what is right. No other family should have to walk this stony path when it can easily be avoided by the complete removal of all mercury in all vaccines. The monetary loss of dumping these vaccines is a small price to pay. My son is now 6, and he is doing as well as anyone can expect. Mr. Speaker, there are thousands of these children who have been damaged by mercury in vaccines, and here are a few pictures of some of these children. We need to adjust the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund to take care of these kids. We cannot leave them and their parents high and dry. It is absolutely criminal for this Congress not to deal with this issue. ____________________ TAX CUTS AND SPENDING PRIORITIES NEED NOT BE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, when the House considered the Republican budget last week, there was a lot of debate regarding whether the President's tax cut proposal was coming at the expense of other obligations, obligations to pay for child care, for public schools, college loans and nutrition programs that help children get a good start in life. Lost in the argument was the fact that nearly everyone in this body is for tax cuts in some form. Our differences are about who these tax cuts go to. Who needs them and why. Tax cuts and our spending priorities need not be mutually exclusive. But who do the tax cuts in the President's dividend tax plan go to? By and large, no matter how we look at it, they go to Americans who do not need them. Specifically, two-thirds of the benefits of the tax cut would flow to the top 5 percent of the population. That is individuals with an average income of about $350,000 per year. The top 1 percent of people who, on average, have an average income of $1 million, this is 1 percent of tax filers, they would receive 42 percent of the benefits; and people with incomes that exceed $3 million would receive nearly a quarter of the tax cut benefits. The top 2 percent of tax filers would receive nearly as much from this tax cut as the bottom 90 percent of all tax filers combined. How much is that exactly? Well, millionaires could receive up to $90,000 in a tax cut. But if one's income is between $40,000 and $50,000, people who could really use a tax cut, they would receive an annual average benefit of $84; and people with incomes between $30,000 and $40,000 would receive only $42. Mr. Speaker, I think most of us recognize those who pay more into the system will get more out of the system, but a $42 tax cut for some and a $90,000 tax cut for others is simply beyond all reasonable bounds of proportion and fairness, particularly in this economy when these tax cuts mean that vital services are being reduced at a time when so many families are struggling to make ends meet. $42 will not go far for a family worrying about paying the rent or putting food on their table. At the very least, we have an obligation to do something for these families. Mr. Speaker, that is why I offered an amendment during the Committee on the Budget markup to expand the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child, to make it available to low-income families with children who are currently not eligible because they do not pay enough in Federal income tax to qualify for the full credit. They pay taxes, they pay payroll taxes, State taxes, local taxes, and excise taxes, but they do not pay enough in Federal income tax. My amendment would have built on the President's tax plan to help working families, while at the same time stimulating the economy. As a matter of fact, the President's tax plan includes a proposal to increase the child tax credit to $1,000 per child for some families. In fact, he allocated $7.4 billion for this purpose in fiscal year 2003. But, today, 20 million children will not receive the full increase, including 10 million who will not receive any increase at all, because, as I have said, these families do not pay enough in income taxes to have the credit count. I want to be clear, these working families do pay taxes. They pay FICA, payroll taxes, State and local taxes, excise taxes, all of which place a far heavier burden on those with the lowest incomes. This is not an issue of income redistribution. Even taking into account the Earned Income Tax Credit, about two-thirds of low- and moderate-income families with children still face a net tax burden. They deserve to receive the full amount of this tax credit. Over three-quarters of these children are in working families who are struggling to make ends meets. The President's proposal will also leave out about one-half of African American children and over 40 percent of Hispanic children. My amendment would have reaffirmed President Bush's proposal to increase the child tax credit to $1,000, but it would make the credit fully refundable so every single eligible family could benefit from it. In addition to being the right thing to do for working families, this tax cut would stimulate our economy, which continues to flounder. Only about one-fourth of the $300 rebate in the last tax cut were put back into the economy. The rest was saved. Giving tax cuts to families who would spend the money immediately, typically low- and middle-income families, would be the best stimulus we could give to our economy right now. This proposal would have been offset by reducing other aspects of the President's tax plan, such as the dividends tax cut which, as I have said, would give nearly two-thirds of its benefits to the top 5 percent of the population. The top 5 percent with average incomes of $350,000 do not need another tax cut. Mr. Speaker, this week is being touted as a week to focus on our children. We should take this opportunity to provide relief to families who need it the most. When this body takes up the tax cut legislation next week, the least we can do is consider the working families who are the backbone of our economy.

Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise because something has been weighing on my mind since last week, and as I have watched the pressure in the streets of America and around the world, I thought I would observe the protests that were taking place a week ago last Saturday that gathered around the Washington Monument. I walked around for an hour and a half amongst the people, and the mood was something like I imagine Woodstock was. But as I looked at the signs and I read the profanity, I began to try to sort the people out and what they believed in, and I saw the desecrated American flags in their ranks. There were quite a number of people there. {time} 1930 Then I went up to the White House for a little while and ended up down by Pershing Park on what I call the grassy knoll. I watched probably 50,000 people come streaming by that corner in what I would call a river of discontent. As I looked at the flags and the signs and I watched the people, I saw some things that, of course, I hope was not on television, if your children are watching, but I also saw Communist flags, socialist flags. I had made the statement a couple of weeks ago that these people were anti-American and that you would not find a single undesecrated American flag in the bunch, but I looked closely through and found about a dozen. For every undesecrated American flag, and some of them were on their way to desecration, there were at least 10 others that were already desecrated marched through. There were probably 10 Palestinian flags for each American flag undesecrated. The people sorted out into some categories as you watched them go by. Out-and-out Communists, proud and avowed socialists, radical fundamental Islamists, the angriest of the group by my opinion, and regular liberals and pacifists. I deal pretty well with the pacifists. They have a political opinion and a right to speak, as does anyone in this country constitutionally; but when it undermines our war effort, it concerns me greatly. And so I left that sea of discontent thinking, well, I'll come back to Congress where it will be logical and it will be reasonable and I can deal with people who have the best interests of America in mind. We entered into a debate last Thursday night, a simple resolution to support our troops. This is the Congressional Record of that debate that ran on until about 3 o'clock on last Friday morning and some of the things that I heard here are the kind of things that I would have expected to hear from the people that were in the middle of the street. For example, the gentlewoman from California: ``I believed and still believe that diplomatic alternatives existed. The inspection process was working.'' That debate was over. The gentleman from Washington said: The leadership should be ashamed of bringing this resolution to the floor. I for one will not be forced to praise the President's reckless decisions. I cannot endorse the administration's policy of unilateral military action without international sanctions. This is a war of choice. Unilateral military action with 47 nations signed on. I could go on and on. I have marked these in the book over and over again. If you are on the front lines in Iraq, if you have volunteered to risk your life to protect the liberties of this great Nation and you see the discontent in the streets of America and around the world of people that cannot answer the simple question, has there ever been a just war, and they will not answer that question because they know that if they do, they will have to say the Revolutionary War was not a just one by their logic and they would be kneeling to a King George. So we have George W. Bush President and a great one, one who has laid out a vision for this country. It is a vision that is in this document, this document that hardly anyone reads, the National Security Strategy of the United States of America. I have gone through that and taken out some excerpts that I think are important that the public understand and know. This is policy that is being applied I believe today in Iraq: We do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom. The United States must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them. People everywhere want to be able to speak freely, choose who will govern them, worship as they please, educate their children, male and female, own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society, and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages. That is our calling. It is a calling to end this war on tyranny at some point. It is a call to provide for the safety of the American people. In conclusion, I would use these words from the President's State of the Union address January 28: Americans are a free people who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world; it is God's gift to humanity. ____________________ ATTACK IN KASHMIR The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise on the House floor this evening to express my deep sorrow for the victims of a brutal attack in Kashmir that began on late Sunday night in Nandimarg village, which was inhabited by 11 remaining Kashmiri Pandit families. After the massacre by gunmen dressed in Indian Army uniforms, 24 Kashmiri Pandits, including 11 women and two children, were left dead. Mr. Speaker, the conflict in Kashmir has plagued this region for over 3 decades and has created an extremely dangerous and unstable situation for the Pandit community. There was a long history of attacks against Pandits in the 1990s, which started the mass migration of this indigenous people from the valley. As the severity of violence has increased and as the frequency of attacks has risen to a near daily basis, the mass exodus of the Pandits has perpetuated and, over time, well over 60,000 Pandits have been murdered. The Pandits as a people have faced tremendous hardship. They have been forced to leave their homes, jobs and temples in order to stay alive. They have been forced to abandon cultural practices in order to live in refugee camps. The exodus from the valley has left the Pandits as refugees in their own country, running away from persecution and extinction. Mr. Speaker, for the Pandits who have remained in the Kashmir Valley [[Page 7422]] or who planned to return, assurances were made in November by the new Kashmiri state coalition government to protect Pandits from violence. In fact, when the new government took power in Kashmir, its leaders pledged to provide welcoming conditions and the resources necessary for Pandits to safely return. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, this has not been the case and both the state and federal authorities have failed to protect the Pandits. It has become clear that security lapses contributed to yesterday's Nandimarg massacre and both the state government in Jammu and Kashmir as well as the Indian Government in New Delhi must step up and meet the needs of both the nearly 8,000 Pandits living in the Kashmir Valley and the 200,000 that live outside of Kashmir. The Pandits in the valley cannot continue to endure the unceasing threat of violence, and the Pandits elsewhere in India must be convinced that their return to the valley will be safe. Mr. Speaker, I hope that a combination of events will take place that will effectuate necessary protections for these people. I encourage the coalition government in Kashmir to do justice to the Pandits. Additionally, I urge President Bush to put more pressure on President Musharraf of Pakistan to stop Islamic militant infiltration into Kashmir and to end Pakistan's moral and military support to these fundamentalists responsible for the mass murder of the Pandits. Pakistan received $50 million in military assistance from the U.S. earlier this month, is slated to receive $25 million in the supplemental appropriations bill scheduled to come to the House floor, and in the President's fiscal year 2004 budget there is a provision that requests $75 million to Pakistan in foreign military financing. My fear is that U.S. military assistance to Pakistan will then be turned around and used against India, particularly in Kashmir. Mr. Speaker, the President must continue to persuade Pakistan to end terrorism in Kashmir and the U.S. should not be providing military assistance to the Musharraf regime. Mr. Speaker, there are no words to express the devastation of the Nandimarg massacre and the sad history of the Kashmiri Pandits. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Pandits, I call upon the coalition government in the state of Jammu and Kashmir to actively engage in steps to protect Pandits that are still in the valley and to ensure the safe return of all Pandits that have been forced to leave for over a decade. ____________________ DENOUNCING INHUMANE TREATMENT OF UNITED STATES PRISONERS OF WAR The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to denounce the creation and the broadcast of the inhumane treatment of United States prisoners of war held by the Iraqi military, photographed by the Iraqi military in violation of the Geneva Convention and broadcast worldwide by the Qatar government-owned Al Jazeera network. For those who have been living somewhere other than in front of television the last 48 hours, Mr. Speaker, we all were witness of Iraqi forces parading five captured American soldiers, including a woman, before television cameras this past weekend. The Iraqi television footage, which was replayed to the entire Arab world for half a day, to over a billion people by the Qatar-based and -operated Al Jazeera network, not only showed these American POWs under a state of great indignity and duress, but it also showed the bodies of at least four other soldiers, graphically and closely portrayed, two of whom appeared to have been shot in the head, raising suspicions that they had been executed after being captured. Mr. Speaker, the Geneva Convention is quite clear and both Iraq and the United States and civilized elements of the media attain to the standards of that convention. It provides in part: Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Likewise, prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults or public curiosity. Measures of reprisal against prisoners of war are prohibited. It is quite clear, and I cite now Human Rights Watch International, that the humiliating display of prisoners of war is a war crime. The leaders of our military who at this very hour, with tens of thousands of brave soldiers at their side, labor on behalf of liberty and on behalf of our freedoms, have made it quite clear that those who have treated American POWs, past, present and future, will be held to an account, Mr. Speaker. They will be hunted, and they will be prosecuted as war criminals. But I rise not only in disgust over the behavior of Iraqi military personnel, which comes as no surprise to those of us who are students of the inhumanity of the regime of Saddam Hussein, but I rise also to condemn the decision by the Al Jazeera network to broadcast these materials. Also, as has been observed by military personnel in the field, the very broadcast of these materials to over a billion people in the world was a violation of the Geneva Convention. I would cite Lieutenant General John Abizaid, the deputy commander of Allied forces who said that any state-owned media or network that shows these materials is also in violation of the Geneva Convention and, quote, ``will be held to account.'' This behavior to perform it but also to broadcast it is, in his words, absolutely unacceptable. Today and tomorrow, Members of this body on both sides of the aisle as a part of our briefings, Mr. Speaker, in the name of the American people and on their behalf, will view these reprehensible 6 minutes which were played over and over again to over a billion people in the world. I rise today not just to offer warning to the deaf ears of an inhumane regime in Baghdad but I rise to offer a warning to the government of Qatar that is friendly to the United States, our own central command is in part located there at this hour, and say that your government-owned media should think very, very carefully about any future decisions which portray American POWs in any way that is violative of international convention, of the Geneva Convention, or of the dignity of those brave men and women who fight on our behalf. The Iraqi soldiers are warned, but let our friends in the government of Qatar also be warned that those who violate this convention will be held to account. ____________________ THE WAR IN IRAQ The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, the President has said that bringing freedom to Iraq would not be easy and that it would not be fast. I think it is important that Americans know that we are indeed making incredible progress, but it is unrealistic to expect that after 12 weeks of digging himself in that we will be able to remove Saddam in a week. Just yesterday, critics were questioning whether Iraqis really wanted freedom because there had been no popular uprisings against Saddam Hussein's henchmen. Well, today we have reports from our allies that in Basra, Iraqi civilians have challenged Saddam's soldiers. Clearly, the President and his advisers have a plan and it is working. The second point I would like to make this evening is that we must remember the unsung heroes of this conflict, the military families. For every American soldier, there is a family, there is a community and an entire Nation who is praying that all will go well. {time} 1945 It is imperative that we keep them in our prayers, for too often the challenges that they face go unnoticed. Mr. Speaker, Fort Campbell sits in my congressional district. I would like to take this time to honor the families of the soldiers from Fort Campbell, the Special Operations forces, the 101st [[Page 7423]] forces. We appreciate so much these families and the sacrifice that they are making to see freedom and liberty preserved not only in our country but also for the Iraqi people. ____________________ ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 7, 2003, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tancredo) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the body another group of people that I would like to bring into what we are now calling the homeland heroes. These are folks whose daily lives confront them with incredible stresses and challenges far different than what their business had provided them with to begin with. They started out ranching, and that is a difficult task in and of itself. But after generations in that particular industry and living in the same area on the border of Mexico, living in Arizona, many of the people who reside there are now living in what we can, I think, accurately describe as a war zone. Every week I have been bringing to the House the names and pictures of those people that I want to induct into this homeland heroes hall of fame, I guess is the way we will describe it. Tonight I want to talk about Rob and Sue Krentz, who own and operate a ranch located on the far southeastern corner of Arizona, about 12 miles north of the U.S./Mexico border and 25 miles northeast of the city of Douglas. They are third-generation ranchers. This ranch has been in their family since 1907. Rob and Susie Krentz have three children they raised on that ranch. Their two sons, Andrew and Frank, attend New Mexico State University, and their daughter, Kyle, is a high school senior. The Krentz family story is similar in many ways to the experiences of hundreds of other ranchers in this border region. Yet to them and their children it is unique and it is personal and dreadful in the impact it has had on their lives and the future viability of their way of life as ranchers. Just one tiny statistic that begins to tell the story of what these folks face every single day. In the month of November, 2002, in the Tucson Sector of the U.S. Border Patrol, which includes Cochise County, where this the Krentz ranch is located, the Border Patrol apprehended 23,000 border crossers. That was in the month of November. It is anybody's guess as to how many people actually come across, but many, many people would suggest that the ratio is just about maybe one in five, and that is a very conservative estimate, that for every one person we apprehend on the border, at least five get through. Again, I think it is closer to one in ten, but I will accept even this very, very conservative estimate, that for every one we get at the border apprehended, five go by them. This means that in just the month of November near this ranch and over their property, when we had 23,000 apprehended, using the conservative estimate of one to five, it meant that 115,000 people cross the border illegally, that same area. We are just talking about one little chunk of the border, the Tucson Sector. That means if we project that out over the course of a year that 1,300,000 people come across that border in that sector. I guarantee that is a conservative estimate, but let us use it. One million three hundred thousand people coming across that border and coming across the lands of the people that live there, including the Krentz family. I had the opportunity to spend some time down there just a few weeks ago, and I can attest to the fact that on any given evening one can watch dozens and dozens of illegal aliens trespassing across the land. The Krentz family will call the Border Patrol to come and intercept them. Sometimes the Border Patrol will come; sometimes they will not. Mr. Krentz estimates that over the past 5 years his family has suffered a loss of at least $300,000 a year due to cut fences, stolen and damaged vehicles and farm equipment and damage to the rangeland itself. This is very, very delicate land. It is desert land. It is something that has to be conserved and protected; and when we have got 1,300,000 coming across there every year, believe me, it is not being conserved and protected. It is being destroyed. The Krentz ranch has 1,000 head of cattle. The continual movement of people across that domain constantly disturbs the livestock, impacting their own value, and sometimes somethings happen that are even worse. In February of last year, for instance, a calf was butchered by illegal alien trespassers. Two men responsible were caught. They were tried. They were found guilty. They served a total of 51 days in jail. They were also ordered to pay $200 in restitution to the Krentz ranch. The Krentz ranch has not seen a cent of that money; and, of course, our best guess is they will not because these people have been released. They came back into the population either up here or have returned to Mexico. These losses that are estimated in the neighborhood of $300,000 include damage and disease that comes into the water tanks and the waterlines on their ranch. The family and their employees cannot drink out of the water tanks any longer because of the disease that happens to be in the water on the land brought in by illegal alien trespassers and the damage done by purposeful, deliberate vandalism. The estimated value of the water that has been lost on their property to date is $4 million. In June of 2002, the Krentz brothers discovered two separate instances of damaged waterlines. Illegal aliens had broken the two-inch PBC waterline in order to get drinking water. The Krentz ranch waterline runs for 40 miles and is one of the best gravity-flow waterlines in the State of Arizona. Because of these two breaks in the long pipeline, several hundred thousand gallons of precious water were wasted. The Krentz family continually has to deal with threats, physical threats, from illegal border crossers. Recently, a family member came upon a group of 39 trespassers and was threatened by them when he asked them to turn around and get off his land. He returned home, called the Border Patrol, and they did come and apprehend them. But we both know what happens is they put them into a revolving door near the border and in a few days or in a few hours many times they are coming right back across the border. The Krentz family members are not vigilantes. They do not try to apprehend illegal aliens by force. They do not carry arms for their own protection. They will always call the Border Patrol when they observe trespassers. They and the other ranchers are trying to follow the law and work with the Border Patrol, and all they want from their own government is to enforce the law as well as to protect them and their property, and that is what we owe them. I mean, they are only asking the minimum, protect their lives and property from people coming across that border, from this invasion. And there are no two ways about it. That is an appropriate word to use to describe what is happening on our southern border especially. It is an invasion, and they are asking their government to protect them from that invasion. I want to salute Rob and Susie Krentz, Phil and Carrie Krentz as homeland heroes who are bearing the brunt of an invasion of over a million illegal aliens crossing our southern border. We need to understand their plight. We have a moral obligation to do something about it. Now for the rest of my time I would like to talk about another aspect of the issue of illegal immigration, and we are going to be doing this for the next several weeks, going to be taking this issue and breaking it down into, I think, more understandable parts. We are going to be explaining its various aspects because I will assure the Members this is one of the most complex, this is one of the most challenging aspects of domestic policy. It has ramifications that go on and on and on. They will affect every aspect of our life. [[Page 7424]] Massive immigration into this country, as I have said on many occasions, combined with a pernicious multicul- turalist attitude and philosophy in this country is a cocktail mix of dangerous components. The one component we are going to talk about tonight, the one part of this picture that we are going to focus on this evening is the issue of our national security, the threat that exists to the United States of America as a result of the fact that our borders are porous and that people can and do cross them at will. There was a time that the United States of America could be seen as somewhat naive, and because we were protected by two oceans we felt that the world was a place of general safety for us and that we really did not have to be too concerned about borders. There was always illegal immigration into the United States. That has certainly been the case, but it never reached a level that posed a threat to the Nation's existence. It now has reached that level, not just, as I say, because of the fact that we have far more people coming across these borders than ever before in the Nation's history and into our ports and into our airports, people who come here legally but then overstay their visas, which comprise about 40 percent of the maybe 13 to 20 million people in this country here who are here illegally, but the southern border alone, as I mentioned earlier, is a place of enormous illegal immigration. The numbers are just staggering. What is very, very worrisome is that in the last several years there has not just been an increase in the number of Mexican nationals coming across the border, but there has been an alarming number of people who are classified as OTM. This is ``other than Mexican'' coming across our border, coming from all over the world. This phenomenon has been observed and has been noted by the Border Patrol, and they have talked about it. They have indicated that there is a change going on and that this is a strange situation because, all of a sudden, through that southern border and our northern border with Canada, we are seeing people come from many Middle Eastern countries, from Asian countries, many from South America, specifically from a place called the tri- border region. Let me tell the Members about this. The tri-border region is an area that is really the borders of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay, and there is a very large group of Muslims in that area, a very large Muslim population in that area. {time} 2000 Over the last decade or so, without much attention being paid to it, there has been an enormous increase in the number of Muslims living in South America, and even in Canada. Many of them, in the millions, live in this tri-border area. It has become a place through which now we are seeing a great number of people transiting from Middle Eastern countries into Brazil, getting Brazilian documents, then coming north into the United States through Mexico. When we intercept them, we chalk them down as Brazilian. But we are finding that they are not really Brazilian. For the most part, they are Middle Easterners coming from places throughout the Middle East. Brazil is a very eclectic country. It is a place where it is difficult to look at someone and say, you are from Brazil. It is not that easy. So people who are Middle Eastern can easily be characterized as Brazilian, especially if they are carrying Brazilian passports and Brazilian papers. But we have had this enormous increase in the last couple of years, it goes off the charts, of Brazilians intercepted at the boarders. It is up in the thousands. Our Border Patrol people are saying, what is this all about? How come we are seeing so many people from this area? It is because that is the area that actually provides the funnel from the Middle East through South America up into the United States across the Mexican border. As a matter of fact, there is a statement that I think is certainly worthy of us spending a few minutes on here. Here is the quote. It comes from the National Commission on Terrorism established in the year 2000: ``The massive flows of people across the U.S. borders makes exclusion of all foreign terrorists impossible.'' Now, this is not an amazing quote, not a very profound quote, but something we should pay attention to. This was a commission established to look into the issue of terrorism. What they are essentially saying is, because so many millions of people are coming across our borders illegally, that we cannot possibly hope to defend ourselves from terrorists coming into the United States. Is that not an incredible statement, when you think of it? On the one hand, it is completely logical. It is certainly truthful, we all know that is true, because the ``massive flows of people across the U.S. borders,'' this makes the exclusion of all foreign terrorists impossible. ``Duh,'' as the kids say, sure that is the case. What are we going to do about it? What kind of a challenge does this pose to us? This is 2000. This is before 9/11, remember. So, this particular statement, along with the entire commission report, as far as I know, was tossed into File 13, because no one wants to hear this. No one wants to deal with this. No one in this body, no one in the administration, really wants to tackle this issue, because, you see, they know that if you try to stop people from coming across that border, if we actually try to defend our borders with our military, which is absolutely necessary, which any country on the face of this Earth would do in these circumstances, any sane policy would tell us that if you are going to be fighting wars halfway around the world and you are doing it today with the new kind of threat we face, that it is not just the war on the battlefields of Iraq that we have to be worried about; it is also the United States of America, the homeland; and just creating a Department of Homeland Defense does not in fact create a defense of the homeland. It may create the illusion of a defense by the name, but that is it. Because there is no way that that department, funded at the levels that are anticipated, could possibly deal with this one statement, ``the massive flows across the United States border makes it impossible to exclude terrorists.'' They could not deal with it. They need technology. We need the military. We need the military on the border. Maybe at some time in the future we will have a homeland defense agency that is so competent, so technically advanced, using the best kind of monitoring devices and cameras, and even the low-tech stuff of things called walls and fences; yes, fences. You know, we actually can employ that low-tech type of device to stop a lot of what is happening here. But we will not even do that, and the reason is because we do not want to stop illegal immigration. That is the dirtiest little secret that passes around this place periodically: We do not wish to stop illegal immigration. That is this government's policy. It is to allow that flow, for a variety of reasons. On one side we have a political party, the Democratic Party, that sees that flow as a source of support for their political party, that eventually those people will turn into supporters of the Democratic Party, as tradition has certainly proven, that immigrants into the United States, at least for a generation maybe or so, tend to vote Democratic. So the Democratic Party sees that as a source of support. They also, of course, have to cater to a very strong minority group within their own party who wants open borders, who wants illegal immigration. On our side, unfortunately, we have a problem also, because there are a lot of people who look at illegal immigration as a source of cheap labor. I certainly hear from a lot of folks who tell me all the time that they would not be able to open their business, their dry cleaning establishment, their restaurant, their hotel, unless they had illegal aliens working for them. This is amazing. Today, in the Denver paper I was reading, flying out here from home, it talked about a job fair, a [[Page 7425]] job fair held in Denver over the weekend. Something like 6,000 people attended. There were maybe 400 jobs available. Six thousand people attended, maybe 400 jobs available. But I hear from people all the time that tell me they simply cannot hire any ``American willing to do the work.'' I have a neighbor who has been unemployed for over a year. He was at first employed in the high- tech industry, very, very competent individual, very significant job with a very good salary. He has been unemployed. That industry, everybody knows what is happening to it. He is right now doing data entry work and driving a limo to try to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. I hear all the time that we do not have Americans who will do these jobs, these other jobs. There was another article in the paper not too long ago in Denver that talked about the fact that one restaurant, the Luna Restaurant, a Mexican restaurant on 38th and about Lowell, put an ad in the paper for a $3-an-hour waiter position. They had 600 applicants the first day for that one job. Six hundred applicants for one job at $3 an hour. Are all 600 of those applicants illegal aliens? I do not think so. I think there are a lot of American citizens who want those jobs. I think right now American citizens are in competition with those people coming in across the border, but in fact employers want to pay people less. That is natural. Unfortunately, many employers want to exploit their employees. We see accounts of this happening all the time. So, they want illegal immigration, they want porous borders. They do not want anybody stopping their flow, even if this means that it is something that could pose a danger to this country, and it does pose a danger to the Nation. It is a very immediate danger, because, you see, when you cannot distinguish at the border, which no one can do, nobody has shown me a way today to distinguish between that illegal immigrant coming in who is just coming to do the job no one else wants to do, who wants to be a restaurant worker or whatever, noone can distinguish just looking at these people, of course, what they are coming for. You can't say, ``that one looks like he is just looking for a job, but that one over there, they look like they might be coming to do something bad.'' You cannot tell. You have to secure the borders and have everybody coming into this country legally through a process that allows us to identify them, find out what they are coming in for, how long they are going to be here and for what purpose, and find out when they leave. You need internal enforcement in the United States of our immigration laws to make this thing work. So it is not just the border where we need to have the military, but we have to have the INS using its resources inside the country to identify people who are here illegally and remove them. I absolutely do not want us, I am not asking for, we never have proposed, using the military for interior enforcement of law. There is a law against that. It is sometimes referred to as the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. That is not what I am talking about. I am talking about using the military to augment our homeland defense forces on our borders, at our ports of entry, at our coasts, until that Homeland Defense Agency is ready to take on that job itself. We can do it. We do not have to have people strung out arm-in-arm across 5,000 miles of border. That is not what we are talking about. It would take relatively few people but people who are trained and have the technology. That is what the military offers us, training and technology, which can be employed for that purpose. Yes, people say to me all the time, we have got this war going on in Iraq, and are you saying you would use troops on the border? I say, yes. Yes, I would use troops on the border. Because, of course, we only make life more dangerous for everybody. There is not a soul who does not think life is more dangerous for the average American as a result of us going to war in Iraq, at least at the outset of this thing. I pray to God that our efforts in Iraq will be successful. I hope they are successful immediately. I do not want to see another person hurt or injured. I certainly do not want to see an American soldier in that situation. I want them home as quickly as possible. They are fighting a just war. We have to win it. I hope we win it soon. Then I do believe the world will be safer. But I know this: That the threat of terrorism will increase as a result of our efforts in Iraq. Even our own government admits that. We went to a heightened state of the alert status immediately upon going to war. Everybody knows that is the case. Everybody knows it is more dangerous right now. So, yes, I would say use troops on our border, because in fact that is our first line of defense. That is exactly where we should be employing some of our military assets. We do not need many. We do not need hundreds of thousands of troops. I was on the border, the northern border, observing an operation that used 100 Marines to control 100 miles. That was the test, 100 Marines, 100 miles. And do you know what? When you combine their efforts with the Border Patrol and the Forest Service personnel on that border, it worked. I saw them interdict people coming across that border on ATVs, all terrain vehicles, and people flying small planes across the border. Believe me, they would have gone unnoticed. It is the most rugged terrain you have seen up on the northern border, in this case just a few miles north of Bonners Ferry, Idaho. We can do it. Let us extrapolate here tonight and say 100 Marines, 100 miles. You have 5,000 miles, you employ 5,000 troops. It would be more difficult than that, I recognize, but it would not be that much more difficult, and it would not take that many more troops. If nothing else, we can train them there. Our troops have to be trained somewhere. The Marines told me that that was the best training experience they have ever had. I was told that by the Marine commander of the unit that that was the best training they had ever had, because it was real time, they were trying to stop real bad guys coming across that border, and it was the most rugged terrain you could possibly imagine. So, if nothing else, we should be training on the border. It could serve two purposes: The training of our troops and also the interdiction of people coming across this border illegally. {time} 2015 Let us go to some of the specific instances that we have witnessed here in the recent past. Here is an interesting one. Wadih El Hage, he was arrested in the Saguaro National Park for possession of an automatic weapon, an AK-47 rifle. He was using this AK-47 for target practice. On September 15, 1998, Wadih testified before a Federal grand jury which was investigating the bombings of the American embassies in Nairobi, Dar es Salaam. Several days later, he was charged with perjury. On October 7, he was indicted in connection with the embassy bombings. He was subsequently convicted for both offenses and is now serving a life sentence. Now, what happened? How they got him is that he was observed and arrested after he had just come across the border; he was observed in the national park by a park ranger. He was testifying, Wadih was testifying at this trial in September and he was saying that he has never fired a weapon, he has no arms, he does not know why he was being harassed. A Border Patrol agent came across this guy's picture and he said, you know what? I remember that guy. I remember arresting him not too long ago in the Saguaro National Park. And you know what? He was practicing with an AK-47. So that testimony ended up, the testimony and evidence provided by the Border Patrol ended up with this conviction for perjury in September; and later they were able to connect this gentleman to the embassy bombings. Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, a 23-year-old Palestinian, 1996 arrested twice within 6 days for crossing over the Canadian border illegally. Both times turned over to the INS who released [[Page 7426]] him back across the border and, of course, the revolving door, he came right back down. In 1997 he was arrested a third time coming across the border illegally, and later arrested in New York in a plot to blow up the New York subways. This guy, talk about a lucky catch, my colleagues may remember something about him. Ahmed Rassem, December 1999, Ahmed Rassem was arrested with 1,000 pounds of explosives and four timers, the timers are right here in the picture at the bottom. He was arrested at the Olympic National Park, Washington. He chose Port Angeles because of the lack of technology and the manpower there. He was convicted of participating in a plot to blow up Los Angeles Airport on New Year's Eve, 1999. Now, these are three we got. Remember what I said earlier that for everybody we actually find, actually interdict at the border, for every one of them, at least five people get across. Now, let me tell my colleagues, those are folks who get across and they are the most unsophisticated and perhaps unskilled in the manners and mechanisms that could be employed to come across the border. These are folks, many of them, that are just simply looking for the jobs that are available. They get by on a ratio of 5 to 1. Can we imagine how much more, what the ratio is, I should say, for people who are a little more sophisticated in the smuggling business? How many more Ahmed Rassems got through? We know that the Center for Immigration Studies has indicated that we have 115,000 illegal immigrants from various Middle Eastern nations who are currently residing in the United States, as many as 115,000 from Middle Eastern nations. Day after day after day we are confronted by news stories of very scary folks coming across the border, sometimes doing very scary things. This is an interesting article. This was in the Tucson paper not too long ago. An Arizona couple has discovered a diary written in Arabic in a backpack apparently dropped on their property by an illegal alien entering the United States, reports the Sierra Vista Herald Review. According to the report, Walter Kolbe, he owns a ranch down there, was chasing some wild animals away from his home last week when he stumbled upon the backpack. Not an unusual occurrence on his property, since it is a path used routinely by illegal aliens coming from Mexico. He brought it home, but did not immediately open the backpack. After going away for a weekend, Kolbe's wife, May, looked into the backpack and discovered the diary. He says, I found it about a hundred yards from the house near a barbed wire fence. I was just going to throw it in the trash. According to Mr. Kolbe and, by the way, his brother serves in the House of Representatives here from Arizona, most of the writing was in Arabic, though there was some Spanish writing as well. When I was down on that border in that same area, I came across a lot of material in what are called pickup sites. What these are are places where a large number of people will gather after walking into the United States illegally, they will gather, and it is near a road always, sometimes a dirt road, sometimes a paved road, and they will await transportation northward. It is all arranged, it is taken care of, because now this has turned into a very big business. And the people who used to be selective and only were involved with the importation of drugs are now importing people because it has become very lucrative. And in these pickup sites, as I say, there will be thousands of people gathered and there is trash strewn everywhere, lots and lots of backpacks, as is evidenced here, and lots of materials laying all over the ground. Not too long ago in this same area we found a prayer rug, a rug that is used by Muslims to conduct prayer ceremonies. It was found, by the way, at one of these pickup sites. There are all kinds of instances where we have found Arabic materials, Arabic passports, Arabic papers, accoutrements in these pickup sites. Now, there is a road not too far from Douglas, Arizona, that is referred to by the locals in the area as the Arab Road. And when you ask them, what do you mean by that, they say, well, because the Arabs are willing to pay so much more to come into the United States, up to $30,000 per person, that they are sometimes transported separately. They will not come in through the same pipeline as the Mexican nationals. Some of these, the high-paying folks, they will be brought across a different area, brought in a little nicer, like going first class. They pay a little more so that they can come in with a little less possibility of heat exhaustion or dropping dead in the desert from exposure because they will pay, as I say, a lot more money. But they are coming into the United States with purposes that we know are the most diabolical, to do something here that threatens our safety. They are coming across the border because it is the easiest way to get into the United States if you want to do something bad, because our borders are undefended. They are unprotected. It is incredible. Certainly it is something to go down in future history books. I just hope that those chapters will not be titled something like ``The Last Days of the American Experience.'' I see I am joined tonight on the floor by a friend, a member of our caucus who has been a champion, is the best way I can describe it, ever since I came to the Congress of the United States and have been pushing this issue. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goode) preceded me here and certainly was laboring in this vineyard before I ever got here and continues to offer his observations, which I invite him to share with us this evening. Mr. GOODE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado for his focus on this issue, for bringing it to the attention of this Congress, for bringing it to the attention of America. He has made many trips and seen firsthand the huge problem that exists on our border, the huge danger that it poses for all of us in the United States. He has been the head of the Immigration Reform Caucus; and he is awakening, I believe, in many of us the need to take action and to do more than we have done. We have one piece of legislation before this Congress, H.R. 277, in addition to a number of other measures, aimed at stopping or curtailing immigration. But H.R. 277 would authorize the utilization of U.S. forces on our borders. We have troops on the borders now, but they are not United States troops. Troops from Mexico frequently come to the border and have various activity and occurrences there, but they are not our troops. The focus of the 107th Congress in large part was on homeland security. A big focus of this, the 108th Congress, is homeland security. On the Committee on Appropriations we have a subcommittee devoted to appropriations matters related to homeland security. They are going to be in charge of billions of dollars. Working with the executive branch and the other body, they will craft a budget for that Department; and I can tell my colleagues when it is voted on here on the floor, it will contain, as I said, billions upon billions of dollars. But spending a huge sum of money in and of itself will not guarantee us homeland security. There may not be anything that can guarantee us 100 percent safety in the United States of America, but I will tell my colleagues one thing that can significantly enhance our homeland security, and that is having a troop presence on our southern border and on our northern border. We had a discussion in the 107th Congress on an amendment for troops on the border on the defense authorization measure. It passed the House. We debated that issue. A fear was voiced that the troops might shoot someone; and, in fact, years ago, that occurred, and that has some persons upset. But if we want a lifesaver, I would submit having troops on the border will be a lifesaver. Hundreds die every year trying to cross the border. Some suffocate, a few drown, others are lost, and some just die in the hot desert sun. Troops on the border would save those lives. We need a lifesaving position, and that is having troops on our borders. [[Page 7427]] {time} 2030 In World War II, prior to World War II, there was a book that received considerable attention after World War II. That was entitled ``Why England Slept.'' America is asleep today by not positioning and having troops on our borders. They are too porous. I was handed some information that appeared in Newsweek where the mastermind of the September 11 occurrence discussed bringing operatives through the Mexican borders. He indicated that officials were concerned that the United States remains dangerously unprepared for terrorist attacks on several fronts. The easiest way for them to come in would be across our porous northern and southern borders. If we are to get a handle on illegal immigration and if we are to prevent a situation which has millions of illegals in this country, we must start with troops on the border, and by adopting other measures of the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus sponsored by the gentleman from Colorado and others. We also need to discourage those from coming to this country illegally. Under the laws of a number of States, illegals have the opportunity by one way or another of getting a driver's license. My home State of Virginia this year adopted legislation to prohibit those in the country illegally from having a Virginia operator's license. They also adopted legislation, and I was proud of this because this is a discouragement to illegals from entering the country, they adopted legislation to say that they could not get an in-state tuition rate at our community college system if they were here illegally. I would suggest that they should not even be at the community college system. However, the debate was over whether we should give someone in this country who either came across the border through no checks or overstayed their visas and were undocumented an in-state tuition rate. What they were saying with a policy like that is if you were from the State of Maryland and you wanted to go to Northern Virginia Community College, you had to pay one rate; but if you were here illegally and you happened to be in the State of Virginia, you got a lower rate. That is the type of encouragement for illegal immigration we need to do away with in this country. Another thing we cannot do again that we did in the past was adopt another amnesty. Millions that come across the border say, you know what, if I can make it across and not drown, if I can make it across and not die in the hot desert sun, and stay in America a few years and have an employer, I can get amnesty. We need to send the message loud and clear, if you are here illegally, you are not going to get amnesty, not now and not in the future. If we adopt that forthright position, we will not have between 9 million and 11 million persons in this country illegally. I will never forget a few months ago standing on the steps of the Cannon Office Building. There was a gentleman there. He had a son that was killed on September 11 at the World Trade Center. He said, if I had to pick out a fact that I think contributed a great deal to what happened to my son, it was the massive illegal immigration in the United States. He said, those 19 terrorists that were here on September 11, all illegal, they were swimming in a sea of illegal immigration. How could the officials ferret out 19 out of the millions and millions that are here that are not supposed to be in the United States of America? He was right on the money. We need to stop illegal immigration, and we can do that by adopting some of the legislation sponsored by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tancredo) and others in the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, and we need to put troops on the border tonight. Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. He brings up an incident I recall well, and I am glad he did bring it to our attention. It was a very emotional time when the father of some young man that was lost in the World Trade Center did in fact say exactly that, that those people were allowed to be in the United States because they were able to swim in this sea of illegal immigration and they were undetectable. This is why when people talk to us about immigration, and we often have people respond when we start talking about the national security issues. I have been in Mexico and have had Members of the Mexican Government say, you know, none of those people were Mexican that committed those crimes. Of course not. It is the fact that we are only as strong as our weakest link. If we cannot control our borders because we are trying to let illegal immigrants come across from Mexico who are not trying to do anything really bad to us, we cannot possibly hope to protect ourselves from those who are trying to do something bad. That is the point here. That is why we are talking about this as a national security issue. My friend, the gentleman from Virginia, mentioned this Newsweek article. He has learned that 9-11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed told interrogators that he discussed bringing operatives through the Mexican border. They worry about these people coming across, suicide bombings at soft targets like malls, public transportation. Another worry, of course, is that a terrorist could acquire shoulder- fired missiles and shoot them at passenger planes. Of course, any number of horrendous things could happen. Our minds could run wild on all the things that could happen in this country because we are an open and free society. We do not want to change that. The best way to avoid having an overreaction in the United States and trying to pass laws that we worry about in terms of what we will do to civil liberties, as Members know, we get lots of mail on the PATRIOT Act, and whatever kind of legislation that may be being formulated here as an addition to the PATRIOT Act. There are concerns, and concerns I share, about overreaching government activity. But one way to avoid that, Mr. Speaker, is to protect our borders. It is to stop, to the extent humanly possible, them from getting here to begin with. Maybe we will not be able to make it absolutely secure. No, in fact, I know we cannot. Even if we do all the things I and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goode) and other Members of the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus are suggesting, we cannot make it perfect; but it is our best effort we are supposed to exert here in this Congress. That is the best we can do. If we have something happen even after we have done it all, we can at least say we have tried everything. That is our responsibility. We cannot continue to ignore the existence of this threat to our very existence. Other recent news, the Nation's biggest commercial nuclear power facility faces a possible terrorist threat. It just came out. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said Thursday, he told the Senate Committee on Armed Services that terrorists may have targeted the Palo Verde Nuclear Plant in Arizona. He said he would not go into details about intelligence reports concerning the plans that may include an attack on the plant. The Washington Times reported Thursday that terrorists have targeted the Arizona plant, and security officials are looking for Iraqi government sleeper cells that might carry out the attack. The threat to the facility came from sensitive information indicating the plant was targeted by Middle Eastern terrorists who were not further identified. Earlier this week on our Florida coast, a Cuban Coast Guard vessel slipped in, it was a military vessel, got into Key West without ever being detected. These things go on and on. In Miami, U.S. authorities made a fresh and urgent call for public help yesterday to find a Saudi-born man who could pose what they termed a very, very serious threat as part of an al Qaeda plot against the United States. Stepping up their search with an appeal to the U.S. Muslim community for information, the FBI said Adnan El Shukrijumah was a friend of a man now serving prison time for plotting to blow up a Florida power plant. [[Page 7428]] The agency said that this individual is not charged with a crime but is being sought for questioning, involved with al Qaeda activities. Just a couple of days ago as Baghdad was being bombed, it was reported on Fox News and Sky News as well as Worldnet Daily that there was a search going on for six Iraqis in either northern Mexico or the U.S. Southwest. They were said to be carrying toxic materials requiring temperature control. That means they are either biological or radiological. Either way, they are ominous and dangerous. According to tips by undercover investigators, the search had been going on for 2 to 3 days on the Mexican side, and now it is starting on the United States side. We could go on through stories like this all night long. Long after I have run out of time to deliver those stories they could be available, because they are there. When we talk about immigration and immigration reform, we have to understand the importance of this concept. It is not just an issue of jobs; it is not just an issue of acculturation, of integration into the society, of balkanization of America. All of those things are disconcerting. It is not just an issue of American citizens who are out of work and being displaced by people coming here from foreign countries. All those things are serious issues. It is not just the issue of the amount of drugs coming across both borders and into our ports every single day. We talk about harmful substances and dangerous substances. Certainly the tons and tons and tons of drugs that are being brought in by illegal smugglers, by illegal aliens carrying things on their shoulders and backpacks, in those backpacks it could be 60 pounds of marijuana, sarin gas; it could be all kinds of very, very ugly things. All of those things are serious consequences, serious threats, I should say, serious issues. But we decided to start this series of discussions tonight with this one specific one of the danger to the country posed by porous borders because of the threat of terrorism that is so real. I hope and pray that we never have to stand on this floor and say, I told you so, I told you, unless we secure those borders, something horrible is going to happen. Somebody is going to waltz across them and do something very, very bad. Do Members know what is going to happen? Not only are we going to be rushing to the borders to try and do something, but we are going to be overreacting, probably, internally. There are going to be threats to civil liberties that will develop as a result of some incident that occurs in this country. I hate to think about this, and I hope and pray I am absolutely wrong in this prediction, but it is certainly not out of the question to suggest that this could happen. We are told by Homeland Security Director Ridge and everybody else in positions of authority to expect such a thing, to expect an event. Well, at least if this event occurs, let us at least be able to turn to our constituents and say, we have tried everything we can do. We have committed to you, when we have asked you for a vote and you have asked us to adhere to the Constitution and uphold that Constitution, we have tried to do that. The part of the Constitution that specifically refers to the protection of life and property, we have tried to do it. That is what I want to be able to say. We cannot ensure perfect security and safety, but we can try our best. That is the least we can do is the best that we can do, and we are not anywhere near it, I am sorry to say. ____________________ LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Ms. McCarthy of Missouri (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today through April 11 on account of personal reasons. ____________________ SPECIAL ORDERS GRANTED By unanimous consent, permission to address the House, following the legislative program and any special orders heretofore entered, was granted to: (The following Members (at the request of Mr. Pallone) to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material:) Mrs. Maloney, for 5 minutes, today.

[[Page 7434]] EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS ____________________ HONORING SANDRA CREQUE'S 38 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE ALAMEDA COUNTY REGISTRAR OF VOTERS OFFICE ______ speech of HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK of california HON. BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, we rise today to honor Sandra Creque's outstanding career in the Alameda County Registrar of Voters Office. On April 1, 2003, Sandy will retire as Division Chief, Registration and Outreach after 38 years of dedicated service. Sandy's long tenure in the office of the County Registrar of Voters is legendary. She was committed to community involvement and service from the start of her career in 1965. She soon became involved in working with Students for Rockefeller at the University of California, Berkeley. Sandy was in the community five nights a week and on weekends, training students at UC Berkeley on how to register voters. Many of those students went into the South and conducted voter registration drives during the Civil Rights Movement, while others lead the nationwide anti-war movement during Vietnam, or worked locally to bring political change. Sandy understands the importance of political involvement through the ballot box. She has been instrumental in providing professional guidance about the registration process and has kept to her mission to make sure every citizen is able to enjoy the franchise. With her calm demeanor and wealth of knowledge, Sandy's invaluable contributions to elected officials and office seekers in Alameda County will be long remembered. Sandy helped make the process easier for them and their campaign workers. She made a difference, always behind the scenes, and always willing to go extra miles for everyone. Highlights of her 38 year career that Sandy points to with pride include witnessing Barbara Jordan testify in Washington, DC, on the Voting Rights Act; the opportunity to help extend the vote to all segments of Alameda County's diverse population; and the opportunity to serve the diverse population in such a way as to enhance the electoral process. These highlights are a testimony to the caring and professional manner in which Sandy Creque has conducted herself during her tenure in the Alameda County Registrar of Voters Office. She has been an exemplary advisor and a friend. We join Alameda County in saluting this remarkable woman; we thank her for her dedicated service, and applaud her for a job well done. ____________________ IN MEMORY OF JAMES G. PATTERSON ______ HON. MIKE ROGERS of alabama in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, James G. Patterson of Cusseta, Alabama, died February 26, 2003, at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Montgomery. He was 69 years old. Born August 22, 1933, in Valley, Mr. Patterson was a retired veteran of the U.S. Army. James G. Patterson was a proud Alabamian and a model citizen who loved the military. He was a retired employee of Wellington Sears Utilization Plant. Mr. Patterson was also an active proponent of civil rights. As a member of the Alabama National Guard, he protected 1960s civil rights marchers, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., at events in Alabama and Mississippi. Mr. Patterson is survived by his daughter, Betty J. Teel of Valley; his son, James Earl Patterson of Washington, DC; and three grandchildren, Michael Corbin Teel, Jamie Patterson and Alexandra Patterson. His children remember their father warmly. ____________________ CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004 ______ speech of HON. BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Thursday, March 20, 2003 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union had under consideration the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 95) establishing the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2004 and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2003 and 2005 through 2013: Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the budget we're considering today does not reflect America's priorities. At a time when Minnesota is making difficult choices to balance the State budget, at a time when we're confronting terrorism and a slumping economy, this budget turns its back on the American people. This budget is reckless and irresponsible and hurts American families. It explodes the deficit, fails to create jobs, and fails to invest in education and health care. Instead of a fiscally responsible budget, this budget piles up record deficits--the worst ever on record. Instead of offering a budget that creates jobs, this budget incorporates the Bush tax cut plan, which the Economic Policy Institute says would cause a net loss of 750,000 jobs by 2013. Instead of providing for a meaningful prescription drug benefit, the budget includes only $28 billion in new money for a Medicare prescription drug benefit, and envisions cuts in both Medicare and Medicaid that put hospitals, seniors, children, and the disabled at risk. The Democratic budget I support focuses on America's priorities. Our budget includes an economic stimulus plan, which would jump-start the economy, provide tax relief and create 1 million jobs. Our budget provides more funding for homeland security, $34 billion, more funding for education, $44 billion, and more funding for the environment, veterans and other priorities. We also provide at least $500 billion more for prescription drugs. Finally, our budget matches the President's defense request for the next 5 years, and achieves balance by 2010. ____________________ HONORING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF FORDSON HIGH SCHOOL ______ HON. JOHN D. DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th Anniversary of Fordson High School in Dearborn, Michigan. Dedicated on March 22, 1928, Fordson High School was designed and built on 15 acres to accommodate 2,300 students at a cost of $2 million. Fordson was heralded in the 1920's for being the first million-dollar high school. However, it is the steadfast dedication to education and more specifically, Fordson's national reputation for helping establish immigrants in the United States that has truly set it apart. Mr. Speaker, the City of Dearborn experienced unprecedented growth with the rise of the automotive industry in the 1920s and 1930s. It was during this time that Fordson became the center of a community increasingly noted for the number of immigrants and for its ethnic diversity. Today, the activities of the Arabic and Romanian clubs at the school continue the tradition of community outreach programs. A plethora of diverse languages and cultures have walked the halls of Fordson High School over the past 75 years. In fact, Fordson pioneers a program teaching non-English speaking students in their native language to keep up with their class work until their English skills are proficient. Education has remained a top priority for Fordson producing many distinguished graduates. Local businessman and philanthropist Michael Adray; Walter P. Reuther, former president and founder of the UAW; Chuck [[Page 7435]] Rossi, comedian with Martin and Rossi; name only a few of the noted graduates. Mr. Speaker, as Fordson embarks on its 75th Anniversary, and in honor of their unfaltering dedication to diversity and education within the community, I would ask that all of my colleagues rise and salute this wonderful school. ____________________ MARCH SCHOOL OF THE MONTH ______ HON. CAROLYN McCARTHY of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have named Oceanside High School in the Oceanside School District as School of the Month in the Fourth Congressional District for March 2003. The principal of Oceanside High School is Dorie Ciulla, the vice- principal is Robert Ledlie and the Superintendent of Schools is Herb Brown. Oceanside High School has over 1600 students in grades 9-12 and over 140 staff members. The school philosophy is ``Know Thoroughly, Think Critically, Act Ethically.'' I chose Oceanside High School because its Participation in Government program for High School Seniors stands out among the other district high schools. Oceanside's seniors are encouraged to get involved in government by learning not only about our nation's history, but by studying our country's evolving public policy and set of laws, and the importance of community service. Oceanside High School seniors can enroll in a variety of Participation in Government classes. Students with teacher or chairperson recommendations can enroll in Advanced Placement American Government, a college level course that features an in-depth curriculum covering the basic institutions of United States government. Students who enroll in Community Volunteer Service get a dual curriculum, where they spend three days per week studying the issues faced by our local, state and federal government, and two class periods a week doing volunteer work in hospitals, nursing homes, elementary schools, political offices and day care centers. Completion of the course leaves students with first hand knowledge of the problems discussed in class. Oceanside seniors have one other Participation in Government option: Public Policy and the Law. This class focuses on the political side of government, by teaching students the nature of politics, how politics relates to decision-making, and the formulation of public policy on local, state and federal levels. Students learn the process by participating in mock trials, town meetings and public hearings. The Participation in Government classes converge to hold an annual Human Relations Day. On March 19, over 50 speakers were invited to address Oceanside students on a variety of topics, ranging from violence prevention to AIDS awareness to civil liberties to poverty on Long Island. The event provided the students with in-depth discussions of particular issues that they felt were of importance. Human Relations Day is a unique and wonderful way for our students to be involved in current events. It shows that the classes in which the students are enrolled are truly successful in motivating the students to get involved in many public policy issues and matters of national concern. I am proud to name Oceanside High School the school of the month for March 2003. ____________________ INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION TO EXPRESS THE SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE TROOPS SERVING TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BY ENCOURAGING ACTIONS TO EXTEND AND PROTECT THEIR STUDENT FINANCIAL AID FOR POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION--H. RES. 158 ______ HON. JOHN KLINE of minnesota in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce a resolution expressing the support and commitment of the U.S. House of Representatives for the troops who are serving to protect and defend the United States. More specifically, the resolution encourages actions to extend and protect the postsecondary student financial aid monies of these soldiers during this uncertain time. This resolution is simple in its purpose. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress passed the HEROES Act of 2001, which allowed the Secretary of Education to work with affected borrowers, lenders and institutions of higher education to grant flexibility surrounding student financial aid matters. This resolution urges the Secretary of Education to maintain his commitment to our men and women in uniform by providing assistance and flexibility as they transfer in and out of postsecondary education during this uncertain time. The resolution also urges all postsecondary institutions to provide a full refund of tuition, fees and other charges to students who are members of the Armed Forces or are serving on active duty, including the Reserves and National Guard. Many times, America's military are also students. They are called away from their class work and studies to serve our nation's national defense. These heroes deserve the flexibility and accommodations that institutions of higher education can provide as they are leaving for active duty and returning to the classroom. Lastly, this resolution urges lending institutions that hold or service Federal student loans for borrowers who have been called to serve the nation's defense to provide all available benefits and flexibility to these servicemen and women. When these servicemen and women return to the United States, we don't want to put them in a worse position financially because of the time they were overseas serving our nation. I hope my colleagues join me in expressing the Congress's commitment to our military and to our students and families. ____________________ HONORING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KIDS BREAKFAST CLUB ______ HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Kids Breakfast Club of Hayward, California on its 10th anniversary. The Kids Breakfast Club was started by educator Marlena Uhrik as a program designed to provide a healthy breakfast and activities during school breaks for children who depend on school lunches for nutrition. After serving 200 breakfasts to low-income children and their families at the Club's inaugural event in December, 1992, Marlena developed a more comprehensive program to include a free breakfast along with expanded opportunities for learning. Today the program serves children during winter and spring breaks, and includes arts and crafts for children, a literacy program with story time and storytelling, free books, clothing, and health and dental screenings and referrals. While the children are engaged in activities, the adults attend adult education classes on topics that interest them, including gang prevention, nutrition, drugs, tobacco, and alcohol, and receive training in first aid, CPR, and parenting skills. All of the presenters are bilingual to serve Spanish-speaking parents. The Kids' Breakfast Club has grown from one location to five, and over 30,000 breakfasts have been served in the program's 10 years of existence. The program also includes a year-round, once-a-month Saturday program. It has formed partnerships with the Youth Enrichment Program to provide tutoring for the students, and the Hayward Adult School to provide presenters and leadership. I am honored to commend the Kids' Breakfast Club and its founder Merlena Uhrik for its dedication to providing children and their families with a safe and healthy start when school is not in session. The Club has brought the community together to show true meaning of the African proverb ``it takes an entire village to raise a child.'' ____________________ TRIBUTE TO SONNY CALLAHAN ______ HON. MIKE ROGERS of alabama in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, from the cab of an 18-wheeler to a seat on one of the most influential committees in Congress, the road Sonny Callahan has traveled getting to our nation's capital was never dull. Congressman Callahan was first elected to the United States House of Representatives on November 6, 1984 and served the people of Alabama's First Congressional District for eighteen years. Prior to coming to Congress, Sonny Callahan was a successful small businessman who knew what it was like to meet a payroll [[Page 7436]] each month. This experience taught him valuable lessons in paperwork and management and solidified his views as an outspoken advocate of less govenment. A veteran of the Alabama legislature, Sonny Callahan came to Washington in 1985 committed to providing a conservative voice in Congress. Ten years later Callahan was tapped to chair the powerful House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. In so doing, he became one of the 13 ``Cardinals,'' an honorary title bestowed on the Appropriations subcommittee chairmen who, by virtue of their positions, are among the most influential members of the House. During this same time, Callahan won rave reviews for his skills as a legislator, with The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post praising on him as ``an unlikely champion.'' He later became the chairman of the influential House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development in the 107th Congress. Mr. Speaker, Sonny Callahan was a dedicated public servant and an honorable Alabamian. Let us take this time to reflect on his work in this historic chamber and thank him for his dedication to his country and the people of Alabama. ____________________ EXPRESSING SUPPORT AND APPRECIATION FOR THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES PARTICIPATING IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM ______ speech of HON. BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Thursday, March 20, 2003 Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 104, our troops in harms way in Iraq, and our President as Commander- in-Chief. I express my sincere disappointment that the rules for H. Con. Res. 104 did not permit a division of the resolution into two separate pieces of legislation. Had this division been allowed, I would have voted in favor of the provisions on Page 4, lines 1-16. I would have opposed the remainder of the resolution, pages 1-3, because in my opinion this language prevented the House from unanimously supporting our troops and the President as Commander-in-Chief. At a time of war, I believe we must stand together, united, behind our armed servicemen and women in the field, our commanding officers, and our military leaders. We must send a strong message to our troops that we stand behind them to the fullest degree, and we will continue to support them once their mission is complete. The service personnel and their families in the Middle East and throughout the world have my thoughts and prayers with them always. ____________________ HONORING THE SAINT MARY CATHOLIC CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP ______ HON. JOHN D. DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the St. Mary Catholic Central High School (SMCC) volleyball team for winning the Class C state championship for the first time in the school's history. It is the first state title for any SMCC girls team, and in fact it is the first state crown for any girls team from a Monroe County high school in any Michigan High School Athletic Association-sanctioned competition. It is quite a feat considering their opponent, the North Muskegon Norsemen were ranked third in the state after the regular season. SMCC was unranked most of the year before finally making No. 10 in the last week. During the regular season, the girls were known for their astonishing comebacks. In the State final, the girls were down 9-0 in the first game before they embarked on their amazing comeback that will go down in state volleyball history. The team finished their remarkable season with a 40-10-4 record. Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask all my colleagues to rise and join me in congratulating the St. Mary Catholic Central girls' volleyball team for their perseverance, hard work and well-deserved championship. ____________________ GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY ______ HON. CAROLYN McCARTHY of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Mr. Speaker, in 1821, drawing inspiration from the ideals and institutions of the fledgling United States, the Greeks waged their own struggle for liberty. They declared their independence after 400 years of rule by the Ottoman Empire, therefore returning democracy to its birthplace. Today, I rise to commemorate the struggle, and later the victory, of Greek Independence. Throughout the world, and through history, Greek influence can be seen and felt. Our ideas on philosophy, politics, architecture, and the arts, stem from the Greeks. Today, Greece is a strong ally to the United States, proving to be a valued partner in NATO as well as to the whole of Europe. This is also true of Greek-Americans. Greek-Americans are extremely important to American society today. They provide our nation with scientists, artists, politicians, and in countless other areas. Today, as we celebrate Greek Independence Day, we are all Greek. ``Opa!'' ____________________ INTRODUCTION OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION RELIEF OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS ACT OF 2003--H.R. 1412 ______ HON. JOHN KLINE of minnesota in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce, along with several of my colleagues, the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act, HEROES, of 2003. This is a bill that expresses the support and commitment of the U.S. House of Representatives for the troops who protect and defend the United States. Specifically this bill provides authority to the Secretary of Education to assist students whose lives are being disrupted by being called to serve in the Armed Forces. This bill is simple in its purpose. It extends the specific waiver authority within title IV of the Higher Education Act for the Secretary of Education, and allows him to maintain his commitment to our men and women in uniform by providing assistance and flexibility as they transfer in and out of postsecondary education during a time of national emergency. This waiver authority addresses the need to assist students who are being called up to active duty or active service. This bill is specific in its intent--to ensure that as a result of a war, military contingency operation or a national emergency: Affected borrowers of Federal student assistance are not in a worse financial position; administrative requirements on affected individuals are minimized without affecting the integrity of the programs; current year income of affected individuals may be used to determine need for purposes of financial assistance; and the Secretary is provided the authority to address issues not yet foreseen. The bill also urges all postsecondary institutions to continue their support and commitment to their students by providing a full refund of tuition, fees, and other charges to students who are members of the Armed Forces or are serving on active duty, including the Reserves and National Guard. Many times, America's military are also students. They are called away from their families, class work and studies to serve our nation's national defense. These heroes deserve the flexibility and accommodations that institutions of higher education can provide as they deploy and return to the classroom. As families send loved ones abroad to defend our Nation, the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act will allow the Secretary of Education to reduce some of the effects of that upheaval here at home. I am proud and delighted that a number of my colleagues have signed on as original cosponsors of the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act. It is an indication of the Congress's commitment to our military and to our students and families, as well as to those who make higher education available. I look forward to swift passage of this legislation. [[Page 7437]] ____________________ CELEBRATING GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY ______ HON. VITO FOSSELLA of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, today we are gathered to recognize the Greek in their 182nd year of independence. It was the ancient Greeks who coined the ideas of freedom and justice that we founded our country on. And March 25th celebrates the freedom that Greeks enjoy since their war of independence. In 1821, Greeks forcefully rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire, which had occupied Greece for nearly 400 years, embarking on the ultimately successful war of independence. This war was to the same likes that the United States engaged in nearly half a century earlier during the American Revolution. Fighting side by side through two World Wars, Greece and the United States remain committed allies in maintaining and strengthening freedom throughout the World. My district of Staten Island and Brooklyn celebrates the Greek heritage as an important part of our community, providing diversity and culture to our schools and neighborhoods. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to congratulate the Greek people for 182 years of independence and thank them for their contributions to American life. ____________________ ON THE OCCASION OF THE 182ND ANNIVERSARY OF GREEK INDEPENDENCE ______ HON. MICHAEL R. McNULTY of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. McNULTY. Mr. Speaker, the American people join with the people of Greece in celebrating the 182nd anniversary of the revolution that freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire. The bedrock of our close relationship with Greece is our mutual devotion to freedom and democracy and our unshakable determination to fight, if need be, to protect these rights. Greek philosophers and political leaders--Cleisthenes and Pericles and their successors--had great influence upon America's Founding Fathers in their creation of these United States. We, as a nation, owe a great debt to Greece. Greece is the birthplace of democracy, as we know it. Thomas Jefferson said, ``To the ancient Greeks, we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves (American colonists) out of Gothic darkness.'' The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were an attack on democracy and freedom--not just against our people, but also against all freedom-loving people everywhere in the world. The Greek people understand this. I congratulate the people of Greece and wish them a Happy National Birthday. ____________________ INTRODUCTION OF ENERGY TAX LEGISLATION ______ HON. MAX SANDLIN of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. SANDLIN. Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest problems facing the United States today is our lack of national energy independence. The United States' dependence upon foreign sources of oil is simply unacceptable for a country rich in natural resources and equipped with the capability to develop these resources as a means of increasing our national security. At the height of the energy crisis during the 1970s, the United States imported 46 percent of our oil supply. Today, it is estimated that we import approximately 55 percent of all energy used in this country. As America's energy consumption increases, our need to produce more energy rises as well. Unfortunately, supply is not meeting demand, and our increased reliance on foreign sources of energy has potentially disastrous consequences for our national security. At the same time, we have to acknowledge that energy independence cannot be attained through production alone. Though Congress should strongly encourage the production of energy sources as diverse as oil, gas, wind and solar power, we should also encourage the increased conservation of energy. I believe the United States needs a balanced, forward-looking energy policy for the 2lst century. For this reason, today I am introducing legislation that will provide needed incentives for the increased production of oil, natural gas, wind and solar power by our small, independent producers, as well as measures to encourage increased conservation of energy. My bill would provide tax incentives for independent oil and gas producers to maintain production from marginal wells and develop nonconventional fuel sources such as coalbed methane and natural gas from tight sands formations. Further, my legislation would spur development of energy from renewable sources by providing a tax credit for residential solar energy production and electricity generation from wind and other sources. Any balanced energy plan must acknowledge that Americans need to increase our conservation efforts in an attempt to move closer to energy independence. To that end, my legislation would provide incentives to homeowners to make energy efficient home improvements that decrease their consumption of energy. Additionally, my legislation would encourage the production of cars powered by fuel cells and hybrid engines. Fuel cell technology holds enormous potential for the future, and the Federal Government has an important role to play in the development and use of this clean, renewable energy source. The United States will not achieve energy independence overnight, and we must acknowledge that it will take years before America attains a greater level of energy independence. My legislation will move our country in the right direction and bring us closer to the day when we can reduce our dependence upon foreign sources of energy and increase our national energy independence. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL PAMELA H. SMITH-BEATTY ______ HON. DAVE CAMP of michigan in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. CAMP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Lieutenant Colonel Pamela H. Smith-Beatty for her faithful service of 22 years to the United States Air Force. Pamela began her career in the Air Force as a Second Lieutenant in the Air Force Medical Service in Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. She continued to serve in various locations, including North Dakota, Louisiana, Texas, California, Illinois, Maryland, Korea, and Florida. Throughout her career in these locations, Pamela devotedly performed her duties primarily as a Women's Health Nurse Practitioner, but also as a Deputy Flight Commander and a Deputy Chief Nurse. Pamela has been honored with several awards, including a Space Command Field Grade Nurse of the Year award, a Meritorious Service Medal, a Commendation Medal, and an Achievement Medal. Pamela will be greatly missed by her co-workers, and greatly appreciated by her country. I am honored today to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Pamela H. Smith- Beatty for her auspicious dedication to serving her country. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER CAROL HOTTENROTT ______ HON. RANDY ``DUKE'' CUNNINGHAM of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding naval officer, Commander Carol Hottenrott, who served with distinction and dedication during the past year for the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, FM&C, as a Navy Appropriations Liaison Officer in the Appropriations Matters Office. It is a privilege for me to recognize her many outstanding achievements and commend her for the superb service she has provided to the Department of the Navy, the Congress, and our great Nation as a whole. During her tenure in the Appropriations Matters Office, which began in March of 2002, Commander Hottenrott has provided members of the House Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Defense as well as our professional and associate staffs with timely and accurate support regarding the Department of the Navy's Operations and Maintenance, Personnel and medical programs budget accounts. Her valuable contributions have enabled the Defense Subcommittee and the Department of the Navy to strengthen its close working relationship and to ensure the most modern, well-trained and well-equipped Naval Forces attainable for the defense of our great Nation. [[Page 7438]] Commander Carol Hottenrott has demonstrated outstanding leadership in the Navy and on Capitol Hill. She continues to be recognized as a truly unique naval officer and is one of a very select group of female naval officers to command a ship. She distinguished herself as a Commanding Officer of a Mine hunting ship and has been selected for command of another combat vessel. Exemplifying the best this country has to offer, she has made many personal sacrifices in the interest of the Navy and our Nation. Having worked with her on the highly complex operations and maintenance issues impacting the port of San Diego, I know she is a wonderful person and officer, and a bright and talented individual. Although she departs today to return to sea on the staff of the new Pacific Expeditionary Strike Group, I expect that she will continue rising through the Navy leadership ranks and that we will have many opportunities to work together again in the future. I wish her every success in her new job, and call upon my colleagues to join me in wishing her ``fair winds and following seas.'' ____________________ NOMINEES FOR THE REGIONAL ACADEMIC ALL-STAR TEAM FROM THE PENNYROYAL REGION IN WESTERN KENTUCKY ______ HON. ED WHITFIELD of kentucky in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize nominees for the Regional Academic All-Star Team from the Pennyroyal region in western Kentucky. The regional Academic All-Star program's purpose is to recognize top academic scholars and performers. Students from Caldwell, Christian, Trigg and Todd Counties of Kentucky were nominated based on their academic performance in seven disciplines: English, foreign language, journalism, mathematics, science, social studies and the creative and performing arts. The students are judged on their core academic score, the curriculum of the student, their grade point average, academic honors earned, unique accomplishments and achievements, extracurricular activities (both community based and school-related), employment history, and an autobiographical essay. Mr. Speaker, education is the foundation upon which we reach our human potential. Students in my District are developing their talents, furthering their education and pursuing their aspirations in life through programs like the Academic All-Star program. Encouragement and recognition develop confidence and achievement among young Americans-- the future leaders of our country. The following students have been nominated for their academic excellence: J. D. Quin, Pettit, Latimer, Hopkinsville. Mr. Speaker, these students embody the spirit, commitment and sacrifice that we all should strive for in our daily lives. I am proud to represent them in my District. I extend my thanks to these students for their efforts, and I am proud to bring their accomplishments to the attention of this House. ____________________ CONGRATULATING JOHN BRADFORD ______ HON. BILL SHUSTER of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker I rise today to recognize and congratulate an exceptional student from Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. John Bradford has been named the male middle school student of the year by the Pennsylvania Middle School Association. John is currently a seventh- grader at Chambersburg Area Middle School, a member of the student council, and involved in numerous projects to help better his community. Last year, John was instrumental in a campaign to raise money for the Ronald McDonald House. He organized an effort to raise $360 by collecting aluminum can tabs at his school. Through his involvement in student government, John has also been involved in other charity related projects such as Coats for Kids, raising money for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and a food drive that sent 4,000 canned goods to the Salvation Army. He is most recently working on gathering other middle school students to join him in participating in a walk-a-thon for the March of Dimes. John has already accumulated an impressive list of accomplishments and has demonstrated a true desire to help better his community. I encourage him to continue volunteering and helping so many worthy charities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating John Bradford for earning recognition as an exceptional individual by being named the male middle school student of the year in Pennsylvania. I am very proud to have such a tremendous individual in my district, and I wish him the best of luck in all his future endeavors. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO MR. SUNIL ``SUNNY'' AGHI ______ HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. of new jersey in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sorrow that I rise on the House floor to mourn the passing of one of the Indian American community's most exemplary leaders, Mr. Sunil ``Sunny'' Aghi. Although we will be at a great loss with his passing and it is difficult to express in words the grief of his family and all those who knew him, I would like to offer this tribute as a celebration of his many accomplishments during his short life. ``Sunny'' was a man who stood for the honor and responsibility that comes along with American citizenship. Among his accomplishments was the creation of the Indo-American Political Foundation, a group dedicated to ensuring that Indian Americans were active in their communities and their government. Beyond his numerous personal efforts to provide food and clothing for local charities, and raising money for scholarships to allow struggling families to send their children to college, Sunil's foundation sought to educate Indian Americans about what it means to be a part of their government and how it allows them to be proud of their citizenship in this great country. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have called Sunil Aghl a friend and I am eternally grateful to have called him a partner in the fight to bring government to the people and people to their government. I, for one, am humbled by his accomplishments and can only hope that his message of strong involvement in government, pride in our country, and concern for his fellow Americans will live on in all those he has touched. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I hope ``Sunny'' is remembered for all he has done and all that he has stood for throughout his short time. ____________________ HONORING 182 YEARS OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY IN GREECE ______ HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor one of America's greatest allies and inspiration for our freedom, liberty, and most importantly, our democratic system of government--Greece. Today marks the 182nd anniversary of Greek independence. Greek- Americans in my district of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and throughout the United States will celebrate this milestone and continue their rich tradition of philanthropy, civic duty, and education. Indeed, there are more than 3 million Greek-Americans in our country providing America with professors, engineers, scientists, artists, athletes, and politicians. Greek culture and heritage touch nearly every aspect of American life. [[Page 7439]] Greek Independence Day marks the revival of democracy in the place that gave birth to its principles, and many of the political, artistic and social innovations of Greece were the source of some of America's greatest treasures, including the rugged individualism described in Homer's poetry or the political philosophies of Aristotle. In these days of war and terrorism, Greece remains a steadfast and stable ally of the United States in a region of the world that is marked by turbulence and violence. Following the attacks on America on September 11th, Greece was one of the very first countries to express solidarity with the United States. Since this time, Greece has made outstanding contributions to the global war against terrorism, including military support for Operation Enduring Freedom, humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan, and participation in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. My Speaker, Greek-Americans should be proud of their rich and long heritage of service to their fellow humans, both domestically and abroad. I strongly applaud Greek-American commitment to family, community, and America, and hope all Americans join with Greece and her sons and daughters to celebrate 182 years of freedom, democracy, and friendship. ____________________ OREGON OPTION ______ HON. DAVID WU of oregon in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, my state of Oregon is one of nine states nationwide that currently operates its welfare program under a federal waiver. In Oregon the program is known as the ``Oregon Option,'' and in the past six years, it has seen caseload reduction rates above the national average. Our innovative, state designed program allows Oregon the flexibility to consider individuals on a case-by-case basis. Some folks simply need a little job training or job search skills and they are ready to transition back into the workforce. On the other hand, others need extensive drug and alcohol treatments, or basic education, before they are able to hold down a job. This combination of basic rehabilitative services to the most needy, and more education and job training activities for others, has proved a great success. Unfortunately, Oregon's federal welfare waiver expires this year. If Oregon is forced to change its program to fit the guidelines laid out in the recently passed TANF reauthorization bill (H.R. 4), the result will be high cost and great disruption to a program that has been heralded as a success. This simply does not make common sense. The legislation I am introducing today would extend existing, or recently expired, welfare waivers through fiscal year 2008. Successful states, like Oregon, should be allowed the ability to continue their federal waivers, for as long as they have successful programs. ____________________ CONGRATULATIONS TO THE THOMASVILLE BULLDOGS! ______ HON. HOWARD COBLE of north carolina in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, the Thomasville High School Bulldogs have long been known for their winning football tradition, but with the dawning of the 21st Century, the Bulldogs are distinguishing themselves as a force on the basketball court as well. On March 15, 2003, both the men's and women's basketball teams of Thomasville High School captured the North Carolina state 1A basketball championship. The Bulldog women's team became the first team in the school's distinguished history to win back-to-back championships after completing an impressive 32-0 season. Congratulations to Head Coach Eric Rader, Assistant Coaches Sara Larrick and Phil Apple, Managers Byron Lattimore, Patrick Jackson, and Andrew Oakley, and each member of the team. Best wishes to Impris Manning (11), Maya Ray (12), Brittanny Marsh (14), Lavonnda Harriott (21), Tyronnica Alford (23), (32), Kendra Rutledge (34), Shay Harris (40), Charnette Davis (41), Tiffany Carroll (42), Tasha Dallas (50), and Erin Crowder (33). Miss Crowder performed especially well, obtaining MVP honors for the second time. The Thomasville men's basketball team also performed well, finishing their season with a record of 29-2 before winning the state title. We congratulate Bryan Shore (10), John Benjamin (12), Adam Oakley (20), Cord Thomas (21), Rasheid Brock (22), Junior Thome (23), A.J. Banks (30), Roy Peake (32), Alan Jeffries (33), Josh Sweitzer (34), Jeremy Mills (42), Terranza Stephenson (44), Patrick Henderson (50), and Brandon Setzer (51). Mr. Setzer obtained MVP honors for the men's team. Athletic Director/Head Coach Woody Honeycutt and Assistant Coach Lacardo Means also deserve congratulations for their leadership in coaching this team to victory. The Sixth District would like to extend its congratulations to the Principal, Dr. Mike Allred, the students, faculty, and families at Thomasville High School. Best of luck to the Bulldogs for another successful season next year. ____________________ SALUTE TO GREEK INDEPENDENCE ______ HON. JOHN E. SWEENEY of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. SWEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the following statement onto the floor in support of celebrating March 25, 2003, as Greek Independence Day. The ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in the people. The Founding Fathers of the United States drew heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient Greece in forming our representative democracy. Greece is 1 of only 3 nations in the world, beyond the former British Empire, that has been allied with the United States in every major international conflict in the twentieth century. Greece played a major role in the World War II struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete and in Greece presenting the Axis land war with its first major setback, which set off a chain of events that significantly affected the outcome of World War II. Greece and the United States are at the forefront of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and human rights. Those and other ideals have forged a close bond between our 2 nations and their peoples. March 25, 2003, marks the 182nd anniversary of the beginning of the revolution that freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire and it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the Greek people and to reaffirm the democratic principles from which our 2 great nations were born. ____________________ EXPRESSING SUPPORT AND APPRECIATION FOR THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES PARTICIPATING IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM ______ speech of HON. WILLIAM D. DELAHUNT of massachusetts in the house of representatives Thursday, March 20, 2003 Mr. DELAHUNT. Mr. Speaker, tonight the invasion of Iraq has begun. Overwhelmingly, it is the men and women of the American military who are carrying out this operation. That's why, although nobody can predict the twists and turns this war will take, I have no doubt that our troops will ultimately prevail. They are the best trained, equipped, and motivated soldiers the world has ever seen. They make us proud even in peacetime. And they will do so again in this conflict. So it is right that the U.S. Congress should come together to express the Nation's respect and gratitude. And this resolution is a good first step. But it is only a beginning. We must follow up these flattering words with concrete measures of support for our troops, and for those veterans who served before them. Let me be clear: I oppose this war. I voted against the Congressional authorization to use military force. I would prefer that our fellow citizens in the military were not risking their lives in this invasion tonight. But now that it is underway, there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that the U.S. armed forces have our full and sustained support. Within the Congress and across our Nation, we still have profound disagreements over the rationale for this pre-emptive strike. For my part, as a member of the International Relations Committee, I have been thoroughly dismayed at the handling of the buildup to this war. I believe it is particularly misleading to argue that this assault is part of the fully justified and necessary response to the savagery of al Qaeda. I strongly object to language in this resolution that does exactly that. [[Page 7440]] This is not to say that I oppose liberating the Iraqi people or ending the brutality of the Iraqi regime. Saddam Hussein is a ruthless dictator who has visited unspeakable horror on Iraqis and their neighbors. And I find myself concurring with those in the Administration who believe that this could be exactly the kind of radical strategy that could shock the Middle East into real change. But the way that the Administration so thoroughly assaulted the structures of world order in its rush to war could make our coming victory in Iraq a Pyrrhic one. The White House attitude has isolated our nation from the rest of the world more thoroughly than at any time in recent history. It has alienated some of our closest allies, seriously damaged the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and potentially undermined the international order that the United States worked so hard to establish after World War II. Either the Administration does not realize, or else it refuses to accept, that we need that international order. It is precisely because of this global cooperation that we have been so successful in the war against al Qaeda. Since for the most part, that is not a war in the traditional sense. It is one waged in the shadows, through intelligence agencies, special forces operations, and old-fashioned police work. Due to the sheer obscenity of the September 11 attacks, and the threat to the international order that this organization represents, most of the world welcomed the chance to assist us in fighting al Qaeda. And the help of many nations--yes, even that of France--has made a great contribution to our efforts against the terrorists. But the Administration's belligerent swagger into war with Iraq has squandered that goodwill. Its ever-changing rationales for this action--particularly its assertion of direct links between Saddam and al Qaeda, which our own CIA refuses to corroborate--have undermined our credibility. Its refusal to estimate the cost of the invasion and subsequent occupation has stripped the budget resolution the House considered tonight of any connection to reality. Its abandonment of our veterans calls into question our long-term commitment to our serving military. Its penchant for secrecy and intolerance for dissent feeds conspiracy theories about our true intentions. And its assumption that might makes right sends a terrifying signal to a world that only recently had begun to embrace the traditional American view that legitimacy is derived from democracy and the rule of law. Although I am certain that our military will win the war in Iraq, I am greatly concerned that the Administration will lose the peace. Time will only tell who is right. Many in this chamber will continue to have great differences with the Administration on this policy. But there is one thing on which I agree wholeheartedly with the President: our men and women in uniform deserve our deepest respect and appreciation. These American citizens are willing to die so that we may live; to risk life and limb for the sake of our national security. And they will do their job effectively, honorably, and without unnecessary partisan rancor. I call on my colleagues, and all Americans, to acknowledge their sacrifices by living up to the ideals for which they are fighting. ____________________ RECOGNIZING JASON GUTHERY AS WINNER OF THE COTILLION FOR ACHIEVEMENT SCHOLARSHIP ______ HON. SAM GRAVES of missouri in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Jason Guthery, a very special young man who has exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership. He has been honored with the Award of Distinction as winner of the Cotillion for Achievement scholarship program. The Cotillion for Achievement award was established in 1986 and is presented annually. Two winners, one male, one female, are selected from public and private school seniors attending school in Andrew and Buchanan County, Missouri. Students are evaluated on four criteria; scholastic achievement, extracurricular activities, community involvement and an essay written by the student. This prestigious award has been extended to Jason. Jason has established himself as a well-rounded student. He is involved in numerous activities, including Student Council president, yearbook editor, newspaper editor, Spirit team, baseball captain, football captain, LaFayette overnight experience, Peers Always Listen, blood mobile, Youth Forum facilitator, Lindbergh Christmas volunteer, Young Life junior leader, and a junior counselor of the Missouri Association of Student Councils. Additionally, he has been honored for his achievements with such awards and distinctions as the Students Owning Academic Responsibility academic pin winner and academic letter winner. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Jason Guthery for his many achievements and in wishing him the best of luck in his future. ____________________ HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF PAT LOOMES' TENURE AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GIRLS INC. OF ALAMEDA COUNTY ______ HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Pat Loomes, Executive Director of Girls Incorporated of Alameda County. Pat has selflessly dedicated her life to inspiring girls to be strong, smart and bold. Pat grew up in Ireland and immigrated to the United States with education and activism as her primary goals. After earning a graduate degree she began working at the Berkeley Women's Center in the early 1970s. There she identified the immense need for preventive measures for women who had suffered life-long abuse and low self-esteem, and who possessed very few skills that could translate into employment or self- improvement. It was at this time that Pat accepted the position as Executive Director at a small organization for girls with the passion and foresight that produced the thriving social service agency that Girls Inc. of Alameda County is today. For the past 25 years, Pat has been instrumental in the financial growth of the organization. Under her direction, operations grew to over $3 million, and today the organization serves thousands of girls. Girls Inc. has expanded from a small tutoring and recreational club to offering girls more than 10 acclaimed programs ranging from science, math and technology enrichment to leadership and fitness as well as comprehensive mental health services. During her tenure as Executive Director of Girls Inc., Pat has been ahead of her time in confronting girls' most sensitive needs with conviction and grace. In 1989, when funding cuts discontinued a local program for pregnant teens and teen parents, Girls Inc. began to support services for this population. Pat also oversaw the implementation of the award-winning national program, Preventing Adolescent Pregnancy. Since that time, Girls Inc.'s health and sexuality programming has expanded to include services to school-age mothers, pregnant and parenting girls involved in the juvenile justice system, as well as providing reproductive health education in schools from Berkeley to Union City. Pat's hard work and devotion have not gone unrecognized. In 1986 and again in 2000, the United Way awarded Pat the Seaton Manning Outstanding Professional Award for her ``visionary leadership and tireless advocacy for girls.'' The Wells Fargo Foundation and the Management Center of San Francisco also honored her with the 2001 Navigator Award for Model Leadership. Pat served as a member of the National Girls Incorporated Board of Directors for 13 years. In 1995 she delivered a seminar on math and science for girls at the International Women's Conference in Beijing, China. Her advocacy skills were well utilized in these arenas of national and international policymaking. I am honored to join the colleagues of Pat Loomes in commending her 25 years of tireless commitment to empowering girls. Pat has made it a personal and professional mission to strike a balance between her ideology and direct service to her community. She has been not only the driving force behind the success of Girls Incorporated of Alameda County for 25 years, but a crucial advocate for girls around the globe as well. ____________________ GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY ______ HON. MARTIN T. MEEHAN of massachusetts in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the 182nd anniversary of Greek Independence Day. Greek Independence Day is a celebration of freedom and democratic self-governance. Classical Greece was the birthplace of democracy. Athen's era of liberty and self-governance inspired many of our Founding Fathers, particularly Thomas Jefferson as the author of the Declaration of Independence. Freedom [[Page 7441]] movements throughout history have been inspired by classical Greece. The 400 year foreign occupation of Greece by the repressive Ottoman Empire cast a pall over the proponents of democratic self-governance. The Greeks captured the world's imagination again when they began their fight for freedom from the Ottoman Empire in 1821. The Greeks won their independence and renewed the worldwide movement towards self- governance. I am proud to represent one of the longest sustained communities of Americans of Greek descent. The first Greek came to Lowell in the mid- 19th century. By the 1890s Greek immigrants began moving to Lowell to work in its mills. They opened Greek Orthodox churches, developed small businesses, organized social institutions, and helped build the city of Lowell. The Greek families thrived and grew and Lowell became a major destination point for Greek immigration. In fact, Lowell was called the ``Acropolis of America.'' Thousands of Greek families throughout the United States can trace their roots back to Lowell. The Hellenic community of Lowell remains vibrant and engaged. For example, last month I held a community forum on the Cyprus dispute. The unlawful division of Cyprus has been a major foreign policy dilemma for N.A.T.O. and the State Department. This winter, a new United Nations plan and popular support on both sides of Cyprus for a settlement fostered intensive negotiations. Because of the importance of this issue, I held a forum on the Cyprus negotiations. I'm often told that people do not care about international affairs until after a dispute has become an international crisis. This was proven wrong by the demonstrated interest of the Hellenic community in the Cyprus negotiations. Those in attendance at the Cyprus forum belonged to such institutions as: Hellenic Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, Transfiguration Greek Orthodox Church, Sts. Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church, St. George's Greek Orthodox Church, the Federation of Hellenic-American Societies of New England, Greek American Legion Post #1, the Mani Society, the Pan-Macedonian Association, the Pan-Laconian Federation, the Order of A.H.E.P.A., the Euorkos Society, the Sons and Daughters of Kastrakini, and the Pan-Messinian Federation, among other institutions. The latest negotiations failed largely because the northern Cyprus obstructionist leader Rauf Denktash prevented the plan from being sent to the Turkish Cypriots for a referendum. This latest travesty by Mr. Denktash will only fuel the increasing distant between himself and the new, pro-settlement government of Turkey. While frustrating to all, the negotiations went further than any prior negotiations. It is the continued interest and work of the Hellenic community that will raise awareness about Cyprus. I can think of no better living tribute to Greek Independence Day. ____________________ RECOGNIZING THE ``LOST THEATRES OF SOMERVILLE'' PROJECT ______ HON. MICHAEL E. CAPUANO of massachusetts in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Somerville Museum on the ``Lost Theatres of Somerville'' project, a multifaceted exhibition of the architectural, commercial and cultural significance of fourteen movie theaters that were built and operated during the twentieth century. This ``Visual and Oral History of Somerville's Picture Palaces'' is an in-depth portrait of Somerville's theatres through compilations of photographs, artifacts and other documents. The exhibit will juxtapose historic accounts of the theatres with present-day photos of the theatre sites. In addition to the visual displays, a collection of oral histories will provide first-hand narratives about the legendary theaters of Somerville. Dr. Guss, a professor of Sociology and Anthropology at Tufts University, will conduct the oral history component of the exhibit. The Lost Theaters of Somerville display will also include a speaker series. Former theater employees, cultural geographers, anthropologists, and architectural and theatrical historians will share their memories and perceptions of Somerville's theatres. The Somerville Museum will keep photographs of the theaters in its permanent archives of Somerville history, and oral history tapes will be held at the Somerville Public Library. Retaining these accounts ensures that the legacy of Somerville's twentieth century movie theaters will extend well into the twenty-first century. Many thanks to the Lost Theaters of Somerville coordinators for the work they have done to document and preserve a very special aspect of Somerville's history. ____________________ INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION HONORING OPERATION RESPECT, THE ``DON'T LAUGH AT ME'' PROGRAM, AND PETER YARROW ______ HON. GEORGE MILLER of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to submit a bipartisan resolution, together with seventeen of my colleagues in the House, recognizing the accomplishments of Operation Respect and of Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary, who founded and helps to promote this outstanding program nationwide. Operation Respect and its ``Don't Laugh At Me'' initiative are helping to promote anti-bullying, compassion and tolerance among children in after-school programs and children's camps. The ``Don't Laugh At Me'' program has been presented in 230 workshops in dozens of congressional districts. Over 18,000 educators in 27 states have received its training materials and professionally-developed curriculum. As we all know, Mr. Yarrow has described in words and song the program's goal and objective to enthusiastic meetings of the Republican Conference and the Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives. The ``Don't Laugh At Me'' program uses character education to promote the social and emotional growth in children. When a child has fewer worries of bullying and intolerant classmates, that child is able to focus on schoolwork as well as create new bonds with fellow students. It is no wonder that teachers, parents and students alike have given very high marks to the ``Don't Laugh At Me'' program. Many organizations have commended Operation Respect and the ``Don't Laugh At Me'' program, including the National Conference of State Legislatures, who passed a resolution in August of 2001 that recognized the value of Operation Respect. Major educational organizations supporting this important initiative include the National Association of Elementary School Principals, National Association of Secondary School Principals, American Association of School Administrators, Council of Great City Colleges of Education, National Education Association, Council of Great City Schools, American School Counselors Association, National School Boards Association, National Middle School Association, and the American Federation of Teachers. The House should recognize the achievements of Operation Respect and Peter Yarrow in helping to make schools and camps safer, more tolerant, more learning-friendly environments for our children. I would hope that the House would be able to consider this bipartisan resolution in the near future. ____________________ INNOCENTS IN UNIFORM ______ HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to draw to the attention of my colleagues an article written by my friend Princeton Economist Uwe Reinhardt. Dr. Reinhardt is well known to many of us in Congress because of his expertise in health care policy. He's an advisor I rely on for his keen insights, knowledge, and his wit--not a characteristic identified in many health economists. What many of my colleagues may not know is that Dr. Reinhardt and his wife, May, have a son who is serving in the U.S. Marines on the front lines in Iraq. Dr. Reinhardt grew up in Germany and saw the horrors of war as a young boy there. His words deserve our attention. He's right. Our thoughts and prayers should extend to all involved in war and against any loss of human life--civilian, military, American or Iraqi. I commend Dr. Reinhardt's article for your attention. His sentiments are ones I share completely and I thank him for being able to so eloquently say what many of us feel. I hope others will take his words to heart. [[Page 7442]] [From the New York Times, Mar. 22, 2003] Innocents in Uniform (By Uwe E. Reinhardt) Princeton, NJ.--CNN recently showed a Marine chaplain admonishing the platoon assembled before him: Pray not only for yourself, he told them, but for your enemies as well. After all, they are just soldiers, like you, doing what they are ordered to do. What a refreshing departure these words were from what I've been hearing from the civilian sector, where the talk is mainly of minimizing coalition casualties or, in more generous moments, innocent Iraqi civilian casualties as well. I wince every time I hear that kind of talk, especially the reference to innocence. Should not the proper minimum in any war be loss of human life, period--which in this case includes Iraqi soldiers, too? My earliest childhood memories were forged by war--real war. My family lived near one of the most ferocious battle grounds of the European war theater--the notorious Hurtgen forest, where American and German soldiers fought one another in hand-to-hand combat for more than four months in the fall of 1944. A plaque at one of the military cemeteries in the area notes that more American soldiers died there than in Vietnam, and surely as many or more German soldiers were killed there too. My family lived opposite a convent that had been converted into a field hospital for the nearby front. I was a small boy then, and watching the ambulances come and go (sometimes peeking curiously into them), I could not help but become witness daily to the horrors of war. Millions of Europeans of my generation, whom many Americans now disparage so contemptuously as pacifists, had a similar experience. Because we lived so near the Battle of the Bulge and the advancing, allied forces, our village was strafed and bombed routinely. One such attack came as my friends and I were playing outside. We ran as the planes approached, taking shelter in the cavernous basement of the convent. There we spied a row of stretchers. On each was a body covered entirely by a blanket. Possibly to overcome our own terror, we dared one another to pull back a blanket on one of the stretchers, to see what a dead man looked like. Someone did. We fell silent instantly as we beheld the serene, waxen face of a very young soldier who could not have been older than 16 or 17. More than 50 years later, I can still see his face clearly. The shock of it recurs whenever I hear the chirpy anchors on the morning programs (not to mention the hawkish talking heads) prattle on about innocent civilians, as if the number of fallen enemy soldiers did not count. What does ``innocent'' mean in the context of war? I am almost certain that the young German soldier my friends and I saw so many years ago in that convent basement was as innocent as those of us who weren't in uniform. For all we know, he had grown up on a farm somewhere and, while fighting in the trenches, dreamed of his girlfriend and of life as an adult in peaceful times. For all we know, he would have happily quit fighting and joined the allies. (He didn't have much of a choice: some German generals strung up on trees the bodies of young soldiers who had deserted, a powerful warning to their peers.) Perhaps many of the Iraqi soldiers, too, find themselves where they are because they have no other choice. After all, is not Saddam Hussein a ruthless dictator, and are not some of his generals likely to be as cruel as their Wehrmacht counterparts? My hope is that Americans can muster the proper decorum that an enterprise as horrible as war demands. There is nothing neat about maiming and killing people with precision bombs from the air or gunfire on the ground--even if they're wearing enemy uniforms. Young lives are snuffed out; parents, siblings and lovers weep, and so should we. We want our troops to win a quick victory, to be sure. As the father of a young Marine officer on the front lines in Iraq, I certainly do. But let us heed that Marine chaplain who, like anyone who has ever witnessed war, knows whereof he speaks. Let us hope and pray for a minimum loss of human life--period. ____________________ ELECTION OF ALICE P. MILLER AS PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE ELECTION DIRECTORS ______ HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to inform my colleagues in the House of Representatives that on February 22, 2003, in Washington, D.C., Alice P. Miller, who is Executive Director of the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics, was sworn-in as President of the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED). That was an exceptional achievement, because the membership of NASED comprises the Election Directors of all of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. NASED is a non-partisan organization, whose members do not take stands on legislative matters. Those matters are left to elected officials to decide. NASED members are committed to conducting elections that are free, fair, and open, while maintaining the public trust. Those of us in the Washington Metropolitan Area (D.C., Maryland and Virginia) have known about Alice's exceptional talents, integrity and leadership for many years. It is especially gratifying, however, that an organization that represents all 50 states and several Territories, also appreciates Mrs. Miller's fine attributes by electing her President of NASED. I had the honor of welcoming this national organization to Washington recently and also enjoyed meeting the NASED leaders. I found them to be very knowledgeable and dedicated public officials who are certainly aware of the serious responsibilities that they have. Mrs. Miller, a Washington, D.C. resident, is the first African American to be elected President of NASED and has served on the National Association's executive committee for four years. She has represented NASED at Congressional hearings, including the 2001 Congressional Black Caucus hearing on election reform. That legislation culminated in the passage and signing of the historic Help America Vote Act of 2002. Recently, Mrs. Miller, who is married and the mother of two children, was also named to serve on the board of directors of the Election Center. This organization promotes, preserves and improves democracy. Their members are government employees who serve in local voter registration and election administrative activities. She is also a member of the board of the Center's Professional Education Program. Last year she was also appointed to the Federal Election Commission Advisory Board. Before she was appointed Executive Director of the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics, Mrs. Miller served as the Board's General Counsel. She was elected President of NASED at a very important time. The nation is hoping that election reform will increase voter participation and also increase the trust of voters in protecting the integrity of the electoral process, which is vital in a democracy. Mrs. Miller has done outstanding work at the D.C. Board of Elections, sometimes under trying conditions. For example, the Board conducted a flawless election with new machines that had never been used before when the two leading candidates for Mayor of the city were write-in candidates. Thus, Mrs. Miller's election to NASED begins with excellence at home. I congratulate Mrs. Miller on her major national achievement and wish her the very best in her new and challenging responsibilities. ____________________ RECOGNIZING MRS. ``NELL'' WRIGHT ______ HON. JOHN A. BOEHNER of ohio in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate, thank, and recognize my constituent Mrs. Neldleen ``Nell'' Wright. Nell is a testament to the innate goodness of human nature and the overwhelming positive effect one individual may have on the community. As a wife, mother, and tireless volunteer in Ohio's Eighth Congressional District, Nell has quietly given much more than she has taken. Her work, as an employee with the Butler County Republican Party, over the past fifteen years has been a constant source of pride and unconditional praise. Nell's dedication is undoubtedly a major reason for the party's huge success. Mr. Speaker, Nell's warm smile and gentle personality are known throughout Southwest Ohio. Her attitude, fierce determination, and community spirit are a constant source of energy for all those around her. So much of Nell's work is done quietly and without reward, and it is my honor to take this moment and say thank you to her. I congratulate Nell and wish her a very happy 80th birthday. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO DON CASTLEBERRY ______ HON. TOM LANTOS of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I ask my colleagues to join [[Page 7443]] me in paying tribute to an extraordinary professor, an esteemed colleague and dear friend, Don Castleberry. He recently passed away at his home in San Mateo, California on Sunday February 16, 2003, having lived a blessed and generous life. Don was born December 2, 1914 in Hollis, Oklahoma and received his Bachelor's Degree from Central State College in Edmond, Oklahoma. He then attended the University of Oklahoma to obtain a Master's Degree and went on to the University of Minnesota where he received a Ph. D. in Political Science. During World War II, he bravely served his country as the Assistant Director of Civilian Relief Operations (CRO) for the American Red Cross in Russia and then as Director of CRO in Poland. After returning from Europe, Don moved his family to California and began his remarkable career at San Francisco State University (SFSU). His extraordinary career at the University spanned a remarkable 31 years. During his tenure he taught political science and held a variety of administrative positions, the last of which as the Dean of the Graduate Division. Additionally, Don had the privilege of spending a year teaching at the American University in Beirut, Lebanon as a Fullbright Scholar in 1959. Mr. Speaker, it is without exaggeration when I say Don was an exceptional influence on my life. In addition to being a splendid professor, Don was a dedicated advisor during my first Congressional campaign. In fact I have always viewed Don's keen insight, astounding intellect and courageous spirit as great assets that were crucial to my first Congressional victory. His passing has taken away one of San Mateo's favored sons and his contributions to the betterment of our local and national community will certainly be missed. He is survived by his loving wife of 61 years, Arline, his wonderful children Karen and Gerry, his grandchildren Samantha, Christopher, Timothy and William and his sister Beth. Mr. Speaker, my wife Annette and I are deeply grieved by Don's passing and I urge all of my colleagues to join us in offering our most sincere condolences to Arline and the rest of Castleberry family. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO MARCUS C. HANSEN, BUSINESS LEADER AND PATRIOT ______ HON. CURT WELDON of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Marcus C. Hansen is one leader whose accomplishments and dedication to both his vision and values have gained him the respect and admiration of individuals across this great country. It is a privilege to take this opportunity to recognize his outstanding leadership as President of Lockheed Martin Management & Data Systems (M&DS). Under Mr. Hansen's leadership for the past six years, M&DS--a $2.3 billion business unit of the Lockheed Martin Corporation headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania--has contributed vitally to the proud history of Lockheed Martin. It has been both a great honor and a distinct pleasure to work with Marc over the years, and I salute him for his unwavering dedication to our country, citizens and economy. On March 31, 2003, Mr. Hansen will retire as President of Lockheed Martin Management & Data Systems (M&DS). Mr. Hansen had responsibility for all aspects of the organization's business, including management of more than 8,000 employees. The company's record under his leadership speaks for itself: outstanding execution, disciplined growth and unquestionable commitment to customer and corporate success. Under his tenure, M&DS has truly grown into a world-class organization that values its customers, employees, and the community. Mr. Hansen is often described by his peers as a strong leader who is able to motivate those around him to continued success. Over the years, I have seen first-hand his ability to inspire, and I applaud his talents and dedication. Since he became president of M&DS in 1997, the company has met or exceeded its financial goals every year while increasing sales from $1 billion to over $2 billion. Under Mr. Hansen's leadership, M&DS has received several business awards and distinctions, including the highest technical accreditation ever accorded a single company, SEI SE/ SW CMMI Maturity level 5 from the Carnegie Mellon Institute. Computerworld magazine also featured the company as one of the ``Top 100 Best Places to Work in IT'' for the last two years. Mr. Hansen directed a broad array of information technology business areas with capabilities in system engineering and integration, architectural definition, and large-scale data and information software systems design, development and implementation. Additionally, major elements of the company are engaged in system operations, maintenance and enhancement at customer facilities. Mr. Hansen's business philosophy is driven his unwaivering commitment to the highest ethical standards. He strongly believes that if you genuinely care about your customers and help them succeed, you succeed. To maintain competitiveness, Mr. Hansen believes a company must attract and retain the best employees and create an environment that allows them to flourish. Mr. Hansen began his career in 1968 with GE Aerospace (GEA) in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. In 1974, he became program manager supporting the Landsat satellite system. In 1977, he joined Management & Data Systems where he held a number of increasingly responsible engineering and program management positions. In 1988, Mr. Hansen took on the assignment of managing GEA's Aerospace Information Technology component. In 1989, he transferred to Syracuse, New York as General Manager of Engineering, Ocean and Radar Systems, and in 1992 he assumed the same position at Government Electronic Systems in Moorestown, New Jersey. In January 1994, Mr. Hansen returned to M&DS as vice president, Requirements Management Systems, and in March 1995 assumed the role of executive vice president of M&DS. Mr. Hansen was then named president of Management & Data Systems in March 1997. With his career at M&DS near its end, Mr. Hansen said that if he could leave just one thing behind, it would be M&DS Guiding Principles or what he calls ``the right stuff''--his recipe for a world-class business. He urged employees to read, understand and personalize them, and he encouraged them to make certain that decisions are made in the best interest of the country, the customer and the corporation. Mr. Speaker, fellow colleagues, please join me in paying tribute to the exemplary accomplishments of Mr. Marcus C. Hansen, for his achievements as a business leader and patriot who exemplifies the spirit that has made this country great. I wish Marc continued success as he utilizes his energies and talents in new and exciting ways. I wish Marc and his wife Cheryl much happiness in the future. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO MR. VINCENT L. BARILE, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY FOR MEMORIAL AFFAIRS ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Vincent L. Barile, Deputy Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, who retired after 28 years of service at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. Vince began his career with VA in 1975 as a veterans' benefits counselor. In 1976, he transferred to the Budget Service in VA's central office. From 1979 to 1984, he served as a budget analyst in the Veterans Health Administration, where he rose to supervisor of budget formulation and operations. In 1984, Vince joined the National Cemetery Administration, NCA, as the director of budget and planning. In this position he was responsible for the formulation and implementation of the annual budget, all planning activities, and other activities including emergency preparedness, energy conservation and safety programs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs promoted Vince to Deputy Under Secretary for Management for NCA in 1990. In 2002, Vince was appointed Deputy Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs. In this capacity, Vince oversaw budget and planning, information systems, communications, human resources, administration, contracting, memorial programs, state cemetery grants, and operations and construction for 120 national cemeteries. Vince testified before the Veterans' Affairs Committee frequently on memorial affairs issues, where he brought extensive knowledge and experience to the witness table. When asked what they will remember most about Vince Barile, employees he supervised say that he was a mentor and a teacher. He often conducted impromptu sessions in the hallways, always credited his employees for their work, and helped them find opportunities to learn. As evidence of the high regard he had for his employees, Vince summed up his remarks at his farewell party by saying that his Exceptional Service Award was not his award, but one in recognition of all his employees. He [[Page 7444]] noted that if his career was considered successful, it was because of the people who worked for and with him. He then applauded his staff. With Vince's retirement, VA is losing vast institutional knowledge and a real friend to America's veterans. Thank you, Vince, for your 28 years of dedicated service to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Nation. ____________________ HONORING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE U.S. ARMED FORCES ______ HON. ANDER CRENSHAW of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, the United States of America is the proud home to the best trained, most versatile, and most committed voluntary military force in the world. The men and women of our armed forces defend our lives, our freedom, and our loved ones at a moment's notice, without question. This incredible commitment provides an incalculable benefit to the citizens of the United States of America; for this, I rise today on behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida to say thank you. There is a tremendous sense of patriotism among those in the military. These men and women answer a call to duty that often means the difference between life and death. The men and women of our armed forces are the first sent to confront the unknown; they face danger until the last threat is gone. This unwavering commitment to defending our freedom extends beyond asking our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines for their duty; this commitment includes asking their parents, their spouses, and their children to stay strong while they are fighting for freedom on a foreign shore. To the men and women of our Armed Forces, thank you. Your sacrifice is priceless. Your dedication is greatly appreciated. ____________________ HONORING SHERIFF C.A. ``PELK'' RICHARDS ______ HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. RADANOVICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sheriff C.A. ``Pelk'' Richards for his commitment and dedication to the Mariposa County Law Enforcement. On Friday, May 2nd his retirement will be celebrated at Sheriff C.A. ``Pelk'' Richards' Retirement Dinner in Mariposa, California. Pelk Richards has been an active member of the community throughout his life. He is a Mariposa native who was born in San Diego and raised in Mariosa County. Pelk graduated from Mariposa County High School and married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy. In his younger years, he was a steer and team roper while taking part in the Triangle Roping Club and the California Cowboys Association. On July 1, 1972 Mr. Richards joined the Mariposa County Sheriff's Office as a Deputy Sheriff/Jailer. Pelk was very progressive and worked his way up the rank structure at the Sheriff's Office. He was promoted to Sergeant in 1977 while receiving the Outstanding Sergeant Award, and again promoted to Commander in 1985 and later moved up to Undersheriff in 1990. Pelk was sworn in as Mariposa's 21st Sheriff in January of 1999. During his career, Sheriff Richards solved all homicides assigned to him and was deemed to be a Court expert in Narcotics. In 1990, he was awarded the ``J. Edgar Hoover'' Law Enforcement Officer of the Year Award. Pelk was also responsible for writing 417(b) California Penal Code-Protecting Peace Officers Legislation. Immediately after taking office, Sheriff Richards gathered his command staff and created a Mission, Vision, and Value Statement which held to the mission ``to control, prevent, and reduce crimes in all our communities, while being courteous, professional, and respectful.'' He also developed a Terrorism Response Plan for Mariposa County in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor Sheriff C.A. ``Pelk'' Richards for his dedication to Mariposa County. I urge my colleagues to join me in wishing Sheriff C.A. ``Pelk'' Richards many more years of success. ____________________ A TRIBUTE TO NANCY RIVARD ______ HON. TOM LANTOS of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to pay tribute to one of my most extraordinary constituents, a beacon of kindness in the world, Ms. Nancy Rivard. This outstanding woman is a former airline attendant who single-handedly founded the Airline Ambassadors International (AAI), an extraordinary non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of needy children from all over the world. Ms. Rivard's desire to establish this organization, dedicated to making a difference in the lives of needy children began over ten years ago. After years of trial, turmoil and rejection her dream finally became a reality when AAI was founded in 1996. Every year this wonderful organization makes a difference in the lives of over 100,000 children in 25 of the world's most troubled countries by having its members hand-deliver food, clothing, medicine, school supplies and personal care products directly to the children in the receiving countries. Since its inception AAI has seen the ranks of its volunteers grow to more than 400 people who have contributed over 600,000 hours of their time. Mr. Speaker, this remarkable organization is made up of 4 different components. First, the Humanitarian Aid Program coordinates the local effort to collect and sort humanitarian and medical supplies. Volunteers arrange the pick up and packing of donations and then with the help of a participating airline, they ship the items to the countries that are currently receiving aid. From there the donations are hand-delivered directly to the children. The volunteers also are involved with facility refurbishing, holiday parties and planting trees. Second is the Children's Escort Program, which supplies volunteer escorts for children in need of medical care in the United States. AAI provides the adoption agency or nonprofit organization with a previously screened and qualified escort at a significantly reduced airfare. The child's airfare is provided through the ``Miles for Kids'' program. The third component is the Youth Programs. These programs give young people the chance to be involved in the humanitarian missions, a unique opportunity that offers adolescences the chance to help needy kids their own age and experience kindness and compassion on a whole new level. AAI also co-sponsors an annual youth art competition that has received entries from over 60,000 children in approximately 62 countries. Finally, the fourth component of AAI involves members volunteering at special events, locally, nationally and internationally with goals to better the world and bring goodwill into action. Mr. Speaker, Nancy Rivard's tireless work has helped countless children in their time of need. Her selflessness, passion and drive have not only given the world's needy children the chance to experience things they had only dreamed of, but more importantly, she has given these children a glimmer of hope. Her plan to build Airline Ambassadors into an organization of even more strength and ability is an ambitious plan, one that should be applauded. Nancy was recently presented with a well-deserved ``National Caring Award'' for her accomplishments with AAI. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to say that this remarkable woman is one of my longtime constituents and it delights me to think that I am representing such a fine example of the American people. I urge all my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Nancy Rivard, for this exceptional woman is truly an inspiration to all of us, proving that one person can make a difference. ____________________ COMMENDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION ON THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN ______ HON. PHIL ENGLISH of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. ENGLISH. Mr. Speaker, Secretary of State Powell was in Beijing recently, asking for Beijing's assistance on the issues of North Korea and Iraq. Beijing responded by asking the Bush Administration to consider ``trade-offs,'' especially more American flexibility on the issue of Taiwan. I want to commend Secretary Powell and the Bush Administration for refusing to participate in this sort of irresponsible horse-trading. We continue to support peaceful solution to any political disagreements between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. At the same time, Congress has repeatedly voiced its commitment to defend the people of Taiwan from aggression, and we have backed this commitment with economic, political and [[Page 7445]] military cooperation. I believe that this Administration has done an exemplary job of reinforcing this commitment by refusing to compromise Taiwan's security in the face of Beijing's attempts at coercion. Meanwhile, Beijing has turned a deaf ear to Taiwan President Chen Shui-Bian's calls for renewed dialogue between the two. This lack of communication will certainly result in misunderstanding, and could lead to dangerous miscalculations by both sides. These sorts of miscalculations can in turn lead to the sort of military confrontation that we all wish to avoid. I therefore strongly urge Beijing's new leadership to remove Chinese missiles from the area along the Taiwan Strait and to embrace a peaceful approach to managing the cross-strait relationship. It is time for bilateral dialogue on economic cooperation, democratic governance, improved human rights and peaceful resolution of all issues between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China. ____________________ 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LABORERS' INTERNATIONAL UNION ______ HON. GEORGE MILLER of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I know that all Members of the House of Representatives will want to join me in saluting the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) on the 100th anniversary of its founding. LIUNA, through its millions of members over the years, has long played a vital role in building America through the construction of highways, bridges, dams and power plants, factories, office buildings, schools, churches, hospitals, apartments, and houses throughout the country. The first president of the AFL-CIO, Samuel Gompers, convened the meeting in April, 1903, that resulted in the creation of the International Hod Carriers' and Building Laborers' Union of America. That union represented just 8,000 workers. In 1965, the name was changed to the Laborers' International Union of North America to reflect the expansion of the union beyond the construction field. Today, LIUNA consists of approximately 800,000 members in more than 650 locals throughout the country. LIUNA members work in a wide variety of fields including local, state and federal governments, health care, shipbuilding and hazardous waste removal. LIUNA is one of the most innovative unions in the labor movement, with state of the art training centers across North America. LIUNA has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to protecting the rights of laborers and is among the most successful unions at organizing within the labor federation today. LIUNA's success is predicated on the protection and promotion of its members--goals that are achieved through the dedication and hard work of union officers and their representatives working at all levels of government. The efforts of these men and women to protect and enhance the welfare of LIUNA's members serves to better the lives of all workers throughout the United States. LIUNA's efforts to raise the standard of living for laborers are deserving of our attention and admiration. This is an extraordinary union whose leadership works hard every day to protect members' health and safety, provide laborers a strong voice in the workplace, provide extensive skill training to empower members to reach their full potential, and perhaps most importantly, to ensure dignity, respect and security for laborers in the workplace. Mr. Speaker, I join LIUNA's officers and members in celebrating their 100th Anniversary, and I salute the work of the Laborers International Union of North America. I encourage my colleagues to similarly respect the positive impacts LIUNA has had within their home districts and states, and I encourage them to express their support of this historic anniversary. ____________________ 182 YEARS OF FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE IN GREECE ______ HON. MARK STEVEN KIRK of illinois in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in commemoration of the 182 years that have passed since the Greek people's revolution from the Ottoman Empire. Nearly 400 years ago, the Greek people embarked on a powerful revolution against the Ottoman oppressors. As Bishop Germanos of Patras raised the Greek flag at Agia Lavras following the fall of Constantinople, the ancient Greeks forged a mighty wave of democracy and freedom. Long after the triumphs of 1821, Greece continues to prove itself as a loyal ally of the United States and an internationally recognized advocate of democracy. Greece is one of only three nations in the world beyond those of the former British Empire to be allied with the United States in every major international conflict of the 20th century. I have little doubt this impressive and dependable relationship will continue throughout the 21st century and beyond. In the Balkans, Greece has played a steady hand of democracy in the face of regional unrest and instability. As we continue in our efforts to free the world of terrorism, Greece again stands firm with the United States. Our efforts in the war against terror would not be as successful without the continued assistance from our allies in Greece. Greece's reliability as a stable democracy and key NATO ally is critical in our efforts to advocate international peace and stability. As we celebrate 182 years of freedom and independence, I salute and thank the Greek people for their spirit and their ongoing pursuit of peace. To Greece, a free and democratic ally: ``Cronia polla hellas''. ____________________ COMMENDING THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL'S EFFORTS AT SUPPORTING PEACE ______ HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, as we begin an unjust invasion of Iraq, I think that it is appropriate that this chamber hears from citizens and leaders on the local level, and not just the representatives of the Administration. Last week, on March 12, 2003, the New York City Council courageously passed resolution 549-A, condemning current plans for an invasion of Iraq. They did so representing their constituents, who have made it abundantly clear through letters, faxes, emails and public protests, that the costs are too great and the evidence too suspect to support an invasion. The resolution represents the voice of the people of our great city. I applaud the majority of the members of the Council for their principled fight for peace and diplomacy. I commend them for resisting the tempting safety of silence and risk being unfairly labeled and misunderstood as ``unpatriotic.'' We live in a time where no one wants to challenge our foreign policy decisions for fear of being perceived not supportive of freedom or of our brave men and women who poised for the invasion of Iraq. However, when history records where elected leaders were at the time that this fateful decision between war and international cooperation was made, it will be clear that it was the City Council of New York who stood strongly as voices for peace. I invite you to read excerpts of their resolution, so that it can be clear why the elected representatives of the citizens of the City of New York, still recovering from the attack of September 11, believe that real peace and democracy should be secured by law, not force. New York City Council Resolution Urging Military Restraint in Iraq Resolution calling on the government of the United States to make all efforts to work through the United Nations Security Council in a manner that would reaffirm our Nation's commitment to the rule of law and the primacy of human rights in our international relationships, and to take all appropriate steps toward securing the participation of other nations and international bodies in the effort to ensure that Iraq does not possess biological, chemical or nuclear weapons and toward promoting human rights for all the people of Iraq; and further calling on the government of the United States to work through the United Nations Security Council and with other nations to ensure the unimpeded access of United Nations weapons inspectors to all areas of and facilities in Iraq and to ensure that the inspectors be given a full and fair opportunity to conduct their efforts in accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions; and further calling upon the Council of the City of New York to oppose a pre-emptive military attack on Iraq unless it is demonstrated that Iraq poses a real and imminent threat to the security and safety of the United States or its allies or unless other options for achieving compliance with United Nations resolutions calling for the elimination of weapons [[Page 7446]] of mass destruction and the means for their development have failed. By Council Members Perkins, Baez, Barron, Boyland, Brewer, Clarke, Comrie, Davis, DeBlasio, Dilan, Espada, Foster, Gerson, Gioia, Gonzalez, Jackson, Koppell, Liu, Lopez, Martinez, the Speaker (Council Member Miller), Monserrate, Moskowitz, Quinn, Reed, Reyna, Sanders, Seabrook, Serrano, Stewart, Vann and Yassky. Whereas, The manner in which the United States government is responding to the crisis involving Iraq has caused great concern among many New Yorkers, resulting in one of the largest public demonstrations in the history of the City of New York on February 15, 2003; and Whereas, The Council of the City of New York is the locally elected voice of the people of the City of New York; and Whereas, Saddam Hussein has violated United Nations resolutions requiring his government to destroy biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, cease the development of such weapons and permit international inspection of all areas and facilities to ensure compliance with such resolutions; and Whereas, Although international weapons inspections barred by Iraq in 1998 have been reinstituted in response to international pressure, particularly from the United States, there is evidence that despite some cooperation, Iraq is not fully complying with United Nations resolutions; and Whereas, It is imperative that Iraq not be allowed to possess, use or export biological, chemical or nuclear weapons, or weapons of terror, and that Iraq fully comply with United Nations resolutions; and Whereas, Since taking power in 1979, Saddam Hussein's regime has committed human rights violations against the Iraqi people on a massive scale--documented by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and others--and we condemn these crimes and the ongoing oppression of the Iraqi people, including the Kurdish, Shiite and the other minority groups; and Whereas, It is in the interest of all nations, including the United States, that threats to world peace and violations of human rights be dealt with in accordance with international law and, whenever possible, on a multilateral basis; and Whereas, A pre-emptive United States military attack on Iraq, absent a real and imminent threat to the security and safety of the United States or its allies and absent the support of the international community would violate our commitments to the United Nations charter; and Whereas, War has grave repercussions in terms of loss of life; and Whereas, While it is difficult to project the financial costs of war, a thorough analysis published by the National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that the total cost of invasion, occupation, peace-keeping, reconstruction, nation- building and necessary humanitarian assistance might range from $150 to $750 billion; Whereas, Such cost would place an enormous strain on our nation's ability to maintain the infrastructure, human services and social programs necessary for our nation's security, general welfare and progress; and Whereas, It has not been substantiated that all other means of disarming Saddam Hussein in accordance with United Nations resolutions have been attempted and have failed; and Whereas, The United States government has not articulated how a military attack would result in the formation of an Iraqi government that rejects the development of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons and promotes freedom and democracy; and Whereas, In the event that our armed forces are called into combat in Iraq, we recognize, honor and appreciate the commitment, service and valor of our military personnel, and together with their families, we fervently hope for their safe return; and Whereas, This resolution speaks of the United States' response to the current crisis involving Iraq and does not address any action the United States might take in response to any future humanitarian crisis; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the government of the United States should make all efforts to work through the United Nations Security Council in a manner that would reaffirm our nation's commitment to the rule of law and the primacy of human rights in our international relationships, and should take all appropriate steps toward securing the participation of other nations and international bodies in the effort to ensure that Iraq does not possess biological, chemical or nuclear weapons and toward promoting human rights for all the people of Iraq; and be it further Resolved, That the government of the United States should work through the United Nations Security Council and with other nations to ensure the unimpeded access of United Nations weapons inspectors to all areas of and facilities in Iraq and to ensure that the inspectors be given a full and fair opportunity to conduct their efforts in accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions; and be it further Resolved, That the Council of the City of New York opposes a preemptive military attack on Iraq unless it is demonstrated that Iraq poses a real and imminent threat to the security and safety of the United States or its allies or unless all other options for achieving compliance with United Nations resolutions calling for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and the means for their development have failed. ____________________ IN MEMORY OF MARINE LANCE CORPORAL THOMAS SLOCUM OF THORNTON, CO ______ HON. MARK UDALL of colorado in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I learned today that Colorado has suffered its first casualty in the war on Iraq. Lance Corporal Thomas Slocum was one of nine Marines killed near Al Nasiriyah on Sunday, March 23, in an ambush. Another forty Marines were wounded in the fight. My heart goes out to Lance Corporal Slocum's family and friends. Thomas Slocum was based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina but called Thornton, Colorado, his home. He was just 22 years old at the time of his death--so young, but old enough to have developed the courage and dedication it took for him to answer the call to service. He was a brave and dedicated Marine who proudly served when his nation called on him to fight in the war against Iraq to bring freedom and justice to that country. The death of Lance Corporal Slocum brings this war closer to home for us all. All Coloradans, and indeed all Americans share in the pain of Lance Corporal Slocum's death, but we also share in honoring his unswerving dedication to our great nation. He will forever be remembered for his heroism and his sacrifice. ____________________ APPRECIATING DR. GURMIT SINGH AULAKH FOR BRINGING PLIGHT OF SIKHS, OTHER MINORITIES TO INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION ______ HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, for 17 years, Dr. Gurmit Singh Aulakh has been serving the Sikhs in this country and worldwide, first as President of the International Sikh Organization, a post in which he still serves, and later as President of the Council of Khalistan, which came into being when Sikhs declared their independence from India on October 7, 1987. He has been a tireless worker for the rights of Sikhs and other minorities in India, such as Christians, Muslims, Dalits (the dark-skinned ``Untouchables,'' the aboriginal people of South Asia), and others. Many of us in Congress have helped to expose the tyranny and terrorism that India has practiced against these groups and Dr. Aulakh has been a friend and an invaluable source of information to us. Sikhs are a separate nation and they ruled Punjab from 1710 to 1716 and again from 1765 to 1849. They are working to reclaim their lost sovereignty. They face persecution and terror for doing so. Dr. Aulakh's efforts and the support of those who back him have been crucial in bringing the Sikh struggle to the attention of the international community. He has worked with us in this House to the true and accurate history of the Sikh struggle and the struggles of other minorities in India. In these efforts he has been opposed by the Indian government, which has spent large amounts of money to counteract his efforts and spread disinformation. They even started a rumor on the Internet that he was dead. He has a tough job trying to achieve freedom for the Sikh Nation against the opposition of the Indian government. Even in the U.S. Congress, the Indian government has formed the Indian Caucus, which has 139 members, to support India and deflect our attention away from the oppression and terror there. He has done a yeoman job in exposing the brutal oppression of the Indian government against the Sikh Nation which has killed over 250,000 Sikhs since 1984. Another 50,000 Sikhs were arrested by the police, tortured, murdered, and then declared ``unidentified bodies'' and secretly cremated. He has brought to the attention of Congress that even at present, 52,268 Sikh political prisoners are rotting in Indian jails as political prisoners, according to the Movement Against State Repression. Dr. Aulakh has been tireless in promoting self-determination, which is the cornerstone of democracy. He has been a relentless advocate for the cause of Sikh freedom and the [[Page 7447]] independence of their homeland, Punjab, Khalistan. Like those of us in Congress, Dr. Aulakh knows and appreciates the privilege of service. Service is essential to the Sikh religion as it is to all religions. Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to salute Dr. Gurmit Singh Aulakh. ____________________ STATEMENT ON KASHMIR VIOLENCE ______ HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my outrage at the hideous and deplorable terrorist attack in the hamlet village Nadimarg south of Srinagar, in the Indian State of Jammu-Kashmir. I am deeply shocked and saddened by the killings. As we fight against terrorism in the Middle East and Afghanistan, we have to remember that the people of India deal with terrorism every single day. I condemn this hideous crime which represents a most despicable, inhumane act of terror. My feelings and thoughts are with the victims and their families. The attacks of the gunmen killed nearly half of the people living in the village. 24 Hindus known as Pandits lost their lives, including women and children. Most sadly, Suraj Kumar was killed only hours after celebrating his second birthday. His cousin, who was age 2 as well, was also gunned down. The attack is an attempt to destroy the conflict resolution endeavors in the region, but violence is no path to bring peace to Kashmir. Although the identity of the gunmen is unknown at this point, it is highly likely that Islamic militants are involved in these actions as part of their efforts to expel Hindus from the valley. In fact, this is not the first time as Islamic militants have conducted similar attacks in the past leading to an exodus of Hindus from the region. More than 300,000 Hindus have already been forced to leave Kashmir after Islamic militants commenced fighting against Indian rule in 1989. While many Hindus remain, increasing terrorist attacks have meant that they never truly feel completely secure. In fact, the Pandit families who live in Nadimarg had good relations with their Muslim neighbors, and their Muslim neighbors felt the same acute loss and pain that the Hindu community felt as well on this senseless attack. Last year, President Musharraf pledged to President Bush that he would end Islamic militant incursions in Kashmir and that he would terminate cross-border infiltration. Obviously, the Pakistani President has not kept his promise. Much more needs to be done to protect all communities in Jammu-Kashmir from terrorism and violence. As the snow in the Himalayas starts to melt, and travel between the mountain passes becomes easier, it is more important than ever that President Musharraf redoubles his effort to control Pakistani incursions into India. ____________________ EXPRESSING SUPPORT AND APPRECIATION FOR THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES PARTICIPATING IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM ______ speech of HON. TOM UDALL of new mexico in the house of representatives Thursday, March 20, 2003 Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, we are at war in Iraq. In the past, when our President has made the decision to commit to the use of force, the Congress has always come together to speak with one voice, for one purpose: to support the efforts of our troops, and to pray for their courage, their success, and their safe and quick return home. While I have stated my own opposition in the past to military intervention without our allies in the United Nations, and I have heard from thousands of constituents who shared those reservations about unilateral action, I today stand solidly behind our men and women in uniform. As the debate over whether or not to go to war with Iraq has been in the forefront in the minds of many Americans, there is one segment of our society that has been relatively overshadowed. Military families. For the past seven months, as we debated our policy in Iraq, I have heard from mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends, who have been concerned about a loved one being sent overseas to fight this war. They asked me, ``Congressman, when we go to war, will you and the others support our troops when they are over there?'' I pledged to do exactly that, and I honor that promise today as their loved one enters the dangerous phase of the war. More than anything, these young Americans need to know they have the backing of their fellow countrymen as they carry out their missions. As a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, I have heard from many that recall their service who have recalled there was no greater asset to company morale than the knowledge that their citizens in the United States stood behind them. New Mexico has many young people that are currently involved in the Iraqi effort. Our three Air Force Bases--Cannon, Holloman, and Kirtland--have deployed over 1,000 personnel to the Middle East. These are not faceless, nameless machines. These are people that have left loved ones behind. New Mexicans are proud of these men and women, along with other Americans from all fifty states that are participating in the endeavor. Our prayers are with them, and we look forward to their speedy success and return home. I have tremendous confidence in the men and women of our armed services to bring this conflict to a successful conclusion. Yet, this support for the effort is accompanied by a deep sense of anxiety and concern. Mr. Speaker, nobody wants war. The death, destruction and misery of war are things that we should never ignore and we cannot forget. When our troops are called to defend our nation and international peace, we do so with a heavy heart but strong confidence that we will prevail. While I remain unequivocal in my support of these men and women, I am deeply disappointed that the House Republican leadership has chosen to bring forward such a divisive resolution to the floor. Unlike our colleagues in the Senate, who passed a noncontroversial and bipartisan resolution in their chamber earlier this evening, the House Republican leadership has chosen to craft a resolution with some provisions that are troubling. It is clear that even during a war, the Speaker and his team will continue to play political games. It is obvious that Republican leaders are hoping that by including contentious language they can break apart the unity that I believe the House has for our troops. Despite some of my concerns over some of this maneuvering, my support of our New Mexico men and women and the ones they have left behind far outweighs that. My thoughts and prayers are with our armed forces personnel and their families. At this time of national crisis, our troops and their families must know that their nation is behind them, they are forever our heroes, and they have our full support. I also want to reassure our future veterans that I will continue to work throughout my tenure in Congress to maintain and expand the benefits that they and their families have earned. The beneflts these men and women earn are but a small gesture of repayment for sacrifices and courage that can never be quantified. Mr. Speaker, I hope this conflict is over as quickly as possible, with the least number of casualties on both sides. I yearn for nothing more than a peaceful and prosperous future for America, Iraq, and the entire world. ____________________ A CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER REMEMBERED ______ HON. SUE WILKINS MYRICK of north carolina in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mrs. MYRICK. Mr. Speaker, Audrey Yvette Wall Augustus was born on November 3, 1956, at Saint Agnes Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina.

McGOVERN of massachusetts in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Barbara Kelly who was recently awarded the Humanitarian Award from the Millbury Democratic Committee. Mrs. Kelly was chosen for her active work for the Democratic Party and her continuous dedication to its principles. Mrs. Kelly is a close friend of mine, and she has helped out on my campaigns for Congress. She is also a dedicated supporter of the party and a salient activist for the core principles the party represents. She had demonstrated her willingness and commitment by volunteering much of her time to tedious campaign work. In addition to her work for the Democratic Party, Mrs. Kelly has been a leading advocate for social causes. She is active in the fight for access to health care. She is a leading voice on behalf of our senior citizens. Specifically, Mrs. Kelly has looked for ways to lessen the tax burden that plagues our seniors. She has fought for single payer health insurance. Mrs. Kelly has worked hard to lower the cost of prescription drugs. In addition to her work in the Democratic Party, Mrs. Kelly is active in many local organizations. She served as president of MSAC, the Massachusetts Senior Action Council and received its ``Unsung Hero Award.'' Mrs. Kelly is currently a member of the Women's Club; she has worked with Alzheimer's patients; she is a senior companion; and she is active in St. Brigid's and St. John's parishes. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to call Mrs. Kelly a friend. I am confident that the entire U.S. House of Representatives joins me in congratulating her for a lifetime of service. ____________________ PERSONAL EXPLANATION ______ HON. THOMAS H. ALLEN of maine in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, on February 13, 2003, I was unavoidably absent for two rollcall votes, due to the death of a family member. Had I been present I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall votes 31 (Obey motion to recommit on H.J. Res. 2), and 32 (Final Passage of the Conference Report to Accompany H.J. Res. 2, the Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations Bill). ____________________ DISMAY OVER THE END OF U.N. NEGOTIATIONS IN CYPRUS ______ HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN of rhode island in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Hellenic Caucus, I rise to register my dismay that negotiations between the President of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on a United Nations settlement plan to reunite Cyprus ended two weeks ago without a final outcome. Mr. Denktash has put most of the blame on his own shoulders for this lost opportunity. By not allowing the Turkish Cypriots to vote on the U.S. settlement plan by a referendum, Mr. Denktash has made the decision for the Turkish Cypriots that they will not live under the European Union's laws or reap its economic benefits. Mr. Denktash should not just look at this as a personal matter, or even as a dispute between Turkey and Greece, but should rather take into consideration what is the right choice for the people of Cyprus. As many other members have expressed, I do not want the recent reunification talks, the fourth attempt since the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus in 1974, to end in an impasse. The U.S. settlement cleared a path for all of Cyprus to unite once again, to share in the European Union's prosperity, and to end military zones. Now with just the Republic of Cyprus poised and ready for membership into the EU in 2004, a deeper divide between the two sides may grow without a push for future negotiations. The United States must continue its role in supporting negotiations so that there is still potential for all of Cyprus to join the EU. Consequently, I recently sent a letter to President Bush asking that we continue to encourage reunification negotiations in Cyprus. Although frustration levels at this point are high, the United States should still play a positive and supportive role that will lead to a final Cyprus settlement. I urge Congress to continue to support Cyprus' membership to the European Union and the United Nation's settlement plan. ____________________ PERSONAL EXPLANATION ______ HON. MARK UDALL of colorado in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, last week Colorado experienced a very heavy snowstorm--in fact, it was a blizzard in many areas. This was good news for our state, which has been suffering from a serious drought. However, it seriously interfered with travel. As a result, I was unable to be present for votes on several measures. Had I been present, I would have voted as follows: On rollcall No. 65, H. Con. Res. 26--Condemning the punishment of execution by stoning as a gross violation of human rights--I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 66, H.R. 868--Nicaragua Property Dispute Settlement Act of 2003--I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 67, H. Res. 109--Urging passage of a resolution addressing human rights in North Korea at the 59th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and calling on the Government of North Korea to respect and protect the human rights of its citizens--I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 68, H.R. 314--Mortgage Servicing Clarification Act (Royce Financial Services)--I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 69, H.R. 417--Cibola Wildlife Refuge Boundary Correction--I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 70, H.R. 699--To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a comprehensive study of the Rathdrum Prairie/Spokane Valley Aquifer, located in Idaho and Washington--I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 71, the Sherman amendment to H.R. 975 (bankruptcy bill), I would have voted ``no.'' On rollcall No. 72, the Nadler amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 975 (bankruptcy bill), I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 73, the Jackson-Lee motion to recommit H.R. 975 (bankruptcy bill), I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 74, passage of H.R. 975 (bankruptcy bill), I would have voted ``no.'' On rollcall No. 75, on approving the Journal, I would have voted ``no.'' On rollcall No. 76, H.R. 1307--To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a special rule for members of the uniformed services in determining the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence and to restore the tax exempt status of death gratuity payments to members of the uniformed services, and for other purposes-- I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 77, H. Res. 132--Expressing the sense of the House that the 9th Circuit [[Page 7449]] Court of Appeals ruling in Newdow v. United States Congress is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the first amendment and should be overturned, and for other purposes--I would have voted ``present.'' I would have voted that way because I am not a lawyer and have not studied the relevant decisions of the Supreme court--and so I do not think it would be appropriate for me to say that the cited decision of the Court of Appeals is inconsistent with those decisions. Last year, I voted in favor of a related (but not identical) resolution. However, as I said at that time, I did so not because I necessarily agreed that the Circuit Court's decision is ``inconsistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence'' as that resolution said, but because I agreed that ``the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should agree to rehear'' the matter, as that resolution also stated. I am proud to recite the Pledge of Allegiance because I personally consider it as being neither a prayer nor a religious practice and so think its recitation is not a religious exercise but instead a verbal expression of support for our country. However, obviously not everyone shares my view. And, as I said last year, I am not prepared to conclude that the author of the Ninth Circuit decision--a long-serving judge originally appointed by President Nixon--was clearly wrong as a matter of law, even though as I understand it another appeals court, in a similar case, has ruled differently. So, I definitely think the issue needs to be resolved by the Supreme Court. On rollcall No. 78, the Hill (Blue Dog) substitute to the budget resolution, I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 79, the Toomey (Republican Study Committee) substitute to the budget resolution, I would have voted ``no.'' On rollcall No. 80, the Cummings (Black Caucus/Progressive Caucus substitute to the budget resolution, I would have voted ``no.'' On rollcall No. 81, the Spratt (Democratic) substitute to the budget resolution, I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 82, on passage on H. Con. Res. 95 (the budget resolution), I would have voted ``no.'' On rollcall No. 83, passage of H. Con. Res. 104--expressing the support and appreciation of the Nation for the President and the members of the Armed forces who are participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom--I would have voted ``yes.'' I would have done so because although I have disagreed with the way the President has handled the diplomatic events leading up to war, it is now time for us all to support our brave men and women in uniform who are charged with carrying out this mission and to pray for their success and safe return home. We all hope for a swift resolution with minimal casualties--among our troops and Iraqis as well. And we must do more to protect ourselves at home. I am confident that the United States and our allies will win the war. That will not be the end, but the beginning of the more difficult task of securing the peace. Congress must commit to providing aid to rebuild Iraq and the Administration must work to repair relationships with our allies. We will need them and the rest of the international community in our corner to rebuild Iraq, bring stability to the Middle East, and win the war on terrorism. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO GARLAND THOMPSON ______ HON. JACK KINGSTON of georgia in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great Georgian and an outstanding American citizen. I am proud to recognize Mr. Garland Thompson in the United States Congress for his invaluable contributions to his community, his state and his nation. Mr. Garland Thompson was born on June 5, 1928 in Soperton, GA. His dad operated as a one-horse share cropper until he could save enough money to buy a small farm. Garland grew up on the farm planting row crops. Garland showed signs of the talent, determination and achievement that have been the hallmarks of his career at an early age, when he graduated from Soperton High School. He then attended Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, and then University of Georgia where he earned his Bachelors degree. He then attended the University of Georgia School of Banking as well as the L.S.U School of Banking. He met his wife, Anita, in Macon and they married in June, 1943. They have four children; Kirby, Andy, Beth and Tim and five grandchildren; Betsy, Macie, Kip, Katie and Trent. Mr. Garland Thompson was employed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for 12 years in Wilkinson County, before serving 37 years in banking between C&S Bank in Dublin, GA, and Sun Trust Bank in Douglas, GA. Mr. Thompson has served on the Douglas-Coffee County Industrial Authority board for the past 21 years. He has also served as Interim President and Director for the Douglas-Coffee County Chamber of Commerce. Thirty years ago Coffee County was 90% dependent on their agriculture base. Today, they have a widely diversified economy that boasts about $200 million in the industrial base and $200 million in the agriculture base. As Garland says, ``it's about 50/50 now and we are extremely blessed''. Garland has retired but still serves on the Georgia State Soil & Water Commission, SubBelt Exposition, ABAC Alumni Board of Directors, and has served on the Vo-Ag Advisory Committee, Georgia Extension Advisory Commission, and the G.T.E. Advisory Board. He is also a consultant on the U.S. 441 Economic Development Council. It is my distinguished pleasure today to honor Mr. Garland Thompson for his service and dedication to Coffee County and its citizens. He remains an inspiration to us all. ____________________ A TRIBUTE TO MOLLIE WEST ______ HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY of illinois in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, today, in celebration of Women's History Month, I rise to honor a woman from my district in Chicago, Mollie Lieber West, for her outstanding work and dedication to organizing women within the labor movement. Her leadership has opened the door to thousands of women to join unions and stand up for their rights in the workplace. Barely off the boat from Poland, Mollie West became an organizer and a person who stood her ground. She was arrested for passing out leaflets in protest of her high schools' decision to discharge all the music, art, and gym teachers because of budget constraints. Soon after, Mollie was demonstrating in support of the Republic Steel strikers in South Chicago. She found herself in them midst of the Memorial Day Massacre of 1937 where ten workers were killed by police bullets and were she, too, felt the pressure of a pistol at her back as she was ordered off the field. Later, after working for various unions, she became a professional proofreader, and joined the Chicago Typographical Union. An active member and a delegate to the Chicago Federation of Labor, Mollie became the voice for women laborers. She successfully lobbied for the establishment of an annual tribute to the Trade Union Women of Chicago, which continues to flourish today. Another of Mollie's great achievements was helping to found the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW) in 1974. Today CLUW has a network of more than 75 chapters and a membership of 20,000 women and men. The goals of CLUW include promoting affirmative action in the workplace, strengthening the role of women in unions, organizing women workers, and increasing the involvement of women in the political and legislative process. For the last twenty years, Mollie has served as an officer and a volunteer of the Illinois Labor History Society. From that platform, Mollie has been able to pass on her memories of the struggle to audiences across the country. In addition, she has continued to stay involved in electoral politics at all levels. To this day, you can always count on Mollie's voice to be among those fighting for the rights of all women workers. Today, I ask you to join me in honoring Mollie for all she has contributed to working women everywhere! ____________________ IN HONOR OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH ______ HON. RON KIND of wisconsin in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women's History Month. In 1987, Congress passed a resolution designating the month of March as Women's History Month and a time to honor, ``American women of every race, [[Page 7450]] class and ethnic background [who] have made historic contributions to the growth and strength of our Nation in countless recorded and unrecorded ways.'' For 2003, the theme of Women's History Month is ``Women Pioneering the Future.'' In celebration of this month, I would like to focus on four women from Wisconsin's history and honor their contributions to society. First, I would like to recognize Cordelia A.P. Harvey. An army nurse during the Civil War, Ms. Harvey worked vigorously in support of soldiers and their families. She not only collected money to support soldiers and their families but also campaigned for cleaner and more efficient hospitals for the soldiers. Her determination and sense of good will is something all Americans can strive for today. Born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Helen Mears was a talented artist who won her first prize for sculpture at the age of nine. She studied formally in New York and Europe and was commissioned to sculpt a woman and winged eagle design, the ``Genius of Wisconsin,'' for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Her sculpture of temperance reformer Frances Willard was the first of a woman to be placed in the U.S. Capitol's Statuary Hall. Ms. Mears enjoyed a successful career and is remembered for her limitless energy and artistic ability. Kathryn Clarenbach is a woman who has made invaluable contributions to our educational system. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin- Madison, Ms. Clarenbach created the continuing education program for women at the university and was appointed chair of the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women upon its creation in 1964. She chaired the commission for 14 years and continues to serve as an inspiration to all women. Finally, I would like to talk about Edna Ferber. A talented writer, Ms. Ferber spent her early years in Appleton, Wisconsin and eventually wrote for the Milwaukee Journal. After four years at the paper, she returned to Appleton where she proceeded to write short stories. Credited with introducing the character of the American businesswoman to modern fiction, she composed not only books but plans as well, many of which have been turned into Broadway productions and movies. Each of these women has had an impact not only on Wisconsin's history but also on the history of the nation as a whole. Whether in art or literature, activism or teaching, each of these women truly was a pioneer in her field and deserves our remembrance. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO AURELIO PALOMARES ______ HON. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, on March 31, 2003, Aurelio Palomares, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy, will be retiring after 32 years of distinguished county service. Deputy Palomares was born in Leon, Mexico in 1948, and, three years later, immigrated to the United States with his parents. After becoming a United States citizen, Deputy Palomares enlisted in the U.S. Army and served as a medic from 1969 to 1971, until he was honorably discharged. After his tour of duty, Deputy Palomares began his career with Los Angeles County as a security officer in 1971. Aspiring to be a deputy, he joined the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in 1980. Since then, Deputy Palomares has received 23 commendations throughout his career with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and has served as a bilingual bridge between law enforcement and the Spanish speaking community in Los Angeles County. On April 8, 1985, he was commended after handling a bank robbery in which the suspect used a handgun and stole over $4,000. Using his uncanny ability to remember names and faces of suspects, Deputy Palomares reviewed the surveillance video and recognized the suspect as an inmate he had seen in the Los Angeles County Jail a few years before. Deputy Palomares provided the suspect's name to investigators, who subsequently arrested the suspect. In 1986, Deputy Palomares was commended by the Mayor of Artesia, Robert Jamison, for his ``consistent willingness to do more than what is required of him.'' Mayor Jamison also praised him as a ``symbol of dedication to the department''. On June 2, 1989, Deputy Palomares was commended for his assistance in the apprehension of a Paramount gang member who had gotten into a shootout with deputies. In 1994, Deputy Palomares was again commended, this time by the father of a drive-by shooting victim who wrote that Palomares' professional treatment of his son ``calmed him and left a lasting and positive impression''. On March 19, 1996, he was commended by the Department of Corrections for ``demonstrating exemplary service and dedication'' in apprehending convicted felon parolees and for keeping ``public safety in the forefront of his dealing with parolees and the community''. In 2000, Deputy Palomares was commended twice, once by a citizen for the caring and compassionate way he handled a rescue call in which a child was injured. The second commendation arose from his ``prompt response and professionalism'' that led to the arrest of a burglary suspect who had fired a handgun at the victim. Throughout his career, Deputy Palomares has continuously demonstrated his dedication to his profession, community, and family. Deputy Palomares, who is affectionately called ``AP'' by his colleagues, has succeeded in having a close-knit family with his wife, Susan, their daughter, Sara, and son, Michael. As a family, the Palomares family regularly takes to the open road in an RV and visits all parts of the United States and Canada. On the road, he is sure to be tuned into National Public Radio, a station he listens to religiously while on duty. From one public servant to another, I praise Aurelio Palomares for his valor in the face of danger and for his service to the community. ____________________ COLON CANCER SCREEN FOR LIFE ACT OF 2003 ______ HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN of maryland in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Colon Cancer Screen for Life Act of 2003. Colorectal cancer is the number two cancer killer in the United States. This year, an estimated 147,000 new cases will be diagnosed and more than 57,000 Americans will die from the disease. My home state of Maryland ranks 7th in the nation in the number of new cases and in the number of deaths. Our capital city, Washington, DC, ranks first in the nation. Colorectal cancer disproportionately impacts the elderly. The risk begins to increase after the age or 40 and rises sharply between the ages of 50 to 55, when it doubles with each succeeding decade. Despite advances in surgical techniques and adjudvant therapy, there has been only a modest improvement in survival for patients with advanced cancers. The good news is that colorectal cancer is preventable, and it is highly treatable when discovered early. Most cases of the disease begin an non-cancerous polyps which can be detected and removed during routine screenings--preventing the development of colorectal cancer. Screening tests also save lives even when they detect polyps that have become cancerous by catching the disease in its earliest, most curable stages. The cure rate is up to 93 percent when colorectal cancer is discovered early. Recognizing the importance of early detection, Congress in 1997 enacted a Medicare colorectal cancer screening benefit. Medicare currently covers either a screening colonoscopy every ten years or a flexible sigmoidoscopy every four years for average-risk individuals. Beneficiaries identified as high risk are entitled to a colonoscopy every two years. Despite the availability of this benefit, very few seniors are actually being screened for colorectal cancer. Since its implementation in 1998, the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries receiving either a screening or diagnostic colonoscopy has increased by only one percent. Why aren't more seniors being screened? I believe the problem is due, in part, to rapidly declining coloercal screening reimbursement levels. By 2002, Medicare reimbursement for diagnostic colonoscopies performed in an outpatient setting had declined 36 percent from initial 1998 level. For flexible sigmoidoscopies, payment in 2002 was 54 percent less. While reimbursement has dropped across the board, cuts have been particularly harsh for screenings provided in hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). In 1997, a colonoscopy performed in one of these settings was reimbursed at approximately $301. Now in 2002, the rate has fallen to about $213. The facility-specific cuts provide incentives for physicians to perform screenings in their offices, where reimbursement rates have remained between 68 percent and 108 percent [[Page 7451]] higher. As you know, Medicare has established its own criteria for both ASCs and HOPDs to ensure high quality of care and patient safety. While there are office facilities where endoscopy is safely performed, physicians' offices are, for the most part, unregulated environments. This site-of-service differential may interfere with the clinical decision-making process, at the expense of patient safety. In addition, Medicare currently pays for a consultation prior to a diagnostic colonoscopy, but not for a screening colonoscopy. Since colonoscopy involves conscious sedation, physicians generally do not perform them without a pre-procedure office visit to ascertain a patient's medical history and to educate patients as to the required preparatory steps. In fact, several states now require physicians to consult with patients prior to procedures involving conscious sedation. Because Medicare will not pay for pre-screening consultations, many physicians must provide them for free. And, unlike screening mammography, colorectal cancer screening tests are subject to the Medicare Part B deductible, which discourages beneficiaries from seeking screening. My colleague, Representative Phil English, joins me today to introduce this important legislation, as well as my colleagues in the Senate, Joseph Lieberman and Susan Collins. This bill is supported by the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and the American Gastroenterological Association. It would improve beneficiary utilization and help ensure the safety of colorectal cancer screenings by doing three things. First, it would increase reimbursement for colorectal cancer related procedures to ensure that physicians are able to cover the costs of providing these valuable services. Second, our bill will provide Medicare coverage for a pre-screening office visit. If Medicare will pay for a consultation prior to a diagnostic colonoscopy, it also should pay for a consultation before a screening colonoscopy. Third, the bill would exempt colorectal cancer screening procedures from the customary Medicare deductible requirement. By reducing the financial requirements on the beneficiary, this law will encourage increased access to colorectal screening services. The preventive benefits we authorized in 1997 were an important step toward fighting this deadly disease. But the colorectal cancer screening program is in danger of failing without our intervention. I strongly urge all my colleagues to support this critical legislation. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO RON KEENEY ______ HON. HAROLD ROGERS of kentucky in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated civil servant and all around great American, Mr. Ron Keeney. After 37 years with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Huntington, WV, he is retiring and embarking on a new stage of life. I want to express my deepest gratitude for his many contributions. Ron Keeney has led a distinguished career and played a critical role in improving the lives and living conditions of thousands of people in my home district in Southern and Eastern Kentucky. Ron has been instrumental in getting a number of important flood control projects off the ground in my region and he shares my belief that we must carefully balance economic development with the needs of our rich natural environment. Through his efforts, the Huntington District has become an integral component of our region's PRIDE program, which is helping clean up our waterways and streams. I want to thank Ron for sharing my vision of how federal-local partnerships can bridge gaps, streamline the process, and make real contributions to people's daily lives. Ron is also widely respected within the Army Corp of Engineers. Beyond measure, Ron has improved the Huntington District's programmatic, oversight, planning, and fiscal performance. He has also proven invaluable as the District's key civilian decision-maker witih regard to strategic management of its major civil-works, environmental, and other programs and projects, including work for other Federal agencies. The list of awards bestowed upon Ron speaks volumes about his job performance, knowledge, and skills. During his career, he has received more than 30 outstanding/exceptional performance ratings. He also received the May 1999, Silver de Fleury Medal, the 1994 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Planner of the Year, and the 1994 and 1985 LRD Planner of the Year Award. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, I want to thank Ron Keeney for the time and effort he has put into the lives of others. Although his time with the Corps of Engineers is drawing to a close, I know the people of the Huntington District will continue to benefit from his contributions for many years to come. I want to wish him and his family all the best for this next stage of life. ____________________ CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004 ______ speech of HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO of connecticut in the house of representatives Thursday, March 20, 2003 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union had under consideration the bill concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 95) establishing the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2004 and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2003 and 2005 through 2013: Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this rule. Budgets are about priorities. They are about values. But this budget does not reflect our priorities or our values. Instead, it shows an irresponsible disregard for working families and priorities the American people have made clear. One example of that disregard in the Republican budget is its potential impact on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. While this budget does not explicitly instruct the Resources Committee to open ANWR for oil exploration, it is clear that the Republican majority intends to use its reconciliation instructions to the Resources Committee to move forward with the Administration's drilling proposal. ANWR is one of the finest examples of wilderness left on the planet, with a full range of largely undisturbed ecosystems. The tens of thousands of caribou, polar and grizzly bears, birds, wolves, and fox that call this place home should not be sacrificed for a mere 180-day supply of oil, which is all the United States Geological Survey says we will likely recover. Even oil companies like British Petroleum, who have given up on the prospect of drilling in the Refuge, understand the relatively small amounts of oil ANWR is expected to yield and the high cost of removing it. This budget should invest in renewable energy sources, not drilling for oil in the pristine wilderness. Yet my amendment to protect the Refuge in the Budget Committee was defeated on a party-line vote. Mr. Chariman, this budget does not reflect the priorities or values of the American people. I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO REPRESENTATIVE SONNY CALLAHAN ______ HON. NICK J. RAHALL II of west virginia in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 25, 2003 Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the achievements and life of our former colleague, Herbert Leon Callahan, universally known as Sonny. I appreciate the invitation by our colleague, Jo Bonner, Sonny's worthy successor, to express my thoughts about Sonny. Born and raised in Mobile, Alabama, Sonny graduated from McGill Institute High School in Mobile, and went to serve his country honorably in the United States Navy from 1952 to 1954. Later, he attended the University of Alabama, Mobile. Following a successful career in business, and terms in the Alabama state House of Representatives and state Senate, Sonny was elected to the 99th Congress. He went on to serve his district and his state with distinction for the next 16 years. During this time, he developed into a key authority on foreign aid matters in the House, and he rose to become one of the ``Cardinals,'' the Appropriations subcommittee chairmen. His involvement with foreign aid allowed him to do great good deeds to help those in need, and it allowed him to develop friendships with a unique cast of characters. I laughed at Sonny's quip about his efforts with the rock star, Bono, which he described as the ``Sonny and Bono show.'' Also, first as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, then as Chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, Sonny always honored every appropriations request with fairness and a much-appreciated willingness to work with members. Sonny helped me personally in my efforts to [[Page 7452]] improve the conditions of my district in rural West Virginia, and I want to publicly and personally thank him for his efforts. Mr. Speaker, I believe that we are greatly privileged to serve our constituencies and our Nation during our time in office. The ``People's House'' in which we serve is a monument to the American people, and it is a symbol of our country's sustained democracy. Let it be known that during his time in office Sonny Callahan served the People's House with distinction. I wish Sonny well in his retirement. As I have said elsewhere, our loss is a clear gain for his family and friends. "}
