Life consisted of work, a social life, relationships--and yet, I wasn't happy. Aimless and burdened by pain from the past, I did my best to repress difficult emotions and self-medicate in socially acceptable ways. I had no idea what I was doing or what I wanted to accomplish in life beyond vague ideas about family and a corporate career. Then, my cousin almost died in a car accident. While we weren't extremely close, it had a tremendous impact on my life, changing its course forever. I had a spiritual breakthrough and realized that my life was for more than having fun and staring at a computer screen. I wanted--no I needed--to do something more, something that helped the world. My new life vision, coupled with a strong interest in spirituality and holistic healing, marked the beginning of my new life dedicated to helping others using Oriental medicine and Sufi spiritual healing and energy work. It all began when I received a shiatsu massage session. Then I tried acupuncture. There was no going back after that... EDUCATION My education began with training in Five Element Shiatsu Massage and rapidly advanced into Oriental Medicine and acupuncture. Following this, I discovered the incredibly beauty and power of Sufi spiritual healing and energy work, and I studied Chinese herbal medicine with a renowned master herbalist, Thea Elijah. Five Element Shiatsu - 500-hour certification, Meridian Shiatsu Institute, 1997. Five Element Acupuncture - Master's degree, aryland University of Integrative Health, 2000. Sufi Spiritual Healing and Energy Work - 500-hour certification, University of Spiritual Healing and Sufism, 2003. Spiritual Teacher's Training - 250-hour certification, University of Spiritual Healing and Sufism, 2004. Chinese Herbal Medicine - 500-hour certification, Academy for Five Element Acupuncture, 2005. SELF-HEALING I have been able to heal my own chronic health conditions, conditions that baffled Western medical professionals in different fields. Because of these experiences, I KNOW that you can heal, using ways and means that you perhaps have never imagined. In 2003 I had mysterious joint pain and swelling in my knees and ankles, to the point where it was difficult to walk and I was in constant pain. Western medicine couldn't discern the cause of my condition, so I went to my spiritual teacher for help. He healed me using Sufi spiritual healing and energy work, and the condition did not recur for 7 years. Upon its reappearance, Western medicine decided it was rheumatoid arthritis. I was able to overcome it and regain normal use of my ankles and knees using acupuncture, Chinese herbs, supplements, and Sufi spiritual healing within 4 months of onset. I did not take a single prescription medication, nor did I receive any other form of western medical intervention. Between 2009-2011, I was pregnant twice and suffered two miscarriages. Both times the miscarriages occurred after hearing the heartbeat, and both were tested and no known cause was found. With the help of the same techniques I've used to help other women become and stay pregnant, along with Sufi spiritual healing and energy work, I had a baby in 2012. He's almost 5 and the joy of my life. Healing is possible. But without your health, you can't enjoy life to the fullest. Investing in your health is the most effective way to improve your life and manifest your unique destiny. PROFESSIONALLY I've had my own private practice since 1998, and have helped thousands of people in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Florida transform their health from a variety of chronic and acute conditions. My specialties in health and wellness include all aspects of pain, chronic illness, internal medicine, depression, anxiety, digestive disorders, and autoimmune disease. I have experience teaching at the GCU School of Oriental Medicine and have taught acupressure courses to couples and individuals over the years at local colleges. One of my passions is collating health and wellness information into a user-friendly way that's easy to access quickly. I've compiled two acupuncture user's guides, totaling more than 1,100 pages, and a Sufi healing techniques guide. Additionally, Since 1998, volunteer work has always been a priority for me and I continually align with organizations and benefit programs to be of humanitarian service. "}
