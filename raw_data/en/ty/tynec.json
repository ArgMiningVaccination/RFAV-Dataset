Using Reiki an old Japanese Healing system that taps into your energy field, clearing and balancing it. Removing what no longer serves you. Including toxic relationships, emotions, stress, anxiety and fear. It is also used as complementary therapy to support your medical treatments and pre-post procedures. Reiki is being used in hospitals and with nurses all around the world. When you are energetically balanced you are operating from a higher vibrational field. A field of infinite potential.
