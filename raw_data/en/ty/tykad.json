Crystal healing is a belief that semi-precious stones hold a unique power to help heal the body and mind or power our intentions. This \"power\" has been used by shamans and gurus, or those who practice earth-based religions such as Wiccans and Druids. Although there is no definitive or scientific proof to back these claims, those who practice the art of crystal healing believe that the power lies in the beholder. With that in mind, I have designed a unique line of pieces where I transform nature's most basic elements into stunning accessories meant to celebrate life and the world around us. Crystal Healing Basics According to practitioners, semi-precious stones and crystals such as amethyst or quartz contain vibrations and energy that connect us to the Earth. These vibrations help us channel and manifest particular intentions in our lives. They also help us connect with the Earth. For example, quartz alone makes up 12% of the Earth's outer crust. The work of [Marcel Vogal](http://www.vogelcrystals.net/legacy_of_marcel_vogel.htm) theorized that crystals have the power to transfer thoughts and energy from the human body. How do Crystals Work? By holding a crystal or keeping it on your person, the stones can interact with your [Chakras](https://layoga.com/life-style/style-apparel/jewelry-7-chakras/). Chakra is a Sanskrit term, and it means \"wheel\" or \"disk.\" It is the term used to describe the wheels of energy that flow within all living things. The human body has seven different [Chakra energies](https://layoga.com/practice/yoga/crown-chakra-aromatherapy-practices-strengthen-mental-clarity/), and crystals can amplify these and help focus your intentions.

Once I Choose a Crystal, What Do I Do with It? Before you start wearing your healing crystals, you'll need to first cleanse and \"program\" it. To cleanse your crystals, you can use a variety of methods, but burning sage or placing it the sun or full moon for a few hours should do the trick. This method will take away any previous programming or negative energy that the stone might be holding onto. Once they have been cleansed, hold your crystal or crystal jewelry in your hands, and take a few deep breaths. Focus on the intentions you want, such as positive thinking, fortune, or even love. Focus on your faith, whatever that may be, and chant either out loud or in your head, \"I desire this crystal to hold the intention of . . .\" and finish the sentence with your personal needs. Do this at least three to five times.
