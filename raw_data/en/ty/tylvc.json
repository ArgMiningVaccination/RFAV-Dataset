Mantras are often chanted in Sanskrit. They are said to have spiritual and psychological powers that work on the level of consciousness and can be vital in the overall healing process. In Ayurveda, Mantra is often used to balance the doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. When using mantras with foundational Ayurvedic wisdom to balance the doshas the chants can act as a paradigm shift for healing, overall wellness and overcoming subconscious blocks in the nadis and chakras (subtle body). As an Ayurvedic Practitioner, I often use mantras with my clients to support transformation from the inside out on a subconscious level. They are also a significant part of my personal Spiritual practice. Mantras can be chanted aloud or silently and are often chanted 108 times with a mala. This is known as a form of meditation known as Japa (which you can learn more about in next week's blog). The Benefits of Chanting 1. Can be soothing to the body and mind working on a consciousness and cellular level 2. Releases negative thought loop patterns 3. Can reduce anxiety, depression and lift emotional mood 4. Engenders compassion and connects to love energy (bhakti) 5. Supports overall wellness, immunity and balances doshas 6. Invites intuition and Divine guidance 7. It is easy and free 8. It increases radiance and magnetism 9. It is empowering and clears the throat chakra 10. Can be a preparatory portal for meditation and improve focus Mantra Therapy for Balancing the Vata Dosha The Vata Dosha is made of air and ether, therefore, to bring balance to Vata we must add chants and mantras that vibrate with more earth and water energy. Warming energy is also balancing. Some symptoms that appear when Vata dosha is out of balance are anxiety, overwhelm, worry, feeling ungrounded, inability to focus and finish projects, rapid and rambling speech, feeling cold, nervous system disorders, excessive dryness, constipation, gas, alternating constipation, and diarrhea. Essentially, anytime there is inconsistency and change resulting in movement in the mind and body Vata will be disturbed. A great example of this is when you travel and the unease you may feel on a physical and emotional level. This is a result of so much air, cold, and dryness. Sounds that are grounding, warm, soothing, calming, gentle, slower, sweet, and rhythmic are best. Below are some chants that really support the Vata Dosha. Basic Seed and Shakta Chants obstacles. Why chant it: Ganesha is the god of wisdom, success, and the remover of obstacles. It is always a good idea to begin any new endeavor by invoking his energetic imprint. Adi Mantra (Ong bow to the creative energy of the infinite. I bow to the Divine channel of wisdom. Why chant it: This Gurmukhi mantra opens the communication channel between the student and the Divine Teacher. We like to think that it also opens us to new endeavors and gives the strength to try something new. These mantras can be repeated throughout the day and before meditation. Using a Japa Mala and repeating 108 times or any denomination thereof. Mantra Therapy for Balancing the Pitta Dosha The Pitta dosha is made mainly of fire and little water; therefore, to bring balance to Pitta we must add chants and mantras that vibrate with the more cooling energy of the earth, water and the sweetness of love or the air element. Some symptoms that appear when Pitta dosha is out of balance are anger, criticism, blaming, feeling hot, intense and excessive focus leading to burnout, sharp speech, rashes, diarrhea, heartburn or acid reflux, inflammation of any type. Essentially, anytime there is too much heat and intensity in the mind and body Pitta will be aggravated. Sounds that are cooling, soothing to the mind, calming, gentle, slower, sweet, and rhythmic are best. Below are some chants that really support the Pitta Dosha. Also, silent chanting is a good option for Pitta. Basic Seed and Shakta Chants for Pitta: Vam (Vum), Lam (Lum), (shreem), Namaha Vum, Lum Aum May there be well-being for all, May there be peace for all. May there be wholeness for all, May there be happiness for all. And the shorter version: Why chant it: Increase peace and wellbeing. \"When sound, breath, and awareness cometogether, it becomes light...So Hum meditation properly practiced leads tothe union of the individual with theuniversal Cosmic Consciousness. You willgo beyond thought, beyond time andspace, beyond cause and effect.Limitations will vanish.\" Dr. Vasant Lad So Hum (Silent Breath Meditation) as taught by Dr. Lad So Hum Meditation has existed in India throughout the ages. It synchronizes the movement of the breath with the mantra that fits naturally into the inhalation (So) and exhalation (Hum). So is felt and said mentally during the whole phase of inhalation and Hum during the exhalation. The literal translation of So Hum is \"I am that,\" while the deeper meaning is \"I am that pure awareness.\" This mantra calms the mind, yet simultaneously focuses and sharpens it. How to Practice: Begin by taking several slow, deep breaths, establishing yourself in the practice of Full Yogic Breath. When you are ready to practice So Hum, shift your awareness as follows. As you breathe in, feel that you are beginning the inhalation at the base of the spine. With the inhale, draw your awareness up the front of the body, along the midline, to the center of the brain. Mentally chant \"So\" during this inhalation. When you reach the top of the inhale, hold the breath in a short retention. As you breathe out, mentally chant \"Hum.\" Visualize the breath leaving the center of the brain, moving down the throat and returning to the base of the spine along the midline of the back of the body. When you reach the bottom of the exhale, pause before beginning. Mantra Therapy for Balancing the Kapha Dosha The Kapha dosha is made of earth and water, therefore, to bring balance to Kapha we must add chants and mantras that vibrate with more air and ether energy. Some symptoms that appear when Kapha dosha is out of balance are stubbornness, depression, melancholy, congestion, dullness, unchangeability, sluggish digestion, nausea, sleepy after eating, water retention, weight gain, and overly attached to possessions and people. Essentially, with a lack of movement, dullness and too much sweetness and moisture Kapha will be vitiated. An example of this is in the Spring time and allergies. Sounds that are uplifting, warming, inspiring, invigorating, sl, sweet, and rhythmic are best. Below are some chants that really support the Kapha dosha. Basic Seed and Shakta Chants for Kapha: Ram (Rum), Yam (Yum), Ham (Hum), Aum (Om), Hrim (Hreem), Shrim (Shreem) Aum Aim Hreem Shreem Chants: Sat Nam Pronunciation: Saaaaaaaat* | Nam || *Sat is extended eight times longer than Nam. If you really want the mantra to radiate from the base of your spine to the center of your head, make the Sat 35 times longer than the Nam. Translation: Truth is my name. Why chant it: Used in the Kundalini Yoga practice, Sat Nam can be a way to develop and tune your intuition. The Gurmukhi mantra is also part of the Sat Kriya meditation that is said to reinvigorate sexual energy if practiced daily for at least 3 minutes. These mantras can be repeated out loud throughout the day and prior to meditation. It is good to combine breathwork and chanting for Kapha. \"By intensive awareness of one's identity with the Highest Reality enshrined in a mantra and thus becoming identical with that Reality, the mind itself becomes mantra.\" Shiva Sutra II Some longer mantras that are used for universal healing and are good for all three doshas include: Gayatri Zo\u00eb Slatoff-Pont\u00e9) Earth, Heaven, the Whole Between. The excellent divine power of the Sun. May we contemplate the radiance of that god, May this inspire our understanding. Why chant it: This is one of the oldest Sanskrit mantras. It speaks to the unity of all creation, despite its many forms. Chanting it invokes the light of the sun and helps us to transcend suffering. Mahamrtyunjaya Mantra Pronunciation: OM. Rolf Sovik of Yoga International in his article on this chant, \"The Maha Mrityunjaya mantra restores health and happiness and brings calmness in the face of death. When courage or determination are blocked, it rises up to overcome obstacles. It awakens a healing force that reaches deep into the body and mind. Just as a plant patiently gathers nutrients from the soil, so healing and nourishing forces enter the human body through foods, medicines, supportive emotions, and encouraging thoughts. The Maha Mrityunjaya mantra attracts these forces and creates an inner environment to enhance their effectiveness. Thus, the mantra can be used whenever any restorative process is undertaken. The mantra can be recited when taking medicines, for it prepares the body and mind to make the best use of them. In India, when ash (bhasma) is applied to the body (as either a medicinal or a spiritual act) the mantra is recited. And so, whenever matters of health, vitality, nurturance, or freedom from the fear associated with death arise, the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra naturally surfaces as a remedy and comfort. It is also said that those in the healing professions will benefit from reciting the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra regularly. Through it, they will draw from an infinite reserve of energy, and thus prevent burnout while opening a channel of healing from which life can be nourished.\" Om Namah Shivaya According to the Vedas this chant bestows deep spiritual experiences and even boons (supernatural gifts) when practiced with devotion and skill. Translation: Om = Before there was a universe, there was a vibrationless void of pure existence. Out of this void came the vibration which started the universe, which is known as AUM. Namah = to bow. Shivaya = Shiva - the inner Divine self. Why chant it: According to Shaivism, when understood fully it means \"I bow to the inner Self\". Repeat Mantra 108 time and visualize yourself bowing to your true inner Self. Regular practice of this mantra will support your understanding and awakening of the Divine within. Siri Gayatri Mantra Pronunciation: Ra Ma Da Sa Sa Say So Hung Translation: Sun, Moon, Earth, Infinity, All that is in infinity, I am Thee. Why chant it: Used as a restorative meditation to send healing energy to ourselves and others. In Kundalini Yoga, the pose for this meditation is as important as the sound. Sit comfortably with elbows bent and tucked in firmly alongside the ribcage, extended forearms out perpendicularly with palms facing up. Sa Ta Na Ma Translation: Describes the eternal cycle of life Saa = Infinity, totality of the Cosmos = emotion and expansiveness Taa = Life (birth of form from Infinity = transformation and strength Naa = death or transformation = universal love Maa = Rebirth = communication Pancha means five and expresses the five primal sounds of the Universe. (SSS. TTT. NNN. MMM. and AAA.) It is the atomic or Naad form of the mantra Sat Nam. Why chant it: According to Kundalini yoga, It is used to increase intuition, balance the hemispheres of the brain and to create a destiny. This mantra is a catalyst for healing transformation. \"There is virtually no tradition, no culture, which does not include chanting of some sort as a spiritual and health practice. The recitation of prayers is found worldwide and has been with us since the dawn of humankind. In the Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Islamic and Hebrew traditions, you have some chanting of prayer or recitation of a Divine name. Whether it's a shamanic or pagan tradition, you will have some aspect of chanting that could be considered mantric chanting in their rituals and prayers. Sometimes these chants are used to invoke Divine entities. Other times they're used for healing or to ask for some benevolent process like bringing rain. With regard to the present day and age, we are seeing more interest, awareness, and use of chanting for health and wellness.\" Jonathan Goldman "}
