Candice Pires speaks with three women about their experience.", "sitename": "Harper's BAZAAR", "date": "2021-04-03", "cleaned_text": "Every woman who gives birth this spring has spent the entirety of her pregnancy in a pandemic. Morphing into a parent is a wild undertaking at any time, but right now, the risks, and rewards, are heightened. There are worries about just entering a hospital, losing income, doing it all without a support network. And there are health concerns too. For some, the excitement of expecting a baby eclipses all the numerous challenges the world is facing. But for others, it's a little more complicated. As life has changed so much since last March, we speak with three women who've experienced the pandemic while also becoming a parent for the first time. Kristal \"Kree\" Boyce, 41, Philadelphia, community logistics manager I didn't think I could get pregnant. And for about 20 years, I didn't try because I was in long-term lesbian relationships where my partners didn't want kids. Then in 2019, I met a guy at work, and, for me\u2014I don't know about him\u2014it was love at first sight. I became fixated on having a baby. I used all the tracking apps and did everything I could. Being 39, I didn't have much time. But it didn't work out for us, and the relationship ended. Then last March, I got COVID. I live alone and was sick for six weeks; it was very isolating. Once I was better and tested negative, I was staying home, but ended up having a kind of one-night stand with my ex. We both didn't think I could get pregnant so we didn't use protection. We were wrong. I did three pregnancy tests, because I couldn't believe it. I had wanted to be a mom so bad that the shock outweighed any worry of being pregnant in a pandemic. I was also concerned with how the baby's father would react. On top of that, I was of advanced maternal age, and for those first few months, I just focused on keeping my baby healthy. I stayed home, prayed, did a lot of yoga, and nested. Talking about the arrival of my baby became \"good news\" for me and my family and friends at a time when good news was scarce. As the pregnancy progressed, I read and learned a lot. Being a pregnant Black woman right now is terrifying. Knowing that people of color are disproportionately affected by COVID worried me. And I never knew about systemic racism in health care\u2014that sometimes doctors give less pain relief to Black people, because they think our pain tolerance is different. Or that they don't explain certain things to us, because they think we won't understand. I developed worries about the stability of my job too. I'm on a mid-range salary and didn't know how I'd afford everything, but my family and friends came through (the baby's father never responded when I told him I was pregnant). I don't know what I'd have done without my strong, established support networks\u2014that's an advantage of being an older parent. I went into labor a couple of weeks ago and had to have an emergency C-section. I was terrified and angry. My obstetrician helped me see they were doing it for the health of my baby. I had postpartum hemorrhaging and was put in the ICU, which, because of COVID, meant I couldn't be with my baby. At home, I could hardly walk the first two weeks, let alone take care of an eight-pound baby. I needed help but wanted to protect my daughter from potential COVID exposure. Family and friends ended up coming from New York, which I couldn't have done without. While having a baby right now wasn't my plan, it was just what my heart needed. Rachel Grigoryan, 28, Grand Rapids, Michigan, mental health therapist I married my husband in February 2020 and got pregnant, because we had too much free time on our hands as newlyweds. When we found out, we were thrilled but terrified. Being pregnant during COVID created anxiety for me. I've been sick, but it's hard to communicate that to friends because everyone is experiencing trauma. My husband hasn't been able to come into all my appointments. I've worried about contracting the virus and losing my baby. And then, my mother did contract the virus. At the beginning of the pregnancy, I called her every hour with a different question. But after we couldn't see each other for two months, it made it awkward to navigate that separation. I've heard pregnancy is always lonely. You're the only one who knows what's going on in your body and how it feels. But the pandemic means I'm also cut off from my close girlfriends and not able to do normal things as a kind of distraction. Layer on the despair at what's happening in this country and seasonal depression, it's been intense. Often, I tell my husband that I need him to stand in the bathroom while I shower. I just don't want to be in the room alone. And then, on the other hand, I'm really okay. I don't have COVID, no one in my family has died of it, I've kept my job. I had wonderful things happen to me in 2020, and it makes me feel selfish to wish that I had a normal baby shower. People are dying, and here I am, Kim Kardashian, dropping her diamond earring in the ocean. It's a lot to process when your hormones are raging. A positive of COVID is I've been able to work from home. I go in one day a week to meet clients, as some don't have access to technology. I got early access to the vaccine, but I worried about the lack of trials on pregnant women. I spoke to medical professionals about mRNA vaccines and realized the worst that could happen is an early delivery. So I took the plunge. I'm excited to pass antibodies to my son. I'm due in one week and can't wait to get my son out. The most difficult part now is telling family and friends they can't meet him as a newborn. Jasyra Santiago-Hines, 32, Philadelphia, entrepreneur and registered nurse My husband and I went to the hospital for a routine 34-week check. The doctor said I had preeclampsia and needed to be induced. As a routine procedure, I was given a COVID test. It was positive. I couldn't believe it. I had no symptoms and had been super cautious. The energy in the room shifted. It was like I had the plague, like no one wanted to be around me. I started crying and blaming myself. My husband was able to stay with me. I don't know how I'd have done it without him. I didn't give birth for three days but had to wear a mask the whole time. I was on high alert checking for symptoms. More than thinking about birth, I was fixated on how I got COVID. I felt embarrassed and didn't want anyone else to know. When the contractions started, I just wanted to get through the pain and have my daughter as naturally as possible. The doctor who delivered my baby was amazing. Pushing and having something covering your face is incredibly uncomfortable. There was a point where I said I couldn't push anymore, and he told me, \"Look, the head is here. Do you want to touch it?\" I put my hand down and felt her. He said, \"She's small, and I know you can do this.\" Even through the pain, I remember telling him I appreciated that. After I pushed her out, she was taken to the other side of the room, and I wasn't able to hold her. Before they took her to the NICU, I got to look at her and rub her head. I was discharged first, and we FaceTimed her every few hours. At home, I started to feel worse. My chest was tight, my body was tingling. I didn't know if it was COVID, high blood pressure, or anxiety. I was admitted back into hospital but had to be isolated. I completely broke down. I couldn't bear being separated from my husband too. I didn't think I was ever going to return home. My anxiety was out of control. As well as health, I was worried about finances. I work for myself and hadn't planned to start maternity leave so early. Our hospital bills are going to be big. Thankfully, the staff were great again, and I was given meds and could return home. When our daughter was discharged, I was still in quarantine. The staff tried their best to teach us on FaceTime how to look after her, but it wasn't the same. A nurse met us in the hospital lobby and, fully gowned, handed us our daughter in a car seat. It was really weird. There were a lot of things that were ripped away from me because of COVID. It's been a month since the birth and my mother only just met my daughter. I just didn't get the pregnancy experience I wanted. But my daughter is here now. She is one of the happiest babies, and I'm truly busy learning to be a mom.
