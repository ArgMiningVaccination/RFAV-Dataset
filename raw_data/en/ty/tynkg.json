Established in 2009, the IPRP promotes innovative and collaborative research focusing on RNA science and technology. Its overall goal is to find and fund innovative, high-impact research with the potential for leading to exter -nal research funding or commercial applications. UAlbany-based researchers collaborating with RPI and the Wadsworth Center are, left to right, Associate Professor of Chemistry Igor Lednev; RNA Institute Director and Profes-sor of Biological Sciences and Chemistry Paul F . Agris; Profes-sor of Chemistry and Biological Sciences Daniele Fabris; and Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences Pan T.X. Li. The RNA Institute, launched in 2010, is located at UAlbany's Life Sciences Research Building. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has appointed SEFCU President & CEO Michael J. Castellana, B.S.'84, M.B.A.'92, to a four-year term as member and chair of UAlbany's University Council. The appointment, made in Febru-ary, is effective through June 30, 2017. Castellana, who serves on The University at Albany Foundation Board of Directors and the advisory board of the University's M.B.A. Advisory Council, was instrumental in creating the Small Enterprise Economic Development (SEED) program, a partnership that links SEFCU, UAlbany and Empire State Development. He also supports many other organizations, including the Capitalize Albany Corporation, T ech Valley Connect, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Little Sisters of the Poor and St. Anne Institute. For the women's basketball team at UAlbany, this was an unprec- edented season. Led by seniors Keyana Williams, Ebone Henry, Julie Forster and Lindsey Lowrie, the team went into conference play undefeated (16-0) and clinched the America East title with a 25-3 record. \"We care for one another and don't want to let each other down. That's how we maintained this incredible streak,\" said Henry, the all-time leading scorer in UAlbany women's basketball history. Head coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson also won high marks from the team for her hard work and encourage- ment. \"Coach Abe is UAlbany women's basketball,\" noted Lowrie. \"She's more than a coach; she's our mentor, a friend and an integral part of our Purple Family.\"Castellana Begins Four-Year University Council Term UAlbany's RNA Institute Collaborates With Wadsworth, RPI It's a Slam-Dunk Season for UAlbany Women's Mark Schmidt Mark SchmidtLiberty Terrace Opens It features permeable pavement, rain gardens, meeting spaces, exercise rooms, lounges, and laundry facilities - and space for 500 UAlbany students. It's Liberty Terrace, an environmentally sustainable student-housing complex opened on the uptown campus in August 2012. While the complex is beautiful, it's also \"green\": Thanks to a geothermal heat pump system installed with support from a $2.7 million U.S. Department of Energy grant, Liberty Terrace is expected to use 50 percent less energy and 45 percent less water than a comparable structure adhering to current building codes and standards. WCDB Marks Its 35th Anniversary Disco is long gone, but after 35 years, WCDB (90.9 FM) - \"The Capital District's Best\" - still rules the airwaves at UAlbany. The student-run radio station has been informing and entertaining the Uni-versity community, and launching careers, since March 1, 1978. (Its predecessor, WSUA, went on the air in 1963.) In the years since, thousands of UAlbany graduates who worked at both stations have moved on to successful careers. They include Brian Lehrer '73, host of \"The Brian Lehrer Show\" on WNYC in New York, and attorney Bill McCann '86, who has hosted \"The Saturday Morning Edition of Jazz\" for nearly 28 years. WCDB's current schedule features a variety of musical formats, including R&B, rock and inspirational; news; and sports. Spe-cial programming includes \"The Social Workers,\" which airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. Assisted by School of Social Welfare gradu-ate students, nationally acclaimed talk-show host Kathryn Zox, M.S.W.'83, Your Social Worker with a Microphone\u00ae, highlights such issues as cyber bullying and organ donation. Anniversary events included a mixer that brought students together with alumni who work in radio, music, television and social media. Rousseau Is Rockefeller College Dean David L. Rousseau, a professor of political science at the University since 2005, has been named dean of the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy. Rousseau, who earned a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan and a master's from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, \"is an outstanding scholar, teacher and leader in the field of public affairs,\" noted University at Albany President Robert J. Jones, who announced the appointment Feb. 6. \"I am excited to be given the opportunity to continue my work with an outstanding faculty to expand our academic offerings, increase international activities, deepen our community engagement, and support our innovative public affairs research,\" Rousseau said.

Mark SchmidtStudent Spotlight By Vinny Reda, B.A.'74 School of Public Health doctoral student Dorcey Applyrs channels Mahatma Gandhi in describing her work with young African-American women in the Capital Region: \"It is my way of taking part in the change I want to see.\" For four years, Applyrs has been an adviser with Delta GEMS (Growing & Empower - ing Myself Successfully), the community- service project of the Albany Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. She conducts sessions and exercises that seek to guide the 14- to 18-year-olds toward achieving their dreams. GEMS meetings focus on \"discussions of self-esteem, body image, bullying, HIV/AIDS and other issues that impact participants' mental and physical health,\" explained Applyrs, who earned a B.S. in psychology at Delaware State Uni- versity (DSU). \"Each meeting, I facilitate a 15-to-20-minute physical activity component to engage the girls in some form of exercise while pro- moting physical activity as a social norm. The program serves lunch and snacks, like fresh fruit, salads and yogurt, to encour - age healthy eating.\" Other subjects include multiculturalism and careers. Applyrs arranged for GEMS teens and Karen girls whose families had left Burma and settled in Albany to meet and talk about culture, unity and community-service opportunities. T opics for sessions related to \"grade-specific career preparation\" include \"r\u00e9sum\u00e9-writing, developing a personal statement, interviewing, and completing college applications,\" Applyrs said. \"We have also brought in professionals to talk about the significance of a college education and best practices for climbing the career ladder.\" Like the young women she advises, Applyrs has a mentor: fellow Washington, D.C., native and DSU graduate Dwight Williams. The clinical associate professor of health policy recruited Applyrs to the School of Public Health, assuring her \"that he was committed to my future success, academically and professionally. His commitment has been unwavering,\" noted Applyrs, a 2012 Center for Women in Government and Civil Society Women in Public Policy Fellow. Once she completes her studies, Applyrs will \"pursue a position that will enable me to advocate for initiatives and policies that will improve communities' quality of life and prevent poor health outcomes, such as HIV/ AIDS, obesity, diabetes, cancer and influenza.\" Applyrs is married to Don-Lee at UAlbany.

Jones, Ph.D., a former University of Minnesota administrator and faculty member with more than 30 years' experience in higher-education leadership and academic expertise. Well known for his work in plant physiology and in urban and international development, Jones is now committed to \"building on the excel-lence\" of UAlbany and distinguishing the University as \"a leader in emerging technology and entrepreneurship.\" Photo: Mark B.A.'93 (\"Activist With a Camera,\" Spring 2011), continues to log miles at a fast and furious rate. \"I'm still living in New York City, but I'm basically bicoastal, with frequent trips to California,\" said the TED (T echnology Entertain-ment and Design) Senior Fellow, who is often \"on the road, attending and speaking at [the organization's] ideas conferences in Europe and the United States.\" In a Jan. 8 email, Kuwayama noted: \"Hurricane Sandy brought my disaster work home to New York, and I just returned from Australia, where I had a series of exhi- bitions and projections and did a talk at the Sydney Opera House.

Bartholomew, M.A.'84 (\"Champ's Biographer,\" Fall 2011). For The Untold Story of Champ: A Social History of America's Loch Ness Monster (State University of New York Press, 2012), Bartholomew explored \"the lake itself and period sources and archives in an attempt to answer the ultimate question: Does Champ ex-ist?\" Although his search was \"obscured by sloppy journalism, local leaders motivated by tourism income, and bickering monster hunt-ers,\" he crafted a rich, color - ful story that \"will fascinate believers and skeptics alike.\" A Whitehall, N.Y., native in-terested in Champ \"ever since I was able to pick up a pair of binoculars and scan the lake,\" Bartholomew teaches history at Botany Downs Secondary College in South Auckland. Jamilah BartholomewTivadar DomaniczkyAs Gregory Maguire tells it, he almost didn't graduate from the University at Albany. But the problem - namely, his many inde- pendent-study courses - is also one of the keys to his later success. Through independent studies, UAlbany \"let me spread my wings and write what I wanted and gave me credit. They made a good bet on me,\" said Maguire, the best-selling author of Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, which spawned the smash Broadway musical Wicked. Maguire spoke about his student days when he visited campus in November 2012 to announce he was donating his papers to the University Libraries. His personal and professional papers, manuscripts, documents, diaries and memorabilia, a collection spanning more than 50 years to date, will be stored in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections & Archives. This collection joins the papers of Pulitzer Prize-winning author William Kennedy; Joseph Persico, B.A.'52; and Marcia Brown, B.A.'40. Gregory Maguire, B.A.'76 Gregory Maguire displays the Wicked manuscript, part of the collection he donated to UAlbany last fall. Also pictured, next page, are some children's books from the collection and a handwritten page from the first draft of Wicked. Gifts at Work By Mary Fiess Photos by Mark Schmidt 6 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013 www.albany.edu 7 In addition, Maguire donated the collected papers of his father, celebrated Times Union columnist John Maguire, and a collection of poetry by his stepmother, Marie McAuliff Maguire. \"Gregory Maguire has made an indelible mark on American literature,\" said UAlbany Provost Susan Phillips. \"We consider it an enormous honor that UAlbany will now preserve and safeguard his papers for the use of students, scholars and the community at large.\" The collection includes such items as the spiral-bound notebook containing Maguire's handwritten first draft, dated Feb. 17, 1992, of the first chapters of Wicked. \"There aren't a lot of cross-outs. I tended to write fairly cleanly,\" Maguire noted as he displayed the notebook. He completed Wicked in 1993; it was published in 1995. T o date, the novel has sold more than five million copies. The musical has been Broadway's No. 1 hit for an unprece-dented eight consecutive years and has won 35 major awards, including the Grammy and three T onys. There are currently seven productions worldwide.While most famous for Wicked, Maguire is also the author of 30 other books, including the adult novel Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, the children's novels What-The-Dickens: The Story of a Rogue T ooth Fairy and Leaping Beauty and Other Animal Fairy T ales, and The Hamlet Chronicles series. Maguire grew up in Albany in an Irish-Catholic family in which five of seven children became writers. \"Our family was a literary ecosystem, in a sense,\" he said. He earned his bachelor's degree in English and studio art from UAlbany in May 1976, although there was a bit of a hitch. \"About a week after my graduation, I got a call from the registrar's office, saying that my degree was invalid because I had taken too many independent studies,\" Maguire recounted. \"I was, however, an early archivist, so I was able to take from my files all the signed permission forms from my professors. I was able to persuade the University, with the backing of the Board of Regents, that my degree was valid.\" 8 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013Courtesy the Institute of Museum and Library ServicesAfter all, she oversees a $200 million annual budget. She and her team are responsible for supporting and advocating on behalf of thousands of museums and more than 100,000 libraries nationwide. And she was appointed to her position by President Barack Obama. Hildreth is director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a federal agency that helps America's museums and libraries remain relevant and vital. Her four-year appointment is a testament to her proven leadership and extensive background in the field of library science - a foundation that was formed at the University at Albany. \"I got a very good education,\" she said when describing her UAlbany experience. \"It was definitely an important step in my career.\" Hildreth has fond memories of excellent faculty members, and of being among the first students to use the then newly constructed uptown campus. When discussing her profession, she acknowledges the rapidly changing role of librarians in an increas-ingly technology-empowered world. However, she believes they can still play a critical part. \"The librarian used to be a gatekeeper,\" Hildreth explained. \"Now, we can use our knowledge and ex-perience to be more of a navigator ... to guide people to the information, books or resources they need.\" Looking back on more than three decades of work in library science, she noted that it's a very satisfying feeling to help people find what they're looking for. This is a mission Hildreth continues today, on a national scale.Susan Hildreth, M.L.S.'73 The Nation's Librarian By Jim Sciancalepore, M.A.'93 Most jobs don't require an FBI background check and confirmation by the U.S. Senate, but Susan Hildreth doesn't have a typical job.www.albany.edu 9Every week, people from across the country reach out to Donna McNulty Reinbolt via email, LinkedIn, T witter and other media. They are often frightened, confused or overwhelmed, because they or their family members have been diagnosed with lymphoma, a type of blood cancer that impacts an estimated 659,000 Americans. Reinbolt takes the time to reply to each inquiry. \"It's easy to start looking too far down the road when you receive news like this,\" Reinbolt explained. \"I try to help them take it one step, one day at a time.\" She understands their feelings all too well. In 2007, the accomplished attorney and mother of two learned that she had lymphoma. Nine difficult months would follow as Reinbolt underwent a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. Thankfully, her treatment was a success - she recently commemorated five cancer-free years. However, lymphoma wasn't just a life-altering circumstance for Reinbolt; it led her to an entirely new career. \"I began simply wanting to volunteer and give back to the lymphoma organization that had helped me so much,\" said Reinbolt. \"But then it grew into something more.\" Reinbolt would go on to found the Houston chapter of the Lymphoma Research Foundation and, more recently, she was appointed a board member at the national level. Her current job is a blend of advocacy, policy-setting and fundraising, all of which draw on Reinbolt's talents for learning and collaboration - skills she cultivated as a student at UAlbany. Donna McNulty Reinbolt, B.A. '83 Survivor, Advocate, Leader By Jim Sciancalepore, M.A.'93 \"I got a great education from excellent faculty members,\" Reinbolt recalled of her undergraduate experience. \"It's part of who I am today.\"Courtesy the Lymphoma Research Foundation10 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013\"Give a year. Change the world. \" Last summer, recent University at Albany graduates Alice Wong, Emily Park and Dimitri Pinnock responded to that call by committing 10 months to City Year. The program, which hires young adults who tutor and mentor students to get them \"on track\" for graduation, operates in 24 U.S. cities; London, England; and South Africa. New York City native Wong provides classroom and lunchroom support at P .S./M.S. 206 in East Harlem, assist-ing students with reading and writing skills and \"other subjects, depending on what they are learning when I am with them.\" Wong, who majored in math- ematics and minored in business ad-ministration at UAlbany, creates \"'mini' lesson plans tailored to my students' specific learning styles. I can already see little improvements when reading with one of my third-graders, and it is such a nice feeling to know that I am making a difference.\" The experience has con- firmed for Wong that work- ing in education \"is what I want to do. I have been able to learn different teaching techniques, as well as how to work with children with special needs by creating a bond with them and giving them a little extra attention.\" After completing her City Year commitment in June, Wong plans to earn a master's degree and her teaching certification. At Sheepshead Bay High School in his native Brook-lyn, N.Y., Pinnock shares with about 60 freshmen \"ideas and strategies\" that helped him to succeed while studying history and biology at UAlbany. He understands \"firsthand\" the struggles \"of trying to succeed in an urban school setting. The students look up to me. I look like them, I went to a similar high school and I graduated from college, so they are always recep- tive to my tutoring and my advice on issues they are facing.\" As role models, City Year corps members are held to strict behavioral standards: They are not permitted to smoke, swear or even chew gum. Each wears a bright-red jacket that sports the City Year logo. For Pinnock, the jacket \"represents the commitment I have with this great program. I wanted to serve my community and establish a better academic experience for students by placing a high value on education and coursework, and by letting them know they can accomplish anything in the world. Pinnock's mother \"held me account- able\" for schoolwork, encouraging him \"to be an overachiever. She wanted me to excel, and I want my students to excel, also,\" said Pinnock, who plans to take the MCAT s next summer in preparation for medical school. City Year \"has taught me to become more of a leader,\" he added. \"I can use this skill in initiatives I set up to involve more minorities in medicine, and also in reducing health disparities around the world.\" Changing the World By Carol Olechowski Dimitri Pinnock, first-generation Korean-American from New York City, admires the ninth-graders she tutors in math, English and science at Thomas Jefferson High School in Los Angeles. \"They don't have perfect lives, yet they come to school every day, excited to see us and wanting to better their futures through a beautiful thing called education,\" observed Park, who earned a degree in sociology and psychology at UAlbany. Jefferson students \"are rising to the City Year challenge.\" One success story, \"Juan,\" was formerly \"late to school every day. He would fall behind on all his classwork and never complete his homework. He is never late anymore and even attends our after-school program. We motivate him, and he's proud to know that his mentors believe in and care about him,\" said Park, noting that City Year \"has opened up my inter - est to studying education reform in graduate school.\" Diversity is one of City Year's greatest strengths. \"I have met so many people from so many different places,\" Wong commented. \"Our different experiences with children have allowed us to bounce ideas off one another and learn from each other.\" Added Park: \"We are all so different, yet we work together cohesively. I know that, after this experience, we will all be able to bring the concept of teamwork and our own strengths to any fields we pursue.\" For more information about City Y ear, visit www.cityyear.org. Alice Wong, B.A. '12 Dan Hart, B.S.'83 Reaching for the Stars Dan Hart believes in reaching for the stars - literally. \"I always wanted to be in the space pro- gram,\" recounts Hart, Boeing Network & Space Systems' vice president and deputy program manager for Return to Intercept, Ground-based Midcourse Defense. \"In high school, I found the theory of relativ-ity fascinating, and I liked the whole 'Star Wars'/'Star T rek'/science-fiction thing happening at the time.\" In 1979, Hart enrolled at the University at Albany; \"I knew a lot of kids who were going there, and the school offered a diverse selection of academics.\" He found the state capital \"appealing. It was a metropolitan area, but not quite New York City, and far enough away\" from Valley Stream, N.Y., his hometown, but near enough so that \"if I had to get home, I could go on T railways.\" \"T orn\" between science and the arts, Hart initially studied both. Freshman year, he landed a lead role in a campus production of the 1920s comedy Boy Meets Girl. (\"I played the boy,\" he jokes.) \"It was an incredible ex-perience. I did theatre in high school, but I had never been in a play where the produc-tion values and the set were so professional. We had a guest director from England. A '20s-style suit was tailored for me. At the same time, Constance Valis-Hill, the move- ment instructor, spent a lot of time work-ing with me on mime, and I was incredibly grateful. I did some Shakespeare and then focused more on physics.\" Glenn Davenport 12 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013 By Carol Olechowskiwww.albany.edu 13 Hart conducted research for Distin- guished Service Professor James W. Corbett, who would become his mentor. \"Dr. Corbett was great. I was amazed that someone who had been all over the world and led an institute would sit and chat with a lowly junior. I told him I wanted to be an astronaut, and he said: 'Do it. There's no reason you can't.' That was energizing and inspiring.\" With graduation looming, Hart \"called NASA, explained I was a senior physics student at Albany and asked how to get into the space program. I wound up talk-ing with somebody at headquarters about payloads on the space shuttle. NASA sent me a book listing companies affiliated with the space program; I checked off about 120 and sent each a letter with my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, unaware that the addresses were for company presidents.\" The responses included \"a couple of encouraging phone calls,\" including one from McDonnell- Douglas. Hart interviewed and, \"by the beginning of June, I was working at the Kennedy Space Center, at Spacelab, the first big European-American space collaborative and part of the shuttle pro- gram. I remember thinking, they don't really need to pay me for this; I'd gladly do it for nothing!\" Hart worked on Challenger in 1985 and supported Spacelab 2, \"one of Chal- lenger's last successful missions. The Challenger accident was the last shuttle launch I saw from Kennedy.\" Later, at Cape Canaveral, he launched and updated \"1960s- and '70s-vintage rockets,\" then relocated to Southern California in 1988 \"to get involved in rocket design.\" Hart has been engaged in \"every aspect of the space program\" - including systems engineering for the Delta IV rockets created in the 1990s, missile defense and satellite programs - \"and all with the same company, really,\" since McDonnell-Douglas, Rockwell, Hughes and other companies \"eventu- ally came together with Boeing\" through mergers and acquisitions. Hart never became an astronaut but has no regrets. \"I married the love of my life; I had kids. I was enjoying what I was doing. At Boeing, you're always on a mission, and every mission is important. It doesn't feel like just a job. It feels like you have a purpose, and that's great.\" The critical thinking and communication skills he acquired at Albany continue to serve Hart well. \"Boeing operates across the U.S. to England, China, India and Brazil. We have 170,000 people from very different disciplines - structural dynamics, controls theory, structural design, propulsion - working on aircraft and spacecraft. They have to commu- nicate with one another, with company leadership and with the customer so everyone can understand what we're trying to accomplish and how we're solving our problems.\" Hart, who travels frequently for work, also does \"a little bit of college outreach. Students have a fresh outlook; it plugs you into their energy and vision. I would love to talk to some students at UAlbany.\"In his free time, Hart plays the drums and guitar and reads \"a lot of history. I still run, too,\" he adds, recalling that the latter pursuit began in college at the urging of boyhood friend and Colo-nial Quad roommate Randy Holloway, B.A.'83. \"And my hobby, raising teenag- ers, is always exciting!\" he laughs, adding that his kids \"are both fantastic.\" T alk of his children reminds Hart again of Albany, where he \"played intramural soccer and 'touch' football most Satur - days, especially if it was snowy or muddy, with buddies Mike Remondino [B.S.'83] and John Beaver [B.A.'83].\" At Sutter's Mill, \"a short walking distance\" from campus, his diet included \"cheeseburg-ers, fries and a couple of beers for a lot of meals. Probably our favorite bar downtown was the Long Branch. WT's was great, too. \"I really enjoyed my time at the Univer - sity. The attention that a couple of key professors gave me was really ...\" Hart halts mid-sentence. \"I get choked up thinking about it.\" Hart was \"one of the primary architects of the Delta IV Launch Vehicle Fleet, which includes the most powerful rocket in operation today.\" Pat Corkery In November 1983, \"six months after graduation\" from the University at Albany, Dan Hart supported his first launch (Spacelab 1, STS-9) from Firing Room 1 at Kennedy Space Center.On the wall next to Robert J. Jones' desk is a photo of him with Nobel laureate Desmond T utu. The story be-hind it tells you something about the long road that brought Jones from a boyhood on a sharecroppers' farm in Georgia to his new calling as the 19th president of the University at Albany. That road took Jones to a Ph.D. in plant physiology, to a life as faculty member and researcher, to a role as a facilitator in T utu's South African Education Program, and to key leadership positions at the University of Minnesota. On Jan. 2, 2013, the road brought him to UAlbany for his first official day on the job. He was appointed by the SUNY Board of T rust-ees in September 2012 to succeed retiring presi-dent George M. Philip, B.A.'69, M.A.'73. \"When I began my career, I had no interest in ever being a univer - sity administrator. I had no intention of being anything other than the best professor, the best scientist, the best scholar I could be,\" Jones recalled recently. So in 1978, he started as an assistant professor in agronomy and plant genetics at the University of Minnesota. Six years later, he was helping T utu's edu- cation program. Then, along came one key administrative assignment after another at Minnesota. Through all those experiences, he believes he gained an ideal preparation for leading UAlbany. \"I see great opportunities ahead, and I want to bring all my passion and experience to bear in helping to move this University to the next level,\" said Jones. His journey began on a sharecroppers' farm in Dawson, Ga. \"Most years, we could barely make enough to sustain our - selves,\" Jones recounted. But they grew their own food and, as a result, \"we never went hungry a day in our lives.\"His Road to UAlbany By Mary Fiess In 2003, Desmond Tutu, the anti-apartheid activist and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, was the special guest at the University of Minnesota's Great Conversations program. The auditorium, with a capacity of more than 5,400, was standing room only. Jones, who invited Tutu and interviewed him, recalled the event as \"the best conversation. When he's in the room, you know you are in the presence of an outstanding individual.\" Mark McCarty Linda Gail Johnson 14 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013 Robert J. Jones, Ph.D. 19th President of the University at Albany www.albany.edu 15 Mark McCarty16 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013Jones and his brother and sister also \"almost never missed a day of school.\" At that time, children of sharecropping fami-lies sometimes missed school to help harvest the crops. But his parents insisted that their children take their studies seriously - \"one of the greatest gifts\" they gave him, he said. \"I was always curious as a child,\" Jones said. \"My high school vocational agriculture teacher, Walter Stallworth, started to call me 'professor' when I was in the ninth grade. He made sure I stayed on track with the math and science to get admit-ted to college.\" At Fort Valley State University, Jones studied agronomy. \"I knew it was not going to be in my future to be a farmer, but I saw a very exciting opportunity to be on the other end of that spectrum, looking at the underlying issues in food production from a scientific perspective,\" he said. \"I took my first plant physiology class as a required course, and I fell in love with it. \"I was fortunate to have another mentor at Fort Valley: Mal- colm Blunt saw potential in me and three other guys who had also graduated from high school with me. We all went on for advanced degrees.\" Accepted by the University of Georgia, Jones earned his mas- ter's in crop physiology. Then, \"one of the world's best plant/ crop physiologists, Curtis Jerry Nelson, recruited me to come to the University of Missouri to do my doctorate. I did well enough my first year that he nominated me for the George Washington Carver Fellowship - and that made all the differ - ence in the world in terms of my ability to pursue my degree and not have to worry about money, for the first time in my life,\" Jones said. The University of Minnesota, \"a forerunner in creating multi- disciplinary teams of faculty to work on different crops,\" hired Jones to start a crop physiology program, working specifically with maize. His research ultimately focused on stabilizing yields of maize in the face of environmental stresses and global climate change as a way of increasing global food production. Initially, his primary responsibility at Minnesota was setting up his research program, securing grants and hiring staff. He also began teaching a graduate-level plant physiology course. Jones was pulled into his first administrative assignment at Minnesota in 1986. \"The president at the time, Ken Keller, was concerned about whether our predominantly white uni- versity was doing enough to create a climate that was support- ive of the high-ability students of color we were recruiting,\" said Jones. Remembering the mentors who had helped him, Jones took on a part-time assignment to create and direct the first structured mentoring program for these stu- dents. It is still in operation today. \"Almost 200 facul- ty members are involved in helping these students feel at home,\" said Jones. \"They take the students to lunch, talk to them about their goals, maybe go to a football game together.\"Dr. Jones is married to diagnostic radiologist Lynn Hassan Jones, M.D., whom he introduced to the UAlbany community Jan. 23 as \"my better half.\" www.albany.edu 17His service on a task force that examined the impact of the university's strategic plan on its diversity goals and objectives led, in turn, to Jones' involvement in helping to develop the university's Office for Equity and Diversity. The man with no desire to become a university adminis-trator assumed his first full-time adminis-trative position - assistant to the associate vice president for Multicultural Affairs and associate provost - in 1994. Three years later, Jones was appointed vice pro-vost for Faculty and Academic Personnel, with responsibilities for managing the university's promotion and tenure process across the entire five-campus Minnesota system. In 2002, Jones was named vice president and executive vice provost for Faculty and Academic Programs. Starting in 2004, he served as senior vice president for Aca-demic Administration at the University of Minnesota System. As he assumed ever greater administrative responsibilities at Minnesota, Jones said, he learned a lot from \"the strongest men-tor in my academic administrative life,\" then president (now emeritus) Robert Bruininks. An innovative, intuitive leader, Bruininks ensured that the university had \"the wherewithal and resources necessary to get things done\" but was \"also very committed to holding people account-able\" for their responsibilities. \"He trusted me with a lot of things that could have blown up and caused both of us big trouble,\" Jones added. \"Particu-larly, he charged me with going out and driving the university's urban agenda, ar - ticulating a value of the university to serve the urban community. The university had Jones' hometown, Dawson, Ga., is best known as the largest Spanish peanut mar - ket in the world. It was also the birthplace of R&B legend Otis Redding and Washing-ton, D.C.'s, first mayor, Walter Washington. Jones' parents were share- croppers who raised mainly peanuts and cotton. They also grew a little corn to feed their chickens, cows and hogs. He was 7 or 8 when he decided he wanted to be a scientist. Fascinating Facts About UAlbany President Robert J. Jones Mark McCartynever done anything like that, and not everyone was enthusiastic about it. He provided an opportunity for me to frame the argument. The community's percep- tion of the university was fundamentally changed. \"Bob gave me the latitude to lead and to innovate, and I hope to provide that kind of space here for my staff members.\" Bruininks, in turn, describes Jones as \"one of the most extraordinary leaders I have met, nationally and internation-ally, in higher education. He has all the attributes necessary to be successful in this new and challenging era now facing higher education. \"He was frequently given the most complex and difficult problems to solve and manage to a successful conclusion. He was asked to strengthen the inter - national profile and especially increase the diversity of undergraduate enroll-ment. In 2007, we had 515 international students. In 2011, we had 2,282. Min-nesota won national recognition for becoming one of the more internationally focused public universities,\" said Bruininks. In managing his responsibili- ties across all five University of Minnesota campuses, Bru-ininks noted, Jones was able \"to really get all parts of the Minnesota university system to work in a more integrative way, to work more productive- ly together. Robert is a leader of considerable vision, cour - age, integrity. He has great Jones studied agronomy at Fort Valley State University, a historically black college in Georgia's Peach County. He was one of the first five African-American students to enroll at the University of Georgia's College of Agriculture. Jones earned his master's degree in crop physiology. For his Ph.D. studies at the University of Mis-souri, Jones studied the physiology of tall fescue, a forage grass important in cattle production in Missouri. The University of Min-nesota hired Jones, then 26, to start a crop-physiol-ogy program, specifically working with maize.

He is highly inclu- sive in his leadership style. Diversity isn't an abstract concept - he embraces diverse ideas, diverse perspectives, peo-ple from very diverse backgrounds.\" Much as he had loved his work in Min- nesota, when Jones was offered the UAlbany position, he decided to ac-cept it because of the opportunities he sees ahead to build on the University's excellence. Gov. Andrew Cuomo's NY SUNY2020 plan, Jones said, is another reason he accepted the UAlbany presi- dency. \"The plan gives us the opportu-nity to hire some 180 new faculty mem- bers and increase our enrollment by more than 1,300 students. It aligns with my vision and passion about how this University needs to be a major player in driving the economic vitality of the region. \"Through our plan, and with the sup- port of the governor, the legislature, SUNY Chancellor Nancy Zimpher and the entire UAlbany family, we have an opportunity to leverage places where we already are excellent to distinguish this University as a leader in emerg-ing technology and entrepreneurship. That will be one of our signature areas because it is multidisciplinary, cutting across many areas. \"Clearly, the task ahead is all about building on the excellence of this University.\" In 1984, Jones work ed on the selection committee for Des- mond Tutu's South African Edu- cation Program, a scholarship program to educate black South Africans in the United States. He was recruited because \"more than half of the (South African) students wanted to be scientists or engineers,\" so the program sought to enlist a black Ameri- can university scientist for the selection committee. For four or five weeks each summer until 1994, Jones vis- ited South Africa and Namibia to \"interview 1,000 or so stu- dents for about 125 to 150 slots at American universities. We educated more than 3,300 stu- dents over those 10 years, and more than 96 percent returned to South Africa. It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.\" From 1980 to 2009, Jones performed and toured with the Grammy Award-winning choral ensemble Sounds of Blackness. Increased responsibilities at work, however, required him to scale back his participation. As they tour the uptown campus, Dr. Jones and his wife introduce themselves to students. Fascinating Facts About UAlbany President Robert J. JonesMark Schmidt Mark Schmidt Outgoing University at Albany President George M. Philip shares a laugh with Dr. Jones and his wife. Mark Schmidt20 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013 University at Albany master's degree in criminal justice helped Peter Stevens draw up a blueprint for success in the architecture field. Stevens is president of JCJ Architecture, a prestigious firm founded in 1936. From its headquarters in Hartford, Conn., and offices in New York, Boston, Phoenix and San Diego, JCJ provides planning and design services for a wide range of justice, hospitality, educa-tion, civic and corporate projects in the United States, Latin America and the Middle East. At Bates College, Stevens prepared for a vocation in urban ministry. His calling took an unexpected turn when he spent his junior year in Sweden, observing the country's correctional system, including Kumla, its \"most secure and largest pris-on.\" Stevens noticed that inmates were required \"to work in meaningful jobs, both inside and outside the prison\"; pay taxes; and support their dependents. Physical environment, family and conju-gal visitations, and personal interaction between inmates and correctional staff promoted \"a restorative approach\" to inmate rehabilitation. By contrast, \"prison industries in the U.S. weren't real industries and didn't really provide vocational training. They made license plates and cheap furniture. Most inmates were idle, not focused on creating a better outcome after release.\" After graduation, Stevens headed an educational program for challenged Appalachian children and became a regular visitor at Alderson Women's Penitentiary in West Virginia. Later at Albany, while taking classes with profes-sors Hans T och and David Duffee, he \"began to put the pieces together and understand what I had observed at the only women's federal prison in the U.S.\" At Hindelang Center, Stevens assisted in a research project \"with some of my mentors, including Kathleen Heide [M.A.'78, Ph.D.'82, now a professor of criminology at the University of South Florida].\" Stevens intended to pursue doctoral studies in criminal justice at UAlbany, but the Comprehensive Crime Control Act enacted in the 1980s impacted all aspects of the federal justice system and \"affected my immediate plans.\" He secured a part-time position as a criminal-justice planner at The Ehren-krantz Group in New York City and, for several months simultaneously, had a part-time research-associate's role at the Hartford Institute of Criminal and Social Justice. Stevens later worked for Rosser International until joining JCJ Architecture in 1988. Peter Stevens, M.A.'83 By Carol Olechowski JCJ Architecture incorporated separate retail and restaurant space into its design for the Middletown, Conn., police headquarters.www.albany.edu 21 Though Stevens is not an architect, he notes: \"What I learned at Albany gave me a certain insight into the built envi-ronment that was not part of traditional architectural training. I enjoy addressing the corrections, judicial or public-safety issues that relate to the operational com-ponents of justice facilities. Many can lead to life-or-death situations.\" Stevens favors a direct-supervision ap- proach to correctional management. \"A less-institutional environment is more rehabilitative; it depends on the human eye and contact for oversight and com-munication, and to prevent situations from escalating. In contrast, indirect supervision is very custodial, relying on cameras, mouthpieces and intercom sys-tems. There's much less direct contact between officers and inmates.\" JCJ designs incorporate elements that will \"act as catalysts for sustainable development\" and advance commu-nity integration, explains Stevens. One example, the police headquarters in Middletown, Conn., provides \"almost a mixed-use development, with separate space for retail and restaurant opera-tions. Locating a facility in the heart of a community and providing community-use spaces helps to erase the arbitrary lines between local residents and their public servants, promoting positive interaction between the police and the public. \"The incredible range of our project experience and sensitivity to design has enabled us to develop a unique position in our industry,\" Stevens adds. Recent high-profile projects include renovations of Lincoln Center's David H. Koch Theater and the Empire State Build- ing Observatory; adaptation of historic Aqueduct Raceway into Resorts World New York; and design services for two Navajo Nation restorative-justice complexes in Arizona and New Mexico. JCJ Architecture has worked extensively with more than 40 Native American tribes, helping their communities \"to meet their economic and self- determination goals,\" says Stevens. Design That Builds Community, JCJ's mission statement, \"drives us in our work and in our relationships with one another,\" observes the third-generation Hartford native, whose family includes wife Sarah and children Matt and Julie. The firm's emphasis on \"personal and corporate involvement with the com-munity\" benefits such organizations as Habitat for Humanity, the Boys & Girls Clubs, YMCA, Connecticut FoodShare and the University of Hartford. Stevens himself, a board member of Watkinson School and the New Children's Mu-seum, also chairs the City of Hartford's Pension Commission. In 2011, \"after 75 years of tightly controlled private ownership, JCJ Architecture became a 100-percent employee-owned business. We still have a board of directors,\" Stevens says, \"but now we have 122 owners. It's very exciting to break ground on such a dynamic model.\" JCJ's Hartford Public Safety Complex design promotes \"community use and positive interaction between the police and the public,\" says the firm's president, Peter Stevens. What I learned at Albany gave me a certain insight into the built environment that was not part of traditional architectural training.22 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013Out and About By Christy Doyle, M.B.A.'04 Alumni Reception Photos: Marty Heitner UAlbany supporters gathered Oct. 17 for a reception at the Manhattan home of Deloitte Vice Chairman Jeffrey Black '76 and his wife, Lee Ann.

Winter Commencement Photos: Mark Schmidt For 167 years, graduates of UAlbany have been contributing to and succeeding across all fields of endeavor. At Winter Commencement ceremonies last Dec. 16, more than 1,000 graduates became a part of that proud tradition and joined a global network of more than 157,000 alumni. The graduating class earned 634 undergraduate degrees and 445 graduate degrees; studied a wide range of subjects and earned degrees in 50 different majors ranging from psychology, sociology, accounting and communication to business administration, history, economics and biology; hailed from 245 cities and towns across New York, as well as from California, Arizona, Utah, Oregon and other states; represented countries around the world, including China, Sweden, India and Sri Lanka; ranged in age from 20 to 59; and included 21 military veterans.24 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013 In 2011, after T ropical Storm Irene rolled across upstate New York, University at Albany Senior Academic Adviser and Educational Opportuni-ties Program (EOP) Counselor Clau-dio Gomez drove to severely flooded Schoharie County to see if his family needed help. By the time he arrived at their Middleburgh home, his mother and brother had already evacuated. Unable initially to locate them, Gomez feared they had been lost in the storm. He later learned they were safe. When Hurricane Sandy made landfall over New York City last fall, Gomez remembered his emotional response to the storm that had affected his family 14 months earlier. Determined to assist those impacted by the October 2012 superstorm, he launched Project Sandy at UAlbany. \"My initial idea,\" Gomez explained, \"was not only to bring relief to those individuals in need, but also to spark others to take action and create their own aid efforts.\" Gomez, a magna cum laude manage- ment/finance graduate who also earned a master's in liberal studies, marshaled volunteers and resources quickly. \"A big percentage of the student population was involved in Project Sandy. Every-one played a major role in this initia-tive,\" he observed. In November, Gomez and a group from UAlbany made one trip to Far Rockaway in conjunction with the Student Association, the Office of Student Involvement & Leadership, the Department of Residential Life, and various student organizations, deliver - ing a bus full of donated goods to make-shift shelters. At one, they witnessed people turned away because of limited space and an overabundance of certain items, such as clothing. The volunteers quickly refocused their efforts and handed out blankets, canned goods and baby formula to those in need. For a second trip to the area last December, \"we went with three buses,\" recounted Gomez, who came to the United States with his family 20 years ago from Colombia. \"During the winter break, [student] Umaru Barrie returned to Far Rockaway to do a cleanup initiative known as Project Helping Others to W Claudio Gomez, M.A.'09 By Greta Petry, M.A.'01UAlbany's volunteer contingent poses for a photo before departing campus. www.albany.edu 25 eather the Storm From page 24, left to right: A bus is loaded for the trip to New York; Claudio Gomez, in green jacket, and other UAlbany volunteers distribute neces- sities to Far Rockaway residents; Gomez take a break; Umaru Barrie is ready for Project Sandy 2.0, a cleanup effort organized during the winter break. Sandy 2.0. He told me the need is still there. It's sad to say, but people really think that, once you donate, everything will be fine. But the need will always be there. The rebuilding process is going to take a while.\" Gomez hopes that UAlbany students will \"create some type of [permanent] disaster-relief group on campus. We need a central location and an organization to address these types of issues.\" Ask Geoff By Geoff Williams , University Archivist 26 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013 Above left: The Psi Gamma house was located at 121 Lake Avenue in Albany. Above right: Newman Hall, opened on Elm Street, moved to 741 Madison Ave. by 1921. The building, which had its own chapel, would remain a home for Catholic women students until the mid-1960s.Home Sweet Home The first sororities and fraternities, established during the same time period, soon offered new housing options, renting or purchasing homes for the use of their members. Accord-ing to the 1921 Student Handbook, the Normal College had seven soror - ities, and six had houses. South Lake Avenue was one of the most popular housing locations, with at least 14 student homes located there from the 1920s through the '60s. Greek houses were also well represented along Madison Avenue and on Ontario, Quail and State streets. After World War II, Beta Zeta Sorority and the Potter Club both had large houses on State Street. By 1918, student housing was supplemented by Syddum Hall, a private residence originally at 390 Madison, and Newman Hall on Elm Street. The latter, which moved to 741 Madison in 1921, would remain a home for Catholic women students until the mid-1960s. Fraternities, sororities and private groups, however, couldn't provide adequate housing for the students - a fact Abram Brubacher, president of what was by then the New York State College for T eachers (NYSCT), recognized early on. After appealing unsuccessfully to the state to build dormitories, Brubacher turned to the Alumni Association in the 1920s. Graduates Anna E. Pierce, first dean of Women, and John Manville Sayles, who would succeed Brubacher as president, led the effort. Pierce wrote a guide advocating the instructional worth of dormitories in educating women students in values essential to future teachers and administrators. Supported primarily by modestly paid teachers who made pledges payable in $20 installments each Jan. 1 for five years, the fundraising endeavor raised $600,000. A dormitory for women opened in 1935; one for male students opened six years later. Both were constructed and owned by the Alumni Association and financed through its fundraising arm, the Be-nevolent Association. The residences were named in 1941: the women's for Pierce; the men's for Sayles. Since the 19th century, students have lived in a variety of housing while earning their degrees at UAlbany and its predeces- sor institutions. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, New York State Normal School and Normal College students were assigned housing approved by the principal/ president and the faculty. Most women boarded with families. Men, often three or four to a room, generally lived in rooming houses. www.albany.edu 27The buildings' interiors were splen- did. Public rooms featured striking moldings, woodwork and light-ing that evoked the atmosphere of English country homes. Like most student housing built before the 1990s, private rooms were Spartan, furnished with beds, desks, closet space and possibly an electrical outlet. Communal baths were located in hallways. In 1944, the New York State Dormi- tory Authority was created, and the first NYSCT-owned, state-funded dorm opened in 1951 on what is now Alumni Quadrangle. Ironically, it was named for Brubacher. With the Alumni Association's purchase of property at Alumni Quad came housing that served as cottage dormitories until it was demolished to make way for construction of residence halls. Enrollment reached 2,500 students by the late 1950s, and the Benevolent Association and the Faculty Student Association purchased or rented buildings near the site, transforming them all into cottage dorms. The Farrell Mansion, located on the west side of Thurlow T errace and a bequest to the school; the Cooper Mansion, which stood where the downtown campus parking lot is now located; and Van Derzee Hall at the corner of Sprague and Spring streets, were palatial. St. Mary's Park, a converted World War II barracks across Partridge Street, provided more modest accommodations. In 1960, then-Gov. Nelson Rock- efeller decided that, owing to the excellence of its undergraduate teach-ing and master's programs, NYSCT would be designated one of four State University of New York University Centers. By 1970, 10,000 students were enrolled at Albany, and the purchase and rental of dorms around what would become the downtown campus continued. In the Fall 2013 UAlbany, \"Ask Geoff\" will examine student housing at the University during the past 50 years. A 14-year fundraising campaign financed the construc- tion of Pierce Hall for women and a men's residence later known as Sayles Hall. Pierce Hall, above, opened in 1935, during the Great Depression.Sayles Hall, a men's residence, opened in 1941, just before the United States entered World War II. The dining room at Pierce Hall featured beautiful woodwork and lighting. Men and women students dressed for dinner - at least on the weekends. Here, Sayles Hall residents await dinner, which will be served in the adjacent dining room. 38 Florence Levinson has moved to be near her family.

Ursula Neuhaus Schiff, who lives in Sarasota, Fla., keeps busy with volunteer work, going to the theater, taking courses and tending to her husband in a skilled nursing facility. Occasionally, she dines with Dick Foster. In September, Ursula, when visiting her two sons and five grandchildren in the San Francisco area, had a very bad experience with the flight and states that she will never fly again. She also went on a cruise with a friend to the Caribbean in December. Jerry Reisner reports that his youngest granddaughter graduated from college and passed her CPA exams. Bobbi Houck VanTilburg and husband Gerry are now proud great-grandparents. Hurricane Sandy left the VanTilburg home with a power outage for eight days. After the third night, they went to the Recreation Barn, where there was warmth and food. Bobbi said the only damage done was a ruined microwave oven due to the power surge. Horty Zeilengold Schmierer, whose permanent home is Malverne, Long Island, experienced a 12-day power outage due to Hurricane Sandy. However, she was vacationing in Hawaii when the storm hit, so she lucked out. There were plenty of fallen trees in the area but no damage to her house. In October in Cape May, N.J., Joe Zanchelli and Joyce experienced a very interesting Road Scholar program concentrating on the Victorian era. Luckily, the program occurred two weeks before Hurricane Sandy demolished much of the area. One of the gratifying highlights of the program was getting together with Ben Jackson '50 and Dave Jack '50 and their spouses. Ben, Dave and Joe were fraternity brothers, and Ben was best man at the Zanchelli wedding in 1951. Congratulations go to Dick Zeller, who in the fall of 2012 was recognized by his local historical society and at the county level for his many years of outstanding leadership and service. Dick has served as a trustee for many years and was a founding member of the group 49 years ago. Dick ended his note by stating: \"I celebrated my 88th birthday on Oct. 18. I'm blessed with excellent health, which permits me to lead a pretty good life doing pretty much what I want to do and going where I want!\" Our reunion planning committee is again ready to roll. A survey letter will be mailed to each class member in the spring of 2013 (it may already have arrived) to ascertain if there is sufficient interest in attending our 65th graduation anniversary in 2014. Horty Zeilengold Schmierer tells me that she hopes there is one because she's already looking forward to it! If any of you would like to contact a classmate, but do not have an address or a phone number, please let me know by telephone at (518) 587-4581. Thanks again for being such cooperative classmates. Class notes councilor: Joe Zanchelli, jjzanch@yahoo.com 50 A note from your class councilor: Basil Karpiak recently was photographed with his neighbor, former New York Governor Elliot Spitzer. Joyce Dubert Everingham moved for the 12th time and came across memorabilia, including a copy of State College News from October 1947. The front page had news of the election of Rhoda Riber as class treasurer and Audrey Koch as class song leader. There also was a copy of the words and music to College of the Empire State. Audrey Koch recently paid a visit to her co-councilor Harold (Sparky) Vaughn in Queensbury, which was a rare and special treat. A native of South Glens Falls, Sparky began his teaching at the high school there along with his mother, Isabel Winch Vaughn, a graduate of NYSCT. He was in town for the South Glens Falls Hall of Fame ceremon y honoring his grandfather, Oliver Winch. While in the area, Harold had the opportunity to Alumni News & Notes More than 75 football alumni returned to UAlbany for a Homecoming weekend reunion and cheered on our Great Danes at the Homecoming football game. visit Tom Yole '51, who has earned a significant place in the education field in his hometown, nearby Hudson Falls. Class notes councilor: Audrey Koch Feathers, akochfeathers@roadrunner.com 52 A note from your class councilor: Our 60th reunion, Sept. 7-9, 2012, was a rousing success, with 31 '52-ers registered for the Sept. 8 dinner held at the Treviso Restaurant. We started the weekend Friday evening with a \"meet and greet\" at the Sovereign Hotel. It's always such fun to renew acquaintances and especially to greet those people who have come from afar, such as Jack Smithler, who came from Prescott, Ariz.; Jean Faville Smith from Cocoa Beach, Fla.; Al Stephenson from Ganfield Heights, Ohio; John Bowker from Coral Gables, Fla.; and Helen Pilcher Terrill from Midlothian, Va. Saturday morning, most of us were shuttled to the campus we know as \"home,\" where we were given a tour. What changes there are to our old campus! There were several of us who opted for a guided tour of the Albany Institute of History and Art instead, and then everyone met at Husted Hall for lunch. The afternoon had us on the bus for an interesting tour of the uptown campus and then an eye- opening tour of the up-to-date cancer research center on the East Campus. Innovative work is being done there, and we will be hearing more about the results of that research. Saturday evening, we gathered at the Treviso Restaurant for a delicious meal, good fellowship, happy reminiscing and class news. Our weekend ended Sunday; after breakfast with UAlbany President George Philip, we bid our classmates a fond farewell until next time. Anyone who attended will tell you it was a time not to be missed. Anyone interested in a 62nd or 63rd? A nice, long phone call from Shirley Feinstein Rosenbaum, who still lives in West Virginia, brought us up to date on her busy life. Shirley plays the violin in a community-based orchestra; her son is a member, as well. She also participates in a strong quartet workshop, has a portfolio in public relations, and continues to substitute teach. Now there is one active lady! Bill Wiley was so sorry to miss the reunion. He and Jane had planned to attend, but both suf fered some last-minute health issues and decided prudence dictated remaining in Hilton Head. You were missed, Bill, but we will hold you to your promise of attending our next reunion. Some bad news from Don Putterman: While visiting during Thanksgiving weekend, Don missed a couple of steps, landed face first on a hardwood floor, and suffered two fractured vertebrae. He had to wear a cervical collar for six weeks. Quick healing to you, Don. He says he still owes Ken Wooster a visit. Nice emails from both Eleanor Roth and her husband Bernard, who reported in more detail on their life together since they married in 1951. Eleanor states that she and Bernard did a great deal of traveling due to his work; they spent a year in Singapore and some time in Australia. She wrote articles about most of the places they either lived in or visited. This talent has manifested itself into the authorship of novels. Eleanor's novel, Rainbow Dust, which has received good reviews, is now available for Barnes & Noble's Nook and available on Amazon. She's busy at work on another novel and hopes for publication in the near future. Recently, one of Eleanor's articles was included in the anthology A Cup of Comfort for a Better World. She tries to keep up with friends from NYSCT, including Millie Uchima, now Nakasone, who returned to Hawaii after graduating. Jane Minckler Jennings looked forward to Thanksgiving, when there would be 21 guests - all family - at dinner. Her grandson and his wife have made it their project. At the end of February, Jane, her daughter and son- in-law spent a week with her niece in Tucson. Helen Pilcher Terrill reports the happy news that she will be a great-grandma two more times this spring. She spent Thanksgiving with her Ohio family and Christmas with her Tennessee family. Helen's son Ed, from Ohio, escorted her to the reunion, and not only did she enjoy having him there, but so did we! Let's get more sons and daughters to join us for our next reunion. Anna Morrissey Karpiak attended the reunion and reported that she is still volunteering at Hospice and is a Eucharistic minister at her church. She spent the fall of 2011 in Madrid, Spain, polishing up her Spanish. Anna lives on Long Island and was severely impacted by Superstorm Sandy; she was, however, most grateful to those who came from near and far to help. Anna said that Texas utilities companies repaired her block, and utility workers from Colorado did her friend's. A quick note from Vickie Eddy informs us that she planned to return to Yuma, Ariz., this winter, though she spent last winter at her home in Olean, N.Y. Tom Holman had kind words to say about the reunion. \"It was a great weekend with a nice balance of sightseeing the campuses and time for catching up with dear friends. What can I say - '52 still rocks. Bet we could still put on a show!\" Thankfully, Tom escaped the wrath of Sandy; he happened to be in places where the hurricane was not. He ends his email, \"So with the holidays approaching, we have much to be thankful for.\" Margaret Gemmell Delea would love to hear from anyone who remembers her (her address and email are in the directory you received last summer). She reports that she is still on Long Island and had her daughter visiting from Oregon to help out, as Margaret had some medical problems. Jean Faville Smith and Smitty are still cruising, having just returned from Amsterdam to Copenhagen, then to Scotland. They made not one, but two trips north - one to the reunion and one to Burlington, Vt., for the wedding of a friend's daughter. Joe Persico has yet another book coming out shortly.

Jeanne Seymour Earle had planned to attend the reunion, but Lyme disease laid her low at the last minute. We missed you, Jeanne.

Baker - who, as both student and professor, main- tained a longtime affiliation with the New York State College for T eachers (NYSCT) and the University at Albany - passed away June 23, 2012, in St. Petersburg, Fla. He was 101. As a transfer student from Ohio, Baker majored in social studies at NYSCT. After completing master's studies at Co- lumbia University and earning a doctorate from Johns Hop-kins, he joined the NYSCT faculty and taught social studies from 1939 until retiring in 1968. In an interview for UAlbany magazine (Spring 2009, \"Seventy Years With UAlbany\"), Baker recalled that \"two-year interruptions for World War II military service and for academic study\" accounted for the only time he spent away from his teaching duties during those three decades. Throughout his career, Baker was a favorite among students who enrolled in his American Government, American Parties and Politics, Constitutional Law, and State and Local Govern- ment in New York courses. He was also well known for his 1941 book The National Bituminous Coal Commission Administration of the Bituminous Coal Act. With his wife of 74 years, who passed away in 2008, Baker established a bequest to support the Ralph H. and Dora W . Baker Scholarship Fund in Political Science. The fund will benefit full-time undergraduate political science majors. Survivors include a son, Ronald Baker.

Trinci, Data Manager, Development Division, 1991-2012, Aug. 22, 201248 UAlbany Magazine Spring 2013Last Look Some Interfaith Center visitors seek out the new meditation and prayer room, which contains Baha'i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish and Muslim texts and sacred objects. Others celebrate special occasions at the center; a bar mitzvah and a wedding were held there in 2012. Timothy Furgal, B.A.'07, reconnected with Roman Catholicism there last summer. Then a graduate student \"trying to find a quiet place to medi- tate,\" he \"wandered into The Interfaith Center.\" Soon, \"I started to invest myself in my faith again,\" said Furgal, who earned a degree in English. \"The Interfaith Center has strength- ened my convictions and helped me gain confidence. Donna [Crisafulli, Interfaith Center executive director]; [Catholic Campus Minister] Cathy [Reid]; and the center have provided me so much this past year. I can only hope to do as much for them someday.\" While majoring in globalization stud-ies, Samantha Leuschner, B.A.'12, initially resisted joining a campus faith group. At the invitation of Nicole Lopez, B.A.'09, M.S.'11, whom she would succeed as Newman Association president, she began attending Mass at The Interfaith Center, which became \"my home away from home.\" The center also broadened Leus- chner's \"knowledge and experience\" of other religions. She participated in Ra-madan observances, Faith Sharing talks and the Unity Dinner. Helping Crisafulli to create the center's meditation and prayer room - a \"joyous and exciting\" experience - underscored Leuschner's conviction that \"there is something special about The Interfaith Center.\" Senior biology major Kamilla Hussein, who sometimes visits the cen- ter to pray and read the Qur'an, agrees. The Muslim Students Association (MSA) president appreciates the \"sense of peace and unity that emanates from The Interfaith Center and brings us together with people from all different backgrounds.\" Through \"fast-a-thons,\" members of other faiths \"fast and break the fast with us.\" A Faith Sharing program featured \"our faculty adviser, Sohaib Chekima of Languages, Litera-tures and Cultures, who spoke about his journey to Islam.\" Events such as the upcoming Muslim-Jewish Peace Walk also \"celebrate religious tolerance,\" Hussein observed. The Albany Collegiate Interfaith Center was incorporated in 1966 \"to provide a space for students, faculty and staff to nurture and/or discover their own spirituality and to come together to explore and learn about other faith traditions,\" said Crisafulli. Students also gather at the center to plan pro- grams that assist others and to socialize. With The Interfaith Center's 50th an- niversary approaching, Crisafulli hopes to be able to add staff and program- ming. Renovations to the kosher and non-kosher kitchens, technology and lighting improvements, and library materials are also on her wish list. Groups on and off campus may rent Interfaith Center space for various events. A sliding scale of charges applies, with priority scheduling accorded UAlbany students, faculty and staff.
