Most cumulative fields will be automatically populated after the current data field is complete. 2. Former allopathic and osteopathic HPSL loans are now part of the PCL program and as such, grantees must complete PCL AOR's. However some questions request the separation of former allopathic and osteopathic HPSL data from the data regarding PCL loans with service requirements. Unless otherwise noted, PCL program data should include both former allopathic and osteopathic HPSL and service required PCL program data. 3. If loans have ever been disbursed to students, they must be reported on your Borrower Accounts Worksheet; therefore, your report will not be considered complete if Page 6 of the report contains all zeros. 4. Before submitting the AOR you will be asked if you would like to be considered for additional funds. Only check the box if you are requesting additional funds. 5.

ITEM A Federal Funds Awarded This field is system generated and the amount is equal to the amount shown on the Notice of Award for the current year. ITEM B Cash Balance - Start of Report Period The amount should be the same as the ending cash balance on the prior AOR. If it is not, please contact the Project Officer for the program for the process to make an adjustment. ITEM C1 Federal Funds Received/Receivable This amount should be the cumulative net funds received that is equal to the total funds drawn each year from Payment Management System (PMS) minus any same year returns of funds to PMS. NOTE 1: The return of any current year fund receipts (against the current year award) should be made through the Payment Management System (PMS). NOTE 2: Money should be drawn down from PMS in whole dollars only. This amount includes the funds drawn against the current year award minus any returns and/or funds requested through PMS not received by June 30. Loans - Annual Operating Report (AOR) AOR Guidance for Grantees Page 22 of 39 ITEM C2 Institutional Contributions Deposited This amount should be the current amount of institutional contribution deposited. The cumulative amount must equal at least one-ninth of the cumulative FCC Funds received (Item C.1) plus any cumulative transfers from scholarships (item C.3) and less cumulative transfer to scholarships (Item D.2). If an institution has exceeded its one-ninth requirement in a prior period and wishes to withdraw some or all of the monies (providing the withdrawal does not result in a negative cash balance), report the withdrawal as a negative amount in the current year column. DO NOT show the withdrawal of excess institutional contributions as a \"Repayment to Institution.\" ITEM C.3 Transferred from Scholarship Fund This number remains constant. A cumulative total in this field was from funds added from the Scholarship Fund which no longer exists. However, this number is included when calculating institutional contributions ITEM C.4 Load Principal Collected This amount should be the current amount of loan principal collected from borrowers or purchased by the institution. ITEM C.5 Interest Income Collected on Loans This amount should be the current amount of interest on loan principal collected from borrowers or purchased by the institution. ITEM C.6 Penalty Charges Collected on Loans This amount should be the current amount of penalty charges collected from borrowers for late scheduled payment. The HPSL and NSL legislative amendments require that for NSL notes/disbursements signed on or after October 1, 1985, and for HPSL notes/disbursements signed on or after October 22, 1985, borrowers must be charged a late fee, not to exceed six percent on loans more than 60 days past due. See Policy Memorandum Number Ten (December 24, 1986) for additional information. ITEM C.7 Investment Income Policy Memorandum Number 6 (May 1984) states: When there is an unavoidable delay between the time a school receives HPSL and NSL Federal Capital Contributions or collections and the time new HPSL and NSL awards are disbursed, the school must place the funds on hand in an insured interest -bearing account, and must deposit all interest earned in the HPSL and NSL funds. A school that has not placed its investment income in the HPSL or NSL fund will be subject to an audit exception, and will be required to reimburse the HPSL or NSL fund out of institutional money for the amount of investment income that the school should have deposited in the HPSL or NSL fund in the past. All schools must assure that invest ment income is being properly handled in addition to the requirement of section 740 (b)(2)(e) of the HPSL statute and section 835 (h)(2)(e) of the NSL statute that any earnings of the fund be deposited in the fund, this money can be an importance source of additional funds for lending to students. Report the current amount of earnings on program Funds deposited in any type of interest- bearing account. You may not enter a negative number here. Loans - Annual Operating Report (AOR) AOR Guidance for Grantees Page 23 of 39 ITEMS C.8, C.9, & C.10 Institutional Repayments of Bad Debts, Principal, interest, and Penalty Charges This amount should be the current amount of the institution's repayment of principal, interest, and penalty charges on bad debt write -offs requests that were denied Institutions have the ultimate responsibility for bad debt losses not approved for write -off by the Division of Health Careers and Financial Support (DHCFS) /Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW). There is nothing to prevent an institution from further pursuing the collection of a bad debt after it has been disapproved for write -off by DHCFS; any amounts recovered would lessen the institution's liability. ITEMS D1 Loaned to Students Report the c urrent amount of funds loaned to students. For the current amount of funds loaned to students in Item D.1. please report the number of loans awarded on page 1a Item 1.A-1 ITEMS D2 Transferred to Scholarship Fund This number remains constant. A cumulative total in this field was from funds transferred to the scholarship fund which no longer exists. However, this number is included when calculating institutional contributions. ITEMS D3, D4, & D5 Repayments to Federal Government, Principal, Interest and Other Income This amount should be the current amounts of this program 's principal, interest and other income repaid to the Federal Government. An example of Repayments to Federal Government is excess cash returned to the Division of Financial Operations. DO NOT include amounts returned to PMS because those amounts should be adjusted against Federal Funds Received within the appropriate award period. Payment made last year for the PCL assessment should be reported on Page 2 - Program Accounts Section in Part D - Cash Disbursements Lines 3-5 - Repayments to Federal Government. In order to report your assessment in the three lines of the AOR (i.e., principal, interest, and penalty charges), apply the 30% assessment amount to the items defined as income (shown on your assessment notice) and report them in the appropriate sections. For purposes of reporting, the amounts determined for penalty charges and investment income may be combined and reported as other income. In addition, the school should repayitself the proportionate share of institutional matching funds (1/9) associated with the amount of funds returned for PCL. These amounts would be broken down the same way as Repayments to Federal Government, but reported on Lines 6-8 - Repayments to Institution, Principal, Interest, and Other Income. Please refer to the Student Financial Aid Guidelines for further information. If you have any questions on your school's compliance, refer to Appendix A for contact information. NOTE: Make check payable to DHHS Public Health Service and enclose a letter with the following information: o Name of i nstitution (including discipline) o Type and purpose of program funds being remitted (e.g., Federal Capital Contribution - HPSL program, remittance of student loan collections) o The core Grant number (Box 4b on the Notice of Award) Loans - Annual Operating Report (AOR) AOR Guidance for Grantees Page 24 of 39 Send your remittance and letter using the Mailing Address Guidelines in Appendix B of the User Guide. ITEM D.6 Repayments to Institution, Principal This amount should be the current amount of principal collected on student loans repaid to the institution. ITEM D.7 Repayments to Institution, Interest This amount should be the current amount of interest collected on student loans repaid to the institution. ITEM D.8 Repayments to Institution, Other Income This amount should be the current amount of other income collected from student loans repaid to the institution. ITEMS D9, D10, D11, and D12 Collection Agent Costs, Principal and Interest Litigation Costs, Principal and Interest This amount should be the current amount of allowable internal or external collection agent costs (prorated proportionately to the amount of principal and interest collected) charged to the Fund. This amount should be the current amount of litigation costs (prorated proportionately to the amount of principal and interest collected) charged to the Fund. These costs do NOT include expenses incurred in sending the final demand letters on attorneys' letterhead. The cost associated with collecting the full amount of principal and interest (Items C4 and C5) must be prorated and reported in Items D9 and D10. Litigation costs associated with the collection of a loan must be prorated in the same manner as collection costs and reported in Items D11 and D12. This method of reporting is required even if the collection agency and/or attorney remit only the net amount (collections less collection or litigation costs) to the institution. If the institution is able to get the borrower to pay the collection costs or the litigation costs, the costs are not charged to the fund. Note: An example of a repayment to Institution would be the institution's proportionate share of excess cash in the Fund balance that has been repaid to the institution. DO NOT show withdrawal of Funds as a result of excess institutional contributions in this item. (See note on item C.2.) Note: This item is in reference any amounts in Items C.6, C.7, and C.10 that were repaid in the institution's 1/9 portion in conjunction with a repayment to the Federal Government. Loans - Annual Operating Report (AOR) AOR Guidance for Grantees Page 25 of 39 EXAMPLES OF PRORATING COLLECTION COSTS (Litigation Costs to Be Prorated in Same Manner) An institution directs a collection agency to collect $1,000.00 principal and $200.00 interest for a total of $1,200.00 from a delinquent borrower. The collection agencycollects all $1,200.00 but deducts $360.00, or 30% of the amount collected, before remitting the net amount of $840.00 to the institution. The institution reports as follows: Loan Principal Collected $1,000.00 Interest Income Collected 200.00 Collection Costs, Principal (30% x $1,000) 300.00 Collection Costs, Interest (30% x $200) 60.00 An institution directs a collection agency to collect $1,500.00 principal and $500.00 interest for a total of $2,000.00 from a delinquent borrower. At the end of the report period, the collection agency has collected $1,600.00 (80% of $2,000.00), which it remits to the institution with a bill for $480.00 (30% of the $1,600.00 collected). The institution pays the collection agency $480.00 taken from the Fund and reports as follows: Loan Principal Collected (80% of the $1,500) $1,200.00 Interest Income Collected (80% 400.00 Collection Principal (30% Interest (30% of $400) 120.00 ITEM D13 Credit Bureau Fees This number should be the current amount of credit bureau agency fees charged to the Fund ITEM D14 Other costs This amount should be the amount of other costs charged to the fund (i.e., overpayments and underpayments of $10.00 or less). Note: Refer to Policy Memorandum Number Nine (May 16, 1986) for an explanation of allowable collection costs. Collection costs may be charged to the HPSL/NSL Fund without requesting prior written permission from the Bureau of Health Professions, Division of Student Loans and Scholarships as long as your school is following sound due diligence procedures. If the Bureau finds that a school is charging collection costs to the Fund without having exercised due diligence, the school will be required to reimburse the Fund for those charges. Report the current amount of allowable internal or external collection agent costs (prorated proportionately to the amount of principal and interest collected) charged to the Fund. Report the current amount of litigation costs (prorated proportionately to the amount of principal and interest collected) charged to the Fund. These costs do NOT include expenses incurred in sending the final demand letters on attorneys' letterhead. Loans - Annual Operating Report (AOR) AOR Guidance for Grantees Page 26 of 39 ITEM E.

Loans - Annual Operating Report (AOR) AOR Guidance for Grantees Page 35 of 39 1.6 Borrower Accounts Worksheet (Report Page 6) In completing this section, you must use the status of all borrower accounts as of the end of this reporting period \u2014 not just the accounts that changed status during this reporting period. The total number of borrowers reported on Page 6 should never be lower than the number on the prior year's report. Borrowers who have renegotiated their repayment schedules are to be included in the \"current\" category provided they are making their renegotiated payments on time. Any borrower whose repayment becomes more than 60 days past due must be placed on a monthly repayment schedule and assessed a penalty charge. A borrower in default who has made sporadic payments must remain in the default category even though the borrower has received more than one loan, the borrower must be counted only once in Column 1. If a borrower has more than one loan, the borrower must be categorized according to the longest overdue loan. Regardless of which category the borrower is placed in, the school must show the dollar amounts for each loan according to the actual status of the loan. Within the same loan, if there are payments overdue in different time frames, report that loan according to the longest overdue payment. Schools should report the TOTAL OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE (as defined below) in default when State law permits them to enforce the acceleration clause in a BHW/BHPr -approved promissory note and demand for the entire balance has been made. If some of the borrower's promissory notes contain an acceleration clause, and some do not, determine the past due under each type of promissory note separately and report the sum of those amounts as determined from the individual notes. TOTAL OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE equals the sum of the borrower's original amounts of all loans (Column 2) minus any amounts that have been repaid (Column 3) and minus any amounts that have been cancelled for employment/professional practice(Column 4). Columns: Number Description of Required Information Number of Borrowers Under this program - The number of borrowers who received loans.

This figure represents the recalculation of the interest on the loan back to date of disbursement and should not be decreased by amounts paid against the interest capitalized. (This figure should also be included in columns 3 through 8 as appropriate.)
