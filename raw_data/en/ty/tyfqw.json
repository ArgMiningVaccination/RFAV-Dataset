This guide should be used in conjunction with the Welcome to Alberta document and Planning to Work in Canada workbook . These documents can be accessed through the following links: Overall, t he information in this guide will enhance your understanding of the people, culture and customs found in rural Alberta. Canada Canada is the second largest country in the world . It is made up of ten provinces and three northern territories. The countrys population is over 33 million. Aboriginal people make up just under 5% of Canadas population and include First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit. First Nations are the first peoples of Canada and include over 600 recognized bands throughout the country. M\u00e9tis are of mixed ancestry (First Nations originally partnered with French and Scottish settlers) and live in various parts of Canada . Inuit are the Aboriginal peoples of Arctic Canada, the most northern part of the country. Welcome to Alberta: Information for Newcomers: http://www.alis.gov.ab.ca/pdf/cshop/WelcomeToAlberta/WelcomeToAlberta.pdf Planning to work in Canada? An essential workbook for newcomers: http://www.credentials.gc.ca/immigrants/workbook/workbook.pdf 2 Canadian women have one of the highest labour force participation rates in the world, only a few percentage po ints less than men . Women hold leadership positions in the workforce and in government. English and French are the official languages of Canada but more people speak English than French. There are pockets of French speaking Canadians found across the country . Canada is home to people from more than 200 countries throughout the world. Core Canadian values include a fair and equal treatment of all people without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or ment al or physical disability (The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , 1982 ). The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms speaks to what Canadians believe and how they live in Canada. Canadian laws reflect this Charter. To learn about your rights, du ties and freedoms in Canada, visit http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/newcomers/before -rights.asp To learn about laws that you should be aware of as a newcomer to Canada and which may be di fferent than the country you are coming from, refer to www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/guide/section -08.asp Rural Alberta Alberta is a large province located in Western Canada with a small population relative to its size. There are differences in landscape, climate, population, industry, language and services available - all depending on where you live. For the most part, English or French wil l be the primary language spoken. The province measures more than 640,000 square kilometres in size and currently has a po pulation of over 3.5 million . 3 When Alberta first became a province, farming was the livelihood for the majority of people . There was a spirit of coo peration among Albertan farmers. The early 1900s saw the rapid development of cooperatives to support the marketing of farm products. The influence and impact of the cooperative movement can still be seen in Alberta today. Albertas economy continues to thrive on its expanding technology, manufacturing and services sectors. The following sectors account for two -thirds of Albertas total economic output. Information, Communications & Technology (ICT) Industrial & Consumer Produc ts Agriculture Energy ( Oil and Gas) Forest Products Tourism Historically, Alberta's immigrants came from European countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and Ukraine. In recent years there has been a shift and there are now more immigrants coming from countries such as India, China and the Philippines. Northwest Alberta has a lot of oil and gas development projects underway. Forest ry activities are common in north and western parts of Alberta. Northeast Alberta has major developments taking place in the Oil Sands. Central Alberta has a lot of grain and cattle farming, while ranching on large tracks of land occurs in southern Albert a. 4 Communities in rural Alberta will range in population size from a few hundred people to a few thousand. Some are more remote than others, largely operat ing as self-contained communit ies. In rural Alberta it is common to own all terrain vehicles (ATVs) such as quads, snowmobiles and motorized dirt bikes. These vehicles are mainly used for recreational purposes . Safety is very important and it is against the law for y outh under the age of 14 to operate these vehicles on public property (although many young people use ATVs on their familys property). There are numerous religio us beliefs in rural Alberta . However , corresponding places of worship are not necessarily found in every rural community. To date , churches have been the most common place of worship. There is an increase in other religious places of worship as more people of different faiths settle in rural Alberta . For example, the number of mosques and synagogu es found in rural Alberta has risen over the past ten years. Despite a majority Caucasian population, there are other cultures that have a strong presence throughout rural Alberta. The province is home to Aboriginal Peoples, Francophone Albertans, Hutter ites and Mennonites. Living in rural Alberta, you are likely to see people from one or more of these distinctly different cultures. Below is a description of some of the characteristics associated with each of these cultures. It is important to note that n ot everyone in each of these groups is the same. There are individual differences within any group, and so the information in this manual is based on generalizations . Some Facts: Alberta became a province in 1905 52% of Albertans live in one of the two major cities - Calgary and Edmonton 25% of Albertans live in communities acros s the province which have a population of less than 10,000 The majority of people living in Alberta are Caucasian The majority of people living in Alberta speak English as their firs t language (t here are small pockets of communities across the province wh ere people speak other languages ) Immigration to Alberta has increase d substantially in recent years. Currently, m ore than 20% of Albertas populat ion was born outside of Canada 5 Aboriginal Peoples Six per cent of Albertas population is Aboriginal people (First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit ). This is slightly greater than the percentage found nationally. 44 First Nations groups (almost 100,000 people) live mainly on reserves throughout the province. More than 85,000 M\u00e9tis live mainly on M\u00e9tis settlements in nor th and north -central parts of the province. A strong bond and sense of loyalty within the community is very important in many Aboriginal groups. This is demonstrated in several behaviours and across many situations. Below are some of the characteristics that tend to be associated with Aboriginal Peoples in Alberta. It is common for Aboriginal Peoples to... Have extended families with many members living in the same household Have representatives speak on behalf of Elders Explain things through story-telling Have many people come to meetings and appointments Arrive past the scheduled time to meetings and appointments Have many people involved in the decision making process Place a strong emphasis on non-verbal communication Not show a lot of outward emotion (This should not be perceived as un -expressive or impolite. It is simply a cultural difference around how people show respect and consideration) Not maintain eye contact (A sign of respect) Leave long gaps of silence in conversations Have spiritual beliefs based on the natural world and partake in various rituals Metis First Nation s 6 Acadian people are descendants of French colonists who settled in the Maritime Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and parts of Quebec in the early seventeenth century. Acadia was a distinct and separate region from Quebec, which led to the development of separate histories and cultures. Today, most Acadians and Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois are Francophone Canadians Francophone Albertans (Franco -Albertans) There are several French speaking communities spread throughout the province of Alberta. You can see where these communities are locat ed by viewing the corresponding map. French speaking people that live in Alberta are referred to as Franco -Albertans Their roots are mostly European, Quebecois and Acadian (although some have their roots in other parts of Canada) Below are some of the characteristics that tend to be associated with Francophone Albertans. It is common for Francophone Albertans to... Speak French in their daily interactions at work and in the community Attend French speaking schools Use a lot of ha nd gestures and expressive body language Be more animated and charismatic in their emotions Be more physically affectionate Be more direct in their communication style 7 Hutterites and Mennonites Hutterites and Mennonites originated in East and Central Europe, and made their way to Alberta during World War I. There are several Hutterite and Mennonite communities spread throughout the province. Hutterites live in self -contained colonies throughout rural Alberta. They operate as an independent community and construct their own buildings, make their own clothes and have their own schools Hutterite colonies are typically found in Central and South -eastern Alberta Most Mennonite communities are located in southern Alberta Unlike the Hutterites, Mennonites h old private properties Farming is the main source of livelihood and income for both groups Both groups live a conservative and simple lifestyle, however more Mennonites have adopted Western customs than Hutterites Both groups are very religious (Anabaptist ) and regularly attend church It is common for Hutterites to... Speak a form of German language known as Hutterite German or Hutterisch Dress in distinct clothing that is conservative in style (For example you will see women wearing vests, pleated skirts and dark coloured headscarves ) Separate themselves from mainstream Canadian (and Albertan) culture It is common for Mennonites to... Dress like other Albertans, althou gh in a more conservative style Integrate themselves into mainstream Canadian (and Albertan) culture Speak English as their first language The information in the next section highlights aspects of life in rural Alberta that will help you and your family se ttle in your new environment. 8 GETTING SETTLED There is a good chance you will have already been in contact with someone from the community where you will be residing. This person may be part of a local Rural Alberta Physician Recruitment and Retention (R&R) committee or a member of the medical practice you are joining. The se individuals will be valuable resource s both before and after you arrive. Housing It is common to have assistance with finding temporary accommodation and transportation prior to ar rival. If this has not been arranged, you can request information on housing options from the local R&R committee as well as fellow medical practitioners. Transportation Alberta has 2 international airports - one located in Calgary, the other in Ed monton. Several s mall communities in rural Alberta have limited access to public transportation. As a result most people own a vehicle. There are car dealerships in the majority of rural communities for people to purchase a new or used vehicle. Larger com munities will have access to urban centres and neighbouring communities through a bus service company called Greyhound. For more information about the Alberta Rural Physician Action Plan, or to contact one of their consultants for support, visit http://www.rpap.ab.ca/ To see if there is a bus service to and from your community, visit the Greyhound Canada website at www.greyhound.ca/home/ 9 Countries with reciprocal licensing agreements include: Austria Belgium England France Germany Japan Other transp ortation services often found in rural communities include privately owned taxi services, and a \"handi -van\" to transport seniors and people with special needs who cannot drive. Upon arrival you can request information about these and other local transporta tion options. When driving in rural Alberta in the winter, there are a few things worth considering: Have a snow scraper, a snowbrush and a small shovel in your vehicle Consider using w inter snow tires to minimize the possibility of becoming stuck in the snow or sliding on icy roads. Ensure that a block heater has been installed in your vehicle in order to plug in your vehicle on cold nights. Carry a blanket, a candle and lighter or matc hes in your vehicle to keep you warm if your vehicle breaks down during cold weather. Note: Alberta Motor Association (AMA) offers their members roadside assistance. To find out more about these and other AMA services, check: www.ama.ab.ca For more information on transportation options refer to the Important Things to Do and Know section of the Welcome to Alberta document. For more information on countries with reciprocal licensing agreements and how to get your Alberta drivers license, visit : http://www.servicealberta.ca/Drivers_Motor Vehicles.cfm Republic of Korea Scotland Switzerland United States Wales 10 An excellent resource to find out what your community has to offer is http://www.AlbertaFirst.com Every Alberta community has a profile that describes town services, upcoming events, and sports and recreational activities. For needs that your community may not be able to meet, you can likely find them in a neighbouring community. You can also seek informati on and referrals from your local Family and Community Support Services (FCSS) office, the local library and/or town administration. Financial Institutions come in different forms. They include traditional banks as well as credit unions (which are membership owned)Shopping and Community Services Stores in rural Alberta will carry the same items found in larger centres. The only difference is that you may have a more limited selection to choose from. For example, if the grocery store doesn t carry your favourite spice or the butcher doesnt have your preferred choice of meat, you can ask if it can be ordered. Local store owners are very willing to help you get what you are looking for. Standard services found in most rural communiti es include: Independent and Cooperatively owned grocery stores Financial service institutions Bakery Convenience store Gas station Hardware store Clothing store Hair dresser Library Liquor store Restaurants Hotel, Motel or Bed and Breakfast Sport s and Re creation centre Places of worship Schools Hospitals and doctors offices Ambulance services Police and Fire services Most local businesses are open during the day Monday to Friday. Some are open on Saturday and most are closed on Sunday. Gas stations an d convenience stores are typically open extended hours ; however , products available there are limited and may be sold for higher prices. 11 You can ask your community library for books in you r first language and/or books of particular interest to you. You can order exotic spices through your local grocer. People may also operate a business from their home which offers additional services to the community . They may advertis e their business locally through the community newspaper, on community bulletin boards or by word of mouth. Examples of such businesses include child care, housekeeping, catering, home and car repairs, yard maintenance, tutoring, music lessons , and sewing or tailoring. Schools Almost all children in rural Alberta attend the publicly funded school system. Public education meets the provincial government education requirements and is the prominent system in Al berta. It provides high quality education for al l children. Catholic, Francophone and/or Charter schools can also be found in many rural Alberta communities. They are also part of the public school system. In addition, some communities may have privately funded schools, such as independent Christian sch ools. People may choose to send their children to private schools for a number of personal reasons including religious ones. Children living in Alberta must attend scho ol from ages 6 to 16. All children have access to the school system from grade one thro ugh grade twelve. Rural Alberta schools tend to be small in size and have fewer students than schools found in larger centres . Children living in rural towns normally walk to school or ride the bus . Those living outside the town are brought in to school by school bus at no cost . If a community does not have a high school, the school makes sure that children are transported daily by bus (at no cost) to and from the neighbouring community to attend high school. Rural Alberta schools include core courses such as English, math, science , history and social studies. Learning a second language is also a mandatory part of the curriculum. Also included are courses such as visual arts, music, drama, physical education, and career and technology studies. Th ese latter courses may be differen t from the courses taught at schools in your home country. These subjects are important in developing your childs skills in social interactions and communication. It is important to note that in rural Alberta, one school is not bett er than another when considering the required school subjects. 12 Parent -Teacher interviews are scheduled at times throughout the year to discuss your child's progress at school. Of course parents do not have to wait for a scheduled interview to speak to their child's teacher. They may do so whenever there is an issue. Public health care provides immunizations for childhood diseases at all schools on a voluntary basis. Parents are encouraged to be involved in their childrens education through a variety of ways: Supporting your child with their homework Meeting with teachers Participating on school committ ees Attending school events Teachers and principals in rural Alberta have an open door policy . This means that you are welcome to meet them to discuss a variety of social, emotional or educational needs your child may have. Examples of things to discuss might include: Health issues you would like to have monitored by a teacher Difficulties your child may be experiencing with other children at school Challenges understanding certain concepts in one or more classes It is also important to note that m ass media has a large influence on fashion trends in rural Alberta. It is common for children and youth to follow current trends in clothing . Dressing similar to other children will help to make socializing at school easier. For more information on Alberta schools refer to the Education section of the Welcome to Alberta document. 13 LIFE IN YOUR RURAL ALBERTA COMMUNITY Rural Albertans take great care and pride in their communities. They actively participate in community associations, local projects and social groups. People may show up at your door with gifts, food and invitations to events. Com munity members will be excited to help you settle in and get you involved in local activities and events. If the community tries to welcome you in a way that you are not comfortable with, please try not to take offence - it has been offered as a gesture of welcome. Being P olite Canadians have a reputation for being polite . People in rural Alberta often smile, have a friendly attitude and ask questions to gain understanding. Albertans are also conscious of other peoples feelings. They tend to put thought and care into their choice of words so that the feelings of others do not get hurt. Should you unintentionally say something that offends someone in your community, the person is un likely to tell you because they dont want to hurt your feelings . Try to o bserve the way people talk and the choice of words they use. Sense of T ime There is a general expectation for people to be on time for appointments and meetings in rural Alberta. However when things happen that prevent people from being on time, rural A lbertans are usually accommodating. It is best to pay attention to punctuality until you have an understanding of how time is understood in the community. Scheduling is also a common practice in Canada. Rural Alberta ns are more relaxed than urban Albertan s when it comes to scheduling appointments, meetings and social outings . In larger cities, these events are usually booked far in advance. Clothing and Appearance Rural Albertans dress fairly casual compared to people that live in larger cities. People often run errands wearing at home or work clothes . If there is a social event or something important taking place in the community, rural Albertans will dress up. P eople in the city also tend to dress more formally for conferences and meetings. The best advice is to dress similar to others and observe the various customs around clothing. For example, many people wipe their boots or shoes and remove their footwear when entering a home. People will also remove their hats when sitting down for a meal. 14 If you are accustomed to wearing traditional ethnic clothing, you should be aware that you will stand out in a rural community. This may attract undue attention from others. The attention is usually not discriminating in nature. Rather, it is often rooted in cu riosity about something new in the community. Odour s People in rural Alberta tend to be more sensitive to odours than others. You may find places with no scent policies. This is largely to accommodate people with allergies. Odours which rural Alber tans react most negatively to are: Tobacco smoke Cologne/perfume Strong cooking spices Suggestions to avoid odour problems are: Wear fragrances in small amounts Have a mint or piece of gum after smoking a cigarette Keep your clothes in a location a way from the kitchen so they dont absorb the smell of spices It is also worth noting that you may experience unpleasant odours that rural communities are used to. For example, the smell of livestock and manure can be strong in some parts of rural Albert a. These odours are not harmful and people adjust to them fairly quickly. Humour What people find funny varies from culture to culture. Canadians enjoy laughing with people as opposed to laughing at people. The exception is that Canadians often laugh a t themselves and make fun of their own shortcomings. Since there is an increased sense of familiarity among people in rural Alberta, people are comfortable joking and laughing with each other about many things. These jokes are usually well intentioned. 15 Gifts are not used for bribery. In most cases, bribery is against the law. Sarcastic humour is not always received by Canadians the way it is intended by others. A s a result , misunderstandings can occur. It is best to observe and learn what people find funny before you start joking around with them. If someone tells a joke that o ffends you, know th at it wa s likely unintentional. They probably did not mean to insult you and reacting in a negative way may make the situation worse. Rather, consider having a conversation with the person at a different time to explain your perspective on what was said. Gifts Albertans usually give gifts on special occasions and holidays. It is worth noting that not everyone celebrates the same holidays. It depends on the persons cultural and/or religious beliefs. Common occasions and holidays in clude: Birthdays Graduations Weddings Valentines day Mothers day and Fathers day Bridal shower and baby shower Housewarmings Christmas Easter Thanksgiving Canada Day In rural Alberta common gifts could include: Home baked bread, cakes or muff ins Bottle of wine Gift basket with fruits and jams Soaps and lotions Flowers and plants The most common misunderstanding with gift giving in Canada is when to open the gift. If someone gives you a gift, it is expected that you open it in front of th em and thank them. Rural Albertans want to see your reaction and hope that you like the gift. If you receive a gift by mail or delivery (For example a fruit basket), it is expected that you call the sender to thank them. Not acknowledging this gesture can be interpreted as bad manners. If at any time you are unsure what to give as a gift, ask advice from someone you know in your community. When going to someones house, it is common to bring a gift such as a bottle of wine, flowers or homemade food. 16 Socializing and Making Friends Getting to know the people in your community is an important part of settling in. There are certain opportunities that will make it easier for you to get to know other community members. Some of these opportunities include: Church and other faith based group gatherings Sports and recreation events and activities Community fairs and rodeos Fundraising events Community dances Pancake breakfasts and barbeques Programs offered by the local library (For example movie nights) Local farmers markets Adult learning classes ( For example Spanish, basket weaving, wood work, cooking lessons) Volunteering ( For example s chool, library, youth centre, community centre, various town committees) You are encouraged to participate in these kinds of activities. People in your community want to get to know you and being involved in these activities will allow others to meet you. It also offers a great opportunity to try something new that you may not have done before. Any uncertainty you have about involving yourself in these new experiences is often eased by the open and welcoming nature of rural Alberta ns. It is easy to form acquaintances and friendships in rural Alberta because towns are small and people tend to know everyone. Neighbours may show up at your door with homemade bread and jam , and would like to be invited in for a visit . Rural Albertans like their sports. Organized sports are a great way to have fun with others and exercis e at the same time. Rural communities will have some if not all of the following sports available: Curling (mainly played by adult men and women) Hockey (played by adult men, women, boys and girls. Recent years has seen an increase in girls hockey league s) Baseball (played by adult men and women, boys and girls) Soccer (mainly played by boys and girls) Lacrosse (mainly played by boys and girls) Bowling (mainly played by adults, some youth) Walleyball (mainly played by adults) Volleyball (played by adult men and women, boys and girls) Squash/racket ball (mainly played by adults) Football (played by adult men and teenage boys) 17 When it come s to conversation, people will be interested in knowing where you come from, what you like to do and what you think of the community. They are not particularly interested in what school you went to, how many degrees you have or your professional accomplish ments. This may be a noticeable difference from your home country. Greetings A community member will refer to you as Dr. Family Name when they see you as a patient. This is because they respect your position as a physician in the community. They may a lso refer to your spouse or partner as \"the wife of\" or \"the husband of\" Dr. Family Name. Again, this is out of respect. When interacting outside of your practice or workplace, introduce both yourself and your spouse or partner by first name. People want to know you (and your spouse or partner) as a person when you are not at work. Shaking hands is a welcoming gesture in rural Alberta. Handshakes are common when you meet someone you dont know for the first time . Hugging and pats on the back are often u sed by people who know each other well. Common verbal greetings include: Hi, how are you? Hows it going? How was your weekend? Have you been keeping well? Hey! It is also very common to talk about the weather at the beginning of a conversation. This is because the weather can change very quickly and sometimes quite dramatically. Listen to what people say, and you can talk about the weather too! There are also greetings that are customary when sending emails to people. The first sentence is similar t o a verbal greeting. For example, it is common to begin an email in the following ways: Hello First Name, I hope everything is going well. Hi First Name, I hope you had a great weekend . Hello First Name, I hope you are enjoying the beautiful sunny weather! 18 Beginning an email this way is a form of politeness. Observe the emails you receive and how they are written (particularly the beginning and the end of the message) . Try to respond with the same amount of politeness. Eye Contact Eye contact is common in rural Alberta. To look someone in the eyes when interacting suggests interest and respect for the other person(s). Maintaining eye contact is an expectation in many social and work situations (For example a job interview, purchasing an item f rom a store, ordering food at a restaurant). It is worth noting that not making eye contact may suggest avoidance or disinterest. Pausing in Conversation In Canada and rural Alberta, it is common for people who are conversing to leave a brief pause in be tween speaking. For example, when you finish a sentence there is a small pause before the other person begins speaking. When the other person finishes their sentence, there is a small pause before you begin speaking again. This pause in conversation means I am listening to you and I am interested in what you are saying. The pause is also an opportunity to ask questions. Personal Space Rural Alberta is quite vast in size and people are accustomed to having a lot of space. Houses are located on large pi eces of land, commonly in the form of lots, acreages and farms. People who come from smaller countries with large populations tend to have a smaller sense of personal space than rural Albertans. It is important to be aware of this because coming too close to someone may cause them to feel uncomfortable. Observe the space that rural Albertans leave between one another in various situations. It is usually one arms length from person to person. 19 Accents Rural Albertans are not exposed to many accents . People in your community are likely to think that your accent is neat and fun. They may also have difficulty understanding you at times. I f rural Albertans do not understand you because of your accent, they may not tell you because they dont want to hurt your feelings . Most people will ask you to repeat yourself once or twice. If they still dont understand, they may nod their head and smile, pretending to understand you. This saves both people from embarrassment, but it does not solve the problem. Ways to tell if people understand you: Observe facial expressions when speaking to others Ask them if they underst and you. This is perfectly acceptable and most people will tell you the truth Provide an example of what you are talking about . This can be a great aid in helping others understand You may also have difficulty understanding the accents of rural Albertans. Tips to help you better understand the accent s of Albertans : Listen to audio books (available at your local library) Listen to Alberta rad io stations Watch Canadian television programs and movies Seek a tutor in the community or enrol in a class to help with language and pronunciation (if offered locally) English Language Whether you speak English as a first or second language, the re are differences around the words that are used. Canadian English words are not always the same as those used in other English speaking countries. There may also be certain words or phrases specific to rural Alberta. This may be confusing, especially dur ing your first few months. It can also be humourous. When you use a word from your home country that means something different in rural Alberta, the result is often a lot of laughter among you and your acquaintances. If you do not understand a word, ask t he person what it means or have them use the word in a sentence. Most rural Alberta communities have a Community Adult Learning C entre (CALC) which offers a wide variety of courses and learning opportu nities for adults. For more information about Community Adult Learning Centres, visit: http://communitylearning.info/ For a listing of communities that have a Community Adult Learning Centre, visit: http://www.aet.alberta.ca/apps/councils/councils.asp 20 Communication and T echnology People use different methods to communicate in different cultures. Common methods of communication in rural Alberta are : Face to face communication Telephone Voicemail Email Text messaging (Sms) Skype When possible , many rural Albertans will use face to face communication because relationships with others are important. When communicating in person is not feasible, telephone and email are popular choices. T exting is particularly common among children and youth. When using voicemail, you may notice that Albertans leave long and detailed messages. Listen to the information that people leave in a voicemail message and try to do the same when you leave a voicem ail message for someone else. Technology and electronics found in large Albertan cities are also found in rural Alberta communities. Devices commonly used in rural Alberta include: Cell phones Laptop computers Satellite television Internet (choice of dia l up, satellite and high speed connections) iPods Handheld video games Some points to be aware of regarding technology include: Most schools have regulations about cell phone and iPod use during school hours Restrictions can be placed on TV channels if you have satellite television Internet programs are available to restrict access to selected sites on your home computers In public places internet sites are unrestricted (For example the local library, internet cafes and coffee shops) If you or family members have problems settling in to your rural Alberta home, there is free support available through the following means: Your local Rural Alberta Recruitment and Retention Committee Your Rural Physician Action Plan (RPAP) consultant The Physician Family Support program through t he Alberta Medical Association 21 FAMILY Famil y Structure The concept of family in rural Alberta may be different than what you are accustomed to. Many kinds of family structures exist. Some of these include: Families with two parents and children Families with only one parent Blended families ( divorced people that remarry) Mixed culture families Families with an absentee parent (one parent works away from home for extended periods of time) Families with adopted and/or foster children Regardless of the type of family structure, it is unusual to find relatives other than parents and children living in the same household in rural Alberta. Extended family often lives in the same community in rural Alberta. Considerations for the Spouse or Partner The first few months in a new community ar e usually the hardest for any spouse or partner. One contributing factor is that the physician is focused on work and becoming familiar with their practice. As a result, the physicians life in Canada often develops at a faster rate than that of the spouse or partner. Families with same sex parents can also be found in Canada, althoug h most live in larger urban centres.

Note that you must be eligible to work in Canada to start your own business. There is a process that must be followed and approval must be granted by the provinci al government. As a spouse or partner, it is normal to experience the following: Feel alone and/or envious because your partner, as a working physician, has a professional life that you are not a part of Feel neglected because your partner may not be giving you the time and atten tion you would like (especially while adjusting to the new environment) Feel lonely because your partner spends long hours at work and has lower energy levels at home These feelings are a result of coping with a large amount of change. They are usually temporary and go away when the period of change is replaced with a feeling of comfort in the new community. As the spouse or partner, you must seek ways to enjoy yourself and keep busy. The people living in your communi ty will be happy to assist you in finding things to do and in meeting new people. Some ways to fill your time include: Find a job in your local community Take courses for personal or professional development Utilize your skills to introduce something ne w to the community (teach an art, craft, sport, skill, etc.). This could be arranged through the local Community Adult Learning C entre which pays individuals to give courses in the community Volunteering in the community is highly recommended for many rea sons: You can give as much or as little time as you like to volunteer work Its a great way to meet and get to know others in your community You will feel good about yourself because you are making a contribution to your community It gets you out of the house for a break To find out what volunteer opportunities are available, consult the community newspaper, bulletin boards, schools, the local library and your local social service agency offices. 23 You will likely be able to find some kind of work in your local community. However, it may not be a job you were trained for. This may be due to a few different factors: There may be limited job openings in your profession (For example small towns do not need many lawyers and accountants) Transportation to other towns or cities may be limited Commuting means more time away from home and family There may be language barriers (English is essential for almost all rural Alberta communities. French speaking communit ies will likely give preference to people that speak French) Things you can do in your local community to help find employment: Read community bulletin boards and newspapers Get to know people in your community by participating in events and activities Many jobs result from talking to someone you know CHILDREN AND YOUTH In Canada, and to a certain extent rural Alberta, it is common for parents to be out of the home for at least some portion of the week. As a result, it is important to consider what supports are available with respect to child care, supervision and activities , for the times that both parents are away from the house. Child Care for Infants and Toddlers You may have young children who are n ot old enough to go to school. In rural Alberta there are different child care options which may be available and which you might wish to consider. For more information on how to start your own business, visit http://www.canadabusiness.ab.ca/ 24 These include: Staying at home to care for your child Hiring a child care provider that comes to your hom e Hiring a child care provider that works out of her home Enrolling your child in a Family Day Home program . These programs offer care in a private residence where there are typically 6 or less children with one caregiver Enrolling your child in a Daycare program . Daycare programs offer up to full day care for infants, toddlers and pre -school aged children Enrolling your child in a Pre-school or Playschool program. These programs offer child care for 4 or less hours per d ay for pre -school aged children Before and After School Care for School Aged Children (6-12 years old) Many rural communities offer programs for school aged children to attend before and after school . If both parents work, there may be days whe n no-one is home to watch your child when t hey get out of school . It is against the law to leave children under 12 years of age alone (for safety and other reasons), so you may need to make arrangements for their care. One of the more common arrangements made between families in rural Alberta is for children to go home from school with their friends or neighbours. Parents will then pick them up on their way home from work. Pay is not normally expected for this arrangement if it happens occasionally . Watching the other child in return is a common w ay of saying thanks and helping out the other family. Other arrangements include : Schools that offer before and after school programs on site Daycares that offer before and after school programs A babysitter who will watch your children after school unti l you get home Organized childrens activities in the community (see suggested activities in following section) 25 Youth (children ages 12 -16) It is generally acceptable for c hildren 12 years and over to be left on their own. Y oung people (youth) usua lly want something to do before and after school, a s well as in the summer. Rural Alberta communities will often have youth centres which are open to young people between the ages of 12 and 16. These centres have a youth worker on site and are places where youth can go to interact with their peers in a supervised environment . Various activities are housed in youth centres such as video games, board games and pool tables (billiards). Often there is a skate board park close by . Youth centre hours and what is offered will be slightly different depending on the community. Activities for Children and Youth There are many activities in rural Alberta that serve as a source of fun and learning for children and youth. Not every activity of interest will be found in all communities, but here are some examples of what you may find. Details of the activities and programs offered in rural communities can be found at the local recreation department, or on the town website. Guides and Scouts Youth centre s Air cadet s Bowling Gymnastics Ice skating Dance classes Music lessons Karate and other martial arts Various programs offered through the local library (these can include board games and pizza nights, movie and popcorn nights, internet and computer access) Swimming lessons Summer day camps Art classes Hockey Baseball Soccer / football You can access information on topics such as parenting in two cultures, moving to a new country and English as a second language. Consult your local library, the Community Adult Learning Council, the Family and Community Support Services office or town office to find out what is available locally. These offices and programs will also be able to assist you in finding courses and workshops in neighbouri ng communities and in urban centres. 26 Did you know...in rural Alberta communities you can access information on topics such as parenting in two cultures, moving to a new country and English as a second language. Consult your local library, the Community Adult Learning Centre, the Family and Community Support Services office or town office to find out what is available locally. These offices and programs will also be able to assist you in finding courses and workshops in neighbouring communities as well as in urban centres. For more information o n Junior Forest Warden programs, visit: http://www.albertajfw.ca/ Two unique activities for children in rural Alberta are 4-H clubs and Junior Forest Warden programs. 4-H is only found in rural communities . It is a program for youth that provides opportunities to meet new friends, participate in fun activities, and l earn new skills and abilities. These include leadership and public speaking skills. Junior Forest Warden program s offer an opportunity for young people and their families to have fun, develop skill s, and get educated in the many diverse aspec ts of the natural environment. Parental Considerations In rural Alberta, children can easily access things like the internet, numerous television programs, video games, m ovies and cell phones. Most children in rural Alberta own a variety of electronic devices and share the use of these devices with their friends. While you may have rules regarding some of these things in your home, it is important to realize th at access may be readily available to your child outside of the home. You may wish to have a conversation with your child regarding electronic devices. For more i nformation on 4 -H clubs, visit: http://www.4h.ab.ca/regional_info.html 27 Considerations for Foreign Trained Physicians a nd Specialists 28 THINGS TO KNOW WHEN PRACTICING MEDICINE IN RURAL ALBERTA Moving to rural Alberta will likely find you prepared for some degree of change in practicing medicine. Medications may go by different names than what you are accustomed to, different equipmen t might be used in comparison to your home country, and the kinds of cases you treat may be different. For example, Emergency wards and clinics in South Africa are used to treating gunshot and stab wounds. Emergency wards and clinics in rural Alberta are u sed to treating common illnesses and wounds from accidents involving motorized vehicles and recreational vehicles (with motors), such as quads and snowmobiles. As a physician practicing medicine in rural Alberta, you will often play many roles. Patients will see you as the main point of contact for both physical and mental health. Medical specialists, therapists and mental health professionals are commonly accessed by referral from ones family doctor. As a result, you may find yourself taking on the com bined role of doctor, marriage counsellor, addictions support, mental health therapist and anything else that may be needed until your patient is referred to the appropriate professional. PHYSICIAN -PATIENT INTERACTIONS Many IMGs come from countries that adopt a patient centred approach to medicine. This is also the preferred approach to primary health care in Canada and rural Alberta. There are many definitions of \"patient centred approach\". Most of them include some or all of these characteristics in a physician: Shows concern and empathy for the patient Seeks to understand the patient as a whole person - physical needs, emotional needs, life struggles, etc. Seeks agreement with the patient on the problem and how to manage it Promotes health and prevent ion From a patient point of view, these are qualities that make a good physician in rural Alberta. A pleasant attitude and spending time with patients in order to better understand them is seen as very important. Canadians often refer to these traits as bedside manner. 29 In rural Alberta, your interactions with patients will likely extend outside of the practice due to the size of the community. The local librarian and your childs school teacher may also be your patients. As a result, physician - patient interactions in a variety of contexts in the community are common. You may even become friends or acquaintances with your patients. Due to the continuous nature of physician -patient interactions in rural communities, it is important to be conscious of yo ur communication style and how your patients perceive you. Many patients are accustomed to the Canadian way of communicating, which is polite and sometimes indirect. As a result, you may come across as more direct than rural Albertans are accustomed to in your communication style. For example, a South African physician practicing in one rural Alberta community was visited by a patient who asked to renew his prescription for medication. The patients current supply of medication would be finished in two week s. The response of the physician was \"No, come back in two weeks\". The patient proceeded to tell people in the community how rude and unfriendly the physician was. What could the physician have done differently to avoid this outcome? They could have provid ed an explanation to the patient as to why they wanted him to return in two weeks. Perhaps there were potential risks or side effects associated with the medication and the physician preferred to have the family doctor make the final decision. Providing an explanation to the patient would have been helpful in this situation. The good news is that because physician -patient relationship is an ongoing one, both parties tend to adapt their communication style and become comfortable with one another rather quic kly. It is worth noting that patients in rural Alberta often come to an appointment with ideas of what is wrong with them. In some cases this information can help the physician with treatment. In other cases it can pose a challenge as it is sometimes di fficult to convince a patient that the problem is not what he or she self -diagnosed it to be. Either way, the patient will want to be involved in determining the health issue as well as the treatment. 30 Cultural Consider ations Some rural Alberta comm unities have a higher concentration of culturally different groups living in them. You may see these cultural differences reflected in your patients, depending where you practice. The information that follows should be considered when treating patients of the noted cultural backgrounds. This information will enable you to better relate to and communicate with your culturally different patients. Aboriginal Peoples as patients: Aboriginal culture tends to view health in a holistic way. Most agree that health is a balance of emotional, mental, physical and spiritual well being. Although Aboriginal groups will differ in their spiritual beliefs, many Aboriginal people value traditional medicines and herbs such as sweet grass. Some people look to the spirits for healing while others are more open to modern medicine. It is important for physicians to take this into consideration when treating Aboriginal patients. It can potentially impact patient compliance and possible drug interactions. When it comes to fa mily, one does not need to be related by blood. This may raise challenges when physicians need to question Aboriginal patients about their family history. Another potential challenge includes the number of people that accompany an Aboriginal patient to his or her medical appointment. Other people may also be involved in making decisions related to the patients healthcare. It is typical for Aboriginal Peoples to come in large groups to medical appointments or to visit someone in a hospital. Silence is val ued in Aboriginal culture. It is a time for the listener to process and make sense of the information being shared. Many cultures are not comfortable with a long pause in between dialogue. This may result in speaking to fill the gaps. If filling the gaps o ccurs in a physician -patient situation, the Aboriginal patient may feel they did not have time to sufficiently understand what is being explained. They may also feel frustrated for not being given an opportunity to speak. Conversely, the physician may feel that the longer periods of silence indicate a lack of interest or respect for what he or she has to say. Within Aboriginal communities increased incidences of poverty, alcoholism and addictions a s well as increased incidences of domestic and family viol ence can be found . 31 Physicians may notice a higher incidence of mental illness, dual diagnoses and high risk behaviours in Aboriginal patients compared to the national average. Many of the se current day challenges, high risk behaviours and illnesses can b e linked to the lingering impact of the residential school system on Aboriginal people . The residential school system purposely separated children from parents with the intent to eliminate connections to their traditional culture and replace it with Europe an-Christian values and beliefs. The first residential schools were established in the 1840s with the last school closing in 1996. While attending these schools, many Aboriginal people suffered abusive treatment from school officials . Aboriginal People m ay be more sensitive to touch for reasons related to past experiences in residential schools or current day behaviours found on reserves. Physical and sexual abuses were common occurrences that have left many significant scars and may have been passed down through generations. Informing a patient before touching them is a courtesy that is appreciated by most. It will likely decrease the element of surprise or a negative reaction. It is recommended that Aboriginal People be approached with respect and human ity. It is advised not to make assumptions or show differential treatment based on stereotypes that may exist. Franco -Albertans as patients: The identity and culture of Franco -Albertans is built upon their language. There is a relatively high expe ctation for physicians practicing medicine in French speaking communities to speak the French language. Some patients may not speak English at all, thus making treatment difficult. Sometimes there are challenges around p ain management when treating Fran cophone Albertans . Situations may arise where t here is a disconnect between the physical condition of a patient and the amount of pain they are expressing. This tends to happen when the level of emotion expressed by the patient is very di fferent from that expressed by the physician. For example, a patient might have a minor sprain but the physician thinks they behave like something has been broken. For a deeper understanding of Aboriginal population health you can visit http://www.visions.ab.ca 32 Hutterites as patients: Hutterites often use medicinal herbs and other home remedies to treat minor ailments . It is important for physicians to take this into consideration when treating Hutterite patients as it can potentially impact patient compliance and possible drug interactions. Hutterites tend to faithfully trust whatever a physician says. There is not the same tendency to question doctors or self -diagnose their symptoms. This is in part due to the self -contained colonies in which they live and the lack of influence received from outside sources. Similar to Aboriginal Peoples, Hutterites tend to visit ph ysicians in large numbers. It is typical to have many family members accompany a Hutterite to his or her medical appointment or to visit someone in a hospital. Primary Care Networks A Primary Care Network (PCN) is a team effort and coordinated approach to providing seamless health care services to Albertans. In this type of arrangement, a group of family doctors and other health care professionals work with Alberta H ealth Service s to coordinate the delivery of primary health services for their patients. There are currently 35 PCNs in Alberta with eight more in the planning phases. Approximately two -thirds of family physicians belong to a primary care network. THE ROLE OF NURSES , PHARMACISTS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS It is important to und erstand the role of Nurses, Pharmacists and other health care professionals that may be assisting you. Although there are provincial standards and requirements that health care workers must meet in order to practice their profession, roles may vary across all clinics and hospitals. This may be due to the size of facility and/or resources available. Regardless of specific roles, each health care profession is viewed as bringing a needed expertise and value to the Canadian health care system. For more information on A lbertas primary care networks, visit http://www.albertapci.ca/Pages/default.aspx 33 Nurses Nursing is an essential part of the Canadian health care system. It includes the promotion of health, prevention of illness, and care of the physically and mentally ill as well as people with disabilities (International Council of Nurses, 1999). There are fou r types of nurses in Alberta that are regulated under the Health Professions Act: Registered Nurses (RN) Licensed Practical Nurses (LPN) Registered Psychiatric Nurses (RPN) Nurse Practitioners All nurses may work independently or as part of a health car e team. Registered Nurses (RNs) Registered Nurses (RNs) are governed by The College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta (CARNA). RNs are responsible for developing the overall nursing plan of patient care in the facility where they practice. The scope of practice for RNs is wider and deeper than the scope of practice for Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs). RNs have more responsibility than LPNs because the education and training requirements are greater. In most rural Alberta health care facilities, RNs will supervise LPNs. Some of the duties performed by RNs include: Record patient medical histories Examine patients and provide treatment Assist in the administration of diagnostic tests Analyze certain test results Operate medical equipm ent Administer medications Participate in patient follow -up care Educate patients about various medical conditions Note: Registered Nurses cannot prescribe medication. For more information on the nursing profession in Alberta, visit http://www.nurses.ab.ca/Carna/index.aspx and http://www.crpna.ab.ca/ 34 Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) are regulated by The College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Alberta (CLPNA). LPNs are heavily involved in patient care and monitoring. They provide a variety of health care services across various health care settings. LPNs are often the main point of contact for patients . They are also responsible for keeping superiors informed on patient conditions. Some of the duties performed by LPNs include: Record vital signs of patients Prepare patients for diagnostic testing Take patient samples, send them to appropriate labs and g et reports Clean wounds, apply bandages and assist physicians with sutures Administer patient injections Administer therapeutic massages Prepare patients for surgery Monitor continuous patient needs (food, water, oxygen, etc.) In most cases, Licensed Prac tical Nurses report to Registered Nurses. Registered Psychiatric Nurses (RPNs) Registered Psychiatric Nurses (RPNs) are governed by The College of Registered Psychiatric Nurses of Alberta (CRPNA). RPNs specialize in mental health. They often work collabo ratively with other mental health care professionals such as psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers to provide maximum benefit to their patients. Some of the duties performed by RPNs include: Physical and mental health assessments Help clients to become independent Develop, implement and document physical and mental health nursing care plans Evaluate and update nursing care plans Administer and assess the effects of prescribed medications and treatments Observe and report behavioural changes 35 Nurse Practitioners (NPs) Nurse Practitioners (NPs) are registered nurses that have completed advanced level education and training in the diagnosis and management of physical and mental health conditions. In Alberta they must be registered as NPs wit h The College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta (CARNA) in order to practice their advanced knowledge and skills. NPs often work independently and manage the health needs of individuals, families, and communities, most commonly within a prima ry care setting. They practice in a variety of community health care settings including community health centres, nursing outposts, specialty clinics, emergency departments and long -term care facilities. Some of the duties performed by NPs include: Condu ct physical exams Diagnose, treat, evaluate and manage acute and chronic health conditions (For example diabetes, high blood pressure) Order and interpret diagnostic tests (For example lab tests, x -rays) Prescribe medications Prescribe rehabilitation treat ments Provide guidance and education to patients on good health practices Provide prenatal care and family planning services Assist in minor surgeries and medical procedures Pharmacists Pharmacists in Alberta must have 5 years of universi ty education in a Pharmacy program and be registered with the Alberta College of Pharmacists (ACP). Pharmacists provide services and programs that are designed to promote health and treat disease and other disorders through drug therapy and the promotion of wellness. In Alberta, pharmacists who have appropriate certification can work collaboratively with other health care professionals and prescribe drugs or blood products, and administer drugs by injection. Pharmacists may work alone or with other pharmacists, physician s, nurses, pharmacy technicians or pharmacy assistants. Some of the duties performed by Pharmacists include: Monitor and manage drug therapy independently, as well as in collaboration with other health care professionals Counsel patients regarding the saf e and appropriate use of drugs and the importance of complying with instructions Administer drug injections Compound, prepare and dispense drugs 36 Provide non -prescription drugs, drugs for injection and health care aides and devices Conduct and administer dr ug and other health related programs such as structured medication reviews Provide extensions to current drug therapies Adapt prescriptions to meet patient needs Other Health Care Professionals Physicians and nurses often work in co -operation with other health care professionals. Examples of other health care professionals include: Psychiatrists Psychologists Occupational Therapists Recreational Therapists Social Workers WORKPLACE INTERACTIONS Interactions with Colleagues Positive inte ractions with the people you work with are known to enhance satisfaction in the workplace. There is often an additional level of closeness and informality among colleagues in rural Alberta because people know each other both in the practice as health profe ssionals and in the larger community as community members. Ways to reach out and get to know your colleagues: Participate in workplace activities such as fundraisers and birthdays Go out for lunch with people you work with Go for coffee breaks with col leagues Physicians practicing medicine in Alberta must comply with the Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice set forth by the College of P hysicians and Surgeons of Alberta (CPSA). For more information, visit http://www.cpsa.ab.ca/About Us/Code_of_Conduct.aspx For more information on the pharmacy profession in Alberta, visit https://pharmacists.ab.ca/nRegistrationLicensure/Pharmacists.aspx For a complete list of Albertas health care professionals and services, visit the Alberta Health Services website: http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/services.asp?pid=services 37 You may find yourself working with a colleague where you both speak a language other than English or French. It is considered rude and inconsiderate to speak languages other than English (or French in a Francophone community) in the workplace. It is important to be conscious of this because rural Albertans are too polite to bring it to your attention. It will, however, cause dissention with your co -workers. Interactions among Physicians and other Health Care Professionals Part of your role as a physician involves the development and mentoring of other staff. It is common for physicians to listen to the opinions and perspectives of other health care professionals who together, with yourself, are involved in the care of patients. Interactions bet ween physicians and those that they work with are usually easygoing, informal and collaborative in nature. This may be different from other countries where physicians instruct health care workers on what to do, and where health care workers listen and carr y out such instructions. Interactions among Physicians, Medical Staff and Facility Administrators In Alberta, each hospital has a Medical Director, male or female, who is the senior m edical administrative leader. The Medical Director oversees all ph ysicians in that hospital or several hospitals and deals with issues concerning patient care and how physicians function in the hospital. This includes a physicians interactions with other physicians, patients and all health care professionals. The role of Medical Director may be held by any specialist, including a general practitioner/family physician who is also considered a specialist in family medicine. Hospitals in Alberta are run by Facility Administrators who oversee all processes and operation s within the hospital or facility. The Facility Administrator (regardless of gender) is the senior administrative leader of the facility who works with the Medical Director. If a Physician wants to recommend or implement changes in a hospital/facility, t hey must work with the Facility Administrator and Medical Director. It is important to note that management roles are commonly held by women. These include positions like Directors, Facility Managers and Vice Presidents. Men and women are treated equally and respectfully across all professions in Canada. 38 CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AMONG PHYSICIANS This section takes a closer look at cultural differences among the top ten countries for physicians and specialists coming to rural Alberta (as identified by the Col lege of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta). Australia Egypt India Ireland Libya The data herein is derived from the work of Geert Hofstede, a Dutch organizational sociologist known for his cross-cultural research. Scores of source countri es are compared to scores for Canada on the cultural dimensions of Hierarchy and Individualism . One can also see how each source country compares to another. The following sections examine the ways that Hierarchy and Individualism may affect your inter actions with others in the workplace. HIERARCHY Hierarchy (also called Power Distance) refers to the degree to which some people are more or l ess powerful than others in an organization or society. In cultures with a high hierarchy score, people are tre ated differently depending on their status or rank in society. In cultures with a low hierarchy score (Canada), people are generally treated equally regardless of their position in society. See Figure 1 for Hierarchy scores from IMG Source countries and C anada. Information and scores pertaining to these dimensions can be found on the website ITIM International http://www.geerthofstede.com/geert_hofstede_resources.shtml Nigeria Pakistan South Africa United Kingdom United States 39 Figure 1 Hierarchy scores from IMG Source countries and Canada * Arab countries include Egypt , Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya , Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Egypt and Libya are two of the top ten source countries for IMGs to rural Alberta. * West African countries include Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Nigeria is one of the top ten source countries for IMGs to rural Alberta. Hierarchy: Source country comparison to Canada 0102030405060708090100 Ireland United KingdomAustralia United StatesSouth AfricaPakistan *NigeriaIndia *Egypt and LibyaIMG Source countries Canada 40 What does this mean to you? The higher the score, the more hierarchical the country. Canada is a societ y where people are generally treated with equality and respect. The elements that factor into someones relative importance are different in Canada than they are in hierarchical countries. For the purpose of the information that follows, South Africa, Pa kistan, Nigeria, India, Egypt and Libya are considered hierarchical countries. Canada, USA, Australia, UK and Ireland are considered non -hierarchical countries. HIERARCHY IN THE WORKPLACE Hierarchy may impact your interactions with others in one or more of the following ways: Formality People with a high sense of hierarchy often refer to themselves and others in a formal manner. This may be done by using the persons first and last name or using titles such as Sir, Madam or Doctor. In Canada and less hierarchical countries, people tend to be more informal in their interactions at work. They often address people by their first name even if they have a title such as Doctor or Professor. In Alberta, titles are not necessarily an indicator of who is important and who is not. When hierarchical people use formal language and titles, it can give the impression that they think they are better or more important than the other person Education The value placed on high education tends to be greater in hierarchical cultures than it is in Canada. Higher education is not as accessible or affordable in hierarchical countries as it is in non -hierarchical countries. A university degree obtained in Canada through an accredited program is largely respected regardless of the institution it was obtained from. This is often different from hierarchical countries where there is a best university that is recognized by most of society. In hierarchical countries, hiring decisions can be made based on what school a physician trained in. This is usually not an influential factor in Canada because all schools meet a certain standard or requirement of education and training. In Alberta, experience, attitude and communication skills are often influential factors in h iring decisions 41 Respect When interacting with people in the Canadian workplace, respect is supposed to be shown to people in all positions, at all levels. In Canada, a janitor, receptionist, nurse, technician and physician are typically treated with the same amount of respect. In hierarchical cultures, it is common to treat people differently depending on their position. The way that respect is shown also differs in hierarchical cultures. For example, respect may be shown by standing when someo ne of importance walks into a room. In Canada, respect tends to be conveyed by the value placed on someones input or opinion. Decision Making In hierarchical cultures, decisions at work are usually made by high ranking positions. In Canada, the same decisions may be made at a lower level. Each health care professional has a level of authority when making certain decisions. For example, if a physician orders a prescribed dose of morphine to be administered to a patient every 4 -6 hours, it is up t o the nurse to decide when within that 4 -6 hours the drug should be administered. If you work with people who are more hierarchical than you, you may want to show more respect and admiration than you are accustomed to in your initial interactions If you work with people who are less hierarchical than you, respect is largely shown by asking for ones input, opinion or contribution to something Generally speaking, the more weight the opinion hol ds, the more respected the person is Respect is conveyed both through the act of asking for ones opinion as well as being asked Hierarchical people may consider the independent decision making of Albertans/Canadians as a lack of respect for authority an d protocol Albertans/Canadians may consider the unwillingness of hierarchical people to make an independent decision as weak and lacking initiative 42 In hierarchical cultures, nurses and other health care professionals often communicate regular updates to physicians to keep them informed. Physicians are not norma lly questioned, and their decisions are respected as final. In Canada, healthcare professionals may question certain decisions to better their understanding. Initiative One of the most noticeable differences between hierarchical countries and Canada is around initiative. In Alberta, initiative is an expectation in the workplace and can be shown in the following ways: Introducing a new idea Suggesting a different approach Contributing more thought, information and/or effort than was asked Taking charge of a difficult situation Each of these behaviours is often praised and rewarded. In hierarchical countries, these behaviours are often discouraged and frowned upon. The role of the superior is to give directives and the role of the person unde r them is to carry them out. Guidance and Direction Consider a situation whereby a non -hierarchical physician wants the opinion of a Canadian resident and asks him or her to retrieve a patients chart. Does the resident read the patients char t? The expectation of most Albertan physicians is that the resident will read the chart because it is implied that reading the chart is a necessary step in order to give an informed opinion. If you supervise people that are more hierarchical than you, encourage them to make decisions within their realm of authority If you supervise people that are less hierarchical than you, do not expect the same level of information updates or requests for permission that you may be accustomed to. If you supervise people that are more hierarchical than you, encourage them to take initiative If you supervise people that are less hierarchical than you, explain to them how their involvement in certain projects will benefit their career. This will help keep them focused on the job and prevent them from wanting to go in a different direction 43 Residents from a hierarchical culture may pull the patients char t as requested, but not review it because they were not specifically instructed to review it. People in Alberta give less guidance and direction to others and rely heavily on instruction that is implied or the expectation of the person to figure things out on their own. In these situations hierarchical people tend to ask a lot of questions because they dont feel they have been provided with sufficient instruction. This often gets interpreted by people in Alberta as an inability to think for oneself. Conv ersely, hierarchical people give a lot of guidance and instruction to others which can offend people in Alberta who know their job, but may ask questions to clarify or better their understanding. INDIVIDUALISM Individualism refers to the exten t to which members of a society identify with a group or groups, compared to an individual entity. The opposite of Individualism is Collectivism. Collective cultures identify strongly with a specific group which may be may be an extended family, an organiz ation or association, a religious group or a nation of people. People pledge their loyalty to the group in exchange for long lasting protection and support. In contrast, individualistic cultures are known to promote independence and self-reliance. They mea sure success by personal achievement and value personal privacy (Hofstede, 2009). See Figure 2 for Individualism scores from IMG Source countries and Canada. If you work with people that are more hierarchical than you and notice they are confused or asking a lot of questions, provide more information and guidance than you are accustomed to If you work with people that are less hier archical than you, they will likely take the initiative to figure things out on their own. Do not interpret this lack of questions or need for guidance as disrespecting your authority 44 Figure 2 Individualism scores from IMG Source countries and Canada * Arab countries incl ude Egypt , Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya , Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Egypt and Libya are two of the top ten source countries for IMGs to rural Alberta. * West African countries include Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Nigeria is one of the top ten source countries for IMGs to rural Alberta.

The higher the score, the more individualistic the country. Canada is an individualistic country where most people are motivated by self interest and define themselves through i ndividual characteristics as opposed to group characteristics. For the purpose of the information to follow, Canada, USA, Australia and UK are considered individualistic countries. Pakistan, Nigeria, Egypt, Libya and India are considered collective countr ies. South Africa and Ireland are moderately individualistic countries where people may behave in a collective or individualistic way depending on the situation. INDIVIDUALISM IN THE WORKPLACE Individualism may impact your interactions with others in on e or more of the following ways: Teamwork The concept of a team is very different for individualistic and collective cultures. For individualistic cultures like Alberta/Canada , a team is a group of individuals that each look after their own area of res ponsibility. Team members respect one another by staying out of each others way and trusting each member to do his or her job. Together, everyone achieves the teams objectives by doing their individual part. It is common for individualistic people to use the word \"I\" and talk about themselves in terms of individual accomplishments as opposed to team accomplishments. Collective teams are usually collaborative in nature. People still have expertise in certain areas, but most tasks and responsibilities are owned by the team rather than the individual. In collective cultures, team members are very involved with each other and share a lot of information. They often seek the consensus of the team before making a decision. Collective people often use the word \"W e\" and speak in terms of group accomplishments as opposed to individual accomplishments. 46 If you are coming to Alberta from a collective culture, you may experience frustration from your colleagues in the following ways: Not offering their help and a ssistance Not sharing information that you feel concerns you as part of the team Not having sufficient group meetings Making decisions that you feel are not sufficiently informed Decision Making In Alberta, decisions tend to be made by pe ople based on self -interest. In collective cultures, decisions tend to be made through group consensus. If you work with people who are more collective than you, think about the influence of your actions on their areas of responsibilities When working with people in Alberta, the expectation is to voice your concern if a decision negatively impacts you. If you work with people who are more individualistic than you, try to focus on your own responsibilities and let them look after theirs Before sharing information with others, ask yourself if they really need to know what you are going to tell the m When working with people in Alberta, it is important to credit all members invo lved in team successes and achievements. Be wary of taking credit for something that was achieved by the whole team 47 REFERENCE MATERIALS TO HELP YOU EXPLORE RURAL ALBERTA Best of the West: your guide to great new books from the prairies 2009 - 2010 Includes lis t at back of guide of bookstores across Alberta http://www.bookpublishers.ab.ca/BestoftheWest09.pdf Name and Location of Museums across Alberta Listing of Alberta communities and museum s and historic sites found in each one http://www.discoveralberta.com/SightsAttractions/Museums/ Alberta Museums and Historic Sites List of select museums and historic sites with b rief description and location http://culture.alberta.ca/museums/historicsiteslisting/default.aspx Alberta Art Galleries Listing of Alberta communities and the art galleri es found in each one http://www.alberta.servpro.ca/listcompht/20005/Art -Galleries.html Alberta Galleries Listing of all galleries and their location in Alberta http://www.discoveralberta.com/Galleries/ Alberta Parks Listing of provincial campgrounds http://tpr.alberta.ca/parks/default.aspx Alberta Sports and Recreation Information on recreation and sports programs, provincial associations, recreation corridors and trails http://tpr.alberta.ca/recreation/default.aspx Alberta Magazines Listing of a ll magazines about and published in Alberta http://www.albertamagazines.com/member_magazines/ Alberta Ski Hills and Resorts Listing of downhill ski hills and resorts in Alberta http://www.discoveralberta.com/ToursActivitiesAdventures/SkiHillsRes orts/ 48 Cross Country Alberta Provincial cross country ski association http://www.xcountryab.net/main.php Alberta Cross Country Ski Club Listing of all Alberta cross country ski clubs http://www.zone4.ca/info.asp?cmd=pc&id=9 49 BIBLIOGRAPHY Books Hofste de, G.
