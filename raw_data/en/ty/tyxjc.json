This [infograph (external site)](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccination-when-to-get-your-covid-19-vaccination) explains when your child can get a COVID-19 vaccination. If your child has recently tested positive to COVID-19, it is recommended they wait 3 months after their infection, before receiving their next COVID-19 vaccination. Waiting 3 months is likely to lead to a better immune response and result in longer protection from reinfection with the virus. How many doses does my child need? This [infograph (external site)](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/atagi-recommended-covid-19-doses-and-vaccines) explains how many doses of a COVID-19 vaccination your child may need. The below information is for children and adolescents aged 6 months - 17 years. In Australia, children aged 5 years and older are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. Most children are recommended to receive two doses for their primary course of COVID-19 vaccination. Some young children aged 6 months - 4 years may also be eligible for vaccination if they have severe immunocompromise, disability, complex and/or multiple health conditions which increase their risk of severe COVID-19. Speak to your child's usual medical provider to find out if they are eligible. More information is available on the [ATAGI website (external site)](https://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-recommendations-on-covid-19-vaccine-use-in-children-aged-6-months-to). Depending on their personal circumstances and medical history, additional doses of a COVID-19 vaccination may be recommended for optimal protection against the virus. It's important to speak to your usual medical provider about the number of COVID-19 vaccines that are recommended for your child.
