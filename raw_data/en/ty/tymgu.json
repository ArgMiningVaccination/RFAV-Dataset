Energy healing is part of complementary medicine therapy that helps in restoring the energy flow in our body system and promotes good health. Energy healing is also known as 'Energy Medicine' in western countries. The term energy healing is mostly used for healing psychosomatic ailments of a person but it also applies to animals and places as well. We can heal animals, humans, and places with the different techniques of energy healing. What exactly is life force energy? Before we go ahead, let's try to understand the concept of energy. As per the latest study in quantum physics, everything in this universe is made up of energy that is always vibrating at some frequency. Everything in the universe including the galaxies, solar systems, planets, sun, stars, buildings, trees, chairs, animals, insects, and human beings are nothing but energy. Matter (i..e solid item which we can see from our eyes) is made up of atoms. Atom is somehow made up of energy. Hence, everything is energy. Every place has some kind of energy that has a direct or indirect impact on us. When we go to the temple, we feel very calm and have a very blissful feeling. When we go to a discotheque or bar, we get the feeling to dance and drink. If you visit any hospital, you will find it is very difficult to stay there for a long time. If you go to any hilly area with a lot of green covers, you feel relaxed. The difference in all places is of a different kind of energy. It's not the environment but the energy of the place that changes your mood and feelings. As we are part of the universe, we are also made up of energy. We are spiritual beings having a human experience. Our life (including plants & animals) is driven by energy and this energy is known as life force energy. Lifeforce energy (also known as vital force) is known as 'prana' in India, 'chi' in China, and 'Qi' in Japan. Along with the physical body, we do have other bodies that we can't see with our eyes as eyes can only see the matter. Such bodies are called subtle bodies. However, there are some saints or spiritual practitioners who have the psychic abilities to see these subtle bodies. These people are known as a clairvoyant. By manipulating the life force energy using energy healing techniques, we can heal animals and humans. Recommended/Featured Best Energy Healers Listed With us All healers listed with us have more than five years of experience in healing different kinds of ailments or cases. Here are a few best healers we highly recommend for any type of problem that can be healed with energy healing Understanding the Energy Body Out of these subtle bodies, we have an energy body that plays a vital role in balancing our energies. The energy body is considered a bridge to connect the physical body and other subtle bodies. We can make our physical body healthy by keeping our energy body healthy. Physical exercises, stretching exercises, yoga, parayanaam, massage, meditation, breathing exercises, etc are some of the tools to make the energy body healthy. Negative thoughts and emotions affect the energy flow in our energy body and it takes the form of physical illness if the energy flow is not restored to normalcy. Therefore, it is recommended to keep our thoughts and emotions positive. We feel happy and healthy when there is a smooth flow of energy in our energy body. We feel dis-ease, discomfort, mood changes, etc. whenever there are some blockages in energy flow. Western medical science mostly focuses only on physical symptoms of the illness and helps with medicine or surgery on the physical level but energy healing goes deeper and heals you at energy and emotional levels. It is a holistic approach that works on the body, mind, and spirit altogether and heals at the root level so that there are fewer chances of recurrence. Why do diseases like hemorrhoids, piles, Kidney stones, or stokes come back? Many of us already know that many diseases like hemorrhoids (piles), stones, stokes, etc have a tendency to recurrence even after many successful surgeries or treatments. This happens because the root cause lies not on the physical level but at the emotional & mental level. These stones, piles, stokes, etc are just the manifestation of the improper flow of lifeforce energy that is caused by negative emotional & mental patterns. Once the energy flow is affected, the health problems at the physical level start appearing gradually. Ailments that are caused by such negative emotional and mental patterns are known as psychosomatic ailments. If we can identify such negative patterns at the energy level in the early stage and heal it, we can stop the illness from manifesting in the physical body. Also, it is important to identify the emotional or mental pattern that is affecting our life. This can be even childhood trauma that we even don't remember. To identify and heal such traumas or events, we need to take the help of different therapies like regression therapy, hypnotherapy, NLP (Neuro-Linguistic programming), etc. The Anatomy of Energy Body Our energy body has also anatomy like a physical body that includes different energy centers (popularly known as 'chakras' in Sanskrit) and meridians (also known as 'nadis' in Sanskrit) interconnected with each other. Each meridian is connected with a body organ and also plays an important role in the functioning of other organs. Any disruption in a meridian might affect the functioning of some body parts. It has been commonly noticed in many people that a person feels symptoms like fever, high/low blood pressure, mood changes, pain, palpitations, faintness, etc and western science finds it difficult to diagnose the root cause. They have medicines on the basis of symptoms which most of the time work as a placebo effect but it doesn't heal the problem completely. This actually happens when energy flow has been disrupted in the energy body but the problem has not completely surfaced in the physical body yet. Chinese medicine practitioner, Nadi expert, or energy healer can help you in diagnosing such a problem at an energy level and recommend you the best healing protocol accordingly. How Does Energy Healing Work? Many energy healers scan the energy condition of the person using their hands. They mostly scan chakras and aura to check the overall energy condition of the person. Once they find the affected area in the energy body, they can manipulate the energy of that area using energy healing techniques. This is how the problem is healed using energy healing. Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) practitioners are very popular to check the energy condition of a person. They have even instruments that can find the energy conditions of a person. Some therapies like Acupuncture have standard protocols to treat a particular illness and hence, they don't check the energy condition of a person and give treatment directly on the energy points. Some energy therapists can also heal chakras and aura without checking the energy condition of the person. Some healers can also scan the energy condition of a house and heal them as well. The diagnosis and energy healing techniques vary as per different energy healing modalities. Recommended/Featured Best Trainers for Energy Healing Courses You can learn basic energy healing techniques within 02 days and there is no specific eligibility criteria to learn energy healing. Here are a few best trainers we highly recommend for doing energy healing courses. They also provide online classes for students all over the world. What are the different energy healing modalities? Energy centers (chakras) are the gateways to receive cosmic or divine energy. Most of energy healing techniques work on our energy centers (also known as 'Chakras' in Sanskrit) and the energy field ( also popularly known as 'Aura' in metaphysical terms). The therapies that work directly on chakras are Reiki & Pranic healing. These energy healing modalities are known as chakra balancing, chakra healing, Aura healing etc. There are also other healing modalities that work on energy bodies like Theta healing, Lama Fera, etc Many healers invoke the blessings of the higher beings or their Gurus before starting any healing. Hence, few energy healing therapies like Pranic healing or Reiki are known as divine healing or spiritual healing. As the emphasis is given on current emotional and mental patterns, some people call it psychic healing. So, different practitioners use different terms as per the teachings they received from their teachers or the tradition or healing modality they follow. We can even call it an 'energy therapy. Which therapies are the most popular energy healing modalities? Reiki and Pranic healing are two energy therapies that have become quite popular in the last decade because of their simplicity to learn and practice. These two energy therapies have opened the doorway to spirituality for many practitioners because of their receptivity to energy. Acupuncture is another technique that works on acupuncture points (energy points on meridians) and is very popular in China. It has been recommended by some medical institutes as well. Many hospitals have started hiring acupuncturists in the last decade. Reiki, Pranic healing, and Acupuncture are the therapies that directly deal with energy for treating any illness. There are other complementary medicine therapies that indirectly deal with energy like Emotional Freedom Techniques(EFT), NLP, Access Bar, hypnotherapy, theta healing, etc. All these therapies help in rewiring your subconscious mind by removing negative thought patterns that further promote healing. Some of the physical exercises also work extensively on the energy body and help in calming the body. Such exercises include Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Hatha Yoga, etc. Meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness, etc are other great tools to nourish the energy body. Whatever energy therapy you choose, it works on energy level and it depends on which suits your body the most. Conclusion Energy healing has been proven very beneficial to heal many psychosomatic ailments and also as preventive measure to keep energy body healthy. Many people have gone through the energy healing courses and do healing practices daily just to keep the energy system healthy. Energy healing is also practiced as preventive therapy by many practitioners on themselves and on their family members. Although, energy healing is very beneficial but we should not use it as a conventional or alternative treatment. This therapy should be considered as a complementary medicine therapy or as a part of integrative medicine. This means that it can be taken along with the conventional treatment but can't be replaced with it. A patient should not be solely dependent on the energy healing for treatment and should always consult medical doctor for the right diagnosis of the physical illness or in case of medical emergency.
