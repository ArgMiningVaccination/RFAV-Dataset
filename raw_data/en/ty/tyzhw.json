It was during a seminar at the beginning of chiropractic college and as I heard it I instantly knew I was in the right place. THIS was the approach to health that I has ben searching for. THIS made sense to me, THIS inspired me and THIS got me fired up about being in healthcare. Salutogenesis is an approach to health that focuses on what makes a person healthy, rather than what makes them ill. It emphasizes the behaviors, lifestyle factors and choices that allow for greater levels of vitality, adaptability and resilience in order to preserve and optimize health. As Shanta R Dube puts it, \"This model suggests that we as humans have the innate capacity to move toward health in the face of hardship\". Most of us probably grew up in an allopathic model of healthcare. The allopathic model focuses on illness and what's wrong with the person. The goal is to find a treatment or procedure that will address the disease or symptom and defeat it. This strategy works well with infectious diseases caused by a known pathogen, or when you encounter physical trauma such as a motor vehicle accident. Allopathic medicine falls short, however, with chronic, metabolic and stress-affected disorders, which are currently on the rise, and it is not designed for true health optimization. One of my favorite quotes from B.J. Palmer, a founder of chiropractic, is, \"Medicine is the study of disease and what causes man to die. Chiropractic is the study of health and what causes man to live.\". You go see your medical doctor when there is something wrong with you. It is reactive care. The purpose of chiropractic is to keep enhancing your innate healing power, even when there is nothing \"wrong\". The power of chiropractic lies in its' ability to strengthen what is already working. Used in this way, chiropractic is proactive care, or preventative. Allopathic care is helpful in specific situations. It is a lifesaving and necessary component of healthcare. And, it is only a component, not the end all be all. Salutogenic care is an all-encompassing approach to living a healthier life in general. The goal of the salutogenic paradigm of healthcare is to empower the patient to take their health into their own hands and take responsibility for the factors that are in their control. The chronic, metabolic and stress-affected disorders that plague our country are multi-faceted and require conscious participation from the patient in order to change. There is no quick-fix remedy for these conditions because there are layers of reasons that these conditions exist in the first place. The fast-paced, highly technology-based world we live in certainly does not support natural health. Neither does the toxins the are hiding in our food, beauty products and cleaning supplies. And to get a little \"woo woo\" here, unprocessed trauma and stored emotions can also contribute to disease, chronic pain and other health issues. My hope is that the salutogenic paradigm continues to expand as more and more people take responsibility for their health and the health of their families. This requires getting curious about what you are experiencing, being willing to change old habits and asking yourself what you are doing, thinking or believing that might be contributing to your current situation. Health is not a destination but a life-long journey. My hope for you is that you feel empowered to listen to your body's innate wisdom and you feel supported by your health care team every step of the way. "}
